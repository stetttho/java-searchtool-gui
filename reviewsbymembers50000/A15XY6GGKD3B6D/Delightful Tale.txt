 The young magician Aubrey has learned almost all he can from his mentor Cyril, so he is sent to apprentice with the powerful shape-changer Glynrenden. He is warned to be wary of the wizard, and soon notices that the situation is far from normal at Glynrenden's home in the woods. Most strange of all is the mage's disturbing and bewitching wife, Lilith, who watches everything impassively with her luminous green eyes.   Aubrey learns lessons of love and hate, right and wrong, on top of the art of shape-changing during his time as Glynrenden's apprentice. A deftly woven tale, reminiscent of the fairy tales I loved as a child, full of nature and morals. Of course, the reader figures out the truth about Lilith long before Aubrey, but this did nothing to detract from my enjoyment of the story.   I am in love with Sharon Shinn's writing, but this book is not for you if you like a story with more action and whiz-bang.
