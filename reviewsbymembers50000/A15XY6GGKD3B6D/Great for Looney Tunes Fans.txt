 I was a big fan of the Looney Tunes cartoons as a kid, so I love this game. There are all the old favorite characters; Witch Hazel with her absurdly small feet who leaves a cloud of hair pins after her, Yosemite Sam in his various historical personae; the medieval king, the pirate, etc., Marvin the Martian and his dumpy-bodied flamingo-like troops. Lots of fun challenges and logic puzzles, but definitely not for younger kids - I still can't win the scooter race with Marvin the Martian.
