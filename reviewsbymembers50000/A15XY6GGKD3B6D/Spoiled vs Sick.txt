 I can understand why many people don't like this movie. It is a story where there are no really likeable characters. You have Tom Ripley (played wonderfully by Matt Damon), the poor kid who bluffs his way into a trip to Italy on behalf of rich Mr. Greenleaf to corral his errant son Dickie. Dickie Greenleaf (Jude Law looking more healthy and tanned than I've ever seen him) is a spoiled, indulgent brat who wants to drift through the rest of his life spending daddy's money. (Daddy could just cut him off - but then there wouldn't be a story would there?) And then there is the long-suffering Marge (Gwyneth Paltrow looking ever so chic in 50s period costumes), who for such an intelligent, independent writer living on her own in Italy, could hardly be more stupid than to keep deluding herself about Dickie's faithfulness.   Tom Ripley is envious of the life Dickie leads, and who can blame him? Push comes to shove and Dickie ends up dead in the ocean (and I don't think anyone misses him but Marge). You cannot help but feel a nauseating pity for Tom Ripley and his sick scheme to take over Dickie's life. The homosexual subtext makes it even more uncomfortable and tense. Have never seen a finer performance by Matt Damon (but I would go watch him read a phone book). Small but pivotal parts by Cate Blanchett, luminously beautiful in period costumes, and Philip Seymour Hoffman in his perpetual role of the fat, obnoxious, frat-boy type. (Neither one of them is likeable, either.)
