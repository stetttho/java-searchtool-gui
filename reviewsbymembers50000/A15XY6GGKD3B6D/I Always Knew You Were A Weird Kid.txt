 Is what my mother said when I tried to extol the virtues of STIFF: THE CURIOUS LIVES OF HUMAN CADAVERS. Ms. Roach paints a cheeky and humorous, but never disrespectful, portrait of what happens to cadavers that are donated for scientific research. She describes how cadavers are dissected, used for plastic surgery practice, decayed, crashed, embalmed, crucified, etc. with enough detail to explain the processes, without being morbid or gross. This is a fascinating subject that is simply not talked about in our society, with most people using polite euphemisms for death or dead bodies. Impossible to put down.
