 Many of the Darkover books are set after people from Earth rediscover their long-lost colonists. The clash of cultures makes for good books, but I have personally always been more interested in the Ages of Chaos and the Hundred Kingdoms, when it is said use of laran science for nefarious purposes was widespread. This book, to my great delight, takes place in this time!   This book tells the story of Queen Tanquiel Hastur-Acosta, who escapes the depradations of the conquerer Damien Deslucido and his evil laranzu brother, Rumail. She escapes her besieged castle and makes her way across land to try and reach her kinsmen in Thendara. Along the way, she meets under-keeper Coryn Leynier, whose home has also fallen to the evil Deslucido, who is traveling to his new post at Neskaya tower. They form a deep and lasting mental bond when Coryn saves her life during a raging blizzard. With his help she is able to reach the home of her powerful uncle, King Rafael Hastur II. There she gives birth to her son, the next king of Acosta, and fights the political machinations of Deslucido and tries to regain control of her son's birthright.  Finally, when it is discovered that Deslucido can lie under truthspell, King Hastur acts, and the evil marauder is finally defeated. Coryn and the other tower workers in Neskaya and Tramontana are drawn into this terrible battle which rages on the physical world and in the Overworld as well.   I thought this was a very good, engrossing read. Bradley's writing always seemed to me to be sparse on descriptions, very down-and-dirty. So, this book was a pleasant change in some ways, it seemed more complete and satisfied my curiosity. However, the long drawn-out discussions of political machinations and the long battle with Deslucido were a bit too much for me. Some prudent editing would have been nice, IMHO. I kept thinking "Isn't it over YET? I want to get to the ending!"
