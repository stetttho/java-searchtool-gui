 There are many reasons to like this book, but my favorite aspect is that it shows a non-traditional family full of love and respect. Three orphaned boys find a little girl in a trash pile and band together to raise her as their sister. The romance element of the book is good, as well as the part where Mary Rose finds her biological father, but the relationships of Mary Rose and her four unconventional brothers are what make this book a must read.
