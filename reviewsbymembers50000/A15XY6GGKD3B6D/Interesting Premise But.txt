 It's just too slow and lugubrious. All the scenes are dark and depressing. I felt like asking someone to turn on the lights! Fine acting, cinematography and all that, but I'm really not a big fan of comic books, and especially not of movies made about comic books. If I had known that this movie was a comic book story I would have never rented it. If you like comic books, you'll probably love it.
