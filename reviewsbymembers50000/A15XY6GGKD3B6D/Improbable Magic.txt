 THE PROBABLE FUTURE is the story of the Sparrow women, who have inhabited Cake House in a small New England town for centuries, and who have extraordinary powers. Sound familiar? That's because this novel seems like an attempt to re-create the delight and magic of PRACTICAL MAGIC. However, in my opinion, it missed the mark. Hoffman's natural (and supernatural) descriptions are not the spice that livens the story as they have in her previous works. They seem forced and overdone, and did not endear any of the characters to me. The only Alice Hoffman book I have ever not wanted to read again.
