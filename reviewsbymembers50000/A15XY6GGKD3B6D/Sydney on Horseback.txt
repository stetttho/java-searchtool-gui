 This installment of the Alias books takes Sydney to Australia with Noah Hicks. She is posing as a rich Texan at a horse show, with Noah (unwillingly) playing her personal assistant. Sydney (again) manages to get into trouble and is dumped in the Outback. Plenty of action, but will probably not appeal to those who are not already fans of the series. Better writing than I had expected for a book of this type.
