 Orlando Bloom plays a recently widowed blacksmith in France who is sought out by his father, Liam Neeson, a noble and a knight returning to the Crusades in Jerusalem. Orlando follows him, then inherits his estate after his untimely death. Suddenly, everyone is listening to this nobody from nowhere, and Orlando ends up heroically leading the army of Jerusalem. Huh?   I guess movies like this about interesting historical periods are very hard to make. Look at Alexander and Troy. I thought I was conversant with the Crusades, having read a score of books about the period (specifically the fascinating Eleanor of Aquitaine), but found this murky movie impossible to follow.   P.S. - Note to Ridley Scott: every cut does not spew blood like a geyser.
