 Sounds promising, doesn't it? But this film is as slow as one would expect, given that the geriatric Elvis is in a walker.   Bruce Campbell, king of the B-movie, plays the ancient Elvis, who didn't really die because he switched places with his best impersonator. Now the King is stuck in a dumpy East Texas nursing home, contemplating a growth on his private parts. His only friend, Ossie Davis, believes he is JFK and that conspirators removed part of his brain and dyed him black.   The President and the King notice strange happenings and uncover the machinations of a cowboy mummy who is taking advantage of the easy pickings at the nursing home and is killing residents by sucking out their souls. Of course, the movie is goofy and campy. And SLOW. I would only recommend this to die-hard Bruce Campbell or Ossie Davis fans.
