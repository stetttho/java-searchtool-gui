 The premise of this book is interesting; for some unknown reason a few immortals are born here and there around the planet. This is not so much a novel as a disjointed collection of vignettes and short stories that cover the centuries since ancient Phoenicia to a bizarre future where everyone is immortal. If you are expecting the derring-do and character development of the television series Highlander, skip this book. It drags unmercifully in parts, and is overall unsatisfying and (dare I say it?) boring.
