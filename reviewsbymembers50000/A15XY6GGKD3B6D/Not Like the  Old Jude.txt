 I love Jude Devereaux's older books, but this is just awful. She wastes a Montgomery man in a ridiculous story involving a coven of witches, psychics, and black magic. It is a completely unbelievable romance between two people who don't even seem to like one another. Not even funny. This one went in the Goodwill bin immediately.
