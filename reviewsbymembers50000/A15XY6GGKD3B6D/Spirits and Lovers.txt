 Isabelle Allende weaves a compulsively readable tale of four (or five) generations in the lives of the South American Trueba family. (I assume the tale is set in Chile, but the country is never specifically named.) Esteban, the impoverished scion of the Trueba family, makes his fortune in mining in the late 1800s so he can marry Rosa, the beautiful daughter of the del Valle family. Rosa dies unexpectedly and Esteban ends up marrying her clairvoyant younger sister, Clara, who always keeps the house alive with her spirits and sances. The story follows the lives of their children (Blanca, Jaime and Nicolas) and their granddaughter Alba through prosperity, poverty, death, birth, revolution, war and exile.   Esteban says at one point in the story that the Marxists will never rule the country because they are cold and calculating, and do not acknowledge the magic and spirits of the Latin American culture. Allende calls forth spirits in these pages and makes the reader believe in green-haired mermaid girls, clairvoyant grandmothers and revolutionary lovers all with equal faculty.
