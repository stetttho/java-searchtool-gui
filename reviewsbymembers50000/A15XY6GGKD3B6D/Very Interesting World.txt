 Samaria, the world Sharon Shinn invents in these novels, may be perhaps the most original concept I've read in quite a while. The fast-paced prose carries you through the love story between Rachel and Gabriel, the Archangel-elect of Samaria. They must battle the evil Raphael, the corrupt current Archangel who does not want to let go of his power, to save faithful men and angels. I can't wait for future books to reveal all because the angels aren't exactly divine beings, and the way the prophets talk to their god is through a computer terminal. A compelling and satisfying love story of the sort that is all too often missing from the science fiction genre.
