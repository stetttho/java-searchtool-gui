 In the THE WHITE BULL Fred Saberhagen again shows his prowess at giving a fascinating new spin to an old story. The narrator of this tale is Daedalus, the Greek inventor famous for the creation of human wings - in the legend his son Icarus perished while misusing them.   In Saberhagen's version, Daedalus has recently had a misunderstanding with the King of Athens, so flees to the court of King Minos of Crete. He has been working for the king for a short time when a white bull, subject of an old prophecy, comes out of the sea onto the shores of Heraklios.   This is an unusual bull - he walks on two legs, can speak, and is accompanied by a metallic companion. It is quickly apparent to the reader (but incomprehensible to the narrator) that the bull and his strange companions are visitors from outer space. At the bull's request, Daedalus builds a labyrinth where the bull sets up a school - which is destroyed by the brutish Athenian prince Theseus.   The bull's school is a clever parody of the ridiculous aspects of the university system; the book itself is divided into sections named after the various stages of study at university. An entertaining read even if this subtlety is lost on you, a good yarn about alien invaders in Greek times.
