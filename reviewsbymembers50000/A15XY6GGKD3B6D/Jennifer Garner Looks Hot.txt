 And.... that's the best thing about this movie. Jennifer Garner, who I love to watch kicking butt in Alias, looks really sexy and fierce as the mega-butt-kicking Elektra. Other than that, the story is too full of flashbacks (which are not informative if you have not seen the ultra-lame DareDevil) and has plot holes you can drive a truck through.
