 When they were idealistic young doctors, Joe and Emily Darrow vowed to give back to humanity and pass these values on to their children. Joe objects strongly, however, when Emily goes on mission work to Venezuela while pregnant with their first child. His fears come true when Emily's bus is swept into the river during a rockslide and no trace of her body is ever found.  Joe throws himself into his work to combat his grief, earning both concern and censure from co-workers and hospital administrators. Strange things begin to happen to Joe, all centering around Emily's totem symbol, the dragonfly. Children in the hospital oncology ward have near-death experiences and tell Joe they saw her in the rainbow. (For a great book on this subject, read PASSAGES by Connie Willis) Soon, friends and co-workers all think Joe is going crazy for believing the supernatural messages and clues from Emily. Costner does an admirable job of portraying a man crippled by grief and losing his grip on "reality" by placing his faith in his wife's love, even from beyond the grave.  By the end of the movie, I was rooting for Joe to be right, for there to be a reason behind all the strange happenings. However, I must agree with other reviewers that the ending should come with a warning for the lactose intolerant. Still a good movie although probably too "girly" for most men's tastes.
