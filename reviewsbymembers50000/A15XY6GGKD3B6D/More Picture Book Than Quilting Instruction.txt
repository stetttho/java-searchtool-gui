 This book features color pictures of each of the 400 quilts made by The Georgia Quilt Project for the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, GA. Under each picture it is noted to which country's flag-bearer the quilt was given. The only instructions given are for the quilt that is featured on the cover of the book. I like to flip through the pages and use it as inspiration for new design ideas. It is a great tribute to the dedicated quilters who gave so selflessly of their time and creativity for the Olympics.
