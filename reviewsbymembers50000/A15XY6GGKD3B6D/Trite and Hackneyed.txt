 I was looking forward to ERAGON, after hearing good reviews about it here and there. What a disappointment. It just goes to show that you need more than the stereotypical `hero quest' parts to make a good story. This story is so obviously borrowed from the works of other writers (and movie-makers) before it; the author could not even come up with new creatures - instead falling back on dragons and elves. *Yawn* Frankly, I was not impressed with the writing, either. If I have to read a sentence three times before it makes sense, forget it. I couldn't even finish.
