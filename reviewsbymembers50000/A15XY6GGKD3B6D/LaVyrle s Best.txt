 Eric and Maggie were high school sweethearts in Fish Creek, Wisconsin. They drifted apart in college, and she ended up happily married in Seattle, he back home running his father's fishing boat. After Maggie's husband dies, she decides to move home and open a bed and breakfast  - and all hell breaks loose. Eric's already floundering marriage crumbles under the weight of their rekindled mutual attraction. A moving portrait of families in conflict, love, adultery and betrayal.  I have read many of LaVyrle Spencer's books, but this one keeps me coming back again and again, picking up another nuance each time.
