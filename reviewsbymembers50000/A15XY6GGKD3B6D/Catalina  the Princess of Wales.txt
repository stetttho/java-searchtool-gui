 Like most people, when I think of Katherine of Aragon, I think of Henry VIII's aging wife, whom he threw over for Anne Boleyn. In this book, Gregory delivers a fascinating tale from the point of view of the young Catalina, Infanta of Spain, conceived and born in a war camp by Ferdinand and Isabella, then raised in the splendor of the Alhambra. How strange the English customs would have seemed to her, how squalid their castles, how wrong her treatment by Henry when she had done her duty to God and country.  Impossible to put down, even if you know the outcome of the tale.
