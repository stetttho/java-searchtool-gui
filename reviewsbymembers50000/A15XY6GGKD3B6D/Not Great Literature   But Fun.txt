 Clive Cussler's novels are hokey and weird..... but I'm addicted. Where else can you get a shoot-em-up adventure and a way-over-the-top James Bond-esque hero combined with oceanography, history, and archeology? The plot of this one makes you wonder what Mr. Cussler was smoking, but is still delightfully entertaining. Abe Lincoln's body is resting on a Confederate ironclad in the middle of the Sahara desert and only Dirk Pitt can save the day and stop the rich industrialist polluting the oceans.
