 What I kept thinking as I was watching Blade Trinity was: "Oh, wait... they want us to take this seriously." The plot, such as it was, was completely overshadowed by loud music and neato whiz-bang special effects.   If you want to see Jessica Biel (as, no joke, Whistler's Daughter) looking fierce in tight clothes, maybe this is the movie for you. If you are a fan of the incredible Ryan Reynolds, he is his usual funny self, but has woefully too little screen time. As for the rest of the cast; Wesley Snipes rarely utters a word, Parker Posey does her usual scheming bitch, and Kris Kristofferson returns again. (Wait a minute - Didn't he die in movies number one AND two?) Not bad enough to walk out of, but not good enough to ever see again.
