 HUMANS is a solid sequel to HOMINIDS and picks up where the first book left off. I was surprised to read such a well-developed and heart-felt love story written by a man. This novel delves more deeply into the Neanderthal universe when Mary goes to the "other side" for a visit. The author, through a preachy Native American scientist, raises more fascinating points about our societal structure that I will be pondering for quite some time. Being too young to remember Vietnam, I was especially fascinated (and amused) by Mary's attempt to explain it to Ponter. Can't wait to read Hybrids, the conclusion to the trilogy.
