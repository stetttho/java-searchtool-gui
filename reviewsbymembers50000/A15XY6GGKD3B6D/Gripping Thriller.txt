 Robert J. Sawyer delivers a fast-paced medical thriller (reminiscent of Robin Cook) in FRAMESHIFT. Pierre Tardivel, a Canadian scientist working in Berkley on the Human Genome project, falls in love with Molly, a beautiful psychologist who can read thoughts. The two are caught up in an intricate web of genetics, corporate conspiracy and the hunt for a fugitive Nazi death camp soldier. Pierre has Huntington's disease and his feelings about his fate and his dignified fight against the disease make him the most three-dimensional Sawyer character I've encountered. An impossible-to-put-down page-turner. Don't miss it.
