 LADY VENGEANCE opens with the beautiful American Celia Tregaron waiting in the bedroom of the Earl of Ashmore. However, she is not there for the usual reasons.   Celia thinks Marcus, the British Earl, is responsible for the death of her brother Ethan during the war of 1812, and has a loaded gun pointed at a, well, delicate area. Celia soon discovers she was about to murder the wrong man, which is fortunate because there is an instant attraction between the Earl and his would-be assassin.   Marcus, at the promptings of his eccentric family, offers to aid Celia in her quest to find her little brother still alive somewhere in England. They are in for a rough ride through the British countryside - dodging bullets, exposing plots, and, of course, lots of juicy love-making.
