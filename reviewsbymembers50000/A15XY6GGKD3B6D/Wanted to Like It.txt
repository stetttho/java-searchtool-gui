 I usually love to spend a rainy weekend with a fat, juicy historical novel, but I just couldn't "get into" this book. My attention kept wandering and I found myself reading the same sentence over and over again. I think part of it was the profusion of names and place names to try to remember. Needless to say, I did not finish it.
