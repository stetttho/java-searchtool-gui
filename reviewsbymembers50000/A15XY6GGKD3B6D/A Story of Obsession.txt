 The title of this story refers to Sheba Hart, a 40-something schoolteacher who has an affair with a 15-year-old student. In fact, the reader never finds out satisfactorily what she was thinking that led to this unwholesome obsession with Steven Connolly, who is younger than her own children. What we do find out is exactly what the narrator of the story is thinking. This tale of scandal is told by Barbara Covett, a sixty-something spinster schoolteacher who befriends Sheba, less for her sparkling personality than for the chance to be in the epicenter of the scandal. Barbara's voice is clear and disturbing, she obviously has a history of obsessive, over-the-top relationships littering her past, such as the one she develops with Sheba. At times I was saying aloud "What a bitch!" and at others I entirely sympathized with Barbara and found her saying aloud thoughts I have had myself (scary though that sounds). One of the most fascinating and complete character portrayals I have read in a long time. You will be enthralled right through to the last chilling line.
