 Cussler again delivers a weird, over-the-top, action-adventure novel featuring the perpetually hunky Dirk Pitt. This time, a shady group of people are killing archaeologists who find out about the existence of an advanced ancient civilization. Throw in death comets, neo-Nazis, cloning, and impossible shipbuilding for good measure. A fun read if taken with a pinch of salt.
