 This novel is told from the point of view of Mary Clayborne, the teenage daughter of a small-town Arkansas doctor during the Depression. When tragedy strikes the family, Mary must choose between her dream of attending the music conservatory, marrying her father's young resident, or staying and becoming head of the household for her younger siblings. A deft portrayal of life in rural Arkansas, a fine translation of the back-country mores, and a convincing dose of teenage angst and ennui.
