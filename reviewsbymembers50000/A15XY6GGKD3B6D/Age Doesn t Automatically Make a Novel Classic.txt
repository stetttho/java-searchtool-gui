 THE DEMOLISHED MAN is the story of crazy gazillionaire industrialist Ben Reich, who is determined to murder his arch business rival, Craye D'Courtney. In this future world, people with ESP are employed in all professional levels of the job market. It is impossible to get away with murder when all the cops, doctors, lawyers, etc can read a person's intentions and stop him before he can fully think about, much less commit, such a deed. Nevertheless, Reich does commit the murder, and most of the book is taken up with his attempted flight from the clutches of Esper Police Prefect Lincoln Powell.   I know, I know, this book is supposed to be a classic, but I thought it was a real stinker. It reads like a smarmy 50s cops-and-robbers story, which is essentially what it is - only set in the future with telepaths. Don't get me started on the character development! All the female characters are either a) breast-heaving, snuggle-kittens or b) crazy death crones. Just awful.
