 Andrew Carr is part of the Mapping and Exploration team which is charting the planet of Darkover for the newly-arrived Terran Empire. Like all Earthmen, Andrew is cynical about psi powers, so he shrugs off a meeting with an old fortuneteller in the Spaceport's trade city who shows him a beautiful red-headed girl in her crystal ball.   What Andrew doesn't know is that this dim, cold world is filled with people with vast psychic powers they call "laran" or "donas", and Andrew himself has been suppressing his potential in the noisy, crowded empire. After his plane crashes in the icy mountains, Andrew receives visions of the lovely Callista, who has been kidnapped by nonhumans. The Earthman must overcome his prejudices and inner mental blocks to aid her kinsman in her rescue, then ultimately find his place between the two worlds.  Classic Bradley. I take out my well-worn paperbacks and re-read them every couple of years.
