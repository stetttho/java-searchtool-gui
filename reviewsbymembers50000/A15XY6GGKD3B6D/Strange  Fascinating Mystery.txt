 Arthur Bryant and John May are the odd and perfectly mismatched detectives of London's peculiar crimes unit. A lawyer dies of a snake bite in the Savoy lobby, an eccentric aristocrat blows up on the tube, a starved tiger eats a family in their own home. Methodical May and Unconventional Bryant must track down a mystery rooted in Victorian superstition and class distinctions that are causing bizarre deaths in the present. Impossible to put down, a thinking person's mystery, full of deeply satisfying history and folklore, not just mutilated bodies like most mysteries nowadays.
