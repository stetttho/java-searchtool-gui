 I first read this years ago, but still remember the world of "jang"(hedonistic teenagers) that is the focus of this book. The unnamed protagonist's journey to self-reliance is the ultimate rebellion against a society that encourages and rewards mindless pleasure-seeking, vanity and consumerism. The sequel, DRINKING SAPPHIRE WINE, is amusing, but not as good as DON'T BITE THE SUN. A classic in the sci-fi genre, no bookshelf should be without a copy.
