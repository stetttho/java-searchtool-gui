 If you want a movie that will make you laugh until you cry or cause your Coke to shoot out of your nose... you should go rent another movie.   There is only one joke in this banal movie, and the less-than-brilliant script uses it for all it's worth. This movie is not bad enough to make you get up and leave; but it's not memorable enough to ever watch again or quote jokes to your friends.
