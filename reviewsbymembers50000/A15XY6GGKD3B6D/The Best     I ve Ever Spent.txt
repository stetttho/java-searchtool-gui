 My difficult cats are almost impossible to stuff into a traditional pet carrier. The top-loading feature on this pet carrier is a dream come true. It is so easy to simply drop the critters in through the large top opening, and the vet can open it and give them shots without removing them from the carrier, saving everyone concerned much aggravation. I only wonder why I didn't buy this marvelous device sooner.
