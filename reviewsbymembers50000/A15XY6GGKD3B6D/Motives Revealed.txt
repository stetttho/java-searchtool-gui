 In the third installment of the Riverworld series, it is finally learned why people were resurrected on this strange planet by unknown beings; for some colossal galactic sociology experiment. The major characters from the first two series are all converging on the northernmost part of the river, and a few new characters are introduced, such as Jill Gulbirra, the dirigible pilot. Farmer put much more work into the character development (this book is easily thicker than the first two put together), but unfortunately puts just as many words into describing the engineering and building of the dirigible, etc. The reveal of THE DARK DESIGN of the aliens is a letdown and mostly anti-climactic.
