 HOMINIDS exemplifies what I consider to be the best quality of a great science fiction novel. No robots, no space ships, no faster-than-light travel; just a fascinating "What if...?".   What if in a parallel universe, homo sapiens did not become the dominant human species, but our long-extinct cousins, homo neanderthalis (the Neanderthals) did? Sawyer creates a fascinating world which is inhabited with Neanderthals and shows us how their society works. It is very interesting to see our world through their eyes, to examine our belief systems and the structure of our society. The romance between the Mary Vaughn and the Neanderthal scientist, Ponter Boddit, should be implausible, but is written with a lot of heart and turns out to be very touching. Great reading.
