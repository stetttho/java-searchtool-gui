 After the ads I had seen with that great romantic song, I was expecting this movie to be a romance. Boy was I wrong! It's the opposite of romantic. If you want to watch four very beautiful people do ugly things to each other, this is the movie for you. With no character development and random clips strung together, it's really hard to generate suspension of disbelief for most of the plot (such as it is) like...photographer Anna (Julia Roberts) hooks up with a guy who thinks he had e-sex with her on an internet porn site(Eew!), then leaves him to get together with her stalker. Hey, it could happen.
