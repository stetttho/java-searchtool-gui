 Twelve year-old Hannah has always been impatient and embarrassed by her Jewish heritage and traditions of remembering. During the Passover Seder, the jaded Hannah is transported back to 1942 Poland when she opens the door for the prophet Elijah. She experiences life as Chaya, a young woman who is rounded up with the rest of her family and village and sent to a Nazi work camp. There she meets Rivka (one of her aunts who survived the camp), who teaches her how to survive the dehumanizing conditions in the camp. A gripping portrayal of life in the Nazi death camps.
