 I was not intending to read this book, after wasting much time forcing myself to finish The Fiery Cross, the fifth book in this series. Between this and the smelly Lord John book (you'll understand if you read it - she is overly descriptive of the ripe smells of 1700s London), I thought I may as well cross Gabaldon off my list of favorite authors. But, the good reviews posted here persuaded me to give her another chance.   I'm glad I did. I was so engrossed in reading this novel that as soon as I reached the end, I turned back to page one and began to re-read it, picking up on little things I missed in the first reading. I thought the beginning was slow, and said "Oh, puh-leeze" on a plot device employed early on (SPOILER ALERT: Now the whole family's been raped), but other than that I loved this book and would gladly recommend it.
