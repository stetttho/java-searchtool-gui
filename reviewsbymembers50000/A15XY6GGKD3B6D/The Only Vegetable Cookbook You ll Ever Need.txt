 That is, unless you have a taste for some really exotic vegetables. This book thoroughly covers most of the vegetables grown in the American garden. (I'd never heard of some of the entries) Not only does it give tasty recipes, it lists the growing seasons, gardening tips, and ways to preserve the vegetables that cannot be cooked right away. This is my favorite feature - especially since my father (avid gardener) will show up with two bushels of snap beans, eight heads of cabbage, etc. and I am panicking about how to use them before they spoil. If you are a gardener or the friend of a gardener, this book is indispensable.
