 Nathaniel Kahn is looking for the father who abandoned him and died in a Penn Station bathroom when he was eleven. His father happened to be the world-famous architect Louis Khan, who we learn had three separate families, each with a child (only one legitimate), and who died bankrupt and his body unclaimed for days because he had scratched out his address on his passport. Nathaniel visits his father's works around the world and interviews his half-siblings, his mother, other family members, and Khan's former colleagues in an attempt to piece together his father's personality. What emerges is a portrait of a man riding the fine line between genius and madness; at turns an egotist, a charmer, a lover, an artist, a shyster. Only watch if you love architecture or a good dysfunctional family story.
