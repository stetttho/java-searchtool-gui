 Romilly MacAran is hitting puberty. Not only does that mean the usual mood swings and hormone surges, but also the surges of Romilly's awakening laran. Romilly has the MacAran gift of rapport with animals in full measure. Her overbearing father, Dom Mikhail, loves her as his favorite, but will not bend in his views of what is right in their society; that women should stay at home and embroider while men work with hawks and hounds. Mikhail also does not believe in tower training to control laran, and Romilly's beloved older brother, Ruyven, also strongly gifted with laran, fled home to take a place as laranzu in Tramontana tower against his father's wishes.   Romilly is unhappy under her father's autocratic rule, (as is her other older brother who is ironically berated for not having the family laran) but is hopeful until her father gives away her prized hawk and pledges her hand in marriage to a fat, greasy, older lord who has already lost multiple wives in childbirth. Romilly cuts her hair, puts on boy's clothes, and takes to the forest. She has many adventures and gets embroiled in the battle to restore the rightful Hastur King to the throne of Darkover, a battle in which she unsurprisingly plays a major part.  Romilly is very like Menolly from Anne McCaffrey's DRAGONSONG books. She is very sensitive and talented, subjected to emotional abuse (and a little physical abuse by her family-especially her father) and she suffers from low self-esteem. Her feelings of injustice are keenly felt and heart-rending. She grows and matures as she comes into her talent and is instrumental in helping a respected surrogate father figure. I first read this book as a teen, and found the angst and righteous indignation of Romilly tore at my heart. It still does. Would highly recommend this, especially to teen girls.
