 I was quite engrossed in the story of Mary's tragic life, up to a point. After about 500 pages or so, it became incredibly tedious. I don't know if that is because of Ms. George's writing, or just that the last part of Mary's life where she was imprisoned was incredibly boring. Probably the latter. This was obviously very well-researched, and I find it far more palatable to learn history this way than from the traditional history book.
