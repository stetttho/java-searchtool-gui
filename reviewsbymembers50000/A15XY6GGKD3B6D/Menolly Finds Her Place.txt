 DRAGONSINGER is the continuing story of Menolly, the heroine of DRAGONSONG. In this book, Menolly, now revealed as Petiron's lost apprentice, comes to the Harper Hall. This center of musical learning is more, and less, than Menolly thought it would be. She is forced to face opposition and prejudice from the music masters and her fellow students. However, the care and understanding the MasterHarper, Robinton, give her make the transition less painful. So do the friendships of Piemur, an impish singing apprentice, Sebell, a journeyman harper and Robinton's right-hand man, and Camo, the sweet but dull-witted kitchen drudge. Menolly faces her demons and triumphs in true fairy-tale fashion. Another favorite book, read so many times it is in tatters.
