 Thirteen-year old Jenna is gawky, unpopular and flat chested. She is also beginning to be ashamed of her best friend, Matt, the slightly chunky boy next door who is a photography buff. After a humiliating run-in with the most popular girls in school, Jenna wishes to be "thirty, flirty and fabulous" after she is sprinkled on the head with magic fairy dust.   Jenna wakes up the next morning - thirty as wished for - and the comedy ensues. Jennifer Garner glows as the dreamy Jenna in a grown-up body. She has the mannerisms of a thirteen-year-old down pat. (As I heard someone remark - it's like Big, but with a smokin' hot chick.)
