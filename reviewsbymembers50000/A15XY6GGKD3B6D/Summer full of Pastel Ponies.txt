 Lonely Pamela lives on Oak Farm with her two aunts because her father is always traveling for his work. After her father breaks yet another promise to take her away, he gives her an amulet that was passed down from her grandmother. Soon after, Pamela meets Ponyboy, a wild boy who lives in the woods with a herd of dainty pastel ponies. They spend wonderful summer days practicing circus tricks on the ponies. When Ponyboy goes into the sinister swamp to rescue the smallest pony, Pamela is forced to face her worst fears and things are never the same for her at Oak Farm.  I first read this as a child and the image of beautiful blue, pink, gray and gold ponies prancing across the meadow has never left me. Truly magical.
