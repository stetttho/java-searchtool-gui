 Have you ever had the daydream of going after your significant other with a high-powered gun? (Come on -what participant in a long-term relationship hasn't? Ok, maybe you're like me and would rather use your hands.)   Mr. and Mrs. Smith is your chance to live vicariously through Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt as they try to fulfill the "til death do us part" clause of the marriage contract. They are both, unbeknownst to the other, deep undercover agents who work as assassins. This movie is a fun thrill ride when they learn the truth about one another and the bullets fly.
