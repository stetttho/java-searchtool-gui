 Not many authors would have been able to re-tell the story of Jane Eyre and still keep the emotional depth and interest in the characters, but Sharon Shinn does an admirable job. In my opinion, Jane Eyre is a boring plot anyway and the depth of Jane's feelings is the only thing that makes it compelling reading, not whether on not what's-his-name will fall in love with her. I like this version much better because it is written in modern language and so much easier to read than the original. Its modern setting also makes it easier to swallow my major objection to the story: that an abused, downtrodden child would be so outspoken and self-righteous.
