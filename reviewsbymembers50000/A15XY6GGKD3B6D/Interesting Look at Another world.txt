 Fifteen year-old Christopher Boone, a high-functioning autistic, is the narrator of this quirky tale. When Christopher finds a neighbor's dog impaled on a garden fork, he decides to solve the mystery of the dog's death. While Christopher does not feel much of an emotional connection to most people (including his own father), he feels that the dog's death is heinous murder. In the course of his investigation, he finds out much more than he bargains for. A really interesting look at the thought processes of the autistic. I found myself laughing to keep from crying at some of the situations Christopher gets himself into, and felt great sympathy for his working-class parents who seem more than a little overwhelmed by Christopher's care.
