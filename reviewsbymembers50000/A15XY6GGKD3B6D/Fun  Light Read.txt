 Being a die-hard fan of the show, I have read the other books in the Alias series, but had a bit of trouble finding this one. It was an amusing, fast read, but I thought it was lacking in plot. All Sydney does is hang around in a castle while her co-inhabitants are picked off one by one. The real action does not happen until the very end of the book. I thought the scene showing how she gets to know the hunky Burke was the high point of the book.
