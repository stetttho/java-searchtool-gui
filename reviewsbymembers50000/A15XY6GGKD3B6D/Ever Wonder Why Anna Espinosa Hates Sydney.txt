 INFILTRATION takes place the summer after rookie SD-6 agent Sydney Bristow's freshman year of college. Sloan sends her on a mission to infiltrate K-Directorate as a junior agent and upload a virus to their network which will allow access to SD-6. Here, Sydney meets the formidable Anna Espinosa, who will become her major rival during the first season of the television show. Sydney's cover is blown, so she must outsmart the malicious and sneaky Anna to successfully finish her mission.  A good entry in the Alias series, I would rank it as a tie for the second best story line of these books. Good entertainment for Alias junkies, but would probably not appeal to those who are not already fans of the show.
