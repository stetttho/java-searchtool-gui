 THE GOOD EARTH tells the story of the life and times of Wang Lung, a simple Chinese peasant. The story begins on the young man's wedding day, and follows through peace, famine, floods, prosperity, love, death, all the way until Lung is an old man on the edge of death. The fortunes of the family rise and fall like the eternal cycles of life, and Buck's biblical phrasing makes the novel a quick but deeply satisfying read.
