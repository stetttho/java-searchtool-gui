 Lt. Cowen Drake, SAO (Special Agent) for Interfed's Moonchild Forces, has been sent to the desert planet Semay to investigate a series of murders. Priestesses from Semay's two ruling religious factions, Triumphantes and Fideles, are the victims and Drake must find the connections between the two very disparate sects. During his investigation, Cowen must confront his own sad religious history and deal with the fact that he is slipping into love with one of the high priestesses.   This was a hard book to finish, the main character is repressed (and depressed) and the entire story sad and dreary. Shinn explores in great detail religious convictions and faith, but there is none of the humor and spark of her Samaria novels. It also didn't help that the solution to the mystery was evident hundreds of pages before the ending.
