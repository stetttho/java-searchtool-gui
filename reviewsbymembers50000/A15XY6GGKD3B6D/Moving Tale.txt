 Avery James was raised in a foundling home in southeast Colorado where her only real friend was the school's cook, Esperanza.  After a disastrous placement in foster care and the death of Esperanza, Avery runs away and ends up with Cassie, an old curandera (herb-woman, healer, witch) in New Mexico. Because of her lonely childhood, Avery has built a wall around her heart and pushes back anyone who tries to care about her. After Cassie's death, Avery is once again set adrift and runs away from Will Cameron, the young man who is in love with her.   Avery hitchhikes to Albuquerque, where she works in a diner and attends night classes at the university. On a whim, she and her roommate move to Santa Fe, where Avery finds work with a catering company. This is how she meets Paul deGraf, her mother's former lover, and begins to unravel the mystery of who her mother was, and who Avery is, was, and wants to be.   I used to live in Santa Fe and found the descriptions of the town and its inhabitants spot-on. Hendricks' fluid and detailed descriptions of the food often made my mouth water. (Yum, chile rellenos)
