 What do (1) a man running from the Spanish Inquisition in 1515, (2) a missing Nazi zeppelin in 1935, (3) a tribe of violent Eskimos, and (4) a nefarious multinational corporation raising genetically modified fish have to do with NUMA? In typical Clive Cussler fashion, he weaves the various strands together into an action-packed story in which only hero Kurt Austin can save the day. A fun read, especially if you are interested in history and oceanography.
