 Allie Fox, a mechanical genius, drags his wife and four children to the wilds of Honduras to live a life free from the commercialism and corruption of America. The story is told from the point of view of his oldest son, Charlie. I can't help but wonder how the narration would have been different from other family members' points of view, especially the mother, whose name was not mentioned once, as far as I remember. Allie is insane in the manner of Hitler, Mussolini or some other dictator, but his only population to control is one family and some unsuspecting natives. He would obviously like to remake the world in his own image if given the chance. He makes a model village in the jungle called Jeronimo, where he is king of a warped kingdom. Disaster, of course, is not far away. I had a hard time reading this because my mind kept wandering trying to diagnose Allie. (Bipolar with 95% of the time in a state of mania?) Just when I thought the family's situation could not get more desperate, it did. This book is very good but so depressing I found it very hard to finish. Read it if you want a voyeuristic look at a family tragedy and the insane proclamations of a madman. (My favorite quote from Allie Fox: "Science fiction gave people more false hope than two thousand years of Bibles")
