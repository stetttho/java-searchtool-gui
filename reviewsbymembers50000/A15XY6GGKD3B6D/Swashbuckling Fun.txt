 I am a big fan of the Highlander series, I used to watch it on USA network almost every day. Watching season one made me realize that I am a big fan of the LATER episodes. Good thing I never saw the very first episode because it is so cheesy it should come with a warning for the lactose intolerant. After that silly attempt to re-create the Highlander movie, the series improves dramatically, but is still lacking in depth compared to later episodes. However, Adrian Paul is still wonderful as the immortal sword-wielding Scotsman, and the series features a number of great guest stars.
