 The Handmaid's Tale is sci-fi at its best; take a supposition and follow it out to its most absurd conclusion. In this book, Atwood depicts how the future could be if all the Fundamentalist Christians were allowed free reign to become a new type of Nazis. I read this after watching the movie, which was excellent with Robert Duvall and Natasha Richardson. But, of course, the book is even better. Really made me think about gender roles and the morality of righteousness.
