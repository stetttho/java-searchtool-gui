 Sarah McClure and her husband Matt move to a small Pennsylvania town for his new landscape architecture job. One of his clients is the prickly Mrs. Compson, who offers the still-jobless Sarah a position cleaning up her mansion for sale. Sarah asks that the old master quilter give her lessons in addition to her compensation. As they work on Sarah's quilt, Mrs. Compson tells her family's history of love, jealousy and betrayal. Sarah comes across as a bit whiny and the ending is very predictable, but still a good read for a rainy afternoon.
