 This is one of my top five favorite Jude Devereaux books. The hero is very similar to the famous Victorian explorer, Sir Richard Burton (not the same as Liz Taylor's on again-off again husband. If you want to read another amusing fiction book about him try Riverworld.) Brilliant, funny characters; all in all a great read.
