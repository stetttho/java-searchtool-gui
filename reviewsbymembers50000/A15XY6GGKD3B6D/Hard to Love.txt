 The heroine of this story, in a fit of eight-year-old temper, makes a wish to never see her mother again. When the mother dies in a car accident, the girl spends the next 30 years shutting down all emotions and merely existing. When she is struck by lightning, her perspective is slowly changed by a steamy (literally) affair with Lazarus Jones - a handsome young man who was revived after 40 minutes of being clinically dead from a lightning strike. She becomes suspicious when Lazarus, like a character from one of the fairy tales she loves, will only make love in the dark.   I love Alice Hoffman's work, but I am of two minds about this book. Perhaps I'm left with this feeling of diffidence because I read most of this book on a plane, but I don't think that is quite it. The interlacing of fairy tales into the story was deft and lovely. I can only come to the conclusion that the choice of first person narration is what makes this book hard to love; because what can you expect but a cold narration from a self-proclaimed ice queen? I think I would have liked this book much better had it been written in third person.
