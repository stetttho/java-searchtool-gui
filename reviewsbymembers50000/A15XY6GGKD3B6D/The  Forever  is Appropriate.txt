 Forever is exactly how long this book seems to last. It is the tale of the beautiful and ambitious Amber, who sleeps her way to the top of Restoration society in London. Amber lives through husbands, lovers, plague, fire, etc; but she never seems to grow up and does not change. (Even the oblivious Scarlett O'Hara had an epiphany at the end of GONE WITH THE WIND) I could not identify with any of the unlikable characters, and did I mention that the main character, Amber, learned nothing in her journey?  Look for my copy at your local Goodwill store.
