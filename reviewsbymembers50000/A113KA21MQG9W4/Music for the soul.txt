 Catto and Bridgeman and so, so clever. An intelligent mastering of world music, One Giant Leap is a bold movement for music, and people. A wonderful selection of artistes from the world over, singing songs "my grandfather earned... for [our] culture". A stunning album with lots of heart. Expect ethnic percussions, haunting sirens, modern pop/rock, unique instruments, and a beautiful fusion of the differences that make music and life so perfect. A product with so much character, you'd almost feel you've met, personally, each and every of the artistes and musicians.
