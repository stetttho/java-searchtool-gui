 While it is nice to see the birds in the flesh with real-life pictures of them, it is certainly not pratical for use in the field. Some of the pictures are poorly taken and it is highly difficult if not impossible to identify certain birds. Some of the images are back-lit, giving a silhouette of the bird! There is no proper classification and very little info given of the birds - how the juveniles look like, breeding plumage, male/female plumage etc.  I suppose it is a good book for the casual birder who would like to know what's chirping outside his apartment window or chalet in the wilderness. It also comes with some interesting information on where to go birding to catch wetland or passerine birds etc. I must commend Strange though for all his efforts into going into the field to capture these pictures - all pictures in the book were taken by Strange - good job Strange!
