 it doesn't matter that linden's discussion on animal behaviour isn't rocket science, as behavioural studies often seem to be thought.  the beauty about linden's writings is that they come from a prespective innate in every humanbeing - simple/fundamental, unending questioning. his questions and case studies can be appreciated in simplicity. which leads to the question then, of why humans have made the study and evaluation of animal behaviour and intelligence so complicated, tenuous and subjective. does it matter if intelligence is ingrained in instinct or conjured through an anylytical mind?  "The universe is simple at its foundation."  And i believe that's where linden is with his book. throughly entertaining and easy to read, this book can be appreciated by any age and any background. any "thicker" and it'd be a scientific reference book that'd bore or overwhelm most audiences.  Several of his stories are briefs of pending behavioural/intelligence studies in universities, which is interesting to the general public because most of the results of such studies only ever turn up in scientific journals full or jargon and mathematical symbols. he also includes letters of intrigue from readers of his first book The Parrots Lament.   Read this book if you're looking to be intrigued and quirked.
