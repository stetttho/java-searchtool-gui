 A guide that motivates you to discover the seas, this book, apart from aiding identification of some of the Indo-Pacific's most beautiful critters, presents the regions biodiversity at its very best. With photographs of an exquisite quality, not a single image is sub-standard making for a clear depiction of every animal - coral or critter. For photographers, this book also includes a handy "Ideal lens" note with each image.  Take note though that is a photographic guide, and not quite a field guide, so don't expect too much information on species and varieties or sites, but there is an informative and interesting note built of a paragraph or two, that is attached with each image.  This book has a good, though not complete, coverage of cowries, nudibranches, and scorpionfish - probably the more common species and varieties which you are likely to encounter. Half the book then presents the marine environment by zonal distinction, i.e. sandy weed and rubble, which really covers all creatures from snails, cones, eels, and other invertebrates and gastropods.  Most of the animals featured in this book are macrolife, so don't expect images of pelagics, baitballs and coral scapes.   While it claims it is a guide of the Indo-Pac region though, I feel it would is a better guide to the zone between Indonesia and Micronesia, otherwise known as the triangular hotspot of biodiversity.
