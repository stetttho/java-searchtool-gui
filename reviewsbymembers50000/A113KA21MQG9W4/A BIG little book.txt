 A perfect little book that's easy to read and internalise.  There are several interesting little known facts (as least to me when I read this book) that reminds the reader that no idea if ever too small if you can think of it in a big way. The Tipping Point is surely insightful, motivational and optimistic. I found it a heartwarming and an optimistic read.
