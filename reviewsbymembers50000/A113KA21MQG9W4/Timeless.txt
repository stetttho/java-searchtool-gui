 The Long Dark Tea Time of the Soul is my favourite of Adams' Hitchhikers trilogy of four. I've had it put on and plucked off my shelf countless times and each read is as enjoyable as the first if not better. I found Adams' wit, insight and preceptions throughly entertaining, utterly hilarious, brilliantly creative and even thought provoking. This is a book to own and to be reread through your life.
