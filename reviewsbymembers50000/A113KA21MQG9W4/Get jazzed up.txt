 I heard the first track of this album at the music store and i knew i wanted to own it. Remixed is a collection of all commissioned remixes by the Berlin-based team thus far. Absolute groove, absolute funk and great down tempo beats, this is a smooth blend of several styles to make for an awesome chillout moment. Lively and contemporary, Acid Jazz isn't quite what i'd use to describe it (it just sounds too boring!)... reinvent Incognito, reinvent Azymuth and you've got the ultimate cool of Jazzanova.
