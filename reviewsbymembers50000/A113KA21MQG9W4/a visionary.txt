 cast away on a deserted island, a pack of children, unsculpted by civilisation, spurred to act only as they have learnt through observing "grown-ups", motivated by a will to survive as in their own prespective, the Lord of the Flies is a literary masterpiece that delves into the psyche of "civilisation" and its disposition. Golding is a visionary, as with several of his likes - Huxley and Orwell et al, creating a scenerio that might appear to most, so clich?, so meaningless, yet undeniably profound. children, indulge in the mundane - play mostly; or so it is thought. Golding uses children, the root and beginning of each human existence to express civil and social evolution, perhaps even communisim and democracy, leftist and rightist attitudes. justice and injustice. his presentation may be basic, but such are our origins. this is a throughly entertaining, thought provoking and undeniable classic of our time.
