 I had the privilledge of experiencing the lead singer of this album, Hinewehi, live at a 100% PURE New Zealand Showcase in Singapore. Her vocals were astounding, and the performace presented the absolute soul and haunting ambience of Maori music.  This album is wonderfully mastered, and captures the chrisp and bold sounds, and essentially, the spirit, of the South Pacific. Cleverly and tastefully mixed with electronic sounds, Oceania carries the crux of Maori music into the mainstream, and allows this beautiful form to perdure, and at its best, to be enjoyed, experienced, and educational to the masses.  My favourite tracks Pukaea [Track 1] and Kotahitanga [Track 2] capture the pure quality of Hinewehi's voice which were as her live performance, outstanding.  The clout of the Maori spirit is too encapsulated by the supporting vocals of Reo Takiwa, Tumanako Ferrel and Angie Smith. Characteristic of Maori culture, the Haka, too doesn't fail to feature.  In addition, in the sleeve of this CD, English translations to the songs which are sang entirely in Maori, have been lovingly presented for listeners.  Hinewehi Mohi also lent her vocals to the soundtrack of the penomenal kiwi film Whale Rider. If you were spirited by the films' music, you will be seduced by Oceania.
