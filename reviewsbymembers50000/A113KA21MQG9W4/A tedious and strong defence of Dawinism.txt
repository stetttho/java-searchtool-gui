 Dawkins has proved himself to be a venerable writer by fragmenting even the tenuous theories that form the construct of Darwinism. He offers some very exciting, novel and at times humorous analogies to the principles of evolution that will allow the reader to delve deeper into Darwin's theories - further understanding the implications and manifestations of concurring with the ideologies, which draws you to question the whole concept of evolution or its intricacies (which Dawkins will ensure you do not ignore). This can do a few things for you: agree further, become puzzled and choose to stick with what you thought before you read his book, or just heck it all because it all sounds rediculous to you. It is likely that if you pick up this book you're either already Darwinian in thought or the opposite, and are looking for statements or whole chapters to rebutt. But whether you're with or against Dawkin's, he will push you to a corner, strap you down with sarcasim and offense (if you disagree with him, because he really doesn't think you should) or give you some positive stroking and nurture your understanding even more - which is highly entertaining. i will not go into the details of his book because that's all part of why you would buy it - to make your own discoveries. This is a throughly enjoyable book that you would like to keep for future references (to antagonise creationists). Dawkins also offers some carefully placed and very apt reflections of some blatently riduculous but proliferate and mostly condoned ideologies of our specicist, passive and conformist society - which you might love or hate, sometimes even though you may be with him most of the time. A scientific and journalistic masterpiece which even Darwin would rise from the grave to throw his two cents.
