 Though I'm no investor of bonds and stocks, I happened to pick up Against the Gods in a need to read and learnt of the game of risk that's been so wonderfully played out in this book. There's little technical jargon and what's technical is made very comprehensive, interesting and (when it starts to tickle your mind whilst bringing in insights) entertaining. As if a ballet about Wall St, Against the Gods will offer anyone something for the long or short term, intangible or otherwise.
