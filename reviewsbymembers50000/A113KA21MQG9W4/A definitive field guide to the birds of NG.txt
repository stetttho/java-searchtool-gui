 What i appreciate most abt this book is tt it's chock full of information. from an introduction to papuan geography to taxonomy, as well as intros into racial variation of the very diverse groups of birds in NG. The book also delves into the country's natural history, environment and even island biogeography. another thing i appreciate is the significant introduction given to each family of birds before the species' details list. such info allows the birder to understand how better to expect, spot and identify these birds in the field. contact information also provided for those interested in visiting the country. followed by a range of tips on how to best to identify birds in the Papuan terrain. the author even goes so far as to give mention of the significance of birds in Papuan culture and life, which is a graet insight, little expected in a field guide.  lastly, of course, the slates are wonderfully coloured, otherwise in black and white (but don't worry, of course the colouration is mentioned in the description) - i suppose to cut costs (this book is expensive) - but an indespensible edition to a complete guide to birds of the indonesian archipelago.
