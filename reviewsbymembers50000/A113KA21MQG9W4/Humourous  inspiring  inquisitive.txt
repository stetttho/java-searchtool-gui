 A field researcher myself, I pleasantly related to, was heart-warmed by, and made to reminisce, the excitements and hesitations of working in the field.  Field research brings varied experiences to the individual; some pertaining solely to work, to life at large, but also to the heart. I've Been Gone Far Too Long delivers a broad and balanced collection of experiences from diverse anthropological, medical, biological, cultural and social perspectives.  It is largely the good editorial that allowed the humour, fear, thrill, and even romance of the writers to be carried through to the reader. With engaging narratives and theatrical prose, you're invited to walk the road less-travelled with these select field researchers, and experience a fraction of what it's like to have to consider survival whilst gathering data for a thesis or story; where all you really want is neither a convenience store nor a fluffy bed, but simply a comfortable and secure toilet.  However, what this books fails to communicate is detail. The editorial could've had greater impact if it included lengthier stories that allowed for enhanced character development and insight into the projects that each of the researchers were involved in. This would've in turn, given the reader greater depth into each of the environments and experiences that were encountered. I felt several stories had the potential to instil greater curiosity and illuminate keen issues, but most stories reached their conclusion before any of that was allowed to arrive.  I've Been Gone Far Too Long celebrates the privileges of working in enriching environments amidst diverse peoples and inspiring circumstance. You'll realise that at the end of each story, what the writer truly wants to say, is quite contrary to the title, and that is, "I'm glad I came."
