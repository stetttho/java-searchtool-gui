 A HUGE star from Irma Records (i love Irma!), Essential Funk Box is a must-have in your funk music collection. Very tight, very funk, and very original. Lovingly crafted and smoothly mastered, the rhythm kinda lost me at Virtual Box [T5] but it picked up real well after making for comfortable and progressive listening. The strong beats make for such "traditional" funk, which is great bcos it's THAT familiarity that makes it so positively good. This is funk. This is ESSENTIAL.
