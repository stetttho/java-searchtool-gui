 Perera's debut 'A Leap in the Dark' is an undaunted contribution to Singaporean literature. His use of vivid and figurative language seemingly cloak his philosopical insights into Singaporean society. For example I would describe that his use of sexual imagery propagates the organic relationship between the Singaporean and the issues  that Perera puts forth in this novella. Such is rationalised by Walt Whitman, "Sex must be brought out of concealment into the open in order to foster a sane, healthy attitude toward the important phases of life", and I think Perera is deserving of this relation. Though I found his poems, which were interjected between his short stories, coming a little abrupt as as a reader I'd have to adjust the momentum and mood of my reading, I find A Leap in the Dark an explicit as well as implicit portrayal of Singaporean and other authoritarian-run societies.
