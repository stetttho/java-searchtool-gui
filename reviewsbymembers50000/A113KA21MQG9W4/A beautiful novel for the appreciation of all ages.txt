 A contemporary love story that may end in an unexpected way for some. Evan's is wonderfully discriptive in his book about the Horse Whisperer who helps a girl's (Grace) tramatised horse regain its confidence so that they both may ride again. However, I found the part of the relationship between Grace's mother and the horse whisperer a little too over played, but it's also an event that forms the crux of the story apart. I also find that it shadows the depiction of the horse whisperer doing as his name, and the book title, suggests. None the less, it is a beautiful novel told out in a beautiful setting, of the contemporary yet primal lifestyle that exists all around us - the one we're often oblivious to.
