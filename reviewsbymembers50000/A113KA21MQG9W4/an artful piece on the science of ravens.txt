 Heinrich has managed a comprehensive and entertaining book on the behavior, biology and indeed, mind of the raven. His book expresses his struggles as a scientist to have what evidence he has abt the behaviour of these "wolf birds", accepted by the scientific community which continues to be conservative.  Expect to learn all and more you ever dared to ask about ravens. Heinrich's studies of ravens are long term and an accumulation of information fed from individuals who are simply curious about the birds to those who've spent their academic lives researching them the world over. Additionally, Mind of the Raven allows a personal take and comment on the birds, some with names, others named in realtion to their tags. Otherwise, you will find that Henrich has very beautifully incorporated a reflection of the human behaviour and the misgivings of our existing scientific community whilst studying his feathered subjects. I've never had contact with a raven. Heinrich's book is certainly motivating me to meet one soon. You'd want to read this whether or not you're into birds.
