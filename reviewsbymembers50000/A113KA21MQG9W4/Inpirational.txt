 This book arrived on my book shelf at a very appropriate time for me.  A young man is torn between choosing love or choosing life's task. The outcomes of both choices are ambiguous. He has to decide sacrificing love for the betterment of his people, or sacrificing his people for the freedom to love.  To put it an oxymoron, his task is clear yet cryptic.   I feel anyone will be able to relate to the story of Elijah. Paulo Coelo brilliantly plays the movement of the mind in lifes immanent decision-making processes. And while in the middle of the book (I cannot reveal what happened..) you may begin to oddly feel the cynicism of life which we all encounter at some point, however, following Elijah through his journey turns out to be be quite the opposite.  Beautifully constructed, Paulo Coelho reminds us of how he has mastered form and function in his writing. It seems funny that I even mention that because he IS a master in his field. But when you close this book, you will be reminded of powerfully he has been able to move your mind, and perhaps even, your heart and spirit as well.
