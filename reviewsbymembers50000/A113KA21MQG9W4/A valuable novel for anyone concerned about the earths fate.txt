 The Song of the Dodo is a charming and inspirational yet detailed and informative depiction of the origin, route and future of civilisaton. I found many facts that were played out in this book to be a tremendous eye-opener. David Quammen has the amazing ability to write of such detailed, scientific and serious issues in the most humourous, entertaining and heartful manner. A wonderful book to own.
