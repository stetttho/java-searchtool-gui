 Rape of the Wild proved to be very informative. I particularly found the etymological explanations wonderfully insightful. The courage taken to invest emotions in an issue/s so often strived to be kept objective and reasoned, is commendable.  Whilst the authors do their best to give reference to their claims and theories, I found certain statements to be assuming, biased and stereotypical. I would have appreciated if certain statements were balanced or countered with references, thereby challenging and reaffirming the authors' views. [...] Rape of the Wild is a bold and much needed attempt at defending that discrimination, regardless of form: racisim, sexism, agesim, speciesim, are one and the same and will require a revolution now if it is to cease to perpetuate.
