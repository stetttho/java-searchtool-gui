 Any serious birder to the listed regions of this book would buy this book. It is the best guide of the region so far with excellent plates and useful details. What I find especially useful, particularly for the raptors, is that they show illustrations of the birds in flight.  The drawings appear consistent and the bird's information at the back of the book is easy to access. The birds are categorised according to their family which definately makes for faster checks and identification, which I find important when in the field. The spine of the book though is a little week and you might want to have it rebound before it falls apart - especially with all the browsing that is to be.
