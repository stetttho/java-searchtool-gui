 There are no short cuts to delivering a high impact speech. Ever smile and shake your head in disbelief at a flawless presentation? Have you ever considered the amount of preparation that goes on before a speech? Writing and re-writing. Yes, writing for your speech! It may seem mandatory to some, but several continue to attempt escapes without preparing for a speech.  High Impact Speeches provides a step-by-step, structured and strategic methodology towards developing a speech that will move minds, win businesses, and change the world. But just when you thought you were merely going to be issued a template to copy from, Heller screams the importance of self-identify; retaining the traits that make you unique and dismissing the habits that make you ineffective. He has deconstructed the Speech so he can pick and present the various fundamental aspects that will lead your speech to success.  The former political advisor to Rt. Hon Denus Healey MP, and Rt. Hon Gerald Kaufman MP, there is no doubt Heller knows what he's talking about (no pun intended).  For students, this book will also prove a mighty tool at understanding the form and structure of speeches.  But it's not just about talking. Heller also includes tips on research techniques, note making, and exploiting the media to get the most out of your little speech.
