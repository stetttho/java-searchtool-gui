 Animal Liberation discusses the deep, dark realities of the relentless suffering of animals for man's selfishly concocted needs.  It's a philosophical discussion of mankinds discrimination that has existed for far too long and requires the effort of every human being to rectify.  Singer's views may seem extreme and radical, but it i precisely that perception which prevents the structural reform necessary to see an end if not a progression towards the end, of the indoctrines and long taught mindsets of society and civilisation. Singer reminds us that we are essentially what we desire ourselves to be and our judgements do not belong to us but to the subliminal social oppession that has led us to think as such. I would encourage persons in woman's, anti-racist, religous and the animal movement, if not everyone else, to read this book at least once, whole or in part, in their lifetime.
