 I am ashamed. I knew little about giant tortoises except that Darwin had one named Harriet and that there are some that live in the hills of the Galapagos that go into warm volcanic soil to lay their eggs. Had I chanced upon this book before my visit to the Mascarene Islands, I would've given these ancient, magnificent, and awe-inspiring reptiles their deserved attention when I met them.  Paul Chambers has done a remarkable job in recognising the characters of his audience as he has delivered a wonderfully entertaining recount of the discovery, torment, exhaltation, recognition, then conservation of the giant tortoises of the Indian and Atlantic Oceans. Be convinced that Chambers' knack at story-telling, served by intricate and exhaustive research processes, is that which has made this book a success. No doubt, the history of the giant tortoises is itself a truly fascinating topic, however, it is a long history and Chambers knits it tightly into just over 300-pages.  Complimented with thought-provoking illustrations and guiding maps, Chambers also supplements readers with archived photographs where available and enchanting excerpts from the journals of renowned naturalists including Darwin and Wallace (whom, when you read this book, aren't as significan't characters to the story as you think!).  Chambers has inspired curiosity and instilled amazement in this group of animals that has come so close to being decemated by development. A well-paced read, that is acutely balanced and finely structured, be prepared to journey back into the ages of the sea-faring colonists, and discover as they did, the unique giant tortoises that have for millenia, led a sheltered life.
