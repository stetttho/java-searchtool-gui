 Although I agree with some of the other reviewers that there were some lost opportunities in the film, the plot was something that I can never forget. And the music and senery is wonderful. I can watch it over and over  again--my first time was in the mid-'80s in high school. I just rented this  here in Japan with the Japanese subtitles to show my Japanese girlfriend,  and she loved it. I can only hope I can find out where to buy the Japanese  subtitle one. If you know, please email me. Check out the book that started  the film "Bid Time Return". I hope they can remake this like they  did the film Titantic.
