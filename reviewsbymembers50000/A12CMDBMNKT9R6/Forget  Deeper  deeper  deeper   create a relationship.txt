 Forget the classic forms of hypnosis. Deeper, deeper, deeper will only work with about half of your clients. This book talks about the importance  of creating a relationship and how the hypnotist should first hypnotize  himself/herself before the client can go into trance. Excellent, excellent  work. A leader in the field. I highly suggest The Courage to Love by the  same author.
