 Just like the reader from San Diego, I thought this book could have been  written in a 20 page pamphlet. And unlike the reader from San Diego, this  is not my first NLP book. I have read severals and found this book to be a  simple rehash of the deeper stuff on NLP. It seem like Mr. Brooks was  trying to stretch representational systems into a book. Nothing too  insightful for those who already know NLP, but not a bad starter to get  your feet wet.
