 As a manager of a new, small organization, we had no real procedures to document and follow for disciplining under-performing employees. This books gave me a good outline of the steps to follow and some of the theory behind the steps. It also provides many sample write-ups for a variety of situations.  It is not by any means a "5-course dinner" on progressive discipline, but it will give you a good basic foundation from which to start--especially if are in immediate need for something to hold you over until you can invest the time and money in setting up a more in-depth process.   As another reviewer has written, best to consult an HR expert for the details, especially those particular gray areas you may encounter. Also, I find this a good companion to the performance appraisal book by Dick Grote entitled "The Performance Appraisal Question and Answer Book". In fact, I would consider both these books as a small business manager's "starter set" for HR basics.
