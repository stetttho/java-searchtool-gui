 I understand that this is THE book to start with by Jose Silva, the radio  repairman turned hypnotist, on Mind Control. Being a hypnotist for over 10  years and delving into NLP for the past 3, I find that this book is right  on with a lot of Silva's theories about the mind (it's all electrical  circuits) and the techniques to explore and improve yourself. However, I  thought about a third of the book was just plain testimonials which I  really didn't need so much, and the techniques could do with some  refinement (almost all are visual techniques--what happens if you're not a  visual person?). If the reader is interested in Mind Control, I'd say to  also check out books on NLP which is a bit more refined than this.
