 I found that this book helped to close up the gaps that I had concerning martial arts in general. I just started taking aikido about 4 months ago, and I had a lot of basic questions that I didn't want to bother my sensei about.  I like the approach the book takes about really 'living' the martial way--not just going around and doing stuff like you see in the movies. Although I was a bit taken back by the book being a bit on the aggressive side of fighting and the lack of coverage concerning aikido.
