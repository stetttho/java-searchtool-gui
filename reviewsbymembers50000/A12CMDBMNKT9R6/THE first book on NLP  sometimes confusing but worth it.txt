 THE first NLP book that specifically introduces the Meta-Model. A fairly easy book to read on some basic questioning techniques to get to someone's deep structure (someone's true linguistic representation of the world).  Fairly easy to read except the appendix on transformal grammar. Use these  patterns carefully for they can be rather direct. A must for the beginning  NLP student.
