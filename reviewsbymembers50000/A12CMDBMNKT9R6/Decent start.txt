 I found the book very helpful for me to understand how to start out in PM. In particular, the initiation and planning phase of the book was terrific in helping me add some structure when confronted with new projects. These  two parts of the book explained to me the basics of Gantt charts, network  diagrams, WBSs, and the like. I wasn't much for the second half of the book  (executing, controlling, and closing). If you have a basic business  background, most likely you'll find the second half pretty much common  sense. If you're new to PM and new to business, then this book is great.  If you're new to PM but not to business, get the book to introduce you to  the tools by reading the first half. Skip the second half and then go find  a more indepth book, or look at the PMBOK.
