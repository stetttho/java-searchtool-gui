 A friend of mine suggested that I start to look at Project Managementto help me organize the variety of projects I do at work in a largeautomotive company. (Interestingly enough, the division I'm in has no real PM processes in place.) I searched for books that could get me going in the right direction and as quickly as possible (in addition to joining the Project Management Institute...) This book was an easy read, but presented a lot of tools that I could implement almost immediately. After reading the book, I started seeing very obvious improvement in my team's work--we started to actually understand what we wanted to accomplish and where we were going. If you're interested in getting a quick start and basic understanding about PM, start with this book!  END
