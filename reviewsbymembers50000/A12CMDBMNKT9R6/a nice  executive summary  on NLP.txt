 A very, very good basic introduction to NLP. This book is good for those who want an "executive summary" of the basic principles of NLP. It doesn't go into the techniques. Just enough to help you decide if NLP is  right for you. If you want to get into basic techniques, best to skip this  one and go right into "An Introduction to NLP."
