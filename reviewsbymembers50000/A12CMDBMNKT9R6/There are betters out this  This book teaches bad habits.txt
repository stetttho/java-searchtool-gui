 A book of very, very basic scripts that assumes way too much and teaches you bad habits for hypnosis. (It uses the beach metaphor way too much--what if the subject had a drowning experience?!?) The author also assumes: 1)  the client will accept the standardized reality of the script and thus no  one is unique, 2) you, as a hypnotist, know what to prescribe to the client  (diet, exercise, etc.), and 3) the hypnotist does all the work and accepts  100% responsibility. And, the book does a poor job at explaining trance and  hypnosis, even as a simple introduction. There are better books out there  that teaches hypnosis. Look for a book by Hunter or, even better but a  little more complex,  Gilligan.
