 It is great to finally have a collected works of Aristotle. The quality of the 2 volumes is superb and the translations, as far as I can tell, seem quite good. However, the INDEX leaves a lot to be desired. First, there is only an index in volume 2 covering both volumes. This is a nuisance if you only have volume 1. Secondly, the index is, for all practical purposes, not subdivided. That is, let's say you want to look up "virtue," all you get is tons of reference (page) numbers but no additional information, so in order to find precisely what you're looking for, you basically have to look up all the references and decide for yourself. And that keeps the index from being very useful.
