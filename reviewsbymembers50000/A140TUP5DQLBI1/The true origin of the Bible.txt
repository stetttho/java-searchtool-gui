 No, the Bible did not drop out of Heaven one day. This book wonderfully shows where the Bible comes from, and why it is the Catholic Church from which it originates. Graham takes a good look at all the major issues involved: history, the proto-Reformers (Tyndale, Wycliff, etc.), the councils, private interpretation, Luther's elimination of 7 books, the abundance of (German) vernacular translations before Luther, etc. Easy read, and well worth the money.
