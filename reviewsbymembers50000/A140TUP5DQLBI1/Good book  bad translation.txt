 Aristotle's "Metaphysics" is superb, no question about it. But this edition ("Prometheus Books" edition, translated by John McMahon--I am NOT referring to the "Penguin Books" edition, translated by Hugh Lawson) is greatly deficient. The translation is horrible, using expressions that are not used in today's English, e.g. "superficies" where other translations have "surface," etc. This edition has no index, no glossary, no notes or commentaries. It's really worthless. Again, Aristotle's work itself is great, but this edition and translation is not worth your money. Get a different one. The best translation is said to be W.D. Ross's, but Lawson's is said to be alright, too.
