 This little booklet is shocking but excellent. John Vennari has compiled strongest evidence showing that the Masons have long tried to infiltrate the Catholic Church and achieved their greatest victory to date with the election of John XXIII and the Second Vatican Council. Vennari quotes from numerous Masons, theologians, and cardinals to prove his case. An excellent introductory guide to give to those Catholics who still don't believe the Church is in a major crisis. It won't go away until the Masons, liberals, and modernists have been defeated. Makes a terrific gift.
