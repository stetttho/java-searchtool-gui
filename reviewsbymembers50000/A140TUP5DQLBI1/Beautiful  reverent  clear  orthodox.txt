 If there is one Catholic catechism I can recommend to the whole family, it's this one. The Catholic faith is explained clearly and beautifully in 193 sections that cover everything a Catholic needs to know in order to live his Faith to the fullest. Beautiful pictures and illustrations grace each section of this catechism, and easily understandable explanations clearly show what Catholics believe and why. In each section there is an abundance of quotes from the Holy Scriptures. This is a truly beautiful hardcover edition that's definitely worth the price. Should be in every Catholic household. Completely authoritative. Well indexed. Republished from the 1954 edition.
