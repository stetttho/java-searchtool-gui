 This book, often hailed a masterpiece, is in fact a dangerous compendium endorsing a modernistic interpretation of the Bible. Modernism was condemned most forcefully by Pope St. Pius X (1903-1914) as a conglomeration of numerous errors that all intend to undermine Catholic doctrine from within the Church. Modernism includes relativism, subjectivism, emotionalism, and many other errors. The "Nihil Obstat" this book bears was given by the authors themselves, which of course nullifies the purpose of having it. I recommend you stay away from this commentary. To get a good commentary, I recommend the one by Fr. Leo Haydock, available in the Haydock Douay-Rheims Bible, or simple get a regular Douay-Rheims Bible which has explanatory footnotes to the text.
