 I like this book. Chesterton, in his enjoyable style, gives a brief overview of the life of St. Thomas. The book is by no means exhaustive, nor is it meant to be. Chesterton recounts particular incidents in Thomas' life that are quite noteworthy, and he even contrasts Aquinas with St. Francis of Assisi, which is among the more humorous parts of the book. Chesterton talks about Thomas' philosophy and the errors of his time he was combatting. He mentions St. Thomas' childhood and his father's unwillingness to let him become a Dominican monk, for example. Numerous tidbits are packed into this little book, and it makes great supplemental reading for anyone who wishes to know more about the Angelic Doctor. Some people say this is "the best book ever written about St. Thomas." I disagree with that. It is a nice book, a relaxing book to read. It gives information about St. Thomas that is non-essential but nevertheless nice to have. However, due to its conciseness and rather informal arrangement of its contents, I would not say that this is absolute "must-read" or even "the best book ever written" about Aquinas.
