 This book is a very fine one, but you must know the PURPOSE for which it has been written in order to appreciate it. Folks, this is probably NOT the kind of book you want to give to a Protestant in the hopes of converting him. Rather, this book is for the Catholic who wants ammunition in his conversations with Protestants to prove them wrong. Ms. Zingleman is very blunt and calls it as it is. For instance, she says, "The Protestant needs to know that his religion is not in the Bible, and the Catholic's is." Something along those lines. Of course, this is true. But it is not how you would put it when you talk to a Protestant, unless the one you're talking to is a rabid anti-Catholic and talks to you in similar fashion. The material Pauline Zingleman presents is terrific. Very hard-hitting and valuable. But it's not for the common non-Catholic audience. So, basically, if you recognize this book's mission, then you will appreciate it. It's people who presume this book is something to give to Protestants that are offended by it. The material itself is excellent. Also, this book is a real wakeup call for modernist and indifferentist "Catholics." You know, the kind that say, "Oh, well, you can't prove either side, and it's both Christian, so it doesn't matter." Oh yes it does! Read 2 John 9. A previous reviewer said: "The author is very conceited to believe that Protestants are wrong just because they don't agree with her on all articles of faith." No, that's not conceited. That's Catholic. As a Catholic, you HAVE to believe what the Church teaches is true. Ms. Zingleman is not afraid to call apostasy and heresy by name, and she calls everyone who styles himself a Catholic to task and challenges him either to defend his faith or give it up. And she's right: you can't be lukewarm. Either be a real Catholic or no Catholic at all. No sympathizing with Protestants. This book is the real deal!
