 I am often asked what book I would recommend to people considering conversion from Protestantism to Catholicism or to people trying to evangelize Protestants who have questions, even tough ones, about Catholicism. If it can be just one book, more often than not, this is the trilogy I recommend. Granted, it's 3 books, but all three of them together form one whole that answers over 4,000 questions posed by Protestants, Atheists, Agonstics, skeptics, etc. Because of the wide range of questions, this book is very recommendable -- it doesn't only specialize on one single topic. And because the questions are REAL questions that other people have asked, many folks will find asked and answered precisely the same questions they've wondered about, in this work. It is thoroughly indexed and covers almost any question that might come up in a debate with a Protestant or other unbeliever. It is extremely useful, as my experience in apologetics testifies. This is the work to turn to first when stumped on a particular issue. The wealth of information in this trilogy is unimaginable. Written by two priests. Imprimatur. If you can only buy one source of Catholic answers--make it this one!
