 Unfortunately, this book is not usable because it teaches heresy. Fr. Osborne, who I believe one could safely term a modernist, says in this book that baptism does not take away original sin or actual sins for adults (p. 64). He also glorifies the common modernists like Karl Rahner and Edward Schillebeeckx. So, in short, hands off that book. There are GOOD sacramental theology books out there; don't waste your money on this one.
