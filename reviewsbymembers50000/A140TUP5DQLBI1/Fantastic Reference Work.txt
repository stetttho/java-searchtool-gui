 This great book is very comprehensive, structured, and a great resource to look up (or just browse!) what the Catholic Church teaches and why. Generally, for each doctrine, Fr. Ott lists scriptural, historical, and rational evidence as well as evidence from Church Tradition. This makes it a very handy compendium, especially when looking for the *sources* of Church teaching. After each teaching, Ott lists the degree of authority with which it had been promulgated up until 1954. And no, the fact that it was written in 1954 does not make it old or out of date, by ANY means. Truth is truth, whether it was written in 1954 or in 2001. You will not regret purchasing this book.
