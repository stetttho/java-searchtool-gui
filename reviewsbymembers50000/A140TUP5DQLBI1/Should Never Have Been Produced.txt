 This movie is horrible. The actor, Timothy Dalton, seems ticked off, cold, and standoffish. Especially The movie itself is unnecessarily gruesome and cruel. So much violence and gory tortures are unnecessary, uncalled-for, and should not be on TV. We don't need to see people eaten alive by sharks, blown up from the inside because they're locked up inside a pressure tank, or ground to death by a human shredder. This movie is just brutal.
