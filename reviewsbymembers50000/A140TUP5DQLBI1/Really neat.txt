 As a philosopher or philosophy student, it goes without saying that you need more than just one philosophical dictionary. Here's a good one. I use it to supplement my other dictionary, Simon Blackburn's "Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy" (ISBN 0192831348), which is also excellent. One dictionary may have more or different information on one term, or even have a term another may not list, and vice versa, and so different philosophical dictionaries complement one another very well that way. This dictionary here in particular makes it easy to find terms and has concise and to-the-point explanations. To be recommended.
