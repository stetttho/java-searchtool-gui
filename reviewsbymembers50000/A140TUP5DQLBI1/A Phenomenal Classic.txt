 Wow, this movie is a true classic. It is simple, yet sophisticated. It is without any action or violence, yet suspenseful and thrilling.  This is the story of how one juror entertaining reasonable doubt about what the other eleven thought was a clear-cut case of "guilty as charged" was able to change the minds of the other eleven to vote "not guilty" instead. I will not reveal whether or not the accused was guilty indeed, for it will take away the suspense.  You will certainly enjoy the 90 minutes of this classic movie as you yourself become a participant in the jury's deliberations and can weigh the evidence and consider the case for yourself: did he do it or didn't he? Is there enough evidence to send him to be executed, or is there reasonable doubt? See the agony and apparent evidence and counter-evidence these jurors went through--in the classic black-and-white format. This is real entertainment, folks!
