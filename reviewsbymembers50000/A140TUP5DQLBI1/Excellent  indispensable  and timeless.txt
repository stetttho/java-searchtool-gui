 This is THE Catechism of the Catholic Church. Trash any imitations. This piece clearly and sternly explains the teachings of the Catholic Church in the face of the Protestant Revolution. Answers almost all questions about  the faith which Protestants raise. Terrific! Super! Must-have! As timeless  as the Summa Theologica.
