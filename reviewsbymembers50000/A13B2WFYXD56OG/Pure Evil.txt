 One thing that the Right simply does not understand is that reality does not change itself to conform to their doctrine. This is nowhere more apparent than in this book. Everything here is the antithesis of science. The personal attacks, the appeal to faith, the appeal to the moral danger of accepting scientific conclusions, the cherry picking of favorable results while ignoring and defaming anything that isn't in lock-step with your desires.  This is not science. This is theocratic fascism and a smear against all science. In a world where scientific inquiry is replaced by dogma we have very little to hope for.  I note that Regnery Press, the publisher of this terrible screed, was the Nazi-sympathizing mouthpiece for Lindbergh and Henry Ford .
