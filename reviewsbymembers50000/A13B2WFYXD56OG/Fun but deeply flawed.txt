 When I read this book I had great hopes. Women are often unwelcome in the martial arts world, and a guide which addresses women's concerns would be welcome. Unfortunately, AWGtMA restricts rather than expands horizons. The good parts reflect the author's love of Japanese Karate. The parts which address anything else are weak, and the range of martial arts studied gives a very non-representative picture of the field - more caricatures than descriptions and very limited in scope.  The descriptions of martial arts training and etiquette are only applicable to the style she studies and should not be taken as a general guide.  This could have been an excellent book if the writer had only educated herself a little more.
