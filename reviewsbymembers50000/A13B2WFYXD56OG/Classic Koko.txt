 If you want one album to introduce new listeners to Koko Taylor or Blues done by women this is the one. It contains her best known songs done very well. The album is a little shorter than it could be - I'd have liked to see "Sure had a wonderful time last night", "Come to Mama" or "I can love you like a woman" in there. But it rocks. And so does The Queen.
