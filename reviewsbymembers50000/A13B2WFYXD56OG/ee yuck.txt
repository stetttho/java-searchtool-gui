 I tried really hard to like this book as with the others in the series. But it was simply impossible.  Don't get me wrong. I like heroes and anti-heroes. And even as a kid I thought that Captain Bligh was one of the former.  But the main character here is the sort of half-crazed martinet who makes Captain Queeg look like Francis of Assissi and Mother Courage rolled into one. A religious fanatic. Grasping. Power mad. Self-absorbed. Needlessly cruel. With no regard for the lives and well-being of his men. The kind of officer who would be fragged in any sane military past or present and who would almost certainly have washed out of OCS, much less a the military academy. The covert racism in this and others is impossible to ignore. The "gangs" down in the cities are all Black or Latino (as if these would still be meaningful categories that far in the future). They even talk like refugees from a minstrel show.  And the "Fish", the demons of the piece, aren't even very good monsters. They seem big, strong, dumb and hungry. Less the objects of a military campaign than a job for the game warden. This whole series is a lot like a sick cat; it just doesn't wash.
