 The concept is interesting enough. The characters could be engaging. But ultimately this novel falls flat. The dialog is very poorly written. And while science fiction writers can certainly assume a number of improbable things it is best to be parsimonious. The author dishes them out in medium-large expository lumps.  On the whole, it was a bit too much like watching a remake of "The Thing" set in Pittsburgh.
