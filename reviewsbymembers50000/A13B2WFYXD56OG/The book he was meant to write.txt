 I've followed Steve Barnes' writing for many years. He always dealt with interesting subjects in a very readable way. But with Lion's Blood he has finally hit his stride. A lot of the themes he's dealt with over his career - conflict, combat, race, and identity are still there. If anything they are more prominent. But there's a difference this time. The writing is better. The pages keep turn themselves a little more eagerly. The themes are dealt with in a more mature and sophisticated fashion. In short, he's arrived. When I first heard this book was going to be written I had fears that it would be a simple inversion of today's world. These fears were groundless. Barnes has done his homework. He's made a plausible, well-researched world in which to explore his ideas. It's someplace else that really is someplace else. But somewhere that we could have ended up.  I look forward eagerly to the next book
