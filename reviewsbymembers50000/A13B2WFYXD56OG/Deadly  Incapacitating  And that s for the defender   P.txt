 Like the other Echanis books this stuff is deadly, for the poor sap who actually tries to use it. The techniques are inefficient, rely on strength, assume the other guy is an idiot moving at the speed of molasses, and put you in a lot of danger. They also violate really basic, and I mean BASIC principles of self defense. Several of them get the attacker in trouble. And then let him out. Others make contact and take control. And then give up both. There are, G-d help us, pictures of him kicking the knife out of the attacker's hand and others where he exposes things most of us REALLY don't want cut to the blade. Save your money. Take a decent course in the Southeast Asian martial arts. Buy Fairbairn or Applegate's books. Learn some police combatives. Get a gun. But if you want to survive an armed attacker DON'T BUY THIS GUY'S BOOKS.
