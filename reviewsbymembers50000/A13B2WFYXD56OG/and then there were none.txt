 In 2001 Columbia University awarded Michael Bellesiles the prestigious Bancroft Prize for Arming America. He seemed to have done an important piece of scholarship on a controversial area of American history. The only people who were unhappy were the paid flacks of the gun lobby and the right wing wing-nuts. The author was showered with awards and positive mention in the press. He had tenure. His future was assured. Then it began to fall apart. Records which Bellesiles claimed to have used turned out not to exist. Notes and photocopies of primary sources became mysteriously unavailable. Independent panels reviewed his word and determined that he had falsified data - one of the unforgivable sins of the academic world - and not only ignored but changed evidence that did not support his position. A year later, in October 2002 Dr. Bellisiles resigned his position at Emory University in what most would call disgrace. In December of the same year Columbia University revoked his Bancroft Prize saying "he had violated basic norms of scholarship and the high standards expected of Bancroft Prize winners." The man's career and reputation have been destroyed. He can not be taken seriously as a scholar or as anything except a writer of fiction. If you want to waste your money on a clumsy fraud at least choose something entertaining like "The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion".
