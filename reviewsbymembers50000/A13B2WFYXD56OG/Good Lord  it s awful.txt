 What can I say? The technique is completely unrealistic. The prose is unreadable. "His Holiness The Dalai Seng-Shi" Simon can not put words together into coherent paragraphs. The stuff about psychology and crime prevention doesn't have anything to do with the real world. There is a lot of crypto-racism.   And the technique. G-d above, the technique. It's lousy. It's elaborate. It requires a lot of strength and a cooperative attacker to even theoretically work. It would be a lot more convincing if it was demonstrated by women against larger men; mostly it's Simon doing it to someone he outweighs by at least twenty pounds.  About the only good thing I can say about it is that the recycler took it. Maybe it will come back as a copy of "Beauty Bites Beast" or "Real Knockouts".
