 I really can't understand why this book and its prequel are so popular. The great revelations are really pretty insignificant. Doznes of priests from the highest levels of the Vatican have their faith shaken to the core by the horrible revelation that a priest was raped.  So what? It happens to women every single day. Nobody cares very much. But somehow the virtue of The Priest is a thing of such awe that its violation nearly signals the end of the world. I thought I didn't get it. Then I looked a little deeper. The Priest gets to have sex, but he is spared the messy consequences of love, tenderness and personal responsibility by virtue of a plague that incidentally commits partial gynocide. What we seem to have here is an author who just can't, in the end, wrap her head around the idea that her beloved Church is made up of men and women.  Of course, it's all necessary to show that The Priest - and by extension the Church - are the only force for mercy and reconciliation. Nobody else except the Christ-like wounded Priest is capable of forgiveness and preventing genocide. There is no Salvation apart from the Mother Church.  Her covert anti-Semitism is just as hard to take. She hits every one of the standard Catholic stereotypes about Jews and passes them off as profundity. The Jew is intelligent but not wise. The Jew has no mercy in her soul. Given a chance The Jew, unlike The Priest, is a fan of genocide. The Jew is, down at the bottom a whore and therefore contemptible (although The Priest magnanimously forgives her for it). The Jew is tainted because her womb brings forth flawed children. It is only a wonder that The Jew didn't kill little Catholic children and use their blood to make matzohs.   Those who showed up early for catechism class will eat this stuff up. Those of us who aren't Christians, let alone Catholics, will leave with a faint taste of rot in our mouths.
