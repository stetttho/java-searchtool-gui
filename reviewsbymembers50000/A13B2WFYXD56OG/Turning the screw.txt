 It must be the Judo. I've always been impressed when someone can reverse an attacker's own technique and throw him with it. The author has done this taking old propaganda art and changing it just a little so that its new message stands out even more sharply. Micah Wright's message seems harsh, reptetitive and maybe a bit bitter. Fair enough. He's an elite, blooded Army Ranger who lost his innocence when he saw atrocities performed in his country's name. Some soldiers make their peace with this. Others become angry. He became angry. But this is a minor criticsim. The message should be welcome to civil libertarians and lovers of freedom from all parts of the political spectrum. The underlying messages are simple. By pushing the country in to an unneccessary war the government has betrayed its soldiers. By creating a climate of fear and paranoia they are destroying the freedoms which make America America. In short, there is a very good chance that our current leaders are involving us in another WWII, but with America as the Axis. Scary stuff.
