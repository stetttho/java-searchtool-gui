 The thing I admire most about S.M. Stirling is his thoroughness. Most of the time he thinks through the implications of what he writes, considers the consequences, and comes up with a self-consistent enjoyable novel. The Islander series was a gem in that regard. Peshwar Lancers falls so far short that it hardly seems to have been written by the same man. It's obvious that Stirling was deep in his Kipling and visions of Imperial Glory were dancing so manically in his head that he didn't have time to think through anything.  The British had time to evacuate their islands and set up shop in India. But America has become nothing but a howling wasteland peopled by savages. A mini-Ice Age has caused the Russians to give up the Orthodox Church, embrace Yazidism and set up shop in fer-Crissakes Central Asia (which would be just as cold and inhospitable). The Japanese, never forced out of their isolation by Perry and teh Black Ships have inexplicably conquered most of Asia. Inexplicably until one remembers that Victorian England was gaga for its fellow Imperials safely half a world away. This book is simply self-indulgence of the worst sort. An unworthy effort by someone who is capable of so much better.
