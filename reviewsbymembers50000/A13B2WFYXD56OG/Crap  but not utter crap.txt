 ... I reserve that wording for really bad stuff.  Yang Jwing-Ming may know a lot about Chinese martial arts, but he demonstrates no knowledge whatsoever about self defense.   The criminal psychology part is abysmally ignorant - more like the villains in bad kung fu movies.  His advice is terrible. "Talk to your attacker" "Find out what sort of person he is." Give me a break. When the attack has started it's been past time to stop talking and start fighting long ago. Staying far away from the attacker is nice work if you can get it, but people who really want to do you won't stay at a gentlemanly range. And a larger attacker has a longer reach. Stay out at long range and he can hit you without you being able to hit him.   The technique is deadly. Deadly to the defender, that is. It's all very classic Chinese stuff out of wide, deep stances and relies on being extremely precise in a stress situation. It requires that you be significantly faster than the attacker. It assumes that one punch or kick will end the encounter. All of these are suicidal things to rely on.  He even, as G-d is my witness I'm not making this up, advocates taking off your shoes, putting them on your hands, and blocking a knife. Presumably the attacker will let you take time out to do all of this. Considering that all the other attacks involve the bad guy striking a pose with the knife or punch extended motionless at full range, I suppose this isn't much more of a stretch.   In short, this book is a complete waste of money if you are interested in protecting yourself. But there are worse ones out there (Simon's "Anti-Rape and Total Self-Defense", Storaska's disgusting and repellent "How to Say No to a Rapist and Survive", etc.), so it doesn't deserve the lowest possible rating.
