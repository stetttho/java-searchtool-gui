 I just can't understand why the reviewers here like this book so much. Character development is weak at best. The pacing is disjointed and jerky. The dialog is stilted. I can't remember who talked about "disbelief suspended by the neck until dead, dead, dead", but it seems appropriate here. Supernatural, quasi-natural and pseudo-scientific explanations are jumbled together without any thought or consistency. The villains are cardboard, but that's alright because everyone else is.  It's just a bad book overall. And it's not even frightening.  Customers should save their money and avoid this book
