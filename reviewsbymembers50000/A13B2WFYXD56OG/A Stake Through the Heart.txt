 Anyone who has read sci-fi and fantasy has run into one (or one hundred) too many bad Tolkien knock-offs. Usually the ones that have reviews on the back along the lines of "A bold new fantasy in the tradition of The Lord of the Rings".  This shambling undead corpus of lousy fantasy deserved a stake through the heart and garlic stuffing. Terry Pratchett provided this service to the quasi-McCaffery and pseudo-Lieber genre in the first two Discworld books. Mary Gentle does much the same to crappy Tolkien knock-offs with "Grunts". It dismembers the cliches, worries the carcass for a while, and buries what's left. The language is bawdy. The humor is often coarse. But it's funny as hell.
