 Ever since reading the purple prose and thin plotting of Bram Stoker's original book I had been looking for something that would give it the kicking it deserved. I found it in this movie. The undead monster is more human and more alive than the sadistic vampire-wannabe Van Helsing or the other feckless characters. And I mean that in a very good way. It has strong connections to Fred Saberhagen's pointed and entertaining book "The Dracula Tape", which everyone who liked the film should go out and read.
