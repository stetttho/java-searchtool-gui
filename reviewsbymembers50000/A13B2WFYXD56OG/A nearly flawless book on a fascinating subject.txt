 There have been plenty of how-to self defense books. Lots of pictures of techniques, lists of street-awareness skills, and recovery literature. This may be the first detailed treatment by an academic about what self-defense is what it does for the women who take it up, and why some people (including a disturbing number of feminists and government types) are so ambivalent about it.  Dr. McCaughey has done an excellent job of looking into the history of the self-defense movement, the philosophy behind it, and the people involved in it. She wasn't content to make grand pronouncements from behind her word processor. She went out, got involved in her subject, experienced it, and met the people who actually do what she writes about.  This book was written at least partially for an academic audience, so the general reader will have to wade through a little bit of jargon. The author leaves out a couple possibly useful points, and I do not agree with everything she says. But these are minor objections. The field of women's self defense finally has an inspirational scholar who treats it with the depth and seriousness it deserves.
