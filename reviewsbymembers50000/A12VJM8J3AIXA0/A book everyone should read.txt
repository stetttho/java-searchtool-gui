 Simply the best book I've read in a long time.  I actually held off reading this book when it first came out, thinking that the hype was just that: hype.  At the time I couldn't believe that some new book could be better than Jordan's WoT.  I was wrong.  I bought the Game of Thrones when the second book (Clash of Kings) came out in paperback, and after 100 pages I knew why everyone who reads this book loves it.  Martin effortlessly gives you a dozen characters that you may not love (some are revolting), but you understand them.  No character is "good" or "bad;" they are simply people, with private motivations, reasons, and prejudices.  Part of what makes these books so great is that the characters are not flawless.  Some likeable characters are blinded by thier pasts, or even thier sense of honor. Another thing about this book that is refreshing is the lack of "magic."  Not that the world is without any, it takes a major backseat in the plot.  Many stories today have the "magic-user" as some kind of god-on-earth, and rely on him/her to save the world by some miraculous display of magic that only they can perform.  This book has more to do with ruthless politicking than Messiahs. To wrap it up, BUY THIS BOOK! Not to lessen the greatness of Jordan, Goodkind, or any of the others...This series is on a different level.  I know that as you read this many of you're probably sceptical, like I was.  Just try A Game of Thrones, and at worst you'll be out a whooping 7.50.  More likely, you will be floored by this unique book.
