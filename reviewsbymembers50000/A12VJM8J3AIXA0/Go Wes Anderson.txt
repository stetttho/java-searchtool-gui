 There are very few movie makers who I geniunely like as much as Wes Anderson.  His movies are always a great combination of dark humor, cynicism, and heart touching warmth.  Life Aquatic is no exception to this; you are laughing out loud at the comments that Murray (as Zissou) makes, or are touched by the burgeoning relationship between Wilson and Blanchett.  What more is there to say?  Great cast, great director, good jokes, good times, and a good good ending.  Almost forgot to mention, Anderson is one of the rare people in this day and age who is not afraid to make his audience sad.  Has anyone else noticed that just about every movie nowadays gets a happy ending?  Wes Anderson, thank you for being unafraid of the audience, and making them (the audience) laugh and cry at the same time.
