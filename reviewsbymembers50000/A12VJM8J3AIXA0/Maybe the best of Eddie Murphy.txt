 This is one freaking hysterical movie,from start to finish.  The plot may be sort of tired; a bored prince leaves his family and money behind to try to find a true bride for himself (and where else would a prince find his future bride--in Queens.)  Nobody is buying this movie for the plot, this movie is all about Eddie, and the one and only time when Arsenio is funny.  I can't even write down most of the jokes from this movie, as the censors would ****** out every other word.  How about a few reminders of the funny scenes; McDowell's hamburgers, the three putzes in the barbershop, everything about the first time they see their apartment, any scene with James Earl Jones OR John Amos, and my personal favorite--won't you please put your hands together for Mr Randy Watson and his band SEXUAL CHOCOLATE. (tastes so fine, don't you agree...)  Buy the DVD, you'll love it.  I'd buy it on Amazon for certain, as practically no retailers carry it.
