 Lord of Chaos might very well be the summit of Jordan's wonderful WoT series.  The next couple of books after this sort of trail off, don't hold the reader as well as the books up to this do.  That being said, you can't help but read his books.  Not for nothing is Jordan the reigning king (along w/Martin) of fantasy epics.   I'm aware that there are many who critisize the series for its sometimes heavy-handed messages and dozen or so cast of major characters (my fav is Mat).  My response to these nay-sayers; try to find someone who has written as much as well as he has, in the time that he has done it.  It will be a very short list.   Jordan's great, the series (while very long) is great, and Lord of Chaos is also great.  (wait 'till the end, it is spectacular)
