 Man oh man, Tad Willimas is good!  I read The Dragonbone Chair about 10 or 11 years ago, and I still love it.  For starters, it is NOT a story that imitates others in the genre.  There are, it seems, many storis in the fantasy genre that echo Tolkien.  You know, dwarves are all aggresive and have axes, elves are all nature-loving magical bowmen, and humans are the brash and at times naive swordsmen.  Not so with Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn. (The trilogy that this book starts up.)  The people in the series are people, not an overinflated stereotype.  The story is well written (and dark, with a series of ups and downs that held my attention.  I've heard somewhere that Williams wrote this series to criticise the at times prejudicial images of Lord of the Rings.  (As in, anything that is black is bad, only white is good)  Maybe they are reading too much into the books, but I can't say that they're wrong.  What's more to say, try these books.  Amazon seems to have a hard time keping copies of the paperback edition---...
