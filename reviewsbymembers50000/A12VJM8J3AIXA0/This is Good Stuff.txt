 Let me start out the review by saying that Tad Williams is one the best writers in the genre.  This book (volume 1 from the Otherland series) is just great.  In what has become a fairly common procedure in Sci Fi/ Fantasy books, Williams presents the story from several different perspectives.  Usually when authors try this method of storytelling I end up with one or two "favorite" storylines.  I tend to burn through the parts I like less, looking forward to the sections with "my" characters.  Here's the thing, when I was reading this book (Actually, most of the tetralogy) I was looking forward to every section.  That's not a line, it's not like I'm selling these books, and I don't get paid to spout off my opinions.  I'm on a personal crusade to get more people to read Williams.  He deserves to be spoken of the same way people talk about Orson Scott Card and George Martin.  (He's done wonders in Sci Fi AND Fantasy.  see also The Dragonbone Chair)   The only problem that you may have with Otherland is that you are probably reading the book after seeing (or hearing about) The Matrix.  Let me make sure I write this correctly, Don't NOT read this book just because you saw The Matrix.  The Matrix is great, this is true; however, Otherland has a very different story...it's as much a mystery as Sci Fi.  Also, check the date, City of Golden Shadow predates a certain movie starring Keanu Reaves by several years. Wrapping this up, give the Otherland series a shot.  You may find a series of books that demonstrate the abilities of one of the best writers in the Sci Fi / Fantasy field.  At the least you'll....I don't know...have...have...a very large book...I guess.
