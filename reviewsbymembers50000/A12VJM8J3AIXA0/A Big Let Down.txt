 I personally refused to read anything concerning this book before I could get my hands on my own copy.  In the previous books I've stayed faithful, and have always found something in each book that was great. (Which was a stretch for Path of Daggers) Now I'm sort of wishing I had. It's not that Jordan has suddenly started writing in a different way than in his previous books.  The problem with this book is that it does not move forward the plot of the story a single iota.  Not one element of the plot is changed in a signifigant (or interesting) way.  Too much time is spent on Egwene and WAY too much centered on Elayne and the pointless succession of the throne.    I am not a serious literary critic, but I think that I've stumbled across Jordan's problem.  He seems to be focusing hundreds of pages (in his last few books) on unneeded details about the different cultures that populate his world.  Kind of like he re-read Tolkien, who did this effortlessly throughout all of his books, and is now trying to make up for this by explaining the exact rules that govern an Aes Sedei speaking to the Hall...and other such unwanted details.  Another thing I've noticed, he has started making jumps in plot as a substitute for describing action.  One second the Seanchan are just landing, now they are taking all of the southwest of the continent.  Did I miss a chapter in between? I'm not going to reveal too much about the events in the story, as they're pretty few and far between as it is.  I rated the story three stars simply because when Jordan does hit his stride (you can't go over 600 pages without hitting it once or twice) he shows why the series started so strongly: he can grab you when you wants to.   To wrap it all up, if I had it to do all over again I would have waited for the paperback.  It continues the story you may love, and you may be drooling to find out what happens, but you can wait a little while longer before you are disappointed.
