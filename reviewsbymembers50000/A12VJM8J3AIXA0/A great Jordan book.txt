 What a great book!  I haven't read through my Jordan books in a while, and for the last month or so I started them all over from the begining. For my money this is when Jordan really gets cooking, and for three books it looked like he was going to write something absolutely brilliant, original, and accessable.  This was going to be the series that Sci-Fi/Fantasy readers could read in public, and recommend to their non-Sci-Fi/Fantasy reading friends.  This is the start of the golden age of Jordan books...of course by the end of Crown of Swords the golden age had gone with a whimper, not a bang.  But that does not diminish the excellence that is Shadow Rising.  An awesome book, but it is an absolute must that you read the first three books before you tackle this one. (The first three are also very very good.)
