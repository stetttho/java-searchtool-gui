 For my money this is the best book that Pratchett has written in the Discworld series.  You get so many great elements added to the story: the alcoholic Vimes, Nobby and Colon, Carrot, the Patrician, Sybil Ramkin, and of course Errol the abnormal dragon. This book is a great place to pick up the Discworld series, if you haven't read any of the others don't feel threatened by it being the...like 9th book.  A whole new cast of characters is introduced along with the wonderful Ankh-Morpork.  It's more than just a comedy about a dragon running through the streets. (With Pratchett nothing is that easy.)  It has some serious commentary on Law and on human behavior.  I see Pratchett as a kind of teacher, who hides his lessons in his hugely entertaining stories. All that said, buy this book!!  I apologize for all of you who will read it and need to read the rest of the series as soon as possible.  It will cost you some money (he's got somewhere around 26 Discworld books alone) but you may end up thanking me.
