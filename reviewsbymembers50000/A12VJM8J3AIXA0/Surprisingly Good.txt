 Lots of people compare this movie with Minority Report.  Both are full of action, have big stars,....are now both on DVD.  Anyway, while I did enjoy Minority Report...lots...it's good, trust me, for my money I pick Bourne Identity as the better of the two.  You go into Minority Report with all kinds of baggage that Tom Cruise and Speilberg bring to any movie they make.  Bourne Identity makes no pretentions about the uber-movie it's going to be.  It's simply a fun movie to watch, with cool action scenes and a hot chick.  Try it out
