 I like M. Night Shyamalan's movies.  I confess that my review of the movie is going to be colored by this.  I thought that the movie was really suspenseful, and it kept me guessing until the end.  I've read some reviewers saying that this movie is corny, and has some obvious holes in the plot.  Well duh, there are very few movies of this kind that don't have gaps in logic, but sometimes you have to suspend your disbelief for an hour and a half and just enjoy a movie.  I think that the absolute best thing about this movie is what is not shown to you.  Shyamalan took a lesson from Hitchcock and shows that your mind does a much better job of scaring you than pouring gallons of blood across the screen.   As for the DVD extras, it is pretty standard fare.  Deleted scenes, interviews, and documentaries, nothing that I was super impressed with, but I haven't yet bought a DVD based upon the awesome documentaries that go with it. Buy this DVD is you are a fan of Shyamalan's movies.
