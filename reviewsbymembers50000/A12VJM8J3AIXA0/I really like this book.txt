 Going Postal is a fine example of why Terry Pratchett is my favorite living author.  This book brings a new character into the impossibly functional Ankh-Morpork.  Moist Lipwig is a natural in the Discworld multiverse, a con man forced by the Patrician to revive the long defunct post office.  As with any Pratchett there is a heck of a lot going on between the covers, among other things a commentary on corparate business practices and the lost art of letter writing.  Another nice thing about Going Postal is that it truely is a stand alone novel, so even if you've not read any other Pratchett books you will not get lost in it.  I don't want to reveal too much, so I'm just going to finish by recommending you to buy this book!
