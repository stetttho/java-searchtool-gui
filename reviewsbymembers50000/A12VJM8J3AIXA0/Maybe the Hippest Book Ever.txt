 There are only so many different ways that we reviewers can tell you, the potential buyers, how great a book or series is.  I remember, back in the day...several monthes ago...when I was the potential buyer reading reviews, and I thought to myself, "Self, you're cool, you've got a pretty good sense of humor, and you're at least...moderatly...intelligent.  Can all of these glowing reviews be serious?"  Yes they are.  It is now just under half a year since I bought The Color of Magic, I recently finished the 25th book in the series, and Pratchett still manages to hold my attention. What's so great about Pratchett?  It is not that he is simply funny; he's smart.  Most of his humor is, too.  Pratchett does not insult the intelligence of his audience by explaining his humor.  He assumes that you are going to get it, and he also assumes that you are going to understand any allusions he uses to make his books amusing. (i.e. Gormenghast, Faust, any Shakespearean play...)  His footnotes are more like short stories than references. Long story short: Pratchett is amazing, funny, smart, cool, entertaining, engaging,...er...a...ma..mammal,...and...ah...british.  Anyway, see what we are all gushing about, try a Pratchett book.
