 I don't think anyone is going to be reading this review who doesn't know what to expect from the Chappelle Show: Hip, edgy, and above all funny.  I bought the DVD (and man did I have to hunt through a lot of stores to find one) mostly because I had started watcing season 2, and wanted see what I had missed during the first season.   Let me say it plainly, the first season is AWESOME.  I own a lot of TV DVD collections, and within twenty minutes of popping this one in the DVD player my roommates all agreed that this was our new favorite DVD.  It's one of those DVDs that is so funny that you have to stop watching it at some point, because you're so worn out from laughing. Just to remind some of you who are on the fence about buying it, this season has; 1) The Player Haters Ball 2) The Black KKK Leader 3) The MAD Real World 4) Trading Spouses 5) What if Blacks Actually Got Reperations  6) and of course, Tyrone the Pipe-head giving an anti-drug lesson to first graders. Get this DVD, you'll love it
