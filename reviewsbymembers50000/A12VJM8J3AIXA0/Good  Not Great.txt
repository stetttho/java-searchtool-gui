 I suppose to be fair I should preface this by saying that I'm a registered Democrat, and I like Al Franken's sense of humor.  That being said, this is a good book.  Franken does not pull many punches, and takes more than a little glee in pointing out the gaffes that the right wing seems to make again and again.   The best parts of this book are him dealing with O'Reilly, Coulter, and Hannity.  His description of the encounters with O'Reilly honestly had me laughing out loud.  Also great is his chapter about Hannity and Colmes (and all of the Fox News crew).  Probably my least favorite part was the at times monotonous repitition that the media is not all liberal.  Franken goes on for a long time proving this point, and I felt that he made his point in one or two chapters, he didn't need six or seven. I gave this book 4 stars; Good, not great.  Good, worth buying in hardback, but not as good as Rush Limbaugh Is A Big Fat Idiot.  It is funny, he does back up his claims with evidence, but in some parts you're just wishing he'd get back to some of his hilarious stories.
