 I can't imagine somebody reading through these reviews who has never heard of Dune.  None of you have blindly found this page, because everyone knows the legend of Dune.  A book that is so strong that it has generated several movies (Well alright, one motion picture and at least two made for TV attempts.) and a legion of fanatical, nearly rabid, fans.   I'm writing this review for two crowds, those who've seen the movies and those who haven't read the book in years.  If you've only ever seen the movies you should be made aware that virtually chapters of details and backstory are cut out of the movies.  When I watch the Lynch movie version I'm left scratching my head, "OK, Paul's Muad'dib...but what does that MEAN?"  "What the heck is Choam?"  "Why do the they call Paul 'Usul'?"  "What is so signifigant about Alia being born a Reverend Mother?" "What's the deal with the Spacing Guild?" If you ever got confused in the movies READ THE BOOK!  There's a good reason everybody calls it a classic, it's just a good book.  If its been a while since you read the book I recommend you try it again, it's not a kids book.  You may find that you've forgotten why you like the book in the first place.  It's an great story with some very interesting ideas. Young or old, I recommend that you read this book.  If you at all were entertained by the movie, or can't remember exactly your favorite part of the story I'd suggest you get a copy of the book and give it a try.
