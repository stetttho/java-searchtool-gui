 Finally!  I've been waiting for Miller's Crossing to come out on DVD since the day I got my first DVD player.  I can't say enough good things about this movie.  Gabriel Byrne is a stoic button-man for the Irish mob in this Coen brothers classic.  He is placed in a series of comprimising circumstances that test his loyalties to his boss, his woman, and his honor.  John Turturro, ALbert Finney, and Jon Polito all play great supporting roles that really flesh out this unsung gem of a movie.  It is rare to find a "gangter" (not gangsta) film that has more to do with the characters than with planning out hits.  The closest comparison to Miller's Crossing that I can think of from recent years is Road to Perdition, but this movie does not have the at times over the top, "sons are put on Earth to trouble their fathers- I love you son" melodrama I tasted in that movie.  Miller's Crossing is more about Gabriel Byrne's quiet portrayal of a man who will do what he feels he must--at any cost to others or himself. Long story short, if you liked The Godfather movies, Road to Perdition, or Carlito's Way...full speed ahead, buy this movie.  If you are a fan of Coen brothers movies, and you're wondering if their early movies are as good as their later movies--yes, they are; give this one a try.
