 Ab Fab is one of the funniest TV shows ever produced.  This collection of the first three seasons is totally hysterical, and very much worth the somewhat high asking price.  I'll give a little bit of advice before buying---wait to see an episode or two before you plunk down the [$$] that Amazon is asking for it.  It is a British comedy, and as such is somewhat different from your average American sitcom.  Try to catch it on Comedy Central, who shows Ab Fab every now and again.  As far as DVD extras, the bonus DVD of "fabulous little things" is fun, and each DVD has about 15 minutes of outakes from each season.  My only real problem with the DVDs is the asking price--somewhere just below [$$] a season in this collection.  I'd shop around before buying--maybe your local [store] will be cheaper or have a sale....
