 Wow, this is some kind of great book!  I'm sure that as you look at most of these reviews you get the idea that this book is not like anything you've ever seen.  If that is the impression that you get, you are not that far off the truth.  Comparing it to anything else I've read is going to sound a little strange.   When I read these books I am reminded of a depleted future like some of Asimov's books, a quest a la Lord of the Rings, and...and...a sort of a moral journey like Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress.  A very strange combination, to be sure, but Wolfe makes it work.  The man writes like nobody else.  I don't see how Wolfe came up with the premise for the series, but it is off the creativity scale.  The books are set up as the journal of a former torturer, Severian, describing how he came to be the Autarch of his country.  Genius. I've read some reviews that put down Wolfe's series.  I don't get it.  I own up to the series being challenging; it is NOT light reading.  Anything being compared to Pilgrim's Progress is not going to be an easy read.  It may not be the lightest thing in the world, but it is well worth the journey if you just stop and think about what you are reading.  Part of the greatness of the book is that you need to analyze what it means to you. Anyway, I highly recommend the books to anyone willing to put forth the effort the books need to be appreciated.  Try it!
