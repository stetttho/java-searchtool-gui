 Royal Tenenbaums is great!  I just had to write a review after I found so many reviews panning the movie.  I love this movie so much, I can barely stand explaining why it's great.  How about the actors---What a spectacular cast.  I have trouble naming another movie with so many A list actors, all of them delivering great performances.  Not one actor steals the show, each character contributes to the whole. Let me address problems people may have with the movie.  Don't get this movie if you think you like Ben Stiller movies.  Don't get this movie if you think you like Bill Murray movies.  Don't get this movie if you like Owen Wilson action/humor type stuff.  This movie is a quirky, off kilter, weird, and at times dark comedy.   It's not really a movie that you can throw in and have a bundle of obvious laughs like Caddyshack or There's Something About Mary.  Expect something more like Rushmore, BottleRocket, or maybe Spinal Tap.  Most of the humor in the movie is not situational or physical--most of the humor is found in the weird dialogue.  Which means you have to really pay attention to what is being said or you'll miss everything. Anyway, I just thought that I'd tell you that not everybody dislikes this movie.  There are a lot of us cult followers who can rattle off whole minutes of the dialogue from The Royal Tenenbaums.
