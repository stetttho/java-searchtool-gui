 I hadn't listened to this symphony in close to thirty years (shame on me) and purchased the Kemplerer box set (all the symphonies plus the overtures). As other reviewers mentioned this is one of, if not the best interpretations of these works. I was originally looking for a recording I first heard during the early '70s which was particularly striking. In the last movement of the 1st, that version brought the string accompaniment for the transition to the "9th" theme to the fore, giving it an especially shimmering quality. I forget which version it was and have never been able to find it again. Kempeler does not, unfortunately, conduct that section the same way. However, in all other respects, it is a wonderful recording and belongs in any collection. By the way, I would be interested in hearing from anyone who could identify the other recording I am looking for (is it karajan, Walter or Boehm or someone else)?
