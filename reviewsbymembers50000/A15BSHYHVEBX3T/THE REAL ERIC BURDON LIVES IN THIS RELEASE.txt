 I read a review about this new CD in BLUES REVIEW and promptly picked it up and placed it in my car stereo. A couple of blocks from the local CD store, I pulled over to the curb and sat there mesmerized, I kid you not! Its all here, the simmering heat, growling Newcastle swagger, familiar blues hollar of ERIC BURDON. I'll admit at having lost touch with this artist over the past decades, viewing him as a former great artist who had descended into the "oldies circuit". Heck, I even decided not to check him out when he played a local venue. However, this CD is a return to his rightful place as a blues singer second to none. It seeps with New Orleans soul. Some of the cuts are reminiscent of the Neville Brothers, others of '70s era War. Under it all there is that primitive Chicago blues feel. Gone are the shredder guitars and synth effects which marred other recent performances. Here we have the sound of telecasters, horns, hammond organ, real percussion and sassy background vocals. Standout tracks are Wolf's 44, Muddy's 40 Days and 40 Nights, the title track and the hilariously rude second number (about a big %@#$). Put this album alongside the best he has ever recorded. Come to thing of it, the anumals version of Hooker's "I'm Mad Again" would have comfortably fit on this release. That's how good it is!! This album makes you realize that, out of all so-called brit invasion singers, Eric Burdon was the "MAN WITH A SOUL". INDEED!!! BUY THIS SUCKER NOW!!
