 A previous reviewer mentioned that the Dam Busters and Battle of Britain movies are not available. The Battle of Britain is available domestically. The Dam Busters is available via the Amazon.UK WEB site (I purchased it along with a number of other great Brit WW2 movies - The British DVD War Collection is particularly good). You must set your region code on your DVD equipment to read European DVDs. My solution was to set my PC DVD drive to read the European regional code. Both of these documentaties listed on Amazon (US) are OK as well.
