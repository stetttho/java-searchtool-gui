 This anthology type series was to the 1980s what Twilight Zone was to the 1950s. Its too bad it was not appreciated in its time. The episodes sparkle with that Speilberg magic. I especially remember the episode "The Mission" (in this set) about a bomber crew who has to trust in faith to get its trapped ball turret gunner home safely. I certainly intend to pick it up...and you should too.
