 Great black and white footage of the classic SDG, including the Winwood brothers, Pete York and Spencer Davis. its worth the price of admission to see these rare shots of Stevie Winwood in his prime, including his singing, organ AND guitar playing (his use of a white strat is reported as a motivation for Clapton moving to that instrument). The DVD also reminds viewers of the blues roots of the Spencer Davis Group. The reason I gave this a four star rating is because the songs include the annoying lyrics of each song written in German at the bottom of the screen as they are performed (taken from a filmed German performance). A real drag, blemishing an otherwise wonderful DVD. The second part of the DVD is a documentary focusing on the first of a number of post Winwood brothers versions of the band. I regret that the version shown did not include the guitarist Ray Fenwick (I saw that lineup in the late sixties). He is a great unheralded (in America) British blues-rock guitarist. It is a curiosity why the Spencer Davis Group never rose in popularity in America beyond their two major hits (I'm a Man and Gimme Some Lovin). This DVD reveals some of the reasons why that neglect is unjust. My recommendation on this one is to purchase it for the content BUT ONLY IF you can stand the irritating lyrics text on the screen. Hey, why did they not edit that out in the digital remaster??!!? A shame!
