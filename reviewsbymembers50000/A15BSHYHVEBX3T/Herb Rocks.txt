 This is a DVD version of Herbert Von Karajan's great late '60s early '70s Beethoven cycle. Many of you must have purchased the original audio recordings when they were released by DG on Vinyl back then. They remain, to my ears, absolutely the best interpretations of this repetoire. I've been watching a symphony a day for the last week and they meet or surpass all expectations. The audio is crystal clear, brassy horns, piercing winds, deep resonant cellos and basses and shimmering strings. The video sets retain a bare bones "classic" almost Greek like feel, befitting early 1800s music. However, the subtle, creative use of video is very effective (the horns in the Eroica and the use of light at the climax of the 9th come to mind). Herbert Von Karajan was one of the best, if not the greatest, conductors of Beethoven. It is a treat to see his conducting style at work, the sheer strength of feeling, combined with traditional German reserve and hidden fragility of feeling. Much has been said about Karajan's clouded association with the Nazis. That being said, it does not take one iota from his talent as a great conductor. This is perhaps the best digital recording you will ever see of these works (Yes, Karajan was a pioneer of digital recording). Put aside the politics and enjoy one heck of a ride. Here's a bit of trivia. During the '70s I briefly visited Vienna. Young musicians in America sometimes carry pictures of rock star heroes in their wallets. I remember seeing a young teenaged violinist. Guess whose picture SHE had in HER wallet? You guessed it. None other than Herbert himself! LUDWIG VAN RULES AND OLD HERB LIVES ON IN DVD AS HIS CONDUCTOR!! Enjoy!!
