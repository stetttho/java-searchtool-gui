 I haven't even seen this set and am primed to get it!! A great afternoon adventure series from the '50s finally comes to DVD!! There have been some cheap single episode DVDs circulating with questionable video/audio quality. If this set compares well with the Superman sets, it will definitely be worth the purchase. NOW!! When will the Rin Tin Tin series be released? (YOOO RINNYY!!!)
