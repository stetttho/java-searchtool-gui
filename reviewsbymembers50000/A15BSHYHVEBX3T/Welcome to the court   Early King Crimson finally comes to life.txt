 WOW!!!!!!!!!!!If there were more than 5 stars, this DVD rates it. I missed this band when they played the Middle East in Boston last year. On viewing this DVD, anyone who caught their recent tours were in for a treat. For those of you who are fans of the early King Crimson, this band is arguably more King Crimson than the current group of that name. Comprised of the Giles brothers, Ian Macdonald, Mel Collins and Jakko Jakszyk on guitar and vocals, the group literally brings the first Crimson albums to life on the stage. Some of these members (most, in fact) were part of the original Crimson, so, this is NOT a "tribute" band, but the real thing (check out the double mellotron effects and twin sax solos). The new vocalist/guitarist does sound like Greg Lake and Robert Fripp on their respective instruments. The whole mood of this concert reeks of early King Crimson (in fact they perform all of the first album (apart from Moonchild). It is great to hear AND SEE live versions of those works, as well as gems like "Ladies of the Road" and "Let there be light". The sound quality is supberb, the playing even better, and the experience incomparable. There hasn't been a Crimson DVD in recent years with as much impact. One listen to live versions of "The Court of the Crimson King", "Epipath" and the classic "21st Century Schizoid Man" will confirm to you that this is a keeper DVD. Enjoy your trip into the iconoclastic King Crimson as it was originally invisioned.
