 This third album is, in my opinion, where it all comes together for this band, the acoustic and electric playing, great song selections and production (due in part because its the first studio album, the other two being live efforts). It also has more polish (which in this case is a positive, although I love the first two albums as well). If you "were there" in the early '70s, you know all about this album (either from purchasing it or hearing it at innumerable house parties). If you are unaware of this album, then check it out, as it is one of the few instances where you will get a genuine sense of a time when young musicians sincerely attempted to explore the blues. What a revelation this gumbo of finger picking delta blues, "thunderous" bass, four on the floor percussion and ragtime violin is (Papa John Creach is worth the price of admission alone). All provided within a haze of post '60s San Francisco psychedelia. This band, to my mind, was hands and feet over the Airplane, and, in many respects, more earthy than the Dead. All young musicians should listen to these fine players to catch a glimpse of one of the true originating forces behind the modern "jam-roots-rock" movement. Rag-time-deluxe!!
