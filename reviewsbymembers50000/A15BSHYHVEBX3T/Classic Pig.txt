 This is a great Cd and a good companion to the Tull "Living in the Past" compilation released a couple of years ago. I just purchased it yesterday and, so far, have only listened to a few cuts. The "This Was" remake is interesting for many reasons, not the least being the fine playing (in my opinion it measures quite well with the original). In fact, the title of the album "This Was" completely fits the re-recording. The other album is a nice mix of reworked Pig originals and blues standards. I have not seen the DVD, but, understand it does not have recorded performances, only an interview (a shame, reflected in the 4, not 5 star rating). Not withstanding this "possible" disappointment, the set confirms Mick Abrahams as one of the great, if often unheralded (at least over here) British blues players. Well done Mick!!
