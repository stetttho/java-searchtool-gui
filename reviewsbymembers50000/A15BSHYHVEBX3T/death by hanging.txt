 Inspired by the Brit film "Cockoshell Heroes", the Dirty Dozen is the template from which all other "social deviant soldiers as heros" movies were made through the late 60s to the 80s. Its worth the purchase just to see Donald Sutherland as a general (watch the idiotic band leader). This stuff has been done to death, but the original still is the best and worth the watch. A great combination of humor, drama and grissily violence! Lee Marvin excelled in this kind of role. One problem: where did they get all the ammo? The last 15 minutes has so much shooting that a dozen men would have had to lug a whole ammo dump to carry it out. A film for those who like their grenades "nice and gassy"!! (:-).
