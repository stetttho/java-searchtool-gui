 As the son of a flier who flew two tours in Halifax bombers during the offensive against Germany, I must say that a book taking this position is long overdue. War is a terrible, but necessary undertaking to protect civilized society from barbarians, whether it is the Nazis or the fanatical Islamic terrorists we are experiencing today. Any book which sets the record straight to counter all the left wing propaganda which attempts to paint allied fliers as murders is welcome. May garbage like the C.B.C.'s "Valor and the Horror" eventually be forgotten. These men deserve to be remembered with honor and respect. Thanks for writing this book.
