 Halleujah!! What a great series!! I just purchased "White heat" and am now going for the entire collection. White Heat alone is worth the purchase. Just one question, wasn't the ending of "White heat" reprised in the '50s shocker "The Hideous Sun Demon"? You will also notice some great bit players in the movie. For instance, the driver of the gas truck at the end was the same actor who played the arch villian in "High Noon". Great collection of "bad guys"!!
