 This film, I believe made for TV, was made around the same time as Gettysberg (film adaptation of the Killer Angels). It parallels that film in many respects (Sam Elliot in both films, for instance). Full of adventure, action and idealism, it tells the story of America's expedition to Cuba during the Spanish American War. The cast includes roles playing the parts of Roosevelt (Berenger, who virtually transforms himself and should have won an emmy for the part), Stephen Crane and Randolph Hearst. The only down note is Gary Busey, who portrays a "hollywood liberal charicature" of a southerner. other than that, it is an excellent film, climaxing in the charge up San Juan Hill. I will be purchasing this the day it is released! You should too!!
