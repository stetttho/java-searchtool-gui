 This is the strongest DVD I have seen of this band (and I have most of the other releases). They have returned to the sound and instrumentation of their halycon days on this release. The group has been strengthened by the addition of several new players (the two female voices a real plus). Two standout tracks which make this set a "must have" are 1. The Actor: a beautiful gem from the Lost Chord album and 2. Higher and Higher: I just love Graeme Edge when he goes "over the edge" - turning this cut into some sort of psychedelic/celtic swami meets Lord Buckley rave up! A real hoot!! All the hits are here. Great sound and video. My recommendation: buy it!!
