 I am inspired to write this review based on another reviewer's comment about breaking beer classes in Uncle Sam's Blues. Its a testament to this album that a whole cult following developed around this record when it came out. Far better than the airplane itself, Tuna was a true experiment of two musicians who formed the group just to play the music they wanted unfettered by commercialism. I could go on, but enough to say that Jorma and Jack were the two best musicians of the airplane. Jack had played with James Brown and Roy Buchanan and Jorma was an accomplished student of the Rev Gary Davis school of blues finger picking. These were no "Berkley folk rockers".  Don't forget the atmospheric harmonica of Will Scarlett. This album is a recording of three hippie musicians getting together to play some great blues tinged acoustic music (when that was a unique fresh thing to do). It is also a GREAT RECORDING which stands tall alongside great vintage recordings such as the field recordings made by Alan Lomax and others. Bottom line: do yourself a favor (don't give yourself any "Hesitation Blues") and buy this album. It remains one of my all time favourites. Buy it and it will be one of your favourites too!
