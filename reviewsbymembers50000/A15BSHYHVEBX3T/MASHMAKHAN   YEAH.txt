 This great DVD has lots of great footage, including Buddy Guy playing a killer version of MONEY. However, the best treat is rare footage of MASHMAKHAN, one of the great (unfortunately mostly unknown outside of Canada) bands of the 60s. I only wish they would have included video versions of "Days when we are free" or their magnum opus "Mr. Tree". Wonderful players!!
