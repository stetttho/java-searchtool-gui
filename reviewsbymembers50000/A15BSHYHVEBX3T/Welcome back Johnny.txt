 I remember 30 years ago a friend said that Pablo Casals should have stopped playing when he began slowing down and losing his edge. I have read similar things about this current Johnny Winter release. That is the wrong conclusion. Yes, he has slowed down and his voice has perhaps lost some of the youthful edge. I must admit that I was initially dissapointed on first listening. But, if you give it another listen, you will hear a voice singing and guitar playing with maturity and authority. Johnny truely is a great bluesman and his current music should be appreciated for what it is. If he were an unknown artist, this recording would rank 4 stars. That's what I am recommending.
