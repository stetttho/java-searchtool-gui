 Jimmy Vivino is perhaps the finest guitar player working on the east coast today. I caught the Rekooperators this past summer in Lowell Mass for their tribute to Mike Bloomfield concert. Any guitarist who can cop Bloomfield's feel is....well, you get my drift. All the players in this group are first rate. I've asked my local record store to put aside a copy for me. Can't wait to put the disk in the player and hear Al sing..."if I was president of General Motors, Man....." FINE, FINE STUFF!!!
