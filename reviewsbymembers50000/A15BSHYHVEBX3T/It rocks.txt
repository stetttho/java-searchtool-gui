 Michael Schenker is one of the great guitarists in the so-called "metal" genre (I prefer the term hard rock). This DVD provides good insight into why he deserves that recognition. Chock full of great songs and tasteful playing, this DVD is a wonderful introduction to this player. Of interest to guitarists is the fact that, like Leslie West, most of his licks are performed by using only his first three fretting fingers. I disagree with other reviews about the quality of the recording (however after 50 plus years of listening to loud music, my ears are probably not the best judge of sound quality). As for the band: that bass player is quite a whirly-guy isn't he?!! Ha! Ha! All the players are first rate. This DVD is on my regular rotation at my daily workout treadmill station. Do yourself a favor and buy this one!!
