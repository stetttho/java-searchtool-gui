 It is wonderful to finally see these films released in the USA. Two years ago, I purchased the British release on Amazon.UK. That set included the Colditz Story, Dam Busters, Cruel Sea and Ice Cold in Alex. That last film is a fantastic story starring stalwarts John Mills and Anthony Quale (as a Nazi). Too bad its not included in this set. The Dam Busters, Colditz Story and Cruel Sea are three of the best war films ever made, hands down. The British style of reduced action in favor of increased drama make the atmospherics really shine. "Went the day well" was a wonderful surprise. I suspect that someone involved in the '70s film "The Eagle has landed" must have seen "Went the day well". "The ship that died in shame" added a film noirish change of pace to the set, with Richard Attenbourgh (Herr Bartlett in The great Escape) as the heavy. These are "must have" DVDs. All five films remind us in this politically correct era that World War 2 truly was a struggle of good vrs evil. YES, BOMBER COMMAND WERE THE GOOD GUYS!! There is something about these black and white works (Ealing studios films in particular), that evoke a near documentary sense of realism. And...the acting is first rate. If only they would release other vintage Brit films over here, such as "Reach for the sky", "Hunt for the Graf Spee", "Beneath the Waves" and "Scott of the Antarctic". Any fan of war films must purchase the British War Collection" as a foundation set within his/her collection!!
