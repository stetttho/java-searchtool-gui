 I'm so sorry to hear about Elvin's recent misfortune, I was not aware of that. I had the opportunity to meet him when he was playing during the early 80s and one could not meet a more gracious performer. I saw this disk last week and, based on his playing in the Butterfield band (I know it was 40 years ago, but...it was East/West for cryin' out loud)I immediately picked it up. Its been playing constantly on my car CD machine ever since. He managed to achieve, on some songs, the vocal and gritty guitar sound of those early recordings reminicent of Guitar Slim and John Lee Hooker. A particular standout is "Blues Train". Wonderful jazzy riffs and nasty backup vocals. He's back with a strong album and its great to see!! Good one, Elvin!
