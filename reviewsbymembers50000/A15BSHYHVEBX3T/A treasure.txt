 The best way to gain insight into a musician's work is to learn to play it yourself. Although no one can duplicate the "magical something" which set Hendrix, arguable the greatest blues guitarist ever, apart, this wonderful DVD goes a long way in exploring the physical technique he used. Grab a strat, crank your marshall on 10, drop the DVD into the player and "bow down before a master". Essential educational material for any guitarist interested in the Hendrix canon.
