 I second the opinion of the vet who wrote the review below. Americans need to support our brave troops overseas instead of abusing their reputations in the name of "entertainment". Like the "Stealth" movie just released, this series provides "action" for us dumb middle-Americans while inserting a healthy dose of anti-americanism for the armchair liberal set. For those people, every war is a retake on Vietnam. If you enjoyed Jane Fonda's vision of Vietnam, you'll like this program. I can't wait to see the episodes where an American soldier experiences guilt over having killed civilians or we are given a sympathetic view of a terrorist. The rich entertainment class just doesn't get it. Boycott this product.
