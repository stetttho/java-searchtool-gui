 What a singer!! The first cut "Its a happening thing" blew my mind (pardon the '60s lingo, but it fits). I remember the name "Peanut Butter Conspiracy" but hadn't heard them. The female lead singer, Barbara "Sandi" Robison, in my opinion, was better than either Grace Slick, Mama Cass or Spanky McFarlane (no kidding). They sound like Surrealistic Pillow era JA minus the hype and hits. Kind of like a modern alternative band performing this type of music. One can only imagine their power in a live setting. If you like jangly Rickenbacker guitars, tasteful harmonies and a rich soulful lead vocalist, you gotta have this one. I hear the singer tragically passed away during the '80s. A real drag. Her legacy, however, lives on in these cuts. Buy it!!
