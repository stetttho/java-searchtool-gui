 I'm giving this 3 stars because I am a long time fan of leslie, Corky and Mountain and in spite of the hack video and sound job the playing is superb, particularly leslie (love the Gibson SG). The Cream tribute was fine. However the sound is unlistenable. I tried to watch it using earphones and the mix fade ins and outs were so horrible I had to stop (particularly on the bonus cut "Blood of the Sun"). I assume that was the concert's opening number? The first song on the DVD was "Never in my life" (begun halfway through the guitar intro). Nice. Whoever put this together was either some hiphop edit freak or an art college student stoned on qualudes. The last DVD by them had some video problems  as well (my copy only)? Mountain remains a great band and deserve more than this. However, Leslie if you are listening, fire the poof tarts who are responsible for the video. Bottom line, if you are a "completist" Leslie West fan, you probably should get it. Otherwise pass on it and wait until they release a DVD truly worthy of this great band.
