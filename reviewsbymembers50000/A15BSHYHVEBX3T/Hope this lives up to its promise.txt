 The first set in this series (the first two Butterfield albums) were fantastic recordings, cleaned up, high fidelity versions far superior to earlier CD releases of those albums. You could clearly hear all instruments, particularly the keyboards and fine separation of Elvin Bishop's and Mike Bloomfield's guitars. This second two/fer holds much promise. Although lesser known than the first incarnation of the Butterfield band, this group, along with Bloomfield's Electric Flag and Al Kooper's BS&T, were watershed albums in the "horns & blues rock" movement (an event which is not fully appreciated 40 odd years later). If the quality of this recording matches volume 1 in this set, by all means sell your previous copies of the CDs and purchase it. Mine is on order and I'm keeping my fingers crossed for a delightful aural experience!
