 Oliver Stone has made a career out of beserching honorable people he does not agree with and inventing drama where none exists. In the case of Alexander, there is a wealth of potential for a wonderful epic. However, Stone, ever the Hollywood liberal, turns it into an expose on the gay lifestyle. Who cares if Alexander was gay, or if he had a complicated relationship with his mother. The fact is, he was one of the greatest warriors and military strategists of all time. However, in this version, all that is incidental to his relationship with his boyfriend. If David Lean were alive, THEN, we would have seen an epic of epic proportions. His portrayal of Lawrence of Arabia (a character similar to Alexander in many respects) portrayed the complexity of his character, including allusions to his sexuality, with class and in line with the overall storyline. However, Lean was a great film maker. Oliver Stone is many things, but, a great film maker? Me thinks not!!
