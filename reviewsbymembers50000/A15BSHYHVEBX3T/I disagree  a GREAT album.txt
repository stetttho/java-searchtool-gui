 I respectfully disagree with another reviewer about the dubious quality of "Doing that scrapyard thing" and "What a bringdown". Scrapyard is one of my favourite Cream songs, a classic '60s Monty Pythonesque music hall jaunt reminiscent of Beatles offerings like "Lady Madonna". Great leslie enhanced guitar on this one. Is that Felix Papallardi on keyboards? What a bringdown is a great Baker(?) song. The bridge is classic Jack on vocals. In fact the three studio songs were at the time considered on a par with each other (Badge, of course, gaining wide popularity over time). The lack of soloing on Scrapyard and Bringdown give an indication of perhaps a more ensemble approach which could have developed (ala the Band or Traffic).  The politician and sitting on top versions on this album are outstanding, as is I'm so glad. On comparing this album with Wheels of Fire, the studio cuts are certainly on a par with the lesser heard wheels titles and the live cuts are far more enduring than Toad (unless you're a percussionist). I have fond memories of this album, as I'm sure many others do as well. It marked the poignancy of their breakup as a band. It also pointed to possible new, and unfortunately unrealized within that group, directions. Goodbye was, in fact, a nice bridge (bridge not badge) between Wheels of Fire and the Blind Faith album. Let's hope we hear more of Cream in the future.
