 Much of what I could contribute has already been said about this DVD. The editors even had Clapton change from a 335 to a Firebird in the middle of a solo. I knew he was good, but seriously folks!! In spite of all the drawbacks, it is the most complete record we have of a Cream concert in a large venue. However, there is room for hope! PLEASE, if anyone out there with the wherewithall will listen. Please record all nights of the upcoming Albert Hall series of concerts and release a box DVD set including every performance, plus rehearsal footage in a pristine, unaltered form using state of the art recording equipment!! This is the one and only way out of this disaster. What do you say? we're listening.........and waiting...and listening.
