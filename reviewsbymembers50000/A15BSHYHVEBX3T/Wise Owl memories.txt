 This is just a great book!! I heard about its release and had it mailed from Nove Scotia to me here in New Hampshire. It is so good, in fact, that I poured through it in one sitting over the weekend. Chock full of stories from the road, many in the words of Dutch himself, this book provides a character study rather than a historical review of arguably Canada's greatest bluesman. Dutch Mason is truly one of the most original performers ever produced by Canada, and, is one of the world's great unheralded primitive guitar players (primitive in the best sense of the word). Almost single handed, Dutch Mason developed the distinctive "East Coast" blues sound. The stories from the road, while magnifying his "larger than life" persona, also thankfully look beyond to the real man himself. Dutch's great feat, beyond his dedication and talent for the blues, was that of a great band leader. From the classic lineup of the 70s and 80s to his current band of younger players, Barry, A.J. and Carter, Dutch has habitually surrounded himself with the best Maritime musicians. I'm sure any of them would tell you that playing with Dutch has been a high point of their career. Reading this book brings back memories of smokey nights at the Wise Owl or Sullivan's. For anyone out there wondering what the Dutch Mason legend is about, this is where to start. Perhaps it could have focused more on Dutch's musical influences and his playing (the next book)? Thanks for the music, Dutch!
