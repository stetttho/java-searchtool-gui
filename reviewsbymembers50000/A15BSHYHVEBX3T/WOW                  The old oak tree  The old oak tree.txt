 I remember as a toddler my father waking me up in the middle of the night (probably 9:00 PM), and bringing me down to see this during the 1950s. The British in their red coats and the idealistic Americans. Just the type of patriotic stuff to combat all the anti-American trash (including the latest installment of Star Wars) being pumped out of Hollywood. For a country at war, THIS is the type of film we should be showing our children. Not some United Nations gollbigook they are currently being fed. Freedom IS worth fighting for!!
