 This is one of the most intense twisted films I have ever seen. Endless scenes of atomic bomb explosions. Try playing this one at some psychedelic den during the '60s with all the guests stoned out of their minds. Me thinks not!!! Especially intriguing is the shot of "the most powerful bomb ever exploded". The background music (sounds like Verdi's requiem mass) adds a nice armageddon touch. Especially heart warming is the scene of military types sitting in lawn chairs, shirtless and in bathing trunks drinking beer, sporting lead glasses, waiting for the next fireworks exhibition off bikini atoll. To top it off, the narration is by none other than "WILLIAM SHATNER". The opportunity to listen to "old Captain Bill" narrate an atom bomb test is worth the price of admission alone!! Seriously, this is a great gift for your loved one to find under the Christmas tree. Oh! Atom Bomb! Oh! Atom Bomb!
