 This album brings back memories. I remember first hearing "I shot the sheriff" in a bar and immediately thinking that EC had "sold out" by moving beyond his 'guitar hero" image. How wrong I was!! This is a great album that easily has worn the test of time. The band is arguably Clapton's best of his solo units (and there IS plenty of great guitar work). It is, in a way, a cross between the D&TD album and his first solo effort. During ECs tenure in Blind Faith, he became passionately interested in the music of the Band. This influence is evident here in the ensemble playing, shared vocal chores, economical guitar playing and the deadened drum sounds. However, ECs strong musical personality makes the album his own. Great original songwriting and an excellent choice of covers. The live material is a wonderful treat. It is great to hear those renditions finally on a legit release. For those of you interested, THIS IS WHERE CLAPTON'S SOLO CAREER REALLY BEGINS TO COOK. Long may he live!!!!
