 It is getting a bit tedious how every singer in the world has come out with a stripped down blues album over the past 10 years or so ("From the Cradle" copycats). However, this offering is a pleasant change. Accompanied only by himself on guitar and an occasional percussion, Dion lays it down with an impassioned, authentically felt, delivery of these blues standards. Highlights include Howlin' Wolf's "Built for Comfort" (a great version covered by Wolf himself on the London Sessions album) and "Who Do You Love" (apart from Ronnie Hawkins' "Last Waltz" version, perhaps the best rendition you will hear, seriously. Picture this: stride into some dingy New York club, sit down with a beer and slowly become mesmerized by a lone unknown singer on the smokey stage delivering some of the best stripped down blues you ever heard. At the end of the set, he introduces himself as Dion. You promptly fall over in surprise. That's the effect of this album. Walk, no run, out and get this one!!
