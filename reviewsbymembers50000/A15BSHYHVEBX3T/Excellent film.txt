 I disagree with a previous viewer. I remember seeing this film when it first came out. It was produced by one of the producers of the James Bond films,Harry Saltzman, and director Guy Hamilton,so you are assured of plenty of action (it also is quite acurate and is a fitting tribute to the Brits in their "finest hour"). The cast of Olivier, Caine and other fine British actors give this film an extra sheen and realism. It is in the mould of many '60s films about the second world war in that it approaches the topic by following a variety of people in their various roles (air marshalls, pilots, ground crew, civilians) through the summer months of 1940 during the battle. It does this very well. Of interest to flying buffs are the authentic Hurricane and Messerschmit fighters and HE111 bombers (from the Spanish air force), The visual experience of the movie is stunning, and, like the Great Escape and other war movies of that vintage, exciting and entertaining to watch. One scene stands out: a German flier parachutes into a British hay field and politely goes up to the British farmer, bows and says "Goot Afternoon". The Brit brings up his pitchfork and exclaims, "You posh Bas...., up with your arms, up with them!!" Unforgettable!! I currently have a copy of the original DVD when it came out a few years ago and will certainly purchase the extended cut version. I recommend this film without hesitation.
