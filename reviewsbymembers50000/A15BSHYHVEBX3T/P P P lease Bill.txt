 Perhaps a hundred years from now nobody will have heard of an ancient TV series called "STAR TREK". However, there will be a huge cult following over a TV character called "T.J. HOOKER". All I want to know is...when will Bill Shatner do a version of "Please Mr. Custer, I don't want to go...". In its place, perhaps a CD version of his immortal take on "Rocketman".
