 This is a wonderful DVD. I had the opportunity to see this tour in Boston last October and was waiting for this DVD release. Brian was superb, as was his great band. It is a miracle that we get to hear this work after all these years, and performed so well!! For you exercise enthusiasts, it is, surprisingly a great workout DVD (it has just entered my treadmill rotation). The second DVD in the set (documentary) is also a gem. The footage of Brian meeting Paul McCartney and shots of George Martin (and others in the audience)listening to the history making first performance are worth the price of admission alone. The rehearsal shots, including Brian's gradual development of interest in participating in the project is also interesting. Great video and audio. The cabin essence of a holiday which provides good vibrations for all of you fellow vegetables out there. A real triumph Brian!! We're all moved by finally having the opportunity to see and hear "smile"! Thanks!!
