 I'm an older player who grew up on Clapton, Martin Barre and all those other pre-SRV (mostly British) blues rock players. I saw Joe's band open for Tull a few years back (they were wonderful! Who is this guy who has the audacity of performing A New Day Yesterday when opening for Tull!). I've been an avid collector of his work ever since. Just purchased this DVD yesterday and, on first viewing the picture and sound looks fine. My fav songs, "New Day..." and the Blind Faith number "Had to Cry Today" rock big time. it is gratifying to see younger players take up the flame of this fine tradition of playing. If all you young players want to catch a small glimpse of blues rock as it was played in the golden age, played by a fine musician your own age, skip the boring SRV wannabes and check out Joe's DVD! It will be a great learning experience.
