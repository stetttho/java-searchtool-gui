 I saw Rostropovich perform all six suites in Vienna during the mid-70s at the time he initially moved to the west. It was the first time he performed all six in one sitting. I also met the man after the concert, truly one of the greatest musical evenings I ever experienced. This man, a giant of his craft, makes these suites "sing". The recording was made inside a cathedral and to my eyes and ears, gets the visual and aural tone just right. These pieces are arguable at the apex of western music. The soloist quality of the performance is also an excellent entry point for anyone, particularly those with a jazz background, who want to "get into" classical music. "Slava" is at the top of his game in these recordings. A total must have for any DVD collection. Next stop: check out Rostropovich's CD interpretation of the Britten suites or Jacqueline DuPre's DVD of the Elgar Concerto. Cello heaven!!
