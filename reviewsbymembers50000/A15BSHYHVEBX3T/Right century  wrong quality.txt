 its a treat to see this H.G. Wells classic presented as it was meant: 19th century England fighting Martians. However, the jerkiness of the DVD transfer (missing frames, poor frame rate...whatever) makes it unwatchable. A pity as the design of the martians and their huge walkers was very creative in this version. Let's hope its re-released on a higher quality pressing.
