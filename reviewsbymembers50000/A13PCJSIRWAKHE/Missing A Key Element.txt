 Don't get me wrong, this is a charming story of Snoopy finding his original owner. Kids love it, but what is missing to me is the genius of Vince Guaraldi. The music here is quite dated, unlike Guaraldi's masterpieces. If you don't think music can make a difference, watch this after "A Charlie Brown Christmas" and you'll see what I mean. Otherwise an enjoyable tape which seems a to have a bit of filler to complete the 80 minutes of time. Good for kids and hardcore Peanuts fans.
