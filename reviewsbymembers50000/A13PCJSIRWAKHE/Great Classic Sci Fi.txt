 When the 2002 remake came out, I read all the reviews for it - and was shocked to see so many critics make fun of this movie. This gets shown on TV all the time - not bad for a 40+ year old movie. That's because it's a great story. I imagine people seeing this movie in 1960 must have been blown away by the special effects. Sure, they pale in comparison to what is done today, but that's not a fair way to judge them. It's worth many viewings...
