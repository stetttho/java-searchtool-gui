 I agree with everything the other reviewers have said about this game's good points, but it has one HUGE issue... this game is REALLY short. My 4-year-old son finished it in less than an hour on Christmas Day. That's it? He enjoyed it enough to play it over again several times, but I felt cheated. The pictures you see on the box are pretty much the entire game. I think there are less than 20 areas, some of which only take a couple of minutes to get through. As good as the game is, it hardly seems worth the money. I suggest going to the Big Idea website for some FREE Veggie Tales games instead. My son still spends more time on that website than on this game.
