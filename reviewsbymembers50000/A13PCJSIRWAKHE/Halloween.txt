 First I'll say my kids like this video. That's most important. There are a couple of strange things about it that I noticed. First, neither the packaging nor anything in the story indicate it - but the title on screen says "Halloween is Grinch Night" and you never see a reference to Halloween again. The date on the box is 1971, while at the end of the movie it is 1977. The music is painfully forgettable. Hans Conreid is a decent substitute as the voice of the Grinch.
