 I understand there are many sentimental parents and grandparents who treasure this movie. Well a 3 year old doesn't care about that; they just want to be entertained. With that as my only criteria, I have to give this 3 stars. The movie is rather slow paced compared to what kids are used to. And there are those now politically incorrect moments, too (specifically racial overtones). They don't bother me, but they could bother some people. We all agree it's a classic, but I doubt all of our kids would.
