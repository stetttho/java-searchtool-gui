 I cannot elaborate on all of the incredible reviews here about this timeless classic. Kids love it. I just wonder if Disney will pull a "Peter Pan" on us and release a BETTER version of the DVD in the future. There is basically no bonus material except for the trailer here. Peter Pan's first DVD release was similar until they re-released it with much more bonus material in conjuntion with "Return to Neverland."
