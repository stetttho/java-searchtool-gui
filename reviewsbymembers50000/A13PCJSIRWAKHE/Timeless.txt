 The reissue doesn't add anything to the original, however if you don't own it, consider buying it. In my opinion, the "hits" not even as good as the other songs. "The Working Hour" is an exquisite piece of music, full of passion. The silky sax intro leads into a huge soundscape, topped by gripping and emotional vocals. It is still chilling when I hear it today. The REST of this recording is great. Other cuts of interest are "Listen" which crosses many genres, and is a more of a hypnotic chant than synth-pop tune. Certainly one of the finest recordings of the 1980s.
