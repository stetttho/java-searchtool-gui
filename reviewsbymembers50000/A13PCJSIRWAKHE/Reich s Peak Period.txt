 There are 3 tracks on this CD. Forget "Violin Phase" which really is just filler, and from an earlier era in Reich's development. The other two tracks are what you want to hear. "Octet" and "Music for a Large Ensemble" are Steve Reich at his very finest. He had developed his sound, but was still relatively young and hungry for success. You will listen to this music in complete amazement that these are classic acoustic instruments. The trick in making them sound so unique is in brilliant compositions heard here.
