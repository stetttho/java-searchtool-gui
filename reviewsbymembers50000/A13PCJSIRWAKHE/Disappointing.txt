 I remember when the previews came out, it looked like an amazing movie. When I went to see it in the theater, what started out mediocre went straight to ridiculous. I don't mind the occasional holes in a plot, but these are craters! Like when they give the aliens' computer a virus? Imagine the aliens running the same operating system as us! Or after they shoot the first ship down, wouldn't the aliens figure it out and prevent it? The list goes on and on. The plot becomes terribly cartoonish and juvenile to the point I was actually embarassed being in the theater watching it. I give it 2 stars for some of the special effects.
