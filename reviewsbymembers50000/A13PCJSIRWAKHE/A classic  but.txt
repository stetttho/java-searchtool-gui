 Having not seen this for a number of years, I was excited to view it again a couple of years ago. I was in a way disappointed. All of the scenes with Charlie Brown and the gang are great, but the Red Baron scenes tend to go on a bit long for my tastes. But don't let that dissuade you. This belongs in every Halloween video library.
