 I watched Scooby as a kid and fortunately missed this one. I rented it for my kids and watched it with them. It was painful to watch. First, there is virtually no suspense AT ALL. And there is no mystery. There is also no Mystery Gang, which really makes this feel like something is wrong. The animation and sound effects reminded me eerily of The Smurfs, which is not a compliment. That said, my 3-year-old DID seem to enjoy it - but only through one viewing. They have not asked for it since, but still ask for other Scooby movies (especially Cyber Chase). Good thing I rented it first, but even that seemed to be a waste of money.
