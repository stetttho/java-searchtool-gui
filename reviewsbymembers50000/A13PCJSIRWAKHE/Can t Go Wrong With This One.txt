 I've rented about every Scooby video, but this is the one my kids always want to see - so I bought it. As another reviewer wrote, it's good enough to watch with your kids - at least the first couple of times! For those of you (like me) who are always curious who does the voices, there is a great bonus feature behind the scenes worth watching!
