 If you've seen Santa Claus is Coming to Town, you'll feel like this is an Easter re-hashing, which it is. The story, supporting characters, even the sets seem REALLY familiar. But a kid doesn't care! And there aren't many decent Easter videos out there, so this is one you'll probably want to pick up if you're in the market. My kids almost always get into the songs on such a tape, but not this one. The music is forgettable.
