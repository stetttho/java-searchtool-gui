 There is nothing terribly wrong with this film, but it just seems a bit flat compared to the first one, not to mention the original animated version. If your kids just can't get enough of the first and you're dying to see something new, this is not a bad movie. But of the 3 "Dalmatian" movies (animated, 101, and 102), this comes in a distant third...
