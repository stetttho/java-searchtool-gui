 I write this review on behalf of my kids who have watched their fair share of Barney... Even though I was relieved to see realistic child actors, my kids (3-year-old twins) just don't like this very much. I think the format is a bit too long for the younger viewers. Perhaps older kids will like it, but in my case it was basically a waste of money...
