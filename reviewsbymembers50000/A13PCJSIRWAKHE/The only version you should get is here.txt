 Don't be fooled by thinking a more modern performance will be better. This is absolutely the finest performance ever recorded of "Mysterious Mountain." As another reviewer said, I have heard numerous other version that give this work NO justice by hurrying it along. Not so with this recording. The performance brings out the true genius of this legendary work. It's power and beauty are stunning.
