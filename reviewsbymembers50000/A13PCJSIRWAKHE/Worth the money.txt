 I bought this CD because a couple of the radio hits sounded good - "Fade" and "Outside" - but I was surprised that the rest of the CD is just as solid. Staind may at first glance seem like all the other angst-filled groups out there, but they are different. There is a heightened emotion and urgency that many of the other groups lack. And they are not sellouts by any stretch. My vote for best track goes to "Safe Place" because of the rich harmony and inspired vocals.
