 There was a time where U2 and Simple Minds were compared to each other in style as well as stature. This release is one of the reasons. It a huge commercial success, and one of their greatest achievements. Great production and song writing abound here. Everyone remembers the hits off this album, but no one should overlook solid tunes such as "I Wish You Were Here" and "Come A Long Way."
