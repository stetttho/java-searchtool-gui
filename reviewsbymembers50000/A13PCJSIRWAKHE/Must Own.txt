 If you have heard of John Adams but didn't know which CD to buy, this is definitely the one to get. From the exuberant opening title track to the mesmerizing "Common Tones in Simple Time" there is not a second you will glance at your watch. Don't be fooled by the misleading "minimalist" label. This is solid orchestral music at its finest.
