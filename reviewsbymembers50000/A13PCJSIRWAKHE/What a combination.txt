 Barbie in a Christmas classic... somehow that struck me as a big odd... Anyway, I've found that my kids somehow prefer these 3D animated "cartoon" to the traditional ones. For that reason, they've watched this probably more than they would have it it were just a cartoon. But overall this is a video the kids will enjoy.
