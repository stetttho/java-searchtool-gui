 This film is fun.  When I was younger, I used to catch this one summer on HBO when they were playing it continuously.  But, somehow although I fought hard not to like it and to say that it was rubbish, I could not. It was and is a fun film.  I love the songs.  In fact, not since 'Mary Poppins' and 'Chitty Chitty Bang Bang' have little ditties from a movie stayed in my mind by using one of the songs.   Just the other day, I was watching 'Punch-Drunk Love' (another film recommended), and to my surprise it was not just I who had remembered the little songs when I was younger.  P. T. Anderson has given tribute to this fun movie in his film as well. Robert Altman has made better pictures ('The Player' and 'MASH') but who is comparing?  He made this for fun (or perhaps some extra cash), but who cares?  It is a fun film.  Enjoy.
