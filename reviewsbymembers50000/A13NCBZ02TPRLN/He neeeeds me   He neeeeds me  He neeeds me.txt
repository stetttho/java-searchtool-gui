 What a wonderful, purposely quirky, extraordinarily beautiful, exceptionally well-written film, with great acting using few words!  You must see this lovely picture. P. T. Anderson is one of my favorite new writer-directors.  You want to allow him to "speak" through his cinematic work, not come to his films with your own pre-conceived notions of what you think the film 'is' about, or 'should be' about.  Just enjoy!  Also, after seeing this picture, I had to rush out and buy 'Popeye' on DVD!  Can anyone guess why?
