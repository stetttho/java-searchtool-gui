 I love Willie and this has become one of my favorite live "Wille Albums"!  All of the songs on this recording are wonderful and distinctly reveal Willie's ability as guitarist, songwriter, and performer.  The many people who he invited to perform with him have been influenced by him and are proud to be a part of this album.  There is no gimmick-madness trying to make some last minute money with an old country legend here!   Additionally, I have to say that those who did not like Aaron Neville's 'Stardust' need to listen to it again (and again!).  It is the subtlety of Willie's vocals with Neville's unique singing ability that makes the song perhaps one of the best covers I have heard of 'Stardust'.  Long live Willie!  This is Willie revealing his genius. Buy this CD!
