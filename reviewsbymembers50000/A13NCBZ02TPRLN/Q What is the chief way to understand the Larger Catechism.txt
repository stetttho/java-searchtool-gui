 Answer: To read J. G. Vos's extremely clear commentary on the (overlooked and underread) Westminster Larger Catechism.  For those who would like a one-volume, handy, theological volume to study, this would be a good one (another good one is A. A. Hodge's Commentary on the Confession).  If you are someone studying for licensure or ordinations exam, or someone trying to better understand the overview of the Bible (also read his father's 'Biblical Theology for an overview), or studying for Sunday school class, or someone studying for devotion, this book is for you!  It is quite indispensable as a commentary on the catechism and now after years of being out of print, P&R has seen fit to bless us!  I hope that this volume will help us to return to our confessional roots as a people of God who are part of a great and long heritage of saints! 'Take up and read!'
