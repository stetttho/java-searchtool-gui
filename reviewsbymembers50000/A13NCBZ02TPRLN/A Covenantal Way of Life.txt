 T. M. Moore's book is a welcome and valuable companion to O. Palmer Robertson's 'Christ of the Covenants'.  The book describes well that the Biblical way of life is understood as the covenantal way of life.  This book should stimulate our thinking, as well as remind us of our identity as people who belong to Christ's church at the beginning of the 21st century.  This books reminds us of the great and precious promises of the Living God toward us in Christ and how we should walk, talk, and live day in and day out in the covenant.  The chapters are developed well and biblically informative.  There is a chapter on the Covenant of Promise, the Covenant of Glory, the Covenant and the Kingdom, the Church, the Covenant Community, Worship in God's Covenant, and an extrememly practical chapter on Covenant Living in a Postmodern World.  For anyone in Christ's church, this book will be the source of much thought, bible studies, and sermons!  For those who are studying for ordination, or planning to be a minister, it is an excellent resource for getting a biblical overview of the covenant as well as the practical implications for the Christian life. Read it!
