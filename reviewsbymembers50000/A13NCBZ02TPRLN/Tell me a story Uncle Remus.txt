 My sweet mama took me see this wonderful film about the South when I was a youngin'!  It's a very special movie that all should see.  It reveals how Southerners, both black and white, define each other.  The black or white man from the South cannot understand himself apart from the other.  This film shows the interaction of two cultures and how they created a world that is now gone with the wind, that was the song of the South.   Providentially, slavery was smitten from the land of the South, but unfortunately we have forgotten the good relationships that existed between the races in this time.  Uncle Remus is a kind and benevolent, elderly man who helps a young man better to understand the tragic world in which he lives, by offering him hope through story telling.  Please Disney, offer the people the same hope by allowing Americans today to view this story in order that they might better understand themselves, and their relations with other races.   This is a delightful movie that will encourage people to be proud of who they are, regardless of their race!  It is a movie that will long be remembered by young people, if it is not allowed to be lost and forgotten like everything else 'Southern'!
