 This book is a welcome addition to many introductory books on the life, thought, and theology of Jonathan Edwards.  Drs. D. G. Hart, Sean Michael Lucas (please correct his name- -it is Sean Michael Lucas, not 'Edwards'), and Stephen Nichols have done an outstanding job of writing clear and informative essays that will be appreciated by both those who are new to Edwards' influence on American Religion, as well as those trained as scholars in this field.   May Jonathan Edwards' life, thought, theology, and most of all his great devotion to God's glory and holiness recapture us all.  This book will point those interested in the right direction and cause some to understand the evangelical tradition and theological stream in which we all live that flows from the influence of Dr. Edwards. Purchase this with the Marsden Volume on the life of Edwards, or Nichols' 'Guided Tour of Edwards' Life. PS Please correct Dr. Lucas' name!
