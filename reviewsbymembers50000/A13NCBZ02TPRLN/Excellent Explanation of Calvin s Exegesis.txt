 This is an incredibly readable and helpful volume!  This was assigned by Dr. Peter Enns at Westminster Theological Seminary in our Old Testament class, and I have re-read it, and referred back to it several times.  It will particularly help those who desire to understand the continuity, as well as the discontinuity, between the Old and New Testaments.  Calvin's exegesis will help the mature Biblical expositor from falling into irresponsible "spiritualizing" and allegorical interpretations of the Old Testament.  Buy it! Read it! Tolle, Lege! Tolle, Lege!
