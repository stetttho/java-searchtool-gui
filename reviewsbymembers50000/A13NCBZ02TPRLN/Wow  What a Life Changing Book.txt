 How do you review a book such as this one?  When I first read this book several years ago, it changed the way I thought and lived the Christian life.  Now, rereading it some years later, it reminds me of just how foundational it was in my way of thinking of "the Christian life".  Especially in the way it taught me (and others through me who I teach) how important and "normal" is suffering in the true Christian life.  It is through suffering God conforms us to the image of Christ.  This is a volume taken from the third volume of 'Calvin's Institutes' and has been incredibly helpful for Christians for over 400 years!  One of the things you will find about this book is how extremely easy it is to understand it, as well as practical (in fact it is almost like it was written yesterday).  Oftentimes, it is easy to think that a book written originally in the 16th century would be both difficult and impractical!  However, this book is biblically crystal clear as well as useful!  I have given this book away often and I have only seen growth in those to whom I have given it!  May it be a new book for you, or one you buy again for a friend.
