 Ms. Kenyon's book is a fairly good place to start research for compositions set in the Middle Ages, but it is by no means where you should stop.  I encountered several errors.  The scope of the book is just too  wide to be throrough or accurate. I use this book as a reference, but I  always check the material presented against other references as well.  The  bibliographies are wonderful - take a look at some of the books the author  mentions in those.
