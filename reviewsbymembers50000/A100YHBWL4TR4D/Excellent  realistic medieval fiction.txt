 While I believe that Karen Cushman's first book, Catherine, Called Birdy, is a better book, this novel has considerable merit. Cushman makes no effort to glamorize the Middle Ages, as many writers do. Her account is realistic and thought-provoking. In response to another viewer, who stated  that this book should be avoided - "I think, in a time when our youth  are struggling to find a healthy self-image and healthy relationships with  others, this is a book that should be avoided" - I think this reviewer  really doesn't see the larger picture. This is how life was, and I think  teenagers do not want their literature to lie to them. Life isn't always  pretty. Not all the people who lived in the Middle Ages had money, or even  morals. That is true today as well. I think a young adult reader is capable  of reaching a conclusion about a character's motives and morals without our  help. More than anything else, this book will really teach readers about  REAL history.
