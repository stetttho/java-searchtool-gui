 As a teacher of American literature, I have read many of the American classics, and since to teach is to learn something twice, I've had to read them often and closely.  Without a doubt, The Great Gatsby is my favorite American novel to teach.  Fitzgerald's prose verges on the poetic.  The  thematic and symbolic issues in the book heighten the reader's enjoyment of  the story, but even the basic story is enough.  I simply love this book.  I  couldn't put it down when I first read it.  It is a flawless comment on the  Jazz Age and the death of the American Dream.
