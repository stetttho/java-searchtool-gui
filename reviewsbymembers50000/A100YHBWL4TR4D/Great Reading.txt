 Okay, let me admit first off that I am an English teacher, and with my critical eye turned to this book, I see its flaws -- namely that it isn't realistic.  Ah, who cares.  I loved it, and I admit it freely.  It is one  of only three books I have read in one sitting.  I loved the story, and I  loved the characters.  I was pulling for Novalee and Lexie (and all the  rest) for the whole novel.  I was so angry at Willie Jack I could spit.   Who cares if it isn't classic literature (come closer ... I'll let you in  on a secret ... some of that so-called classic literature is soooo dry ...  and I don't care for it at all).  Give me Novalee Nation, in all her  unrealistic splendor, over Captain Ahab anyday.
