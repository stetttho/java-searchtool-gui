 This book is a wonderful tapestry of Norman/Angevin England and Wales.  The characters are well-developed and complex.  For example, historical treatments of King John invariably cast him as a villain, but here we see  him as a character with many facets.  The plot follows Joanna, or Joan, the  illegitimate daughter of John, through her life from about age five to her  late thirties.  A reader of this book will learn much about culture clash,  women, the Angevins, and England and Wales in the Middle Ages.  The book is  captivating -- I was hardly able to put it down.
