 This movie is one of the best I've ever seen.  The cast is superb, particularly Cary Elwes as Westley.  One of the most quotable movies made, the script is well-written and funny.  The story captures the essence of  the fairy tale, purporting to make fun of it, but in the end, glorifying  it.  An absolute must-see.
