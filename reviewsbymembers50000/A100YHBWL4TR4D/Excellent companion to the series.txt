 I especially enjoyed Gabaldon's descriptions of the art of writing. She reminds us that what looks effortless on the page is actually hard work. This companion also has teasers for the next two books, character  descriptions, even a glossary. It is packed with so much information that I  don't think a fan of the series should be without it.
