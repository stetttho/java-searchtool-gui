 This movie is simply breathtaking.  Of course it isn't historically accurate, but it is a grand epic.  The acting is superb, particularly Mel Gibson as William Wallace.  The movie is visually stunning.  The soundtrack  is excellent.  I have heard that James Cameron heard it and knew he had to  get Horner to do Titanic, even though they had worked together in the past  and had difficulties.  You simply have to see this movie.  It is my  personal favorite, and it is one of the best.
