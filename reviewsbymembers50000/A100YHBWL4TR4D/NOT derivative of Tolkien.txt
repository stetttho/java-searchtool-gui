 I was alarmed at the number of reviewers who claim that this book is derivative of Tolkien's books.  If anything, it is derivative of the Mabinogion, which inspired the names of many of the characters.  I have  read both series many times, and while I would put them in the same genre -  fantasy - I would not compare them otherwise.  I suppose they compare in  this: if you did like Tolkien, you will probably like Alexander, and vice  versa.
