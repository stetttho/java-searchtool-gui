 In all, this book was very, very good, but not quite on a par with the rest of the series. It seemed to me that the characters were acting against their former natures - doing things they wouldn't do. In all, I do  recommend it, and not just because you won't be able to follow the next  book. Some of the scenes are breathtaking, and the writing is superb.
