 This book is one of my favorite books of all time. Karen Cushman perfectly captures life for a young teenage girl in the Middle Ages. From mundane, everyday problems like fleas to major concerns like familial expectations and marriage, Cushman covers it all! This is one of the few books that is  so accurate that readers can really get a feel for the times as they truly  were - not the way they are romanticized. I say kudos to Cushman, and I  hope she keeps them coming!
