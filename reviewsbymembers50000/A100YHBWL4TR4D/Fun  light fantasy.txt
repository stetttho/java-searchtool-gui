 I really enjoyed this book.  OK, so I am still not clear about how Kurland's time travel theory works -- I guess I like to see something more substantial than just wishing.  I loved Richard myself.  This book is  sensual without being smutty -- sex is not described in graphic detail.  I  would feel comfortable recommending this book to my high school students.   The medieval details were authentic and accurate.  This book rates above  most romance novels I have read.
