 I wasn't sure I would like this one. Claire and Jamie weren't in Scotland! It did take me a while to get into this one, but once I did, I tore through it. The characters are real people. By the time I finished this book, I was  so sad because there was not another one to pick up. I miss my friends!  Gabaldon does her research, and it really shows. Excellent book!
