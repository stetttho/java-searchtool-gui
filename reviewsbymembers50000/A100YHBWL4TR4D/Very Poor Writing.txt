 I love all things Scottish, but not this book.  The descriptions were bland and the diction was horrid - at one point Carlow's hero describes his feelings about his beloved's appearance - "Her figure was  wonderful."  What does that really mean?  I have read much better  books set in this time - try Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series, but avoid  this book!
