 I have to agree that this is based on poor scholarship.  Where is the second edition that acknowledges that most of the information they based their theories on was admitted to be fabricated by Pierre Plantard?  He admitted it in the 1990s, under oath.  Find out more at http://priory-of-sion.com/. It's a shame Dan Brown didn't acknowledge the spurious scholarship Holy Blood, Holy Grail was based on when he wrote The Da Vinci Code, but I guess it would have undercut his plotline.
