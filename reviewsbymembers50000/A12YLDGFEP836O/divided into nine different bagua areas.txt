 This is one of the funniest things I ever read.  Witty in a British sort of way.  (It's not offensive either, unless you're stuffy - I've organised a few things in my apt around feng shui.  & a few according to Wrong Shui - in fact the architect who designed my building was probably a practitioner.)
