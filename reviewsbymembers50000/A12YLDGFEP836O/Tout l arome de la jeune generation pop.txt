Zirvedesin (Galatasaray Te Quiero) Extended Version - Ishtar & Burak Aziz  I bought this hoping to get a nice middle eastern folk sound, which it doesn't have at all.  It's just pop.  It may be good pop or it may be bad pop to those who like pop, I just don't like generic pop.  Sorry I can't post music samples.
