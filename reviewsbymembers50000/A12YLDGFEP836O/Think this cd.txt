 I have just got up to track 11 on this cd, and I am high.  Literally high on the music.  I have never taken drugs.  I jumped up and down.  I saw animated records and writing.  My mind diagrammed an entire music video based on my science fiction and Russian dissident library for Resurection by PPK, which has never happened before.  Musical tastes are idiosyncratic, and if this cd thrills me, someone else will hate it.  But if you like trance, this is the cd.  (Practical description: it sounds kind of like the dance soundtrack for Queer as Folk only more ethereal and synthesizer-like and cool.)
