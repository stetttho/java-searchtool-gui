 This is a very strange album.  It's got Marta Sebestyen singing love songs, what sounds like a chorus of Hungarian youths rapping in unison, a couple great industrial dance pieces, and strange yet appealing ragtime & honky tonk pieces with people talking in the background.  I loved all the Muzsikas albums with Marta Sebestyen singing (for all us non-Hungarians out there, I think it's pronounced SHEH-behsht-yain, where yain rhymes with plain) so I got this one because it had her name on it.  The two Sebestyen songs on it turn out to be on other albums, and they were some of the soft love songs I'm not as fond of, but I think the album is very cool, and I'm glad I have it anyway.  It's supposed to be a description of the Hungarian emigrant/American immigrant experience, as they go over the sea, come to the new land, and work and generate fusion musical forms in it (this is where the ragtime and jazz & industrial come in).  Since the styles are so varied, there's probably at least one song on the album that anyone will like (although I won't guarantee about the rest), but they still all seem like the work of one person or group, I mean they don't sound completely random.  They're just all very different.  I still love 33 Boilers and the other track like it, they sound like people hitting a bunch of pipes in a fast and exciting way, almost similar to crystalline music.  In fact, hearing those two tracks first got me into goth industrial music and now I'm a huge fan of Apoptygma Berzerk, Alan Replica, and Assemblage 23.  So if you're a fan of industrial or eurodance, check out this album and Muzsikas' album The Prisoner's Song, with Marta's pure, almost crystalline voice, the lovely blaring bagpipes (they've got extra vibrations all over them just like synthesisers and organ music), and Peter Eri's nice, low, almost growly voice.  Enjoy!
