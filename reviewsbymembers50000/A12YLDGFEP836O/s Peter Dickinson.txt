 I love Peter Dickinson novels.  He writes extremely well, sort of extremely good in a very subtle way, & you keep wanting to read more of him.  This is a really nice one about a semi-Marxist landlord/housewife/carpenter with a pre-school age child, and a Baltic government-in-exile renting out the top floor of her house.  One of her other tenants keels over and dies, a hot dude comes to work for the government, everybody follows each other, & the main character and her husband (who is recovering from depression/a nervous breakdown) have lovely cozy moments.  I wish I had a nice relationship like that with someone.    By the way, there is another review of this book, by lazy reviewer, misfiled on the page for the book Walking Dead, also by Peter Dickinson.
