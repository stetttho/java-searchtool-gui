 This is actually a really good anthology.  There were some poems I was familiar with, like Blake's Tyger, Milne's Pinkle Purr, Lear's The Owl and the Pussycat and a few folk poems such as The Cats of Kilkenny, but there are a huge number of poems here and I loved most of them.  Some selections:  In the clear gold of sunlight, stretching their backs, --White as snow--see the voluptuous cats, Closing eyes jealous of their inner glooms, Slumbering in the tepid warmth of their illumined fur. *****  It was a little captive cat Upon a crowded train His mistress takes him from his box To ease his fretful pain. *****  Praise be to thee, O Ra, exalted Sekhem, thou art the Great Cat, the avenger of the gods and the judge of words and the president of the sovereign chiefs and the governor of the holy Circle; thou art indeed the bodies of the Great Cat *****  Yes, you are lovely with your ingratiating manners, sleek sides and small white paws, but I wish you had not come here. *****  Their moonpale cries hurl themselves against your full spoon. If you touchone gently it goes crazy. Its eyes turn up. It wraps itself  around your ankle and purrs a rusty millenium, you liar, you tourist. *****  In the eyes of the cat Is the color of the sea, On a sunny day, in winter *****  Most cats, with the exception of Burmese, do not celebrate their birthdays.  Rather, they are extremely sentimental about Palm Sunday and Labour Day, at which times they survive solely on white lace and baloney sandwishes.  Cats on the whole are loath to discuss God.  Generally speaking, cats have no money, although some of them secretly collect rare and valuable coins. *****  One cat built a secret nest in my socks. *****  He is all black, but has an electric tail.  When he sleeps in the sun he is the blackest thing one can imagine.  Even in his sleep he catches frightened mice.  One can see this in the little claws that are growing from his paws.  He is terribly nice and naughty.  He picks birds off the trees before they are ripe. *****  Sleep, sleep, cat of the night with episcopal ceremony and your stone-carved moustache. Take care of all our dreams; control the obscurity of our slumbering prowess with your relentless heart and the great ruff of your tail. *****  Dear creature by the fire a-purr, Strange idol, eminently bland, Miraculous puss!  As o'er your fur I trail a negligible hand, *****  Come into the garden, Fred, For the neighborhood tabby is gone. Come into the garden, Fred. I have nothing but my flea collar on, And the scent of the catnip has gone to my head. I'll wait by the screen door till dawn.
