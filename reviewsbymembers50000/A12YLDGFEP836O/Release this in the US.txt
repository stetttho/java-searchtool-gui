 Blake's 7 was an extremely well done British sci fi series from around the early 80s or late 70s.  As in any series, there's some clunker episodes, but the dialogue is always stellar and extremely witty.  Tanith Lee wrote two episodes (and appears to recreate the Avon-Vila relationship in her book Kill the Dead).  Basically, Blake's group are rebels against a huge interstellar dictatorship.  The special effects are the level you'd expect from an ordinary tv fx studio 20-30 years ago - so what?  There's also some really nice, memorable fashion and set design.
