 The seven stories of the title are: The Sage of Theare; The Master; The Girl Who Loved the Sun;  Dragon Reserve, Home Eight; What the Cat Told Me; nad and Dan adn Quaffy; and Enna Hittims.   I haven't actually read this book, but I've read 6 of the 7 stories in other collections (I've just  always thought amazon should put up short story lists for collections the  way they do track lists for cds in the music section).  The Sage of Theare  is a very nice Chrestomanci story and The Master is one of Diana Wynne  Jones' beautiful eerie stories.  Dragon Reserve and What the Cat Told Me  (previously only available in a multi-author anthology) are classic Jones.   nad and Dan adn Quaffy is fun.  I haven't read Enna Hittims yet.   Dragon  Reserve, The Master, and nad and Dan adn Quaffy (man I love typing that:)  were 3 of 8 stories in Everard's Ride.  Dragon Reserve and The Sage were 2  of 8 stories in Warlock at the Wheel.  These 2 collections also share 2  other stories, which are not in this one.  Maybe we should have a collected  works? 4 stars because she's so splendidly good, but only 4 stars because  none of my personal utter favourites are in here, & maybe we could have  seen some of the harder to find stories in here instead of the duplicates.
