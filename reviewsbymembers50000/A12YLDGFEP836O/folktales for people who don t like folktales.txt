 I like folktales in theory, but I don't like them in practice.  I can't find ones I like to read.  I don't like the ones in Russian my teacher brings out that everybody else likes.  I don't even like the ones Italo Calvino writes down, even though everybody else raves about it and I love Calvino.  This collection rocks.  It's this very nice clear prose and the stories are cool and exciting and there's lots of wild cats who change into people.  An Old Man Who Saved Some Ungrateful People is hilarious.  Guinea Fowl Child, Brave Hunter, and Sister of Bones are very cool, and Children of Wax is very beautiful.  Go buy this and have fun reading it, forget the children.
