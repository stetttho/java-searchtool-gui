 This is a sequel to Gregory Maguire's book The Lightning Time.  The boy from Lightning Time is on vacation, and is taken to see various people's dreams by a bird.  Not as good as The Lightning Time (or I Feel Like the Morning Star, a very haunting book by the same author), but good - definitely better than the average children's book.  It has a good sense of mystery and wonder.
