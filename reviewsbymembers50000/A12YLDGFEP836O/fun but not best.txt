 I prefer tie-in books that stand by themselves literarily (the plot can be convoluted as heck, I don't care).  I am also a big Sean Stewart fan since his first book.  This is a really good Star Wars novel, but it's not a great Stewart novel.  It's a lot of fun, but there's some sort of weirdness or depth lacking that is present in, say, Passion Play or Night Watch.  It reads sort of like a script, or a good action thriller.  The characterization is truly good though, and the dialogue.  You really feel for all the characters, from Scout to Ventress and Dooku.  I would've liked to see a scene with Whirry and Whie, and more of Solis, but oh well.
