 I usually read fantasy, science fiction, and young adult novels, not famous literary works or 'modern adult fiction' (which has got to be the most boring thing anyone could ever imagine).  I heard about this being famous, so I looked at the first chapter in a bookstore and knew I would love it and could buy it.  The prose has the best qualities of the best fantasy and YA novels.  It's lyrical and clear and makes everything you look at feel new and interesting and different, like the way you feel after you come out of a theatre after seeing a really really good movie.  The writing doesn't intrusively interpret or explain things for you.  The dialogue makes every character feel like a real person, three dimensional and distinctive.  If you like reading Diana Wynne Jones, Sandra Cisneros, Gregory Maguire, or Nina Kiriki Hoffman, you will like this novel.  I read it in 2 days during breaks at work and on the bus and staying up several hours later than I should.
