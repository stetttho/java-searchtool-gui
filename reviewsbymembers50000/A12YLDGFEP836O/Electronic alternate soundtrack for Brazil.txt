 I love every song on this album and frequently just listen to the entire album.  The songs all have similar sounds, so it's nice to just listen to them all in a row, like different movements of a long piece, but they're different enough I only feel like I'm listening to the same thing over and over again in a *good* way.  It's nice electronic stuff with a beat, some machine-oriented lyrics, and often a nice mood of melancholy as well as beauty and energy - sort of like goth and klezmer, if they were written as techno or ebm.  Alan Replica is listed as Masq on the album Electricity II, which includes 'The Machines' from Clockworks.  I hate trying to describe music in print reviews, but this album deserves a review and 5 stars.  This album sort of sounds like a less angry Apoptygma Berzerk, a more gothy Spray, or S.P.O.C.K if they were a lot better & not singing about Star Trek.
