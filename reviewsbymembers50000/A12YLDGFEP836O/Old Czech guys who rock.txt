 The filmmaker finances Jan, now a professor in America, to go around Europe and retrace the long journey he made to escape occupied Czechoslovakia in WWII; his drinking buddy Arnost ends up coming along too.  Prof Weiner had an amazing journey taking him all over Europe.  Mainly it's really cool because these two incredibly colourful old guys are telling stories and spouting East European humour and arguing with each other, in between these true stories of amazing escapes that actually happened.  I love observing cool people talking with each other.  The (two main nonfictional characters) remind me of my dad's late friend who escaped from Prague and my dad's late girlfriend's father, who's also a colourful person with WWII stories.  I wish there was much more of this documentary!
