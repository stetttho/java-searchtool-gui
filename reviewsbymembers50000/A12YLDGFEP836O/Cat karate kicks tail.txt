 Varjak Paw is the youngest cat in a cat family who want to sit and do nothing - they lack curiosity.  His grandfather begins to tell him about the Way of Jalal, the cat martial art his ancestor invented, but Varjak is forced into the streets by strange intruders.  He must make his way back to his family to defend both them and the other cats of the city using the Way of Jalal, which is taught to him by a cat master in his dreams.   This is a wonderful book, enhanced by vivid, stylised illustrations by Dave McKean, known for working with Neil Gaiman.  There isn't any excessive cuteness, and the Horrible Fate menacing the cats is chilling.  The illustrations in the middle of the pigeons in Trafalgar Square have real google-eyed pigeon personality.  The writing is simple, not kids-book dumbed-down, and on the few occasions it doesn't meet its usual quality the illustrations carry it.  Whether you're looking for a good young adult book, a good story, a 1st-class, non-sentimental cat book, or a tribute to kung fu flicks, this is an answer.  Buy it, Little Grasshopper.
