 Incidental music for the television series The Prisoner.  Albert Elms composed original music for it, but he also stuck in pieces from a BBC music archive of some sort.  This cd has the (wildly different from each other) archive pieces.  They include the jazz music from Mme Engadine's party, the jazz music from No. 6's speech in Fall Out, and the calm music from when he gets back to London (some of my favourites).  Also included is Age of Elegance, the alternate main title theme by Ron Grainer made before he wrote the regular one.
