  . . . because a wolf already has its own fur.'  Maybe I'm not a true Mustapha fan because I haven't been able to find any of their other albums in the past 5 years, but I love this band because of this album.  It's a huge mixture of styles (sometimes one per song, sometimes more), kind of like Ad Vielle Que Pourra only (much) more Balkan and with more of a spirit of rock, even when they're not playing rock.  Si Vous Passez Par La is a beautiful French or Algerian accordion sort of song and Buke e kripe ne vater tone is the most wonderful, heavenly blaring Albanian piece ever, sort of like tuning bagpipes riding to battle with the occasional country & western line thrown in (and run over).  Kac Kuzulu Ceylan and Kopanitsa are also terrific (Turkish rock and Bulgarian fairly-trad-if-fast) and Starehe Mustaphas and Fiz'n are unforgettable after enough listens just because they're so weird.  Okay, I can live without quadruple Lindas and Maldita Guajira, but who cares?  The only albums that have absolutely *nothing* bad on them are The Machines by Alan Replica, 7 by Apoptygma Berzerk, and Pink Floyd's The Wall.  Go buy them.  But buy lots of Mustapha first.
