 I love good food.  I am currently on a quest to find Perfect Hot Chocolates.  This and Cocoa Amore Chocolate Cinnamon are the top placers so far.  This is a really good, tasty, not-too-sweet-or-thin-or-icky hot chocolate, I managed not to burn it, & it also tastes good with amaretto liqueur in it.
