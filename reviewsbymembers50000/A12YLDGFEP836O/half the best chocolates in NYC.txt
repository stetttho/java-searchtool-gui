 Marie Belle and Teuscher make the most wonderful chocolates in NYC.  Marie Belle chocolates are little chocolate squares with flavoured chocolate ganache filling and they're very very good, especially the kind with lots of different kinds of dark chocolate and the spicy chocolate kind.  And others I can't remember.  Why doesn't amazon say which flavours come in the 9-piece box?  There are definitely more than 9 flavours.
