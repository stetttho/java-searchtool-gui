 Possibly the most hilarious movie I've seen in my life.  It beats Window  to Paris and A Fish Called Wanda.  Matko Destanov is trying to pull off a  really good scam and fails miserably, leading to an hour and a half of  complications as three generations of four families get in deeper and  deeper until the ends meet themselves and tie up.  Also features lots of  wonderful Balkan music *and* the dance hit "Where Do You Go" (No  Mercy version).
