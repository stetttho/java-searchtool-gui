 "Lucas" is a good example of how 80's adolescent movies undermines 90's teen movies. I don't have to tell the ones who read this that the teen movies that are made today is beyond horrible. One thing I love about the eighties, is that the directors who made teenage movies really put their hearts in it, and made an effort to capture the true luminous light of youth. I was immediately taken with "Lucas", because, unlike most teen movies, intelligence and individuality were portrayed. Clever dialogue, wonderful acting, and best of all, individuality was emphasized. One thing I honestly regret about being a seventeen-year-old teenager in the millennium is having to be subjected to Hollywood teen flicks, which are so full of dreck it's amazing. My skin almost crawls when I look at "She's All That," "Ten Things I Hate About You", "Loser", "Drive Me Crazy", etc. Plus, the actors in "Lucas" do more of a convincing job than the modern teen actresses today. Watch "Lucas". You'll be rewarded. It's simple in its sweetness and charm, and is always good for a snowy night.
