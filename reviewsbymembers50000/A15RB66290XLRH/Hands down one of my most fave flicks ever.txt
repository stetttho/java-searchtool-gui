 One thing I love about the 80'S is the teen flicks that were made in that decade. Unfortunately, I'm a 17-year-old teenager growing up in the 90's decade, and I'm reduced to watching terrible 90's teen flicks. When people ask me what my favorite teen flick is, I always respond, "The Breakfast Club." "Isn't that a movie made in the eighties?" "Yes. Compared to 90's teen movies, 80's teen movies win by a landslide."  This wonderful movie is hilarious. We are treated to a wonderful cast, funny dialogue, and an airtight plot. You all know what the movie is about. What I really love is the characters- we can really see how each character differ from each another, yet they grow to be friends. One of my most favorite things about this movie is the lines they throw at each other. Especially Bender- he had me laughing from start to end!! "I feel empty inside. I admire guys who roll around with other guys." "I want to be like you. All I need is a lobotomy and some tights." "Brian, this is a very nutritious lunch. Did your mom marry Mr. Rogers?" "Screws fall out. The world's an imperfect place." "That's very nice, sir, but what if there's a fire? I think endangering the lives of children would be very unwise at the juncture of your career."  "Claire?" "It's a family name." "Yeah, for fat girls." "I'm not fat." "Not at present, but you'll be pushing maximum density." and much more! Who could forget the dancing scene in the library? Who could forget the time when they all confessed their deepest secrets to each other? It's a wonderful, funny and sweet movie. It couldn't be more engaging. All of you who hasn't seen this movie, rent it immediately!!!!!!! It won't be a waste of your time, trust me.
