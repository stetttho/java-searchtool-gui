 I am a huge fan of Woody Allen's works, and a few of his films have come to be on my list of top-ten favorite films. "Manhattan", "Annie Hall", and "Interiors", to name a few. I guess Allen had everything going for him in the seventies-after that decade, everything went downhill. I was unbelievably disappointed with "Small Time Crooks". I thought it would be hilarious. It was, before the one-year jump. Afterwards, everything became incredibly insipid. Because the DVDs were all taken, I was resorted to renting the VHS tape. I was lucky, in a way, because I could stop the movie and take it out to see how much more I had to watch.   I have always enjoyed Allen's self-deprecating whining, but I found his character, Ray, hugely annoying. Ray's whining just grated on my nerves. This movie is just a mess. The plot is structureless, the characters prove to be more dimwitted than Frenchy's cousin, May, which I actually found to be the smartest one. Most of all what's got me steamed is that it has no moral at all. I LOVE movies with serious and funny morals. "Manhattan", "Annie Hall", and "Interiors" proved to have heartbreaking, beautiful morals. This particular movie is the very opposite! You can't relate to any of the characters. The plot is scattered. The dialogue proves to be annoying while trying to be funny.  Watch this movie only if you're vastly bored, but that might be a bad idea, since it would make you even more bored! You've been warned!!   You want wonderful, spellbinding, vivid Woody Allen? Get "Manhattan", "Annie Hall", "Interiors", and "Sleeper" that turned out to be wonderful pieces of art!!
