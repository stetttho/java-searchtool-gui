 It is an enigma that this film did not get the credit it does. 'The Man in the Moon' instantly became one of my favorites when I watched it for the first time, and I continue to love it to this day. It is all about a young girl's journey of self-discovery and awkward first love. As the plot moves along, we see that Dani is an irresponsible girl who just wants to have rollicking fun. After she meets Court, a seventeen-year-old enigmatic boy, she falls deeply in love with him, and she starts to become responsible and think for herself. This movie comprises of two parts: first love and a family's ability to love each other despite the odds.The relationship between Dani and her father is one that some of us can familiarize with, and the relatiobship between the sisters. Youth, innocence, awkwardness, and heartbreak-could a movie be more beautifully merged? The heat of the South can be felt even in the wintertime, and the tangibility of our first loves reoccurs. This is a wonderful movie for a summer night, when the sun is setting and memories quietly sneak up on you. Don't miss it.
