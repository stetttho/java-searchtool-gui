 What is the matter with you people? You overanalyze the plot and themes of this movie and deem it unacceptable because it doesn't apply to real life and that it should be portrayed in better points leading up to child abuse. This movie may comprise of many points, but it is very simple. Two brothers struggle to overcome the stepfather's constant abuse and finally find a solution to cease it. This movie is blended very perfectly on two strong points: child abuse and imagination.  A 6-year old still gets creeped out by scary movies and monsters, yet he's got the real monster living in his house, and he still manages to hold on to his imagination and depends on his older brother for solace and protection. What better plot than that? It shows that people still have shreds of dignity and self-respect inside them, and that there is always a way out.  I think the reason why "The King"'s face wasn't shown is because it was portrayed in both boys' minds- they don't want to see his face. They would rather look at his body instead of his face. If his face was shown, this movie would actually be butchered. The entire movie is just shown in both boys' realms of imagination and memories, and it's sad when you guys think differently. You have forgotten what it was like to be a child. The 6-year-old is encountered with a problem even most adults can't bear to resolve, and still manages to hold on the fact that there still is hope, that he can fly away... were you watching this movie with a closed mind? Tell you what: watch this movie again with a very open mind, and i'll just see about forgetting that there are shallow people in the world.  I admire Bobby for his courage and ability to hold on his imagination-too many people forget imagination too soon, and are left with a very boring life. :)As for me, I'll treasure this movie.
