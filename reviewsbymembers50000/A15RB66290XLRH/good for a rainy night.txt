 This movie is good for a rainy night, when you're feeling bored and not in the mood for an overly-drenched romance. This movie balances romance and drama well. The point of this movie is to tell your significant other only three words: "i love you", but to the two couples in this movie, it's taking them a lifetime to say it. I thought the plot was sweet,also the actors, but you find yourself thinking "come on! just hurry up and say 'i love you!'".. though i like this movie, i have a few thoughts based on the plot. The plot seems too general- like every part seems superficial. I wanted to see the actors show a bit of emotion. Instead, they're holding in their feelings for each other. the story should have been focused on the older couple, Keaton and Shepard. Patrick's friend, Donovan, just seems out of place- it makes the movie seem awkward sometimes. Of course, I'm tossing out random thoughts on the movie, but I just think that the script should have called for deep analysis of each couple's feelings, as well as how the decades influenced them. Basically, there was no emotion. Impassivity, that's it. Sure, there were anger and all, but I wanted to see tears and sweet nothings whispered in ears. I wanted to see vulnerability. The plot is so intent on concealing the actors' true feelings that it just drowns out the tender feelings shared between them. I know even if it was difficult for them to express their feelings, they could have expressed their feelings in a different way.  I overall like this movie, but it doesn't rate as one of my favorites. I enjoyed seeing Keaton in this movie, though. She's one of my favorite actresses.
