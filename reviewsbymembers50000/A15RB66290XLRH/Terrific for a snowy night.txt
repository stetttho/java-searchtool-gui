 I bought this video for a solitary reason: it starred Diane Keaton. As usual, she turns in a brilliant performance. She's never disappointed me in any of her movies, counting this one. Keaton's character, J.C. Wiatt, shows a fabulous transition from a tiger lady to a doting mother.  My favorite scenes were the ones in the airport, when Wiatt first learns she has a baby on her hands, when she yells at the plumber at the well, when she confesses all her problems to the vet (Shepard), when Shepard rescues her, and finally the ending- it's so sweet and so unpredictable. This movie emits warm vibes,and is a must-see during a snowy night with the lights turned off. The only complaints I have about this movie is that Shepard's character should have shown a little more emphasis on what he should have been doing. I excepted him to be a witty,teasing character. And while he is, it isn't seen very well. I wanted more conversations between those two, a little vulnerability. Plus, I would have liked to see some more mother-daughter time between Wiatt and baby Elizabeth. But I still declare this film a must-see, especially since Keaton is in it.
