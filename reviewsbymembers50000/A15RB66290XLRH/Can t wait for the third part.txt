 "Good bye Father of the Bride Part Two forever"? (I'm speaking to the oblivious clueless reviwer back on the reviews) Please. How juvenile can you get? Even if you bid it farewell, it won't go away. but I respect your opinion,even if it may not sound like it.       On with the movie review. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Most sequels are boring and terrible, but this one really followed up with the first one. The fact that all of the characters were back from the first movie really helped. And how many movies have this kind of plot? Have you ever heard of another movie with a mother and daughter getting pregnant at the same time? And Martin's character, George Banks, was a really sweet man to be able to help out both his wife and daughter at the same time, without blowing his top, and he was a high-strung man to begin with. Short's character, Franck, is back with the same kooky qualities, and his driving to the hospital and all added much humor. I was happy to see some vulnerability in this movie, such as Keaton and Williams crying over the littlest thing-like all mothers do. The baby room, the deliveries, everything was so sweet. There isn't anything nasty or vengeful about it- it's just a soft, warm movie about a normal family with two babies on the way,with bright hopes for the future. Everything just seemed to pull together. The plot may be a bit predictable, but it's still great just to kick back and enjoy this two-hour movie accompanied with an emotional uplift.  I sincerely hope they make a third part! It would make the movies even more enjoyable! I highly recommend this movie!!
