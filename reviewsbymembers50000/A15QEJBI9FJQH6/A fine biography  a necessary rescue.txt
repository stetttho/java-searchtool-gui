 The lack of attention Donald Davidson has received since his death is  scandalous. No doubt it stems in part from his racicialist views and  resistance to the civil rights movement. Well Davidson was a flawed  man--but to call him a "Racist" ( His old friend Robert Penn  Warren's daughter says that his name was never spoken in their house on  that account--I find it hard to believe) is simply to miss the measure of  the man. He was a fine poet (just a notch below Robert Penn Warren and John  Crowe Ransom) and a brilliant literary critic and teacher. His "Attack  on Leviathan" is essential reading for those who confuse conservatism  with Newt Gingrich, and his poem "Lee in the Mountains" is a  tribute not only to a lost cause, but to all lost causes, and should  therefore resonate with all but the incurable narcissist.  Winchell has  done us a great service by presenting the man warts and allto us. If we  ever get beyond the name calling that passes  for political and literary  judgement these days it will be due in large measure to books like this  one.
