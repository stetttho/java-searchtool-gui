 I use the word stunningly only semi-figuratively. This book purports to be a series of diverse explorations of a great theologian and martyr. It is nothing of the sort. We hear nothing from reformed evangelicals who regard Bonhoeffer as virtually apostate. Instead we have a collection of essays written by those who claim to pass as Lutherans and Anglicans (there is I believe one Roman Catholic) whose next claim to fame after violating the kerygma of Christianity will no doubt be to announce with pride that they are baptizing Dolphins. Consider  the statement " People like Martin Luther King, Nelson Mandela and Mahatma Gandhi  illustrate what Bonhoeffer means (p 118) All one has to do is to read the first page of Bonhoeffer's Ethics to realize that hypothetically however much he may have admired them they represent exactly the OPPOSITE of what Bonhoeffer means. Bonhoeffer is a LUTHERAN and a conservative one at that but these writers are using Bonhoeffer to suit their own agendas (which they concede has often been done) Don't read this book--read The Ethics or Act and Being--notice the influence of Barth. Bonhoffer deserves better than to be left in the hands of the "Honest to God" people. It might also be good to have a look at what Luther said as well.
