 There is only a bit more to say--most of the reviews positive and negative are on the mark. So I want to make a proposition and a suggestion. Mart, a first and a half rate writer son of a first and a half rate writer--along with his pals Hitchens and Rushdie represent the best of what the new world order writers have to offer--great (though sometimes overly precious) writing with little heart--"heart" being an inadequate word to explain the experience of reading great pre new world order writers. Compare him to Evelyn or for that matter Auberon Waugh. At first they seem blood brothers. But Mart like his pals Salman and Chris do  not understand the religious impulse--nor for that matter do they have any sense of "home." Now such homless writing is possible--if you are Vladimir Nabokov or Joyce. Martin Amis is neither. Evelyn Waugh tried to be Proust in Brideshead and he failed, but the failure remained an interesting book since there was a world he was engaging. Since Amis and his circle have no ground under them, failure is not an option--all that remains is a wearisome pastiche of fiction or memoir.
