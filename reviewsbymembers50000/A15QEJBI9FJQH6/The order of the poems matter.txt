 I give the book four stars because of Larkin's verse. However it is not clear to me that the editor has paid attention to the order of the composition of the poems. This is a matter often neglected. It is important when reading a poem from a book of poems--say High Windows--to know what poems surrounded it. The editor does provide the original order in the back--but the order of composition matters or rather the arrangement of poems that the poet produces matters--if Larkin wanted a certain order it was because he felt that the poems feed off each other in a specific way. Reproducing the poems willy nilly destroys the pattern of the poetry.
