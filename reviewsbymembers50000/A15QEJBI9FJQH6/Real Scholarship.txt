 Prof Berman wrote a thesis in 1954 which explored a little known area of the history of American Pharmacy and Medicine: Plant remedies and Botanical medicinals in America from Colonial times on. In doing so he gave us a view of American Culture not previously expressed. The thesis was circulated and used by many in the field but never published as a book. In his later years Prof Berman with the happy help of the distinguished scholar Michael Flannery used this thesis as a basis for this wonderful book. It is learned, it is lucid, and it is engaging. Sadly, Prof Berman died right before the publication of this book,a book which is testimony to the continuing existence of real scholarship in America. This is not a "theory" book. It is solidly grounded in history and evidence. It is not light reading  but even laymen (like myself) should read it to engage good history and good prose. Have you ever heard of the Thomsonians? Are you interested in how this "narrow field" speaks to or is influenced by Jeffersonians and Jacksonians? Are you in short interested in how seemingly small movements within a culture reflect that culture at large? Above all are you interested in the process of investigation which reveals and explainsthese connections? If so read this book. If you want to read trendy scholarship be my guest; but, if you want to read real scholarship--the kind of thing truly imaginative and thoughtful academics do then as I have said you could well profit from this wonderful book.
