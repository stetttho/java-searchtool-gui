 I saw this movie many years ago and I still take pleasure in watching it over again. The script is superb the music (Georges Delerue I think) splendid and the cast is simply marvelous. One wishes more of De Broca's  pictures were available particularly "Male Companion"--the one  sadness is watching the wonderful Francois Dorleac who died so young. A  great story, a great spoof a winner,
