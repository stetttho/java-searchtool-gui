 I agree with all of the praise that the other reviewers heap upon this book. I would just like to add two points: first Bonhoeffer is deeply conservative and his appropriation by liberal theologians of the sixties rests on a serious misreading of him. He reiterates the Lutheran insight that works flow from grace--he is not a "liberation"theologian and he died at Flossenburg because his he had been given "costly grace" not because he was a "decent man" or felt that "he" had to help his fellow man--that is idolatry. Second point: we Catholics ignore this insight at our peril. Working for the poor avails us nothing if it is done out of "kindness" or decency--all ethics for Bonhoeffer--in so far as that word has any meaning for him are supernatural and must flow from Christ the center. My confession has only two writers who stress this: Augustine and Pascal-- and we tend to ignore them. Working in a soup kitchen avails us nothing if it is purely a "work". Bonhoeffer did not merit salvation because he resisted Hitler, rather as I said he resisted Hitler because of the costly grace visited upon him and that grace is what is salvific. We Catholics could do with more Bonhoeffer--otherwise we lapse into an "I can do it by myself" pelagianism or an "all I need is a push" semi-pelagianism.
