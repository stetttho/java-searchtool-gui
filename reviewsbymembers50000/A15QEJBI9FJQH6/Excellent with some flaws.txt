 I agree with O'Brien's diagnosis of the modern world with one important caveat: The west has learned from the Nazi's and the Stalinists that overt repression does not work--it spawns principled and in the end victorious resistance (Bonhoeffer, Solzhenitsyn)--the "soft totalitarianism" of the west relies on a) the consent of people (and O'Brien gets this) but equally important a marginalized dissent which is permitted because it is ineffective and sustains the illusion of democracy. Second point: As with the later novels of Walker Percy this is too much a tract--fiction works differently than this does. Fiction makes the reader an interperative participant not just a listener -- I advise readers to look at Flannery O'Connor's short stories which often voice concerns similar to O'Brien's but which  engage the reader at an interperative rather than at a polemical level. Having said this you could sure do worse than read this novel!
