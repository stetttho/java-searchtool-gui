 I watched this movie on ESPN some time ago, and despite the strong language, I really enjoyed this film. It was a bit depressing at times seeing Bobby Knight struggling as the coach of an underdog Indiana basketball team (the Hoosiers). He had a very bad temper, but all he wanted was to be a successful coach and make his basketball team play better. And for some reason that just didn't happen.  This film is somewhat exhausting at times but enjoyable nonetheless. Sure, it contains a lot of profanity, but I still liked it. I can't wait to buy it on home video. If you wish to know the true story of Bobby Knight, then get this video. The adult language is surely not for the entire family, but basketball fans of this sort of thing will probably like it. It just depends on your taste for movies. I'm not a basketball fan at all, but I still found this movie to be quite interesting. Bobby Knight, love him or hate him, will go down in history as one of the most greatest hard-boiled basketball coaches of all time. "If you wanna be liked, then don't be a coach" - Bobby Knight.
