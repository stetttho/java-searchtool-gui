 I like this wicked album. "Fiend", "Something Told Me", and "Glow" are among my favorite songs on this CD. However, there is just one little problem: I wish Coal Chamber's headsinger (Dez) would quit trying to sound scary and sing with the normal talented voice he really has. Coal Chamber's past albums were perfect in my opinion, but in the album, Dez tries too hard to make his voice sound dark & disturbing. It can give you a head ache after awhile (depending on who you are). But anyway, this album still kicks buttocks and fans of black/gothic rock and heavy metal should be pleased. Be sure to buy the uncensored version of this CD since it's a lot better than the 'edited version'. You should get your moneys worth.
