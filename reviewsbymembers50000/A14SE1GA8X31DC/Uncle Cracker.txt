 This album is O.K. but nothing new. When I first heard Uncle Cracker singing, I actually thought it was Kid Rock. Why? Because he sounds like Kid Rock. Uncle Cracker is a Kid Rock wannabe. However, he sure can sing. And if you like Kid Rock then you'll love this album right here. Trust me. Just buy it.
