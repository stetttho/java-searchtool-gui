 I loved the first two Batman movies, but I hated this one. This one stunk! Jim Carrey is so annoying as the psychotic Riddler.  Scarface, played by Tommy Lee Jones, was pretty cool. However, this movie just wasn't as dark as the first two films. And Val Kilmer is no Micheal Keaton, who played as Batman is the last two. I think Kilmer makes a lousy replacement for Keaton. The plot in this movie is poor. The script stinks, too! Sorry. That's the way I feel about this silly mess. Batman is old anyway. How about some James Bond or Jackie Chan. Their movies are a heck of a lot better than this.
