 As a huge Marilyn Manson fanatic, I bought this singles CD and it was awesome! It includes "Nobodies" from the Holy Wood album. The LIVE! version of "Nobodies" is very moving and absolutely unforgettable. "The Death Song w/ Bible Speech" is extremely outrageous! Christians should not listen to Manson's blasphemous bible speech. Although I wasn't offended, most people in this religiously brainwashed world will be. So don't say I didn't warn you! Manson reads from the bible and speaks his mind about God's bad influence on young people. The music video for "Nobodies" is also cool. I enjoy owning this disc. It's a must have for every diehard MM fan.
