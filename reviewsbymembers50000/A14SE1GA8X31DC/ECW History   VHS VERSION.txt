 This review refers to the VHS version of ECW History, not the much better DVD version. If you have a DVD player, then buy ECW History on DVD. I bought this video on VHS and it wasn't too good. But on the DVD version, you'll get better bloodier matches including: the barbed wire match between Cactus Jack & The Sandman, and the "stretcher match" between Rob Van Dam & Sabu. Believe me, the DVD version is a heck of a lot better than the VHS version! In my opinion, the VHS version gets only 3 stars, while the DVD version gets 5 stars. Still, a few of the matches on this ECW video stink. But the scaffold match between Tommy Dreamer & Big Diesel, the stretcher match between RVD & Sabu, the cage match between The Eliminators & The Gangstas, and the barbed wire match between Cactus Jack & The Sandman are all worth seeing. Buy this on DVD. You'll be glad you did.
