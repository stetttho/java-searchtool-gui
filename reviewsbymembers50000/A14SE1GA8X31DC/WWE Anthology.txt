 WWE Anthology is a cool album, but is still quite disappointing for a number of reasons. In my opinion, the 1st disc is the best because it features wrestling themes I've never heard and ones that I've wanted for a long time. My favorite track is # 32: "Corporate Ministry". I loved that one best. I also loved: "I'll Be Your Hero" by Lex Express, "Cool Cocky Bad" by the Honky Tonk Man, Bret Hart's theme, Jake 'the snake' Roberts theme, and HBK's theme. Disc 1 was the best to me. However, disc 2 is very disappointing. It contains 35 tracks, and 22 are ones that I've already heard on previous albums. I didn't care to hear DX's theme again! Why so many repeated songs from past WWF albums? The WWF/WWE can't do anything right as far as music is concerned.  This disc proves it!!! Where's Booker T's theme??? Where's the original Raw Is War theme? Where's the original slower version of the Undertaker's 1999 theme, Ministry, which was longer & had louder bell tolls? I don't know, but WWE has ruined this disc. Sorry. That's the way it is. Disc 3 was a tiny bit better, but not much. Eric Bishoff's theme is alright. Trish Stratus's theme is awesome. The Undertaker's theme was also cool, but why 2 slightly-different versions? One version doesn't have the singing and the other does, so what's the big deal? Shane McMahon's theme is very tight. Billy & Chuck's theme sounds like boy band music, and I hate boy bands! Chris Jericho's theme is simply O.K. But if you really want to hear some good music by Saliva, then go buy their albums. Otherwise, steer clear of this track. I hate Chris Jericho! Christian's song is even more horrible, and so is Reverend D-Von's theme. The Hurricane's theme is a cool superhero theme. Torrie Wilson's theme isn't so bad either. This disc could've been a heck of a lot better. Maybe the WWE will somehow manage to get it right next time, with all due respect. However, if you've never owned a wrestling CD before, then make this album your first!
