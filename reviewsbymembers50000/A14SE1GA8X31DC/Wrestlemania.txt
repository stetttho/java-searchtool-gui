 This was an incredible wrestling event. I saw it live on PPV this year and it was awesome! I bought it on DVD when it came out in June. I'm happy to write a review on this DVD. If you're a true wrestling fan, then you should really like this DVD. It has a lot of extras and highlights. Wrestlemania 19 delivers some pretty good wrestling action. Here's a listing of the matches from the event (each one with a star rating): Cruiserweight Championship Matt Hardy vs. Rey Mysterio **1/2 This match was good, except it was way too short!  Still, a great way to start out Wrestlemania. The crowd really got into it. A-Train & Bigshow vs. The Undertaker ** The Undertaker deserved to be placed in a better matchup than this. The match didn't stink. But it didn't make me cheer much either. The ending was cool, with Nathan Jones delivering a big boot to the Bigshow and Undertaker tombstoning A-Train for the win. World Heavyweight Championship  Booker T vs. Triple H ***1/2 BR> HHH can be a pretty boring wrestler. And he's been the WWE World Heavyweight Champion long enough. But this time, Triple H actually had a decent match. While not really a classic, Booker T and HHH did manage to put on one heck of a technical wrestling match, and perhaps one of the best matches of the entire PPV. Sadly, Booker T doesn't win the championship, but the match was a lot better than I'd given it credit for.   Women's Championship  Trish Stratus vs. Victoria vs. Jazz *** The best women's match I've seen in a while! And the hottest babe won! I sure miss Lita.  WWE Tag Team Championship Team Angle vs. Rhyno & Chris Benoit vs. Los Gurreros **1/4    This match could've been a lot better. It wasn't long enough and the ending was a bit disappointing. Overall, it was still fairly good.  Chris Jericho vs. "HBK" Shawn Michaels ***** This was definetly Wrestlemania quality & easily the best match of the night. Shawn Michaels & Chris Jericho stole the show and gave a perfect example of what true technical wrestling is all about!!!  "Stone Cold" Steve Austin vs. The Rock **** Although their match at Wrestlemania 17 was much better, this match still deserves a whole lot of credit & admiration. There was no interference in this match, and we actually got to see who the better man was. This match wasn't nearly as brutal & violent as some of their past wars, but it did live up to its hype. And while Austin couldn't quite beat The Rock this time, it did take 3 rockbottoms just to put him away! Very good match.   "Streetfight" w/ Hogan's career on the line. Vince McMahon vs. Hulk Hogan ****    Going into this match, I didn't know what to expect. There was a ton of hype going into it. As it turned out, it was everything I wanted it to be: bloody, brutal, and highly entertaining. The part where Mr. McMahon legdrops Hogan through the announce table from a ladder was off the page. The match had one heck of a climax. WWE Championship Brock Lesnar vs. Kurt Angle ****1/2 Both men gave everything they had to put on one heck of a matchup. It only dragged on a little bit at a couple of spots, but it still turned out to be one awesome match. It had a terrific flow to it. Great sportsmanship, great athletisicm, and brilliant courage by Kurt Angle (who was suffering from neck trauma) made this match what it was. Kurt Angle was even able to kick out of an F-5. Brock Lesnar messed up on the shooting star press near the end and suffered a mild concussion. This match earns my respect in every way.  The bottomline: Buy this DVD. (...)
