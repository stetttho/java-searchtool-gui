 This was a very good PPV, almost perfect. The wrestling event actually did a good job at living up to it's hype. WWE No Way Out had a little bit of everything; hardcore matches, technical matches, comedy, and even chicks! Here's my review for each wrestling match on the card. And I give every match between 1 and 5 stars. WWE Hardcore Championship match: Raven vs. The Bigshow - This match was a big joke! It was plumb silly with it's cartoonish violence and dull action. This ain't no hardcore matchup! As a result of the ridiculous 24/7 rule, this match looks like a parody of The Three Stooges! Poor. * Fatal Four-Way Match for the WWE Intercontinental Championship: Chris Jericho vs. Chris Benoit vs. X-Pac vs. Eddie Guerrero This was an excellent all-out technical wrestling match, showing just what fatal four-way matches should be about. ****1/2 Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley vs. Trish Stratus - This was a pretty wild catfight between two hot chicks!!! I like the part where Stephanie splashes a jar of water on Trish at ringside! You get to see Trish wet! I love it! Great effort from both ladies. ***1/2 Jerry "The King" Lawler w/ The Kat vs. Steven Richards w/ RTC - O.K. This match stunk! Jerry Lawler lost the match & we didn't get to see The Kat get naked. What a crock! Jerry Lawler has had much better matches that this. * Triple-threat Tag Team title table match: Dudley Boyz vs. Edge & Christian vs. Kane & Undertaker - This match was fair. It didn't blow me away, but it was still entertaining. It had it's moments. *** WWE Championship Match: The Rock vs. Kurt Angle - This was the best match that Kurt Angle & The Rock have had against one another. This match was very entertaining. Great wrestling and good athleticism. It was unpredictable the whole way through. ***** 2-Out-of-3 Falls Match: Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. Triple H 1st Fall: One on One. 2nd Fall: Street Fight! No rules, NO DQ! 3rd Fall: Cage Match! Although this match lived up to it's hype, it dragged on too much. It was also too long! But still, it was a classic feud. Weapons such as barbed wire, ring steps, chairs, the ring bell, a sledge hammer, and T.V. monitors come into play in this bloody war between two of wrestlings top superstars! Not for the faint-hearted. This was a good PPV. I liked it a lot. Buy it while supplies last, or else.............
