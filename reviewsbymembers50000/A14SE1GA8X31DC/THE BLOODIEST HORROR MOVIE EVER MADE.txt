 IF YOU THINK YOU'VE GOT WHAT IT TAKES TO WATCH THIS EXTREMELY GORY ZOMBIE FLICK, THEN GO RIGHT AHEAD. THIS IS THE BLOODIEST HORROR MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN. DEAD ALIVE (UNRATED VERSION) IS NOT FOR THE WEAK OF STOMACH. WHEN A MAN'S MOTHER IS BITTEN BY A SUMATRAN RAT MONKEY, SHE TURNS INTO A ZOMBIE AND GOES ON A RAMPAGE, TURNING HER VICTIMS ALSO INTO ZOMBIES. THE MAN MUST FIGHT TO KEEP HIS HOME TOWN SAFE..........OR ELSE........! IF YOU HAVE A STRONG STOMACH, THEN YOU'LL LOVE THIS MOVIE. IT'S MIXED WITH HORROR & DARK HUMOR, AND IS NOT SUITABLE FOR KIDS. IT CONTAINS NONSTOP VIOLENCE, GOBS OF GORE, BRIEF PROFANIY, AND LOTS OF GROSS SITUATIONS. VIEW AT YOUR OWN RISK. THE ACTING IS SUPERB, THE PLOT IS COOL, AND GOREHOUNDS WILL DEFINETLY GET THEIR MONEY'S WORTH. I GUARANTEE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!
