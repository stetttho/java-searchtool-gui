 This video game-turned action movie is O.K. It's got some pretty good action sequences in it, O.K. performances (except Christopher Lambert's silly performance as a thunder god who speaks in fortune cookie riddles), and a amazing shock-rock soundtrack. However, the plot is shamelessly stolen from the Enter The Dragon. The best fight scene in the movie is the part where Johnny Cage takes on Scorpion. That was awesome. The reptile fight scene is also cool. This movie is violent and savage, but not nearly as gruesome as the popular video games of MK. And the language isn't that bad either.
