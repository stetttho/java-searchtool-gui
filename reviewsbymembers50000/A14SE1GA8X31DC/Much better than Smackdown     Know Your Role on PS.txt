 This game is much better than Smackdown 2-Know Your Role on regular Playstation. The graphics are smoother and clearer, the animation is better, the gameplay is faster, and even better: THERE'S HARDLY ANY LOADING!!! However, this game does have its cons. The commentary gets annoying after a while, but atleast it can be turned off in the options. The story mode is limited. That stinks. Plus, a lot of the matches and wrestlers are similar to the ones on Smackdown 2-KYR on PS. The moves and gameplay hasn't changed much. However, the entrances and superstar themes are very realistic. That's a good thing. The Undertaker comes out on his motorcycle to his correct entrance theme "Rollin'" which is very cool. You can create your own superstar and taunts and everything. That's pretty cool too. You can fight through the crowd a little bit, but not much. That stinks. Plus, there's no freakin' blood! You get to use weapons in this game including a 2x4 wrapped in barbed wire, and when you hit your opponent with it, they don't bleed or anything. That really stinks! Also, a lot of wrestlers aren't included in this game. Where's Tommy Dreamer? Where's RVD? Where's Brock Lesnar? Why the lack of superstars? Of course, if you play through the story mode, you can access more wrestlers and stuff, but nothing too significant. This is not a bad game at all, ...
