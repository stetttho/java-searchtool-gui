 This is the best version of the popular arcade game to ever grace a video game console! Mortal Kombat 3 is perfect on the Playstation. It's exactly like the arcade hit, with the same moves, stages, combos, music, sound fx, characters, and intense brutality. Mortal Kombat Trilogy for Playstation was also a great game, however it did lack in originality. But MK3 does not lack in originality. It is perfect. Infact, since Mortal Kombat was so extremely popular, MK3 put Playstation on the map for good. The arcade story mode is here, and all of the blood, fatalities, animalities, babalities, and friendships are here. The nail-biting stage fatalities are also here, including the gruesome Pit III fatality!!! The game also has a couple of secret cheat menus which allow you to do all sorts of cool stuff. I highly recommend this game to diehard fans.
