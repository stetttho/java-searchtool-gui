 I don't care what anybody else says, Howling V: The Rebirth is an awesome horror movie. When I was a kid, my mom allowed me to rent Howling V: The Rebirth and watch it. For years it gave me terrible nightmares. I had a wild imagination back then and it often got the better of me whenever I watched certain certain things. A group of heirs are invited to a Hungarian castle for a secret werewolf bust. The guests realize to their horror that they are being hunted down by evil. They all have the same birth mark. One of them is a werewolf, and it can only be destroyed by one of its own, someone who has the mark. Howling VI: The Freaks is a pretty cool horror film too. But I like Howling V better. I am glad this movie is finally on DVD.
