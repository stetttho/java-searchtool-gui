 Despite the fact that Drowning Pool's head singer (Dave Williams) died this past summer, this album is still cool. Songs like "Bodies", "Tear Away", "Sinner", and "Serman" are simply awesome. If you like heavy metal and hard rock, then maybe you should check this album out. I'm sorry that Dave Williams died. It makes me a bit angry and sad because Drowning Pool was on its way to becoming possibly one of the biggest heavy metal bands of all time. And everybody who hates this album can kiss my you-know-what!!!!! I say DROWNING POOL STILL ROCKS!!!!!!!!! Elvis Presley is dead and there are still albums of him being made. So Drowning Pool will also never be forgotten in my book. Peace
