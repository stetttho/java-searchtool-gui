 I have been waiting anxiously for this CD to arrive for a long, long time, and I have to say it was well worth the wait. The Golden Age of Grotesque is definetly worth buying for any true Manson fan. Once again, Manson takes us on an incredible music journey, only this time, it's a lot more unique and extremely interesting. The Golden Age of Grotesque welcomes you to explore the exotic sexually-drenched dream world of our star, Manson himself. Oh, yeah, the music, the vocals, and the lyrics are very well done and quite interesting. Of course, this thing is loaded with expicit lyrics, but mature music fans should get a kick out of it. Manson is back & better than ever. I highly recommend this CD. Even if you're not a big Marilyn Manson fan, you still ought to give this CD a try. You might just like it. I bought it today at the mall, and it was incredible.
