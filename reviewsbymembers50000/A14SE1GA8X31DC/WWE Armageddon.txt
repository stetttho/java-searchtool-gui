 This was a good PPV, but not great. The match between Kurt Angle & The Bigshow turned out to be pretty good, with plenty of great effort by both men. The tag-team elimination match (The Dudley Boyz vs. Regal/Storm vs. Jericho/Christian vs. Booker T/Goldust) was surprisingly very good. One of the best tag team matches I've seen in a while. However, the 2 out of 3 Falls match between Shawn Micheals & Triple H was a bit disappointing. It dragged on way too much and was too long! It was very slow at times and the action was a bit bland. The part in which Shawn Micheals whacks Triple H over the forehead w/ a burning 2X4 wrapped in barbed wire is quite interesting. Also, the cage match was entertaining in some ways, especially at the end when Shawn leaps off the cage and crashes HHH through a table! The climax in the 3rd Fall (ladder match) was obviously stolen from the Tables, Ladders, and Chairs matches, but it's still cool when Shawn is shoved off of a ladder through 4 stacked tables! Guess who wins?!!!  Buy this video to add to your collection of wrestling tapes. You'll watch it from time to time. Buy the Survivor Series-Elimination Chamber on DVD.
