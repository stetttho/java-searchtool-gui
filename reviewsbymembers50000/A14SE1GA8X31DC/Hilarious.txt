 When I rented this movie on DVD the other day, I thought it was going to be just like any other teen sex comedy, but I was wrong. This movie was ten times more funny than American Pie or National Lampoons Senior Trip. Not Another Teen Movie lives up to its title, and it was so darn funny that I was laughing outloud. Like Scary Movie did with its horror-genre, Not Another Teen Movie makes fun of other teen movies from the 90's and even the 80's. This awesome DVD also contains special features including: Marilyn Manson's Tainted Love music video, outtakes, deleted scenes, a yearbook, and other exciting features. This movie is rated R for crude humor, nudity, and lots of profanity, but it's so cool. Bottom line? GET IT!!!
