 This is an excellent DVD. I bought it a couple of weeks ago and watched it, and it was definetly worth my time and money. It contains seven full-length matches & a lot of extras. It even contains four easter eggs, or hidden extras. Here's a full list of the matches, each with a star rating. AWA Tag Team Championship match The Rockers vs. Buddy Rose & Doug Summers: This was actually a pretty good tag team matchup, with plenty of great effort from both teams. The heated tension in this match continues to build up and finally turns into an all-out brawl between the two teams! While not match of the year candidate, this match still deserves a good bit of credit. *** Intercontinental Championship Ladder match Shawn Michaels vs. Razor Ramond: This was a very exciting ladder match. Both men worked hard & put forth a lot of effort just to make this match a classic. And by all means, they succeeded. This is not my favorite ladder match ever because I have seen better, but it sure is historical. **** WWE Championship Iron Man match Shawn Michaels vs. Bret 'The Hitman' Hart: Now this is match of the year candidate, folks! This is what professional wrestling is all about. With tons of great submission holds, awesome aerial and technical wrestling tactics, and tremendous athletisicm, you can't get any better than this. ***** No Holds Barred match Shawn Michaels vs. Diesel: This matchup was quite interesting, with plenty of clean hardcore action and brutality. There was surprisingly NO blood in this physical battle, although it was still pretty violent, especially the part where Diesel powerbombs HBK through the announce table.  ***1/4 WWE Championship match Shawn Michaels vs. Mankind: I agree with Mick. This was definetly the best match of his career, with great psychology, great timing, and tremendous athletisicm. However, the stupid DQ at the end of the match is the only reason why I'm not giving it 5 stars. ****1/2 Hell In a Cell match Shawn Michaels vs. The Undertaker: This was the very first Hell In a Cell match, and it kicks @$$. HBK recieves perhaps the worst beating of his wrestling career. Kane also makes his debut in this bloody matchup. ***** Non-Sanctioned match Shawn Michaels vs. Triple H: This classic match from Summerslam 2002 is absolutely amazing. Infact, this was HBK's memorable comeback match. HBK and Triple H beat the heck out of each other, using various weapons such as garbage cans, a sledgehammer, a ladder, a table, steel chairs, and a leather belt. *****  The bottomline: BUY THIS DVD NOW!!! DON'T BUY IT ON VHS UNLESS YOU WANT NOTHING BUT CLIPS AND HIGHLIGHTS. BUY IT ON DVD AND YOU'LL GET YOUR MONEY'S WORTH!!
