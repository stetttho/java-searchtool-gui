 This is a terrific movie mixed with romance, comedy, action, drama, and suspense. Patrick Swayze stars as a banker who is suddenly murdered by an armed thug, thus leaving his poor girlfriend (Demi Moore) behind. Patrick is now a ghost who must solve the true reason to why he was murdered. By doing so, he uses the aid of a psychic (Whoopie Goldberg) to help him warn his sweetheart of a similar fate. The crimes are hard edged, the cast is awesome, the special effects are cool, and Whoopie Goldberg is howlingly funny. Buy this movie if you've never seen it. If you like collecting movies, then don't bother to resist and add this to your collection. This is a true classic. NOTE: This movie is rated PG-13, but contains a ton of profanity, including violence and a sex scene.
