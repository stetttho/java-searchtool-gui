 ...I went to the darn theater with my family to see this movie, and it blew me away!!! The special effects & nonstop action/suspense were off the page!!! The acting was good, the characters were quite interesting, and the plot was splendid as well....Die Another Day made me a new James Bond fan. This movie gets an easy five stars in my opinion. If you're a true James Bond fan, then get this movie!!! YOU WON'T REGRET IT!!!!!
