 Corbin Bernsen stars as a wealthy dentist who begins losing his mind after catching his beautiful wife cheating on him with the swimming pool cleaner. He knows that if he divorces her, she'll take half of everything he has. His intense fear of losing it all causes him to lose his own mind. So, he begins taking out his frustrations on his unsuspecting patients. The result is a chilling bloodbath that'll make you think twice before going back to the dentist. This movie is definetly not for the easily offended. The scene in which Bernsen rapes a female patient is in bad taste. But gorehounds will not be disappointed! This movie would've been even better if the conclusion hadn't of fallen short. This movie is still cool though. If you got the 'nerves' to watch this, then get it. You'll like it.
