 Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4 is awesome. The gameplay is cool. The graphics are realistic. It's extremely challanging and very addictive. It features plenty of neat stuff such as cheats, tricks, hidden skaters, different levels, and more. Unfortunatly, as good as this game is, it does have its cons. For one thing, the music soundtrack is awful. Also, some of the goals are extremely difficult, even if you have all the cheats in the game. The time is a real thorn in the side. Infact, speaking of time, there are some goals in the game that must be completed in a matter of 10 to 20 seconds, or else you'll fail it. That stinks! But most of the time they give you 2 minutes. Plus, this game should've had more levels and cheats than it did. Where's the Level Select code? And where in the heck are the special 2 player challanges?  Anyway, this is not a bad game. It's very hard at times, but is still cool. I recommend this game for experts only. It does require a lot of patience and intellegence. Instead of collecting tapes you're having to collect money. You use the money to buy your way through the game. That's the object, and it can be exhausting.
