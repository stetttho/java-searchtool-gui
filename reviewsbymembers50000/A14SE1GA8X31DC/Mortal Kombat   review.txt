 Mortal Kombat 2 for Sega Genesis is a good game, but far from perfect. MK2 on the Super Nintendo blows this one away! On this game, the music and sound fx are a bit bland. The graphics aren't so bad. The fatalities look fairly good, but compared to the ones on the SNES version, they seem a bit lame. Like whenever you blow your opponent up, instead of their bones & body parts splattering all over the ground, they simply disappear whenever landing on the ground! That really stinks!! The only reason I give this game 3 stars instead of 2 is because the game features a secret cheat option, which is pretty cool. The SNES version of MK2 doesn't have a darn cheat option. The bottom line: if you want an enjoyable version Mortal Kombat 2, buy it on the Super Nintendo (SNES).
