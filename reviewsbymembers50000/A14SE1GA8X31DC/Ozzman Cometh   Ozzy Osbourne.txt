 Ozzy Osbourne is one of the best hard rock/heavy metal singers of all time. While I can't stand any of his new music, I can't get enough of his old music. Back in his prime, he had the greatest heavy metal voice ever. Black Sabbath was an awesome band, and this disc proves it. Ozzy is the best ever.
