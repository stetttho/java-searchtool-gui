 Mortal Kombat Trilogy is a pretty good game for N64. But compared to the Playstation version, it's just a small combination of the past three MK games and nothing more. The graphics are okay, the animation is fair, but the sounds & music are ... poor! It would be better to put the volume on mute while playing it. Plus, the N64's control doesn't quite do well with this sort of game. There are three really cool cheat menu's on this game though. However, for whatever reason, there is NO one-button-fatalities cheat! You have to press a certain combination of buttons on your controller in order to do all the finishing moves. That really...!!!! Plus, every stage uses music from MK3. That gets really annoying after a while.  My advice to MK fans: BUY THIS GAME FOR THE PLAYSTATION! YOU'LL GET YOUR MONEY'S WORTH! On the playstation version of MKT, you get all the characters from all of the MK games, including their own set of moves and fatalities. Plus, there are more cheats, secrets, and even the popular one-button-fatalities cheat is on here!!! All of the stages are here, and the graphics, sounds, music, animation, and controls are excellent!!! Buy this on your Playstation, and avoid the N64 version. ...
