 The original Terminator was a good movie. But T2 blows that one away!!! Arnold Schwarzenegger is the good guy in this astounding sequel. He is sent to protect John Conner, a rebellious teenager who will be the leader and savior of earth in the future. The ultimate enemy in this blockbuster movie is none other than the almighty T-1000 (Robert Patrick), a killing machine made of liquid metal. The Terminator (Arnold) must protect John Conner from the T-1000. The word as not yet been invented to describe the special effects, especially the most nightmarish holocaust scene yet! Ofcourse, this movie is loaded with strong intense violence and action, as well as profanity. This is the best sci-fi action film ever!!! Watch it for yourself and try to make up your own mind. This movie will blow you away!!! It's very moving, gripping, and absolutely unforgettable.
