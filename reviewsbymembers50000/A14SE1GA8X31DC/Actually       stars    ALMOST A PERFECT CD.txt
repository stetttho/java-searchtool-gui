 I hate N'Sync, Backstreet Boys, and Five. But there's just something special about Vertical Horizon that I love. Their music is beautiful and very moving, especially track # 4: "Best I Ever Had (Grey Sky Morning)".  Some of the singing is a bit cheesy, but the music is so beautiful that I can't help but like it. Vertical Horizon are awesome at making feel-good music. Sure, a lot of the songs on this CD are about love, but the music is very soothing to listen to. I bought this CD at Wal-Mart on my birthday last year, and it was worth my money.
