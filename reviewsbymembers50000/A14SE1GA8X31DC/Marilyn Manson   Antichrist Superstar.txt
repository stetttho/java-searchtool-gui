 I don't understand why so many people hate Marilyn Manson like they do. Marilyn Manson is no different from any other hard rock/heavy metal singer. Sure, he's gothic! OF course, he's satanic! But that's what makes him so cool. However, Mr. Manson does like to speak against God. So if you're religious in any way, my best advice is for you to avoid this album. It has some very explicit lyrics, many of which I can't write in this review. And even though his shock-rock music isn't for all tastes, he's certainly one of the best gothic entertainers out there. In this album, Mr. Manson produces some of the most electrifying shock-rock ever heard. Heck, even Gene Simmons (Kiss) and Alice Cooper never dreamed of taking things quite this far.   The disc kicks off with the "Irresponsible Hate Anthem" which makes an excellent opening track. Then from there it's "Beautiful People", one of the best songs ever! "The Reflecting God" is tight. "Man That You Fear" is very moving and depressing, but that's what makes it a classic. Also, let's not forget about the title track, "Antichrist Superstar", a song so incredible that it gives me chills and makes me wanna cheer along with it. I love it!!! "Deformography" is pretty tight. "Cryptorchild" is probably the least best song on this album, but still cool though.  I would strongly recommend this album to those who aren't easily offended. Christians who hear this music will not be pleased. As an atheist, this kind of music doesn't offend me the least bit. Bottomline: I LOVE IT!!!! Peace.
