 This was a very good PPV. "Stone Cold" Steve Austin returns to the WWE ring to take on Eric Bischoff. And of course, Eric gets the cr@p beaten out of him, along with 4 stunners!!! The Rock vs. Hulk Hogan 2 was much better than the one they had at Wrestlemania 18 last year in Toronto, Canada. Also, witness the heel turn of "The People's Champion." The other matches on the card are watchable,too. Buy this PPV on home video, whether you get it on VHS or DVD. It's a must-have for your wrestling video collection.
