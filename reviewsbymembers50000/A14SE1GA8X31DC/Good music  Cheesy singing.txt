 This album has some cool jams on it, but the some of the  singing is a bit cheesy though. The Immortals can make some very good techno music, but they definetly aren't the best singers around. I still like this album though. The main Mortal Kombat theme "Techno Syndrome" is cool and makes a good workout song. Johnny Cage's theme "Prepare Yourself" is also cool. It's the perfect movie star theme. Rayden's theme "Eternal Life" was very cool and 'electrifying'. Sub Zero's song "Chinese Ninja Warrior" is slightly moving and O.K. Not my favorite though. Goro's theme "The Outworld Prince" was kind of tight. Scorpion's theme "Lost Soul Bent On Revenge" was fair. Kano's song "Use Your Might" is O.K. Lui Kang's theme "Born In China" was cool but the sound fx of Lui Kang fighting in the background is silly. The last song on the album isn't that good.  But this album is good. If you like techno then you might find yourself liking this. Mortal Kombat - The Movie Soundtrack - is ten times better than this though.
