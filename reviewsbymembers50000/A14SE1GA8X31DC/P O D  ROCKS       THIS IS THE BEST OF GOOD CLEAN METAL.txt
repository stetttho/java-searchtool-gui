 P.O.D. doesn't swear in any of their music, but they are one of the finest heavy metal bands around. The album itself gets an easy 5 stars. The DVD, however, gets only 3 1/2 stars. Here's why: On the CD song # 4 (Youth of the Nation) is very moving and beautifully played. However, on the DVD, Youth of the Nation (LIVE) doesn't sound as well. The DVD doesn't have too many good features, so if I were you, I'd simply just buy the album without the DVD. P.O.D. Satellite is simply awesome. That's all I can say about it. Songs like: Set It Off, Boom, Masterpiece Conspiracy, Alive, and many others are all beautifully played and wonderfully sung.
