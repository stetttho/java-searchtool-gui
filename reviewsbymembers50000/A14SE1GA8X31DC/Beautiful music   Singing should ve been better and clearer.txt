 This album has some very pretty music in it. However, the singing by Harriet Wheeler is a bit cheesy and sometimes unclear. I can't understand what she's saying in some of the songs on this CD. "Wild Horses" is a very moving song and is sung quite well. "Goodbye" is also cool. A few of the songs sound terrible. If you like feel-good music, then you'll probably like this album.  What else can I say? Try it for yourself and see what you think.
