 I'm not a BIG Ozzy Osbourne fan, but this show is pretty cool. The only thing I don't like about it is the constant swearing. The profanity doesn't offend me, but the 'bleeping' censorship does. Just about every word they say is 'bleeped' by the darn T.V. censors. But if this video is really uncensored, then I'll surely be buying it. The Osbournes is funny, crude, and moving at times. Ozzy might be old, but he's still cool. I don't care for his music too much, but The Osbournes are pretty cool.
