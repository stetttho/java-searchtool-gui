 Puddle of Mudd is too overrated and not what it's deemed to be. The only song on it worth hearing is "Blurry", which is very moving. The other tracks are ... poor. "Control" is O.K. but gets old after awhile. "She Hates Me" is pathetic. I know some of the simple songs are best, but "She Hates Me" is just too simple. I can write it better. As for the album itself, the lyrics [not good], the music is rather cheesy, and the singing is also pretty bad. Avoid this album. It's overhyped and overrated too much. Listen to some of the samples on this website before buying. You'll be glad you did.
