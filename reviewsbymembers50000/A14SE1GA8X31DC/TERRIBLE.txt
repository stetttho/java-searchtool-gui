 This is the worst game I have ever played on the Playstation. It takes way too long to load, the gameplay is slow, and the graphics are just terrible! I can knock my opponent over the head numerous times and he'll just stand there! I could hit my special until I couldn't no more and throw him off the top of the Hell In a Cell. Then I could hit all my specials again and pin him and guess what? I WOULDN'T EVEN BE ABLE TO GET A FREAKIN' ONE COUNT! Then you have to dive halfway across the wrestling ring just to get the darn championship belt in a ladder match. You can't 3-D anybody through a table either. THAT STINKS! The only ways you can drive them through a table is: Powerbomb, Piledriver, Rock Bottom, or a top rope move!!! Gosh, that really stinks! And in the Season Mode it will make you do all sorts of B.S. loading just so it can say: '(Whoever) Is here tonight'! or '(Whoever) seems satisfied with the victory'! That is downright pathetic and very exhausting! The game freezes sometimes and loads too much. DO NOT BUY THIS TRASH! Rent it, but PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ON THIS GAME! SAVE YOUR MONEY FOR SOMETHING ELSE! ...
