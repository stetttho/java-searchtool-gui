 WWE Badd Blood was a good PPV. The Hell In a Cell match between Triple H and Kevin Nash was very brutal. The two ferocious combatants tore into each other, using steel chairs, ring steps, a hammer, a sledgehammer, a screw driver, and even the infamous 2x4 wrapped in barbed wire!!! The result is a bloodbath, and Mick Foley even serves as the special guest referee.  Shawn Micheals takes on Ric Flair in a matchup that I expected to be a classic. Unfortunately, it wasn't that much of a classic, but still fairly good. I like the part where Shawn frog-splashes Ric Flair through a wooden table at ringside. The match between Booker T and Christian was doing pretty good until Christian chickened out and got himself disqualified. That stinks!!! Scott Steiner takes on Test to determine who gets Stacy Keabler for manager. Test did a good job getting heat from the crowd. Steiner does his job and teaches Test a lesson. Not too bad of a match. The redneck contest between Eric Bischoff and Steve Austin is absolutely hilarious and quite interesting. Austin humiliates Eric by beating him in a burping contest, and finally throwing him in a muddy pig pen. Oh, and the "poon-tang pie scene" involving 70 year old Mae Young is outrageously funny.  I would recommend this WWE video to diehard wrestling fans and Hell In a Cell buffs.
