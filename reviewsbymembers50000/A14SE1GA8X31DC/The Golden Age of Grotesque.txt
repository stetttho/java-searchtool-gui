 Well, the wait is over. Marilyn Manson is back and better than ever w/ his new disc, The Golden Age of Grotesque. I highly recommend this album to all hard rock/heavy metal fans, especially MM fans, who will all get a kick out of this album. The music sounds better than ever, and the lyrics are quite interesting. It's definetly a fresh new start for Mr. Manson, as he successfully produces incredibly unique music for 2003. It's unique because it's a lot different from his past albums. Antichrist Superstar and Holy Wood were two very dark albums, producing shock-rock and metal mayhem. The Golden Age of Grotesque, however, is a little bit different. It offers Manson's view on contemporary society, especially sex. Yep, I said it. This album welcomes you to explore Manson's bizarre sexual dream world, and mature audiences should get a true kick out of it.
