 O.K. It goes like this: I recently sold my copy of this tape because I never watched it anymore. The first few times I watched this video (after I bought it) was fun. But after a while, it got boring. Most of the stuff on this video is just scenes & moments of the Austin-McMahon feud. If you want a video on the rivalry between S.C. Steve Austin & Mr. McMahon then go buy the McMahon vs. Austin home video. This video is uncensored too. That's the only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. There's a scene in which Cactus Jack is cutting a promo in the ring, and he says the GD word twice. Also, there's a part where Val Venis is about to be castrated by some enemies, and you can see his nakad behind when security breaks into the locker room. The story of The Undertaker & Kane is kind of cool, but nothing much. This video focuses on the feud between Austin & McMahon too much. Don't waste your hard earned money on this. Find something else to buy.
