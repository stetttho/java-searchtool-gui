 The Neverending Story is an awesome fantasy tale about a boy who discovers a mythical book at a library and steals it. He begins reading it and becomes captured into the fantasy world of it. Great entertainment. However, the scene in which the horse dies in the 'swamps of sadness' is a bit depressing. Other than that, this movie is a true classic. Get it.
