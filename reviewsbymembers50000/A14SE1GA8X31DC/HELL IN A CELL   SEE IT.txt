 WWE No Mercy was a very cool pay-per-view event which took place in Little Rock, AR. A friend of mine recorded it off PPV and let me borrow it. I watched it, and it was pretty cool. But the only match you'll probably care about seeing is the Hell In a Cell match between Brock Lesnar & The Undertaker. Anybody that says wrestling is 'all fake', I dare that person to eat supper while watching Hell In a Cell. The Undertaker & Brock Lesnar beat the...out of each other. At one point, Lesnar throws a set of steel steps at Undertaker, and next thing you know, he's got blood literally pouring from a nasty gash on his forehead. Blood spatters all over ringside, all over the wrestling ring, & I mean EVERYWHERE!This match is ECW quality! No barbed wire or thumbtacks, and no fighting ontop of the cell, but still very gruesome and disturbing at times. Gorehounds will surely love this one! Be sure & order this video right now here on Amazon.com  You'll get your money's worth, even if you get it just for the Cell match.  P.S. The Hell In a Cell match is quite graphic and may never see the light of day on cable TV. TOO BLOODY!... ALSO: IF YOU'RE A WRESTLING FAN WHO HATES PAUL HEYMAN, THEN YOU'LL ALSO GET A KICK OUT OF THE CELL MATCH!
