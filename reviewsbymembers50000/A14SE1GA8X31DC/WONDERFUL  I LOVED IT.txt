 Silence of the Lambs was a terrific thriller. Jodie Foster was excellent as a police officer who  seeks a cannibal's help to catch a gruesome serial killer. Dr. Hannibal Lecture (Hopkins) is very realistic as the cannibalistic psycho who helps Foster catch a serial killer named Buffalo Bill. Ofcourse, this movie isn't necessarily for the weak-stomached, but is definetly worth a look. The plot is realistic, the suspense is unpredictable, and the climax is chilling. I love it. This movie deserved the Best Picture oscar, and thank god it got it. Hannibal was a rather lackluster sequel to this film, but still sort of cool. Check out this movie and you'll like it.
