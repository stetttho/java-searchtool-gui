 If you love horror movies about werewolves then this is the flick for you. This movie has a lot of cool werewolves and a lot of scary scenes that'll make you jump out of your seat! The characters & actors are O.K. and so is the plot. The story is about a news lady who visits a ranch and eventually discovers that the place is flocked with werewolves! This movie isn't really suitable for kids, but older teens and adults should get a big kick out of it. The film does contain a lot of gruesome adult horror, as well as nudity and some sexual content. I highly recommend this horror classic to anyone with a taste for it.
