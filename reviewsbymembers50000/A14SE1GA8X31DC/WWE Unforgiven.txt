 This PPV was fair, but for the most part, it was rather boring. The return of Stone Cold Steve Austin was sort of interesting, as he searches for the person who ran him down with the automobile a year earlier at the 1999 Survivor Series. I like the part where Austin delivers 3 stunners to Shane McMahon in the ring and drinks beer. That was cool. Otherwise, the rest of this PPV stunk. Don't waste your money on this. Buy something else.
