 I bought this CD a week ago and it was a bit disappointing. The music isn't hard enough. I like hard rock/pop and heavy metal, but Gravity is nothing more than just another boyband. The only song I really liked was track # 6 "Not Enough", which is very moving. Tracks # 2 and 5 were O.K. but not worth listening to all the time. Our Lady Peace is a sellout. This album proves it. Buy Vertical Horizon or Linkin Park, but avoid this. The singing is cheesy and the music stinks for the most part.
