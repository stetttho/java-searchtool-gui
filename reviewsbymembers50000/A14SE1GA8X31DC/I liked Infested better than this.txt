 I didn't particularly care for this album to much. Papa Roach's last album, Infested, was a lot better in my opinion. Lovehatetragedy was boring and not as interesting as I thought it would be. Papa Roach kind of stinks. Every song on this album sounds just about the same and I don't like it. Sorry. I prefer Infested over this one any day.
