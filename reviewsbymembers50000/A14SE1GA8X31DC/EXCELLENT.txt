 This is some pretty tight music. Tracks by Drowning Pool, System of a Down, Creed, P.O.D., Coal Chamber, Flaw, and Rob Zombie w/ Ozzy Osbourne make this album a true hit. My favorite song is Iron Head by Rob Zombie w/ Ozzy Osbourne. This was a cool song! This album is great. What more can I say? Get it!!
