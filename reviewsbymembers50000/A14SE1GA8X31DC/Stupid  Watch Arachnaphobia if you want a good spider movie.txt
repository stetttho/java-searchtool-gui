 I went with my dad to see this in theaters and it was truly pathetic. It wasn't very scary at all. It only had a couple of jump scenes at the beginning and that's it. The "eight legged freaks" look fake. They're so darn computerized and cartoonish that you'll wish to return this to your local rental store. Don't buy this movie. It's not worth your hard earned money. Now if you want to see a REALLY good thriller with spiders, then buy Arachnaphobia (starring Jeff Bridges and John Goodman. Trust me, you'll get your money's worth. But if you still want to see Eight Legged Freaks, then rent it first before deciding to buy it. If you rent it, watch it, and really enjoy it, then go ahead and buy the darn thing. But keep in mind this is my opinion. Watch it for yourself & make up your own mind about this 'freakin' movie.  It had some O.K. action scenes in it but nothing to blow me away though. I've seen better than this. And that's all I've got to say.
