 This PPV was O.K. but not worth buying on home video. I rented this and watched it. I would not recommend anyone buying this. Just rent it like I did. It's not worth your money. The Undertaker takes on Stone Cold Steve Austin for the WWE Championship in a no-holds-barred match. This match wasn't as good as I expected. It only gets good near the end when The Undertaker starts beating everybody up with a steel chair (Vince McMahon, Steve Austin, and Triple H). If you ever wanted to see Stone Cold wrestling as a heel (bad guy)  then you'll need to see this matchup.   Triple H takes on Kane for the Intercontinental Championship in a chain match. This match also could've been a heck of a lot better than it was. Triple H gets "busted open" in this match, but nothing much here. This was probably this best match on this PPV.  The triple-threat match for the Hardcore title - Test vs. The Big Show vs. Rhino - was boring and pathetic. William Regal takes on Rikishi in the very 1st match on the card, and ends up getting the 'stinky face' from the 'phat man'. Regal gets his head slammed onto the steel ring steps and he begins bleeding a little bit. Lita takes on Chyna for the Women's title in a fairly good match. I wish Lita would've won this match since Chyna later retired from wrestling.  This PPV wasn't so bad, but it was fair. I've seen better. Rent this video, but don't buy it. A few O.K. matches doesn't make a good PPV.  Get it?
