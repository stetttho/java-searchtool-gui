 This album was good. Not great but just plain good. My favorite song on this album is "All In The Family". I thought that song was funny as hell. And "Freak On a Leash" is also very good. "Dead Bodies Everywhere" is pretty tight. If you're a Korn fan then you'll probably love this CD. I have heard better than this but this album is still enjoyable.
