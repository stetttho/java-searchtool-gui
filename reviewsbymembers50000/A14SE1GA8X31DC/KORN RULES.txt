 If you're a true Korn fan and don't own this album, then you need to buy it. It is so cool. the opening song "Twist" is simply awesome. Songs like "Good God" and "Porno Creep" and "No Place To Hide" are also tight. However, if you're offended by extreme vulgarity and profanity, then you'd best steer clear of this album. The lyrics are very explicit. Track # 8: "K@#%!" is very raunchy! It is a trashy song dedicated to spiteful women.
