 I love this music. I listen to it nonstop everyday. Call me crazy if you want but I could really care less. In my opinon, Mr. Manson is the best hard rock/heavy metal singer EVER!!! He's kooky, he's wicked, and he's not afraid to speak his mind. In this incredible album, Manson sings his evil heart out with smash hits like Lunch Box and Dope Hat. Oh, and did I forget to mention that this album IS NOT for the easily offended? VERY EXPLICIT LYRICS!!! On track # 7: Get Your Gunn, the GD word is used 7 times, and the F word is used several times as well. But despite that, Marilyn Manson is awesome and is one heck of a singing artist. What more can I say? GET IT!!!  P.S. Kids, put your parents to bed! They can't handle listening to this!
