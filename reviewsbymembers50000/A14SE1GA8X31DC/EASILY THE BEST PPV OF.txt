 A friend recorded this on PPV and let me borrow it. I watched it and enjoyed it so much that I didn't want to give it back. It was that freakin' good! Ofcourse, I did return it, and now I can't wait to buy it when it comes out on home video. WWE Wrestlemania 18 this year was terrible, but the WWE Survivor Series was the best ever. Bubba Ray Dudley, Spike Dudley, and Jeff Hardy took on Rosie, Jamal, and Rico in an incredible tag team table match. Also, Trish Stratus takes on Victoria in a hardcore match, and both women beat the cr@p out of eachother.  Brock Lesnar took on The Bigshow for the WWE Undisputed Championship in a short but cool matchup. I loved the part where Lesnar actually man handles the 500 pound Bigshow! You have to see it to believe it! However, the conclusion of the match is shocking to say the least. The elimination chamber match was very good. Rob Van Dam, Booker T, Kane, Shawn Micheals, Chris Jericho, and Triple H squared off in this awesome main event. The conclusion of the grueling chamber match is very moving and exciting! The bottomline: GET THIS VIDEO WHEN IT COMES OUT! IF YOU'RE A TRUE WRESTLING FAN THEN YOU NEED TO BUY THIS THING! BELIEVE ME, IT'S WORTH IT!
