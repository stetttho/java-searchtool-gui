 If you're a true wrestling fan then you need to get this video right now. Do like I did and order it off Amazon.com and they will ship it right to you. Believe me, it's worth it a lot. Shawn Micheals takes on Triple H in a non-sanctioned match, meaning that there are no rules, no count outs, no time limit. If you think the match between The Rock & Hollywood Hulk Hogan at Wrestlemania 18 was something, then wait until you see HBK vs. Triple H. These two men beat each other up with chairs, ring steps, ladders, a sledgehammer, a leather belt, tables, and garbage cans. This has to be the best match this year so far. It's bloody, violent, and truly unforgettable. The brutal and distasteful sledgehammer attack following the matchup is NOT for the faint of heart. But this match is truly a classic.  Also, The Rock takes on Brock Lesnar for the WWE Undisputed Championship. This match was also enjoyable, especially the part where Paul Heyman is rockbottomed through the spanish announce table by The Rock. The Rock was booed an awful lot in this match. I don't really know why. But the fans seemed to be more behind Lesnar than The Rock.  The other matches on the card were O.K. but nothing compared to the double main event. Buy this video. It's worth your money. It was certainly worth mine.
