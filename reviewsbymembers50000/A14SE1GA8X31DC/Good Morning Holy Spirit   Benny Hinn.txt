 Here lately, I have become highly critical of television preachers who don't devulge the details of how they raise & spend their money, especially Benny Hinn. Benny Hinn's crusades are more organized than a political convention, and he's a master fund raiser. Infact, Pastor Benny is one of the most successful fund raisers in history. I say he's in the business of raising big money and spreading his own celebrity. As far as this book is concerned, it's just too good to be true. In Good Morning Holy Spirit, Benny Hinn claims that he's actually seen God and spoken with him in person. In the bible, God himself says that "no man can see me and live." So Benny Hinn must be a false prophet. There are so many sick people who go to his miricle crusades expecting a miricle, and they sadly leave the crusade still sick & hurting. I could go on & on ranting about this false healing ministry, but I'll keep it short and sweet. Benny Hinn is a false prophet! If you have common sense, then don't support this lying ministry. Support Billy Graham or Pat Roberson.
