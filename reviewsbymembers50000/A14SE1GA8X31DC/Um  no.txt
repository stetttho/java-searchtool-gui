 If you love hardcore wrestling, then avoid this! It's not hardcore, except for the streetfight between Cactus Jack & Triple H from Royal Rumble 2000. The other matches stink. WWE has had its share of good hardcore matches, but not like ECW, XPW, or NWA. Over the last couple of years, the WWE has revolved too much around stupid storylines and wrestlers who portray silly comic-book characters. I'd rather watch a wrestling show that has real athleticism and not two men in underwear pretending to fight. The WWE doesn't take its hardcore matches seriously. Heck, they ruined the hardcore championship with the pathetic 24/7 rule. They use fake blood too much. The matches are becoming so darn predictable and dull. A few great matches a year isn't enough to make me wanna tune in every other night of the week. My suggestions: how about some ECW, XPW, or NWA? Now that's real hardcore athletic entertainment.
