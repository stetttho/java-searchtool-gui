 I am a big Marilyn Manson fan, and I own a lot of his albums including this one. Out of all the Marilyn Manson CD's, this one is probably the least best. Don't get me wrong, it does have some pretty good songs (Sweet Dreams, Kiddie Grinder, Everlasting C******, and Rock 'n' Roll N*****) but most of it is just a bunch of ridiculous skits and wierd eerie sound fx. It's strictly for fans that appreciate wierd musical art with an eerie touch to it. Others should steer clear if they want some real music. Most of the songs on this album are remixes from songs on Portrait of an American Family. Portrait of an American Family is a much better album by the way.
