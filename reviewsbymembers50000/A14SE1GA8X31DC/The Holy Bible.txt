 Christianity is a plagiarism of the sun god Mithra, a poorly written thought virus that was used by the Romans to control their slaves. No first century historian confirms the existance of Jesus. None of the Jewish or Roman historians living during the time in which Jesus was said to have lived wrote one word about him. The birth, life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ is documented in only one source, the bible. Now if there were other Jewish or even Pagan historical documents showing that Jesus really was around at the time in which he was said to have been around, you would have something. But to date, NOBODY has been able to produce such a record! You don't believe bigfoot is real because you read it in a tabloid, do you? The bible is just like a tabloid. It contains a lot of extraordinary hearsay evidence. However, extraordinary claims need extraordinary evidence. Yes, I am an atheist, but not without careful consideration. The bible is flooded with contradictions, but that's not the main reason I refuse to believe in god. There are more than 5,000 different gods out there and everybody has their own opinion to which one they want to believe. As for me, rather than believing in comforting lies and hearsay evidence, I choose to follow that which can be proven and used in a clear state of truth. I depend on science and research to find the answers & solutions for my life. Instead of living on biblical fables and blind faith, I rely on true knowledge and my free will to accept life as it is. The bible is hearsay evidence, much less a fairy tale. I would strongly advise anyone to be more skeptical and do more research on things before taking them for granted.
