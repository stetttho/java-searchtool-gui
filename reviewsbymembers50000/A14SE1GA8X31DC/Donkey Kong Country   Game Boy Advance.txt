 Although it's not nearly as good as the SNES version, it's still a pretty cool game. The graphics are a little bit better than I expected. However, the gameplay is more complicated and some of the added sounds are annoying (like whenever Donkey Kong falls and makes an annoying scream). The music is okay. The enemies are a lot easier to bump into, even if you own a Game Boy Advance SP. Some of the levels are out of order and a couple of the bosses are more difficult to beat. The balloons float a lot faster and you can't jump as good as what you could on the SNES version. In my opinion, this game gets 3 1/4 stars. Still, it's a great game to carry around while traveling. It's fun, more challanging, and not bad for a hand held game.
