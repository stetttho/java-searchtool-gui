 The bible is a poorly written thought virus that was used by the Romans to control their slaves. Many of the Romans living today have admitted to the lie. As for me, I depend on logic and real historical documents, not inadmissable evidence like the bible. Science explains things much better than so-called biblical "doctrine." To live a religious life, one must be able to lack the ability to reason and thus allow blind faith to consume their minds. I choose understanding and the simple life gift of knowledge. The truth is more appealing to me than comforting lies, myths, fables, and poetry.
