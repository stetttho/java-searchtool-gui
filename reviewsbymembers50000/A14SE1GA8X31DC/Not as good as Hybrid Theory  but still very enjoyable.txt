 Linkin' Park does make a successful comeback with this new album, Meteora, following their last smash hit album, Hybrid Theory. I liked Hybrid Theory little bit better, but Meteora definetly delivers. It's quite enjoyable and worth buying for any true Linkin' Park fan. However, this album doesn't seem to have as much unique rap-metal style as Hybrid Theory did. It's more of a hard rock album than a mix of rap-metal. But it's still a cool CD. I enjoy it.
