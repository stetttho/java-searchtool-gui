 O.K. This CD wasn't all that bad. I mean, compare these tracks to the ones on WWF-The Music, Volume 5 (which was a terrible album in my opinion) and this is a pretty cool album. Here's what I think about the themes on this album: 1) Break Down the Wall - this is one of the best songs on the CD. Pump up the volume on this one. ****  2) Big - This one stunk. A "BIG" clunker! * 3) No Chance In Hell - this one is kind of cool. "No chance, yeah that's what you've got! We're up against a machine to strong, them busy politicians buying souls for us are puppets who'll find their place in line, so tie a string around your finger now, boy, 'cause it's just a matter of time!" *** 4) Sexual Chocolate - good romantic song, but nothing too special. ** 5) This Is a Test - very poor and stupid. I don't know who sings this theme but I can't understand a word they're saying except "Test, this is a test, test, test, this is a test". Poor. * 6) Wreck - this is a fair track with some cool sound fx of car crashes, but nothing to get real excited about. The clapping really turns me off though. **1/2 7) Oh, Hell Yeah - in my opinion, this is Stone Cold Steve Austin's worst theme song ever! The cool music can't help with the extremely cheesy singing. Sorry. This song stinks. * 8) Danger At the Door - pretty cool song. The singing is O.K. The music is tight... Cool. *** 9) Blood Brother - O.K. theme but no singing or anything. ** 10)Ass Man - this song is kind of funny. If you like songs about butts then you need to hear this track. ***1/2 11) Ministry - this Undertaker theme was a bit of a letdown in my opinion. Why? Because it wasn't like the slow eerie version that he used throughout 1999. It's a much faster version with lower bell tolls. What a rip off! I loved the slower spookier version that the Undertaker used in 1999, not this! Terrible! *  12) My Time - this is easily the best song on the entire album. Great singing, music, and good beat. It sings against politics, stupid rules, and stuff like that. Enjoyable. *****  13) On the Edge - Pretty good dance music if you ask me. Play this at parties. Otherwise, steer clear of it. I kind of like it though. **1/2 14) Know Your Role - I didn't like this song very much. It was boring. This theme could've been better if it had better lyrics than just "The Rock says....The Rock...The Rock...The Rock says...." Ridiculous. *
