 Incase anybody hasn't noticed, all of the songs on this incredible CD were used in the popular Mortal Kombat arcade games, namely MK II and MK III. If you have Mortal Kombat Trilogy on Playstation, then you already own this CD. Just stick it in your CD player and you'll be surprised to find that the Playstation game is also an audio soundtrack --- 'A Compilation of Warped Music'!!! Every track on this artistically 'warped' album are well-done and enjoyable. This is simply the killer Mortal Kombat Trilogy soundtrack, just with a different title. The Bottomline: I LOVE THIS DISC!!!! GET IT!! It'll warp your mind!
