 Love it or hate it, Doom was indeed one of the most controversial and popular games of the early 1990's, due to its violent content and satanic imagry. Doom was among some of the violent games that were blamed for the shooting at Colombine High School in Denver, Colorado. Doom was even ordered to be banned by religious protestors. But despite all that, Doom is still one of the hottest shooting games in U.S. It's my favorite game on the PC. I play almost every day on my computer at home. I would love to own this game on the Playstation because, it is, by far, the best version of Doom ever!! I rented it from one of my local movie rental stores, and loved it. The graphics are pretty good, the sounds and music are very eerie, and the animation is excellent. And just like on the PC version, all of the weapons, levels, enemies, and cheat codes are here. If you play this game and love it, also get Final Doom for Playstation. Those who are offended by lots of satanic imagry and bloody action should steer clear.
