 Anyone reading this review is probably wondering if Afrika Bambaata's still "got it." The man who sampled a then obscure Kraftwerk song ("Trans-Europe Express") and turned it into "Planet Rock," thus creating electro, is still kickin'. He has been DJing for going on 30 years and here we have the latest result. An excellent electro workout featuring mostly new tracks, including some by the man himself. If you're into electro or a fan of Afrika Bambaata you'll be into this.
