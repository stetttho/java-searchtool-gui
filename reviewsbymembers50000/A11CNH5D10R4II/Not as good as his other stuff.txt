 This new album by DJ Cam protege Minus 8 was quite a disappointment  for me. I loved his first two albums,  "Beyond," on Inflammable records, and "Beyond Beyond," on Sony Music. These were great, solid hip-hop/jazz influenced drum and bass albums that really worked well- even though "Beyond Beyond" contained some of the better tracks from "Beyond" (about five). But "Elysian Fields" marks another new label and a change of style for Minus 8. Like many drum and bass artists of late (see the new Photek, "Solaris" and the atrocious new Mocean Worker, "Aural and Hearty"), Minus 8 have changed their style, moving away from drum and bass and "expanding thier horizons". Their new label is Compost records, a decent little label known for jazzy Drum and Bass acts. "Elysian Fields" is much in the style of many Compost acts- jazzy, laid back, beat-oriented. Very Early '90's to me. It's not bad, it's just nowhere near as good as his previous two albums. I don't feel like he has as strong a grasp of jazz as he does of beat oriented compositions- not yet anyway. If you're looking for great Drum and Bass, get his earlier efforts...
