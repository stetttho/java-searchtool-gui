 I cannot think of a bigger waste of time than to slog through this movie. Don't let the great actors that appear in it sway you. It is pandering tripe. Any episode of "The West Wing" is ten times more realistic, better written, and certainly better shot. For a movie with this budget to have a complex steadycam shot left with a drop of water on the camera lens (As this one does) is inexcusable. Also there are a countless number of superfluous scenes, not even including the many many deleted scenes on the DVD. But the most troubling thing about this movie, to me, is the way it tries to make a statement about the double standard for women in America- and yet contradicts itself. The entire film focuses on Joan Allen's character not defending herself because she feels she shouldn't have to (THIS WOULD NEVER HAPPEN). Her character is the model of integrity- basically a saint with no flaws. But after this important point is made, we are introduced to a minor character- an FBI agent who just happens to be a gorgeous 20-something with "Hot for Teacher" glasses. NOT an older operative, as would no doubt be used in a high profile case, nor a man (4/5 of the FBI's operatives are male), but basically another model in a suit like we are always "treated" to in Hollywood films. It's interesting that the focal point of this movie is that women are held to a double standard in America and that looks will always play a part in that. Then they (the filmmakers) work against themselves by not casting realistically so that they can squeeze a good looking woman into the film- somewhere, anywhere. Yet every male part, without exception, is played by men 35 and older (closer to 50 actually). Once again proving that while leading men need not be young or attractive to get good roles, women must be both to go anywhere in Hollywood. I could go further and further into the bad plotting and dialogue, but let's just stop here.
