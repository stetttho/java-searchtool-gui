 ...don't listen to the naysayers. Black House was a terrific book. The only thing to watch out for: If you're not familiar with King's "Dark Tower" saga, you'll be lost. Does this hurt the book? Not for me, but I am a big fan of "The Dark Tower" and I loved the way they tied this book in. Don't be afraid, especially if you liked the first one.
