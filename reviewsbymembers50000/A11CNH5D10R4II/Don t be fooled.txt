 Don't be fooled. "Progressive" does not mean good. These guys are trying very hard to make music that is forward thinking and different, and that breaks the cliches that mire current hip-hop. For that, I give them credit. But otherwise, this album is a bust. As is often the case with progressive hip-hop, the flow is not that strong, leaning towards the spoken word style. That's not a bad thing when you're Saul Williams, Dana Bryant, Gil-Scott Heron, etc, but when you're as rusty as these guys...you get the picture. Musically it's actually pretty solid, with industrial sounding beats that are far from the awful "bling bling" simplicity prevalent today. But man, where is the funk? Somewhere in all this "progressiveness" I think it got lost. Well intentioned, but ultimately boring.
