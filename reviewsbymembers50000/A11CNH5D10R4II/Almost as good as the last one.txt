 Soundbombing 3 is much in the spirit of Soundbombing 2, Rawkus' last compilation CD. Many of the same artists appear on this'n as on that classic, like Mos Def, Taleb Kweli, Ra the Rugged Man, and Pharoahe Monch. That said, there are a few throwaway songs. Q-Tip and Mos Def especially failed to impress me here. But The true stars of this record are Kool G Rap and Method Man, whose tracks absolutely kill everything else here. All around, a great collection of singles and a worthy sucessor to the last one.
