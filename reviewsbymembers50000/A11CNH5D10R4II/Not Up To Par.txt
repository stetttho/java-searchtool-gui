 What you've got here is a rehash of old K+D stuff from a couple of years ago. Several of the tracks already appear on the amazing  "K+D Sessions". The others are basically straight from the Count Basic albums. Count Basic himself is a mid-level talent in the acid-jazz genre. Fairly Milquetoast. This CD is another example of Shadow Records cashing in on the few K+D recordings they still have the rights to (along with the equally boring "Conversions" mix, released in America against the will of K+D). Check out "Peace Orchestra," by Peter Kruder, or "Tosca," by Richard Dorfmeister. These are much closer in form and execution to K+D's previous works.
