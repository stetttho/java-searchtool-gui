 Check this guy out if you're a fan of progressive drum and bass at all or just like good music. He takes the best elements of the Good Looking crew's style synth-washed ambience and combines it with the hard beats and analog  sounds of a squarepusher or a mu-ziq. I read about him in a videogame  magazine of all places. One of the most overlooked jungle pioneers out  there, and certainly America's best drum and bass artist.
