 Don't listen to the reviewer below. Yeah, I wanted a longer record too. But I'll take what I can get. Bahamadia is by far the best female MC out there, and it's a crime that she's had such a hard time. This ep is highly experimental, with a little soul and even a little drum and bass thrown into the usual hip hop mix. The production is top notch, her rhymes are tight, what more do you want? Wait for her next full length- I think this is just to tide us over. PS if you like this, check out the new album from Mystic, another female MC, produced by Bahamadia. It's tight.
