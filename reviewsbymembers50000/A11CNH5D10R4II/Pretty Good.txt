 This is a decent mix CD. If you're into the DJ Kicks series, there are certainly better disks to get. But whether you like the Stereo MC's (I don't) or not, this is a fun blend of hip hop beats and silly breaks. Its  definitely a party record. Not very well mixed, but again, that's not  really the point. If you're looking for a fun, fast paced CD mix of some  good hip hop/ big beat, check this out.
