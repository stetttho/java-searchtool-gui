 Akiro Kurosawa revolutionalized not only the whole western genre, but the entire motion picture industry when he released this film in 1954.  And just so you'll know, this is not a movie.  DIEHARD is a movie.  ARMAGEDDON  is a movie.  SEVEN SAMURAI is a film, when the definition of a film meant a  piece of art captured on the spinning reels of a camera, intended to evoke  style, story, and meaning through a visual arena. There is absolutely  nothing I nor anyone can say that would describe the importance of this  film, and I believe it to be one of the top three films of all time, maybe  even number one.  The good points are just too many too count.  Moral  complexity, sacrifice, rage, and honor all combined into a perfect piece of   beautifully orchestrated action and drama.  Toshiro Mifune is a standout  as a wisecracking, often childish, but masterful swordsman.  But he is only  one of many superb performers in this, perhaps the greatest action/drama  ever to grace the silver screen.  If you ever have the opportunity to see  the fully uncut version and decide against it...there is something wrong  with you.  One of my all time favorite movies.
