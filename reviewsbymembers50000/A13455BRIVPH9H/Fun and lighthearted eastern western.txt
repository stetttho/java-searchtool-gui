 "Holy crap, vultures are eating my head!"  So said Roy O'Bannon (Owen Wilson) as he's buried up to his neck in the middle of the desert, just before Chon Wang (Jackie Chan) leaves Roy two chopsticks in his mouth to dig himself out.  SHANGHAI NOON, though not great, is a terrifically fun and funny film.  Chon comes to the states to rescue a kidnapped princess and encounters O'Bannon, a funny, laconic wanna be desperado who's more interested in the fringe benefits of being a desperado than the actual work of becoming one.  But when Jackie finds the princess (the scrumptious, freckle faced Lucy Liu) he finds maybe she doesn't want to go back.  An inventive, hilarious movie chock full of Chan's patented fighting and stunts (though a couple were obvious cheats, either by a computer or a stunt double, a rarity for Chan but hey, he is pushing fifty years old) and the extras on the DVD are pretty nifty, including a "so you want to be a desperado" and a "so you want to be a Chinese imperial guard" interactive games.  Jackie's best movie?  Not quite.  But the chemistry between Chan and the deadpan hilarious Wilson is much better than the Chan and Tucker of Rush Hour.  Watch for the gut splittingly funny bath tub drinking game.  Better than Rush Hour and Who Am I? but not as good as Jackie's better Hong Kong films.  Still worth repeated viewings though.
