 If high voltage gunfights teamed with snappy one-liners and explosive action backed by a multi-million dollar production are your idea of a good action movie, then this one's your cup of tea.  We all know the  story...lone good guy versus tons of bad guys in a Los Angeles highrise,  with only balls and banter at his side.  Of course, this is the one that  set the standard for just about any big hollywood block buster action flick  for years to come, the only things that changed were the locations (witness  Under Siege and the double threat of Die Hard sequels).  I'm not  particularly a fan of American action movies, but this one's just plain  awesome.  Alan Rickman, as Hans, is the best movie villain since Darth  Vader.
