 Wow.  I've not seen very many westerns, truth be told.  I can count the one's I've enjoyed on one hand.  Tombstone, Unforgiven, and to a lesser extent, Silverado.  But the Jack Bull tops them all (sorry, Clint).  John  Cusack plays a horse trader who is forced to leave two prized steeds with a  spiteful land Baron because he can't afford the Baron's toll.  When he  returns to pick his horses back up, he finds them badly beaten and  swaybacked, and the Indian worker he left with them was beaten and driven  off.  He wants amends and gives the Baron two weeks to have his horses  returned to their former glory and his Indian cohort payed for his damages.   The Baron refuses, and with no help from the local or federal law  agencies, he takes matters into his own hands.  In my opinion, this is how  the Wild, Wild West really was, as every bit of this movie rings authentic.   Cusack is amazingly good in one of his best rolls ever (among Say Anything  and Grosse Point Blank), and John Goodman is equally as good as a  no-nonsense judge.  This is a good example of the price of taking the law  into your own hands, and I think this one will become a staple in any film  fan's, western or no, permanent video collection.  I give this one five  stars, and that's saying something seein' as how I ain't none too keen on  westerns and all.  Watch this movie.  Buy it.  You won't regret it.
