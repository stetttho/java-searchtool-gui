 This is what low budget, independent film making is all about.  Want to see what can be done with a little money, a lot of guts (figuratively and literally) and chutzpah?  This is the one for you. Goose decides to leave  his gang for his girlfriend, but his rival kills her.  On a drunken binge  and suicidal, one of Goose's old gang buddies smacks him back into  soberness for an armored truck heist to be pulled off with Goose's rival's  gang as partners.  Of course, it's a ruse, and Goose's gang is wiped out,  leaving only him to fight the good fight and attempt to get the stolen loot  to his dead girlfriend's sister.  Very violent, very gory, very exciting.   Sure it looks grainy, but the action's fierce, the dialogue is convincing,  and everything just seems to click.  Probably the best backyard Urban  Action Flick there is, and well worth the money.
