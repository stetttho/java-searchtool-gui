 Okay, let's just say it...Everybody loves Arnold Schwarzenegger.  He's been one of the top action stars since TERMINATOR.  He even tried to mock his own image in LAST ACTION HERO, a movie that I thought was just great,  but was overshadowed by the simultaneously released JURRASIC PARK.  This  one's a change of pace for old Arnie, though.  Not quite so much action  (for good reason; Arnold had elective heart surgery prior to production),  but some great computer effects and a sincere performance by Arnold as  Jericho Cane, a suicidal ex-cop now acting as a top security specialist.   Arnold finds himself thrown into the world of Satanic rituals when he  stumbles upon Christine York (played by Robin Tunney) and soon discovers  her to be the intended bride of Satan as well the mother of Satan's unborn  child who will herald the end of the world. Satan (played well by Gabriel  Byrne) must rid himself of pestersome Arnold, even going so far as to offer  Arnold's dead wife and child back to him to step out of the way.  I'm not  going to tell you how it ends (duh) but needless to say, I'm glad to see a  bit more bleak an ending to an Arnold movie.  So, the verdict is, a very  good performance by Arnold the ACTOR as opposed to Arnold the MACHINE, but  overall, could've been better.  Still well worth the look, though, and a  must for Arnold completists.
