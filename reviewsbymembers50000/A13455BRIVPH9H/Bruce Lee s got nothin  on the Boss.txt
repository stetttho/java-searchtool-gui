 Jet Li, affectionately called Boss Li in Hong Kong, stars in this remake of Bruce Lee's Chinese Connection (a.k.a. Fists of Fury in China).  The difference is this one's better.  You don't agree?  I'll do my best to convert ya.  Li stars as Chen Zhen, a student in 1930's Japanese occupied China.  He returns home upon receiving news of his master's death, who was supposedly beaten by a Japanese master in a challenge.  Li smells a rat and challenges the Japanese master in return, to find the master's fighting ability's terribly inadequate to have defeated his old master.  Li has the body exhumed and tested for poison, and we find that the old master was indeed murdered after all. And Li wants revenge.  This is a truly amazing flick.  The fights, performed with minimal wire work as found in other period martial arts pieces, are a showcase for the stupifyingly amazing martial abilities of it's star, and standout moments include the opening fight between Li and a slew of Japanese fighters and the duel between Li and his japanese girlfriend's uncle, an older, wiser fighter who, before the duel, insists that older fellas need a minute or two to warm up. Unlike the Bruce Lee film the Japanese are not presented as monsters, and this film goes out of it's way to prove it, whereas the Lee film goes out of it's way to show how heinous they are.  Jet Li is a true phenomenon, and to quote the Hong Kong movie oriented book,...'Nuff said.
