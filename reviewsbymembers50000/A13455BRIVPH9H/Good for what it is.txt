 I'll make this one short and to the point.  I like ol' Stevie, though even I can admit that other than Above the Law, Under Siege, and this one, he could stand to broaden his horizons.  This is, however, my favorite Seagal  film.  The plot and story are threadbare, but the action, particularly the  excellent martial arts scenes, are what street wise aikido is all about,  and I can assure you, 99 percent of the moves he does in this movie are  what a good aikido stylist would do in a real situation, unless he's smart  enough to run away.  One particular highlight is a stick fight between  Seagal and one time Bruce Lee nunchaku trainer Dan Inosanto.  Seagal was  supposedly going for a sincere acting performance, but unfortanetly, his  dramatic capabilities are as easy on the eyes as his open hand is to your  neck.  Good fights, plenty of graphic gunshot wounds, and Jason Vorhees  himself, Kane Hodder, doing some getting blown away in the movies big  brutal finale.  Good of its type.
