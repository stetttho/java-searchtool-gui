 If you can accept the fact that Antonio Banderas is an Arab Muslim and that he learns to speak "viking-ese" after one night of watching his fellow warriors, than you will enjoy this flick based on Michael  Chrichton's "Eaters of the Dead".   Banderas is recruited into a  band of warriors, despite his lack of true experience, who go off to fight  a legion of cannibalistic creatures and protect the inhabitants of a small  village.  They're first tussle with the creatures is quick and brutal, and  the creatures appear to be superhumanly powerful demons.  The warriors  catch on soon, though, and fortify their defenses Seven Samurai like.  I  enjoyed this movie, and thought it was quite exciting.  The only flaw is  the fact that everyone in the movie is supposed to be speaking in, what,  swedish or something I guess, but instead of subtitling it, they go the  easy way and let you appear to be understanding it in english.  If it  sounds weird, you'll see when you watch this flick.  One of the things I  liked, and I was a little surprised after having seen many epic medieval  pieces where the main character is a lesser warrior than his companions, is  that it's not up to Banderas to battle the vicious Head Warrior.  Rather,  this story is told more from Banderas' point of view as a novice soldier.   One thing I don't understand, though, having never read the book...why is  Banderas in his obvious lack of experience deemed a warrior?  Maybe that  witch just had a hunch...or maybe it's just a confection by the  screenwriter.  Beats me.  Overall, a decent flick and worth seeing.
