 I've seen a million straight to video sci fi flicks.  The only difference between those and Soldier is bigger explosions and an excellent performance by Kurt Russell.  Russell is Sergeant Todd, trained from birth to be the  ultimate soldier, who becomes obsolete with the introduction of a new breed  of bio-enhanced soldier.  In a test of abilities, Russell is defeated by  Jason Scott Lee (who's been better) and dumped on a garbage planet where he  finds a small community of families fending off intense sudden bursts of  winds.  Russell is very good as an incredibly disciplined soldier who's  understanding of human emotion is non-existant.  Throughout the course of  the movie, he begins to understand the sensitivities of normal people, but  the community leaders decide he poses too much of a threat through his  warrior ways to live with them.  No sooner does this happen, then the  community is raided by the military, bio-enhanced soldiers included.  So  it's up to Russell to protect the people relying on his tried and true  combat savvy.  The explosions are bigger than in other sci-fi flicks, and  Russell's buff physique certainly fits the role, but overall, just a less  bland than most B-movie, with an A performance from Russell.  As a matter  of fact, he's why I give the movie three stars instead of 2.
