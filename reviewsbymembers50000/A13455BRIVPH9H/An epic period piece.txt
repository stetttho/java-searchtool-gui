 A lot of people agree that CHINATOWN, starring Jack Nicholson, is one of the best modern film noires since the genre's heyday.  I'd like to say that L.A. CONFIDENTIAL is well on its way to taking it over.  Bud White (Russell Crowe), Ed Exley (Guy Pearce), and "Hollywood" Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) uncover a major coupe in the city's organized crime ring and the twists just keep on comin'.  With charged action scenes, heavy drama and loads of style, L.A. Confidential is easily one of the best films of the nineties.  Kim Basinger won an Oscar for her turn as Lynn Bracken, a Veronica Lake lookalike who's the only character in the film with nothing to hide.  The extras on the DVD are just great, including the screen tests of Crowe and Pearce and the discovery that the first retro-gangster American film in a long time is headlined by two Australian actors.  With an all star cast, tight direction and an award winning screenplay, L.A. Confidential is a tough one to beat.  For all you fifties music lovers, you're gonna die for the sound track.  One of my top ten favorite movies ever, I very highly recommend it.
