 Anyone who follows the Evil Dead Trilogy knows that the first and last installments are polar opposites in terms of tone and content, but both were still incredibly entertaining..Evil Dead II  strikes the perfect  balance between the pure horror of part one and the prat falls of part  III...and is my favorite of the trio.  Hilarious and gorge-risingly  graphic, it's a near perfect mix of horror and humor,and is highly  recommended.
