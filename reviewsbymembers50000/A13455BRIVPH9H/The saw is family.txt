 So read the poster for the second sequel to this highly influential backyard meat movie, yet neither it nor the sequel before can even come close to the impact of the original.  Inspired by the infamous Ed Gein  cannibal case of the fifties, this movie succeeds through sheer virtue of  relentless terror.  The best thing about it is that you never really see  anything...save for maybe two or three actual scenes containing minimal  blood, everything is implied.  The constant roaring of Leatherface's  chainsaw and the  almost documentary look of the film make you think you  see more than you actually do, and your mind's imagination just takes it  from there.  A true classic, inducted into the National Art Museum, and it  still packs a whallop 26 years later.  Poor Tobe Hooper...he's made some  valiant efforts, but none of his films since even compare.  But what can  you expect when you start at the top?  There's nowhere to go but down.  If  you call yourself a horror fan and don't have this film in your video  library...shame on you.
