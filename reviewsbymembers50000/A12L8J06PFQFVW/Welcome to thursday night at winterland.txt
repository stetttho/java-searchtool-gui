 There has been alot written about this show by dead heads in it's reguards to legendary statis. So it was with great anticipation to put in on and let  it rip. WOW the opener of Jack Staw is tremndous. the drummers have never  sounded better on this number, a force that will blow you away. The other  highlights of the first disk are Loser and Sugaree. The set list is the big  disapointment however. There are too may run of the mill selections like,  Tenn. Jed., They Love Each Other, and, Promised land, all ho hum selctions,  sure they are played great but standard stuff. The second disk has two  songs missing from the show Must Have been The Roses and Sunrise. The  Version of Not Fadaway is short for the time, but a good version none the  less. The real joy here is the Playin-China -Rider-China Doll pure  excellence. The add on of Eyes of the World-St. Stephen is worth the price  alone. Did it ever get better than this for the Dead? Maybe, Though for the  most part you would be hard pressed to find it. While the song selection in  the first set is average at best you will find the rest of the stuff here  is awsome.
