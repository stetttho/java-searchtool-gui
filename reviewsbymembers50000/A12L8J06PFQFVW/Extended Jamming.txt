 The first song on disk one Dancin'in the Street has a major  improvisational jam The bass lines are inventive and quite smooth. The two  guitar players mesh perfectly while trading leads. The band plays as a  collective whole not just soloing players trying to out-do one another. The  other Major musical exploration is St.Stephen. A song that on the original  Album release over 30 years ago was around 4 minuets long. On this CD it is  27 minuets. The band just keeps going, but not just playing the same thing  over and over. They are playing different themes, tempos and get even very  quiet without making one fall asleep. The climax is so intense that the  listener is forced to take notice with great exhilaration. It is  truley an  amazing piece of music. They are playing with a  Jazz attitude but with  rock instruments. While this is nothing new for Phil Lesh the result are  outstanding. Another song of note is Good Shepherd, again given nice jam  which is much differnt than the original version off the Jefferson Airplane  album Voluteers. It is nice and long with the instumental passage fully  explored. The Mashed Potatoe Jam is also intersting in it's more laid back  approach, illustrating the band ability to play different types of music.  The only real Down Side are the renditions of Mississippi Half-Step And  Franklin's Tower. The vocals seemed forced and lacks some real punch.  Keeping in mind how difficult it is the sing and play bass at the same time  these songs are not bad they just do not hold up as well to the many  Grateful Dead versions which are out there in such abundance. Over all  though this 2 CD package is a great first release for Phil And Friends. His  Fans should eargerly await future releases,as will I.
