 This is a excellent CD. The sound Is very good, the music is solid. Here we have Mud is true form songs Like "Country Boy" is sung with such feeling you believe the words. John Lee's "Boom, Boom" is  strong, And no one sings good ol' "Stormy Monday" Like Muddy does  here. The band is tight and crowd noice is kept low enough so you are not  blown out of your seat when they cheer. This was my first Muddy Water CD  and It is still my favorite by him. This is blues at it's best.
