 This is a 3CD package that offers a tremendous example of a band playing with total confidence. 1972 was one of the best if not the best year in the history of the Grateful Dead. The song writing,vocals, jams, and passion  were at an all time high. Listen to the passion on "Brokedown  Palace" Jerry is signing his heart out. Songs like "Uncle John's  Band" and Playing in the Band" ,sound better here than on any  other CD the Dead has out. The Best part of the show is "Dark  Star." This is the perfect example of the Dead as visionary artists.  In "Dark Star" the band opens the avenue to total exploration,  improvising like no other band in the history of Rock. There are alot of  fans of rock and roll who hate the Dead. They do not listen to jazz. All  the band members are soloing all at once, yet playing as a whole. This is  the magic of the music. There are other new "jam" bands out now,  however none of them  even comes close in combining  lyrics, passion, and  musician ship that the Grateful Dead has.  If you like original music with  a large mix of influences like jazz, rock, folk, country, ragtime,  classical. swing, and mind expanding explorations than get this CD now, and  discover what the Dead Heads have been raving about all this time.
