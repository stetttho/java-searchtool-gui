 It is safe to say the the Grateful Dead is probably one of thefew group in the world who has a 4 CD package out for around [this price]. Combined with very high quality music, there is no way to go wrong with this. The sound is crisp, clean and amazingly clear. Remember the tape are over 30 years old.On disk 3 we have one of the best versions of Hard to Handle ever produce by any group, anywhere. Pig Pens contribution to the band during this 5 Night run was priceless. The rap during Good Lovin about a man buying a women on the corner from a salesman, who has anything you need, is pure fun. Every song is tight and picture perfect. Some songs like Loser and Wharf Rat are too new for the incrediable guitar solos that formed years later, but the vocals by Garcia are sung with such passion that they are must have versions. If there is a person out there that enjoys Rock & Roll  from  the 60's and 70's and has not really got into the Dead, this is the one I would strongly recommend. The Dead have a balls to the wall attitude here, not the long 30 minuet jams, just tight jamming which is a little more accessible.There is no way to go wrong with this, the best vaule in the world of music today.
