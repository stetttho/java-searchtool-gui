 This CD is just plain fun. Bromgerg's ability to have a good time while  singing traditional songs makes this CD worth playing over and over again.  Statesboro Blues is twisted reworked with different lyrics, the same is  said about Mr. Bojangles. The story telling is shere delieght and just good  fun. One of the most moving songs is Sammy's Song. It is about a boy taken  to a brothel by his uncle. The song is tender and deepley moving,with story  telling details that transend song structure. There are happy songs as  well, like Yankee's revenge. A great bluegrass,folk, country mix  instumental with a feeling of a outdoor country dance festival that would  make anyone get up and dance. This followed up by Wallflower. A  song that  has great lyrics about a man approaching a women at a dance. The song  Sharon, has unusual chord changes while the lead guitar and bass lines are  held down by Jerry Garcia and Phil Lesh respectivly. And no one can  complain about the obvious truth to the song, You've got to Suffer to Play  the Blues. This CD has a great mix of styles from a great artist. The usual  problems of a "retrospective", which is lack of cohesion is  avoided here. Everything blends together perfectly.
