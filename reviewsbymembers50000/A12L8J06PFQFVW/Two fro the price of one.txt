 This CD is actually two original albums put together for one CD. The first  half is what I consider a small Big Band. With other Sax players, trumpets  and guitar. The second half is the Rollins Trio. With that said I simply  Love this CD., Grand Street is my favorite song, it instantly lights up the  whole room. The sound is tight and powerful. I do prefer the first half  with it's rich full sound. The second half is good but less attention  getting. The playing however is excellent. For a great mix of styles and  sound on one CD your cannot lose with this one.
