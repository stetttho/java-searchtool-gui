 I listen to this album once then took it to the store to sell it for two dollars to get something else. This is ultimate cheese. It sound like  Stanley lost a bet. If you want to get the worst album Clarke ever made get  this one. The mix is so over saturated with cheap keyboard sounds that no  more words are worth the effort. Go get If this bass could only talk or  Live at the Greek. Enough is enough!
