 This show is not perfectly played, but who cares. The energy level at this concert is so high it is hard to imagine any other Rock group ever coming close to such tremendous results. Viola Lee Blues will blow you away. Then  compare it to the gospel song Cold Jordan and you will realize  the Dead  could play any type of music they wanted too. There is a cut in St. Stephen  and feed back during Good Lovin but who cares the Dead rip.
