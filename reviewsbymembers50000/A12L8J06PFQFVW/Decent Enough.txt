 This is a perfect example of early Santana. His guitar playing is in the  infant stage on this release. Carlos is a much better player now, but for  early work this is pretty good. The most soulful track is, As the Years go  Passing By. The tone on his guitar is masterful. Persuasion is given the  royal treatment and also Treat is tight and full of energy. The only real  bummer here is the extremely monotnous Freeway. The simple bass and drum  line just go on and on and on.  Complete overkill of undynamic playing at  best.  Even though Santana's playing is in the infant stage( I will say he  turned out to be the BEST guitar player in Rock, better than  Hendrix,Clapton,or Garcia) the CD is enjoyable considering it's time and  place in History. Just compare his playing with the Live in South America  CD, pretty much night and day. While listening to Bill Graham's  introduction and the music itself, one gets the feeling of how special the  music and venue were at the time, that is worth the price by itself.
