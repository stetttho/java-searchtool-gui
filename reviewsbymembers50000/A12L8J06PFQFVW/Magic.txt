 This Cd has tremendous power and energy. You hear Jerry pouring his heart  out. The vocals are rough The guitar playing is out of this world. John  Kahn is also the most unheard of bass player ever. His playing along side  Jerry is fantastic. Check out  Jerry's solos on Think and Tore up Over You.  You will be shaking you head in disbelief. This is a treasure and a gift no  doubt about it.
