 Soul Pride is one of those collections that anyone interested in jazz simply must have. There is a big difference between disk one and two. You  can hear how much improved the band became. The first disk has a rough edge  but loaded with power. Fat Bag and Devil's Den are standouts. From disk two  songs like The Chicken, Soul Pride, The Chase,& Sudsy, is group jazz at  it's finest. The band is tight and the sound is powerful. And Tighten-up is  pure fun with Maceo at the helm,. there is so much good music here it will  take months to absorb it all. There is a jazz radio station in Denver and  why they never play anything of this set is a mystery. James Brown had a  jazz Band that is up there with anyone at the time these CD's are proof of  that.
