 The energy on this cd is outstanding. The real disapointment however is  the sound quality. There is a guitar that is very low in the mix, and it is  a strain trying to hear it, which is a shame. The songs are all great one  after the other,oh only if it had better sound.I would rate this 5 stars if  the mix was better, because the music is first rate all the way.
