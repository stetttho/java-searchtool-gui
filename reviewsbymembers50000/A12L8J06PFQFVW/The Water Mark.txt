 I went to the store to buy new speakers and this was one of the CD's I brought. The sound of Bag's Vibes and Trane's horn set the mark for  quaility jazz. They trade solos so smoothy that they seem like the same  thoughts just different instruments. Coltran's playing here is different  Than his other stuff like African Brass or A love Supreme. It is straight  foward and very smooth. Of course Milt's playing is top notch as well.  Stairway to the Stars and Bags and Trane steal the show. This is a  tremendous CD. It is in the Top five of the Fifty Jazz CD's I own
