 The songs on this album bare no resemblance to the versions played in concert. And the songs are all below average besides. The fans of 80's and  90's Dead may like this album but it lacks passion. This is the reason the  dead took over 5 years to make another album. The version of Feel Like a  Stranger has no jamin like it did later on. Songs like Alabama Getaway,  Lost Sailor, and Easy to Love You, just are plain boring. The only bright  spot here is Althea though played much better live. If you wanted to  introduce someone to the Dead do not show up with this CD, It is a loser  all the way
