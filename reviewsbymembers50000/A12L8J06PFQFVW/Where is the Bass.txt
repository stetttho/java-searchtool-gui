 This music is the best example of classical music meets jazz. The music is played with great subtle power. There is deep feeling in most every track. My biggest complaint however is the bass is extremly low in the mix, my 120  watt B&W subwoofer is the only thing that saves this terrible problem.  Why do so many old jazz albums suffer from such problems. Some people  believe that the bass is the most important part of the rhythmn section,   why do such an injustice? The music is so good it should get 5 stars but  with the reording being sub-par, I do not see it. If you have a subwoofer  turn the bass up and discover the real way to hear this materpiece.
