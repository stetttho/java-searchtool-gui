 This Cd is A absolute masterpiece. The sounds invoke a inner spirituality. When I first put this on I instantly felt something no other cd ever made  me feel, a deep rooted almost primitive feeling of sound that transforms  the mind and soul into the music. Mickey Hart aslo makes a excellent  recording here. The sound is the best I ever heard come from a cd. These  sounds we are hearing come from all over the world, there is no denying,  this is a Matsterpeice. For fans of world music and jazz alike.
