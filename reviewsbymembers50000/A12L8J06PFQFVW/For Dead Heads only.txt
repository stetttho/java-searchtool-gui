 Here is a collection of music that is for the hard-core dead heads. There are some short simple songs,along with the long jams. The best parts are the long jams. This is what made the Dead different from all other bands, the ability to jam on and on and on. Who else could play Not Fade Away for 15 minuets or longer. The Truckin jam has Phil Lesh showing the world why he is a world class musician. Dark Star is vintage Dead with song structure being unimportant, but the ability to improvise while  maintaning focus and make tremendous music is sheer brillance. Capped off with the the most touching version of Morning Dew makes this worth the price alone.  Playing in the Band gets the royal 20 minuet space jam treatment as well. Execpt for the off key screaming of Donna everything is played with confidence and passion.
