 The wall of sound was the Dead's sound system that took 12 hours to set  up,this CD features that massive system. The sound is clear and has plenty  of punch. The China Cat-I know you Rider Jam is worth the whole price  alone. The most amazimg musical passage is the Let it Grow jam. This is a  huge mind blowing jam. Filled with abstract moments, subtle jazz riffs, and  in you face smash mouth rock and roll. The differnet types of music being  played on this 3 cd set is amazing. Check out Seastones, a sonic  exploration that you will either hate or laugh at in admiration. The often  over looked song Ship of fools,is sung brillantly by Garcia to end this  excellent package. Some of the songs on the 2nd disk are played in an  average way.And the  Sunshine daydream has Donna and Bob screaming out of  control to the point of going way over board. But disk 1 and most of 3 are  the reason the Dead stood out amoung all other musician of that time, and  stiil to this day, Great Jams ,Great Imagination, Great passion, and Great  sound.
