 This disk simply does not stand the test of time. For example, the echo used on the Us and Them vocals is over produced. Also the song Great Gig in the Sky amounts to nothing more than a bunch of screaming and lacks any direction what so ever. The songs Brain Damage and Eclipse especially have lost its appeal. "All that you touch....."  seems dry and just lacking in anything thay can be taken seriously. During the "High School" days this was very stoney. But now it amounts to little more than  overplayed FM dribble. This music simply tries to hard to "freak out" the listener. Real music that holds up after 30 years or so is usually not so overproduced, but instead has strong, straight forward song writing.
