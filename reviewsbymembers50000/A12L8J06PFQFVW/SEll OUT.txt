 Rush wanted to get on the radio so Neil Peart decided to write Limelight and Tom Sawyer. He sold out and it worked. They got FM air play. Gone are the days of 2112 and Hemipheres,where originallity and substance were key to their early unique song writing. MTV garbage is what we have hear. Yes YYZ is the best song on the CD. Witch Hunt also shows some promise. Other than that this was the beginning of the end for Rush
