 The songs on this CD are too short. The songs themselves are excellent but they are all around the 3 minuet mark.  It seems as though they were in a hurry to end the songs. The song Ineffable fades out so fast as if the engineer had something better to do.  The sound during the song Spanish Fly has a bad sound like an old scratchy record. The all the solos are bright but lack exploration, as if they were in a big hurry to end the songs.  With that said I still enjoy the CD somewhat though overall a dissapointment
