 The real story on this CD is Phil Lesh. The bass player in any band is always over looked and under appreciated. Phil plays the 6 string bass and the bottom end is the deepest I ever heard from any bass player. Plus he is  playing all over the place, he stands out not only from a tonal aspect, but  also from the amount ot notes he plays. He's Gone and the MSG Jam is by far  the high lite. Here we have Phil letting loose with a great improv. jam  with The two Keyboard players. This is very unique. The down side here is  Jerry's vocals. while Heart felt and full of passion,they are rough and  harsh. The sound that comes from Vince's keyboard is also unpleasent. This  is the irony of the CD. Morning Dew has Phil pumping and Jerry rippin' But  the vocals are really rough here. If you love the Dead do not miss this  one. If you are a fan of fine vocals pass on it.
