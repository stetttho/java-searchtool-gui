 This live recording has tremendous enery from all aspects. The horn  section on Evil Ways makes this the best version out there.  The version of  Them Changes is excellent and has great vocals by Miles. Santana's guitar  tone  and playing is masterful. The highlite should be the long version of  Free from Funkafide Filth. This is where the problem lies. Sanatana's  guitar fads in and out of the mix. One second he is screamin' the next he  fades out to unaudiable levels. It is a shame because this song just cooks  tremendously. Too bad about the bad mix or just bad sound because is would  have been a recording for the ages.
