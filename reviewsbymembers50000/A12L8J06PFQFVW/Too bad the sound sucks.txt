 This is easily the worst sounding Vault release the Dead have out. There is so much hiss that it really sounds like a bootleg tape. I have been listening to this for over 5 years now and still can not get over the lousy sound quality. If this is the best sound that the Europe 72 tour has to offer then other releases from the incrediable tour will be really a drag. The quality of music is the only saving grace. The version of Cryptical is one of the single best pieces of music the Dead have out. Followed by Comes a Time and what you have hear is the Grateful Dead at ther very best. A 30 min.  mega jam followed by a tear jerking ballad. The other stand out is Lovelight>Goin Down the Road jam. You can hear Garcia starting to play Not Fade Away then change his mind, going into GDTRFB. This is the improvisational genius of the band. They are inventing music as they go, note by note.   What puts this over the top of Europe 72 Release(besides the terrible hiss) is that Phil's bass is way out in front, the way it should be. Overall it should get 5 stars, but the sound is terrible, and that is very unusual for live GD releases. Also there were at least a dozen songs left off this release from the same performance, that is also a drag. Some people may not notice the terrible sound, if you have high quality stereo this is a warning.
