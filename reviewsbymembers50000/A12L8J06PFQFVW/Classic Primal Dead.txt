 This is what is known as "Primal Dead." 1968 was a landmark year  for the Dead. This is when the real unique music making for them started to  take place. The Dark Star is simple,short and lacks the exploration that  would take place in just a few months, The St.stephen is rushed and not yet  fully developed. However the Eleven, Death Don't Have No Mercy sequence is  great. The jam between the two songs is as intense as it ever got for the  Dead in their 30 year history. The Eleven is compared to the Live Dead  version by some. In some ways it is even better than that version. The  intensity just explodes. Pure improvisational excellence unmatched by any  group then or now. This passage of music will never be duplicated in it's  technical exacusion or imagination. Listen and you will believe. The second  disk contains what is probably the best New Potato Caboose ever. This is a  very difficult song to play with it's unusual chord changes. The Dead  played this song  for only a year or so and this version is definitive. The  version of Morning Dew is cut when the power goes out on stage. Pigpen also  sings excellent versions of Good Morning Little School Girl and a rousing  Lovelight. If you ever wanted to dance to "Hippie" music now is  your chance with these two R&B cover tunes. The sound quality is  excellent considering the original source was from what I understand quite  bad. The Dead pride themselves on Live recordings, and this release proves  that point. This is not your typical FM pop music. If you wonder what  alternative music was like in the late 60's get this and you will realize  it still holds up as not just alternative rock music, but just great music  period.
