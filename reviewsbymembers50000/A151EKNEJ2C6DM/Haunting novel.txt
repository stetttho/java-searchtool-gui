 This was a haunting novel that opened my eyes to the atrocities committed in SE Missouri during the war, and war in general.  It wasn't always a page-turner; there were chapters that had a dream-like feel; there were also scenes that touched me deeply. Adair was a very positive, strong heroine. I am thankful to the author for assisting me in learning more about this great country of ours! If this were another place on Earth, we could well still be fighting the Civil War. Think of Somalia or Bosnia, and ask yourself why the next generation of Southerners did not continue to take up arms. It's not because the Civil War was a humane war!
