 Any one who is inclined to care about Jane Austin's wonderful characters would not care for this Fanny. She is unrelated to the Fanny in Mansfield Park, and the movie is altogether an insult to Jane Austin. Want to make a movie? Great, but don't steal a famous book, write your own plot entirely and slap it together. That's a cheap publicity stunt.
