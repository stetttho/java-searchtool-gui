 My five year old and I read this book at least twice a month, and we love it.  I love that it teaches a valuable precept for living, and I love the rhyming and pictures.  And my son hardly ever rejects a suggestion to read this book; what more can I say?  Altogether wonderful!  Thank you, Melody and Steve.  I'm going to order The Other Brother now.
