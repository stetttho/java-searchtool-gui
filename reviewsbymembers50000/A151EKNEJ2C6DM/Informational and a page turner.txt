 This book keeps you reading, through one sorry number on the list, up to the next. The chapter on Al Franken is priceless: Al's own words roast him more effectively than Goldberg ever could.  Some of the people on the list seem to be merely stupid, others intent on evil. (Why do some people hate their own ancestery and gene pool so much? I have no clue.) One of the most chilling accounts in the book involved the pro-abortion rights activist who got pregnant with triplets; she kept one and neatly terminated the others. Then she wrote a column about it because of course it's nothing to be ashamed of... The other was Barbara Kingsolver telling her young daughter how the flag was a symbol of hatred. No, Barbara, it's the flag of Ronald Reagan's Shining City on the Hill. It's sad you don't realize that, but sadder still for your daughter.
