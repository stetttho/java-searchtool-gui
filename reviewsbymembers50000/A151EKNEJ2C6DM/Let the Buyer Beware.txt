 Mr. Diamond is clearly someone who is of Western European descent but finds nothing, or very little, to admire in his own heritage. To hear him tell it -- endlessly, I might add -- Western Civilization owes it ascent and dominance purely through nature's circumstance. He discounts religion and culture as drivers in the development of nations. A ridiculous notion, indeed!   For example, the Black Plague nearly wiped out Western Europe, but the Europeans rose from this period to begin the Renaissance era:  a period of unequalled creativity and increased liberties for the average citizen, leading to the end of serfdom. If Mr. Diamond were predicting the course of the 2-3 centuries following such a cataclysmic event, I have no doubt he would predict the area to fall into great decline.   People determine their fate, and the fate of their nation, through their individual actions.
