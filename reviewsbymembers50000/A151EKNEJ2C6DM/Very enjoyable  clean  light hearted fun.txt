 I saw this film with two other adult women with no kids accompanying us, and we all thought it was a great pick for our ladies night out.  The film made us laugh and smile, and the plot kept us involved.  Not only that, I can now take it home and know that my 4-year-old will enjoy when he gets older. Thanks, Bruce, and thank you, Hollywood, for making a good family film.
