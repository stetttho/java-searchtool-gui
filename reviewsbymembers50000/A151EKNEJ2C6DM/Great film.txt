 My husband and I both enjoyed this film very much. Wonderful acting and gorgeous imagery. It does leave many unanswered questions even for the careful viewer. Does this make it a bad film? We didn't think so. Perhaps Nick Nolte sums it up best at the end of the film: as a child of God, we don't have to understand death. It is only necessary to view it with compassion. Thank you, Polish Brothers, for your vision and your gift!
