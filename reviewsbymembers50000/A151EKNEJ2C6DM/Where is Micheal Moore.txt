 When a young conservative film-maker wanted to interview Mr. Moore regarding Fahrenheit 911 for his new film, Mr. Moore was unavailable. So I guess he isn't much different from Roger, now is he?  Micheal Moore laughs all the way to the Bank. And all he has done for the documentary is nothing. Because his films are propaganda, not documentaries. Documentaries present balanced views on issues or historical events.  And by the way, you might ask yourself, where is the HIGH PROFILE look by Newsweek or Time or Dateline or 60 minutes regarding the facts in Fahrenheit 911? There isn't one. There are only interviews with Mr. Moore further expousing his viewpoints. Since there would certainly be plenty of interest in such a show or article, we are left to draw our own conclusions: A) too much real work would be involved in chasing down the facts as opposed to asking Mr. Moore questions and nodding while he talks B) the real facts don't support the media's outlet's agenda of electing John Kerry.
