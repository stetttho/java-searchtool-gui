 I guess the Dems can't manage to be a "mensch" and admit they lost the election. Votes were counted and recounted. Still Gore did not win. So Gore in effect took it to the Supreme Court with his refusal to graciously concede. But then Gore is not a gracious man. Does anyone realize that CNN was poised to air a speech of his around July 1; they were actually showing the open podium waiting to begin and had been promoting the speech all morning. The speech never aired, and CNN offered no explanation. We can only surmise Gore began frothing at the mouth... What about Gore's attempts to BLOCK votes of military personnel? Personnally, I would rather be elected by soldier et al than rapists, druggies, and other felons. Are the Dems at the point where they need this illustrious group to vote in a President? Scary.
