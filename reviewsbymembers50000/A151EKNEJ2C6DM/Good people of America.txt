 Ill-supervised, lonely, bullied children are responsible for the murders at Columbine, not guns. Better to ask yourself WHY children in America are committing these heinous acts than do a knee-jerk 'blame the NRA' thing.  How about the sea of pornography, much of which exploits children, running through our land? How about the greed for money and power exhibited by women in our country, resulting in kids coming home to empty BIG houses and eating dinner by themselves? How about the lack of respect for human life we teach our children when we say a woman has a right to choose a late term abortion, even if that means we karate-chop a 4 lb baby's head before it's even out of her womb? How about the way we teach our children that God can't be trusted by teaching them it's wrong to say His name in school? Remember this: Hitler, Saddam, and Stalin were all avid gun-control proponents. First they disarmed their perceived enemies, legally, of course, then they killed them. If you think it can't happen here, today, look at some of the rhetoric around you.
