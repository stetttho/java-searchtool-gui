 This book is filled with great facts, most of which are a matter of law or part of the Congressional Record. It's also filled with the well-documented history of the Democratic Party's attempt to win at any cost, including CHEATING.  I wanted to respond to Mr. B. Bolger's review: no way could you read this book and make the remarks he made. He should take his own advice and read books from the other side of the aisle. Also, it is not unconstitutional to apply the law -- felons cannot vote -- equally to all races. That is, in fact, the basis of the American belief that all are created equal.
