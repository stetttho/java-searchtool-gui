 If you are like me, you want a medium price wine and you want to purchase with confidence. This book should get you there.   It's arranged so you can look up wines in several different ways: type of grape, alphabetial, etc. It also features wines that are easy to find at your local wine shop -- no running all over town! And, it has a "kitchen countertop rating", so that you can see whether a bottle will last a day or two in the fridge (white) or on the countertop (red) after opening.  Great work, Andrea! I also enjoy your show.
