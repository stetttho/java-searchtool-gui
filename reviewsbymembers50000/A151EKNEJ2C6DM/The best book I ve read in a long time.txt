 This is a great book about what really matters in life.  It's a wonderful story that is touching without being sappy and feel-good without being predictable.  The author had a lot to say about how we live and the choices we make.  I cannot recommend it highly enough! Thank you, Ms. Wingate, for your Grandma Rose.  She reminded me a great deal of my Grandma Wallace.
