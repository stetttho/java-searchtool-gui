 A book on loan from a friend who returned my DVD movie of Vertical Limit with this book as "interest on the loan." And what a payback! Throughout the whole book we are treated to not only a story of climbing a mountain, but we are given insight into a spiritual quest and a peek at the lives of the Sherpa people.     The story starts out to chronicle the IMAX filming expedition of Everest in 1996 lead by David Breashers. And while that goal is accomplished, we also learn of the superstitions, faith, and spirituality of the Sherpa people. We learn too that the modern world has taken its toll on those people in the same way that it has affected most of our world.       But Jamling Norgay tells us his own story as well. We learn of his lost faith as he studies here in the US and then how he regains respect for the religion of his youth as he prepares for the expedition. We are privileged to learn of the ritual offerings, and given insight into the "forecast" of the lamas. All of this is done in a spell-binding, can't put the book down way. An entertaining and informative read.
