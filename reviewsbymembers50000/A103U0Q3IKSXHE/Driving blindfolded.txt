 and taking directions from someone in the back seat looking out the back window. That's one definition of forecasting. Despite the hazards, the authors bravely predict what is going to happen with some very interesting developments in the business world. Probable Tomorrows was interesting to read since it was written in 1997 and made some predictions for "today" that we can use as a benchmark for accuracy. And all in all, the predictions were good. The tables at the end of the book, and the timeline for changes can be used to help us see what we might need to do to update our company strategies (as outlined in a recent book e-Strategy).       Some of the topics discussed here were expanded upon in the futuristic book The Age of Spiritual Machines by Ray Kurzweil. Between these two books, a broad brush look at what we are in store for emerges and may indeed give us some hints on how to formulate business strategy to take us into the future. Overall, I would rate this book a 3 out of 5. It was well written and easy  to read, but books that attempt to forecast the future are qickly dated.
