 Javed Mohammed is a friend whom I have grown to respect and trust in our sporadic time together. He is a thoughtful man, one who is dedicated to his profession and his religion. In this book he shares some of the inspirational thoughts, readings, and speeches that he has come across in his life experience. He shares them with us, providing insights and introspection that is well worth our time. We can, after reading this wonderful volume, be ready to gather our own gems throughout the day. Tom Campbell (US Congressman - R/CA) put it well: "A must read for all American youth and adults. This book informs and illuminates the way through inspirational Muslim literature."
