 I had the pleasure of listening to Dave DeLuca speak about his Hindu religious journey and his love for the teachings of Vivekananda. He is passionate about this topic and so far, this book shows his love and compassion for bringing an open and inclusive spiritual view to the world. His passion for Yogi Vivekananda comes through in his editing effort. The selections that DeLuca chose are indeed inspirational and give a clear image of the Unity of all existence that seems to be the corner stone of life philosophy from India. The story of Swami Vivekananda is compellingly told and rivets the reader. The short clearly written teachings can be read in just about any order, used as daily meditations, and revisited over and over again. Along the way, this uplifting volume will provide insight into the Vedanta philosophy. If you have the opportunity to hear DeLuca's presentation, take it. If you have the opportunity to read this book, take it! An excellent addition to anyone open to understanding and embracing the concept of the interconnected web of all existence. Whatever your religious (or non-religious) grounding, you will likely enjoy this book.
