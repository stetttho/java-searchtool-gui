 Mr. Komisar weaves an interesting story about his experiences as a Silicon Valley entrepreneur and venture capitalist. Along the way, he imparts important lessons for the would be start up company leaders. There are many practical business lessons here, but also some important life lessons such as making sure we do not sacrifice our lives, for the wrong reasons, working to start a company. For there is no doubt about the hard work that is necessary to start a company from scratch. So it had better be something that makes your heart sing. But even if you have no intention of starting your own business, this book is valuable to any of us working in the technology field. And technology continues to touch more and more of us every day, so it is vital that we understand what is driving the new emerging economy. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in where we might be going from here. The riddle? Imagine I have a raw egg in my hand, and I want to drop it three feet without it breaking. How would I do that? Don't answer now, sit with it for awhile. Think about it. Read the book to get the answer.
