 Groff states that the popular slogan "What would Jesus do?" needs translation. "What would Jesus be doing," or "What would Jesus BE," is more appropriate. Journeymen is a spiritual guide for men, and for women who want to understand them. A gift, in more ways than one, this book has definitely added clarity to my spiritual journey. Seneca said: "Without knowing which port one is sailing toward, there is no such thing as a favorable wind." This book can help you understand the port for which you should be sailing, and helps you with the dead-reckoning along the way.  Modeled after 12 step programs, the book and its 12 chapters provide much for us to contemplate on our journey. Meditations, prayer practices, rest areas, and excursions provide variety on our way as well as many ideas for future excursions and side trips. But "Journeymen" is also another word for apprentices. And so, while this small, easily read volume will be a resource for our men's group for many months to come, it will also be a great individual resource for my own difficult individual soul work. It is well worth the read and serious consideration of today's renaissance man.
