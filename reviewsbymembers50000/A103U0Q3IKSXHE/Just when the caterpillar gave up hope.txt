 Hope for the Flowers is a children's story with a moral that we adults should take to heart as well. We can't help but keep thinking about our own careers as Stripe, the caterpillar, struggles with his climb to the top of the heap. Once he gets there, he learns that there really isn't anything special to see or own. I won't spoil the story for you, but will remind you of the old adage that it is best to make sure that the ladder you're climbing is against the right building! I highly recommend this book to those with young children or who teach young children. Only because you might be embarrassed to purchase it for yourself and read it. So use a child as an excuse and learn how Stripe and Yellow finally get through the perils of climbing the heap. Simply a wonderful book.
