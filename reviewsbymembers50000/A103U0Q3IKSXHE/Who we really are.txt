 Yep! That's me on the cover! This book is another recommended by my friend Dr. Gus Rath. I've enjoyed every book he has recommended so far, and this book is no exception. In fact, I have ordered several additional copies and given them out as gifts. This is definitely a challenging read, but puts things in perspective in regards to the question of "Why are we the way we are?" Not an easy read, but the effort pays off with new insights into our human nature and some of the biological and environmental reasons we think and act in our own unique manner. One cannot, I think, read this volume without coming face to face with the reality that we are all responding, at different levels, to programming from our genes and our environment. The decisions we make between competing moral values is truly a mixture of those program subroutines we are not even aware are running in our "computer brain." There is not much comfort for those looking for a "meaning" to life, or simple answers about our interaction with our environment. But if one sticks with the author, the reward is a bit of insight into the real Darwinian equation. One notable quotation concerning free will versus determinism, Wright notes that: "Darwin saw all of this. He didn't know about genes, but he certainly knew about the concept of heredity, and he was a scientific materialist; he didn't think any nonphysical forces were needed to explain human behavior, or anything else in the natural world." Be prepared to be enlightened. This is a must read for anyone seriously pursuing knowledge of our human nature.
