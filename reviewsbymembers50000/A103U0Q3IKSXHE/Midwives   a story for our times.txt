 This is a book I couldn't put down. It is amazing how Mr. Bohjalian was able to put into writing the feelings of women during childbirth. Certainly it is difficult enough to express those feelings, but to do so as a man  shows an incredible amount of compassion and understanding. A lesson to us  all, I'm sure. 	This is a tightly written novel concerning a normally  safe home birth gone terribly wrong, and how it affects the lives of all  those involved. It twists and turns and leads the reader to wrong  assumptions over and over again. At the same time it manages to bring forth  the mystery and wonder of life, and especially the moment of birth. The  novel is written from the point of view of the Midwife's daughter, who is,  at the time of the writing, a doctor, specifically an OB/GYN. Armed with  first hand knowledge as well as her mother's copious notes, Constance spins  the story of her mother's passion for midwifery, devotion to her trade, and  tragic loss of that love after the death of one of her mothers. 	The  trial scenes are wonderfully exciting and maddening at the same time. But  more important is the story of love and support in the Danforth family,  though not without it's stress and misunderstandings. And Constance tells  her own story of growing up and through the tragedy of the public trial,  her mother's too close relationship with her lawyer, and her father's  struggle to understand and support his wife. All in all, a wonderful book  that surprised me a great deal. Thanks to my wife and our book club for  getting me to read it.
