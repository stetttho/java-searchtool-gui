 Reforming Christianity is a bit more difficult read than Remedial Christianity but as compelling.  I had the pleasure of hearing Professor Cupitt speak at a seminar not long ago, and I find his writing as interesting as his presentation. It helps, too, that I now can hear his voice as I read his book. Each sentence is packed and must be carefully unpacked in order to get the full meaning of his statements. But the effort is worth it since, as you work through the dense words, you begin to see a full picture of the Kingdom Religion that Don Cupitt believes to be so vital to the reformation of Christianity. I refer to such statements such as: "All the doctrinal themes are meant gradually to sink in and become part of one's own being - which gives rise to the paradox that when you have fully become a Christian, you aren't one any longer." And this: "I have already said that in the process of its reformation, Christianity has to move on from its ecclesiastical period, its 'schooldays', now ending, to its fully adult form, the 'kingdom religion' that Jesus originally lived, preached and hoped to see on earth." I can think of no other way to get across the new ideas and directions for Christianity than the way Professor Cupitt takes. His well structured thoughts in this logically laid out volume helps put things in perspective. And though I found some of the ideas  difficult to grasp at first reading, subsequent study made them so with little "Ah Ha!" moments. Overall I have to rate this excellent work at least a 4 on a scale of 5. I hope it gets to your reading list for the hard work of continuing on your spiritual path.
