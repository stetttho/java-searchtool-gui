 I had the pleasure of hearing Mr. Smith speak at a presentation to a local church group. He spoke on the real meaning of the word charisma, and how we pretty much misuse it today. We frequently use the word to mean someone who is a good speaker, or presenter. But the meaning of the word, to Mr. Smith, goes much deeper than that. He posits that there are at least three levels of "charismatic speakers." The first level is accessible to many individuals who take the time to master the principles of persuasive speaking. The second level of charisma is more difficult to achieve because it requires a speaker to be "authentic," by which Mr. Smith means they know who they are and they take responsibility for their actions and what they advocate. And the third level of charismatic speaker reaches beyond the material world to associate in some way with the metaphysical, the transcendent, the spiritual, or some other form of perfection. Mr. Smith then goes on to give examples of each of these levels of charismatic persons, drawing from history and our understanding of historic figures such as Socrates, Plato, Jesus, Buddha, and Augustine. This text is one every public speaker and/or clergy should read and understand.
