 Prior to reading this book, I chalked up the misfortunes of the well run companies of our time to the vagaries of the market place and put them in the same shoulder shrugging category of "bad things happen to good  people."  But now I have a new way of looking at success and failure  due to disruptive technology.    I better understand my own frustrations of  trying to do new things in a large corporation given the further insight  from Christensen that assets are really managed by customers, not our own  managers.  That is what makes this book scary.    There seems little hope  of any large corporation staying on top of disruptive technology unless  they follow the prescription of segregating those innovations from the  usual corporate overhead structure. That means spinning off groups, taking  equity positions in start-up firms, and/or completely funding start-ups to  grow the new markets.    The writing is clear, the data gathered is  thorough and fully documented with ample notes, the logic is concise, and  the conclusions are entirely logical. Christensen gives us formulas for  success including agnostic marketing to help us recognize emerging markets.  The case studies are at once interesting and compelling. This is a must  read for managers in any industry. Dr. Andrew S. Grove, Chairman and CEO of  Intel Corporation had this to say, "This book addresses a tough  problem that most successful companies will face eventually. It's lucid,  analytical-and scary."
