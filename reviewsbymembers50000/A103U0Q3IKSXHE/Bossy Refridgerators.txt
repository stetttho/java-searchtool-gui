 An excellent book for the layperson to understand where computing is headed and where the lines between life sciences and technology blur. Gershenfeld makes it easy to understand how our lives will be affected by  the incredible advances we are making in all fields of science. This book  belongs on the shelf right along side Kurzweil, Norman and Metcalfe. It  will round out our comprehension of the future, both near and farther out  on the horizon. 	I learned about PEM three-dimensional printers and how  they will help us model our ideas. I learned about the all too easy use of  buzzwords such as "fuzzy logic" to confuse the public into  thinking something "new" is happening. I learned a great new  definition for religion-"Beliefs about our existence that are not  falsifiable have a central place in human experience-they're called  religion." And I learned about a great place for students of all  backgrounds to work together for fun and maybe even profit-the Media labs  at MIT. 	And I found an answer to a question that has long been  bothering me. "Marvin Minsky believes that the study of artificial  intelligence failed to live up to its promise, not because of any lack of  intelligence in the programs or the programmers, but because of the limited  life experience of a computer that can't see, or hear, or move."  	 Anyone with even a hint of questions about the future and what it might  hold for us should pick up this book. It is marvelous reading, despite the  weight of the subject matter!
