 When I was about one chapter into this book I stopped to wonder why it was called "remedial." As I continued to read, it dawned on me that this is a perfect title in that while a very broad range of topics relating to the history of Jesus, the Bible, the Church, and various forms of Christianity are covered, they are not covered in depth. Rather, Dr. Laughlin manages to give us enough information to make us stop and think and thirst for more. It would be easy to lapse into well deserved accolades over this book, but suffice it to say that it was exceedingly difficult to put it down and I found myself not able to read two other books at the same time as this one, as would be my normal custom.          I can't help giving an excerpt that is, to me, an outstanding example of the clear and forthright prose from this scholar:                "While the thorough going skepticism of many Unitarian-Universalist may  be too radical for most Christians, it is quite clear that Christianity has taken a turn in that direction and will have to embrace the attitude of Liberalism in a major and deliberate way in order to survive, prosper, and maintain its relevancy in the Third Millennium. The modern scientific world view is simply too pervasive, productive, and compelling to ignore; and all of us reared in the West are so acculturated into it that we simply accept it as the way the world operates. Any religion -- Christian or otherwise -- that demands of its followers that they deny their senses and minds in  order to believe, or that tries to shield them from the prevailing worldview, is doomed to anachronism, retrogression, and eventual oblivion."          And there are many more worthwhile gems of wisdom and scholarly corrections to common misperceptions about the many different faces of Western Christianity. This book is logically organized, clearly documented with excellent exercises at the end of each chapter. It comes complete with wonderful bibliography and glossary of terms. It will take every lay-person with the curiosity to learn more about Christianity to the next level of understanding.           My sincere wish is that so many Christians, and those of other religious paths, read and learn from this book that a grass roots movement to modernize this wonderful religion takes place. Simply a marvelous text.
