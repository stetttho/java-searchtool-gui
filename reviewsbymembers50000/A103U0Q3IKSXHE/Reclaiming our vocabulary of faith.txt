 I am so grateful that I found and read this book of outstanding courage. Kathleen takes the thoughtful reader through a wonderful exercise of reclaiming what for her was a lost vocabulary of faith. Much of what she  had to say about the Christian words I grew up with has been echoed in my  own life, and while I have not gone back to my roots, I do feel much more  comfortable with the old language after having read her book. Bringing  the words of faith to life in our everyday living is certainly a struggle  for most of us. Kathleen shows us some of the ways her own struggles lead  her to at least temporary states of grace. This interesting and useful  approach to defining her own theology was lively, engaging, and compelling  in the sense that she faces her many shortcomings, celebrates her  successes, and continually strives for meaning in her life. Personally, I  find today's organized religion lacking any real meaning. But Kathleen has  shown me how I can at least reclaim some of the vocabulary of faith that I  had long ago thrown out with the other religious baggage of my early years.   Thank you Kathleen.
