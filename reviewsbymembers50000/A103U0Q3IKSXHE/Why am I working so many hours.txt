 If you have been working more and enjoying it less, or even if you've been enjoying it more, this book can explain why. Well documented and reasonably argued positions on why the "new economy" is going in the direction it is provides insights into the phenomena we are likely all to be experiencing at work, but have not been able to figure out ourselves. Robert Reich takes us through the history of how we got here as well as the common misconceptions of our times. He points out, for example, that contrary to popular belief today's innovators are not necessarily particularly adept at using new information technology. He points out that they are creative workers. He then breaks the creative workers into two groups defined as "Geeks," and "Shrinks." The Geeks provide the creative innovations from a technology point of view, but the Shrink provides the marketing intelligence as to what people really want for the product or service. Reich's thesis is that technology is speeding and broadening access to "terrific deals." That is driving everything including worker mobility since they are selling their own services. The look for the best deal as an employee much as the employer looks for the best deal in materials as well employees. One of the difficulties facing workers in this new age is that they will not be able to predict their "bottom line" income. Because payment is based on value added at almost all levels of the economy, your annual income will depend on a great many changing parameters. To put it in his terms, "the fabulous new deals of the fabulous new economy carry a steep price: more frenzied lives, less security, more economic and social stratification, the loss of time and energy for family, friendship, community and self." We must all be aware of this change and manage the high touch part of our high tech lives.
