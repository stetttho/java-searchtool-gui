 According to Keven Rollins, "Getting results in large companies is a very rare skill and this book captures how to do it. The guidance provided here will prove invaluable for leaders who are trying to drive tighter execution in their organizations."  My reading confirms Rollins statement despite the fact that in the back of my mind I kept thinking about the marketing reasons for Covey writing this book. Still, the information within is useful and builds on the seven habits of highly effective people.  The DVD provided with the book would, I believe, make things easier for folks who learn better visually rather than reading text. While this was a nice touch, it didn't add too much to my understanding of what Covey was trying to convey; but great marketing. The book would have been even more effective if it was half as long. Covey spends too much time rehashing the old habits information.  Covey in his usual conversational style, encourages the reader to "Find your voice and help others find their voice." In some ways, this seems a labored metaphor. Others have said this more succinctly with "Follow your Bliss," or "Discover your Passion." Covey takes great pains to bend his "lessons" into the "find your voice" analogy, and often times the story seems disconnected from the message.  Yet for those who found much meaning in the Seven Habits, this book will add to the rich imagery that Covey created in his earlier book. There are new ways of looking at how we are in relationship with each other and with ourselves. All in all, a book worth reading, though as I said, it could have been quite a bit shorter.
