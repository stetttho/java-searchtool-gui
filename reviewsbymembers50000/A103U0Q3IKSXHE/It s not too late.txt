 This could have been a five star book, but Ray Strand insisted on peppering us with language of a particular religious world view that has made it difficult to believe in the rest of his recommendations. Personally, I wanted to read the book for solid scientific information on nutrition, I could have done without the narrow religious statements. However, if you can get by the self-serving public piousness, there is good information on nutrition, diet, supplements and exercise which will serve us all well. For years I fought the use of supplements as being a waste of money. I subscribed to the view that if you ate a reasonable diet of vegetables and fruit, you would get all the nutrients you need. Perhaps that was true at one time, but with the high levels of pollution in our environment, poor animal husbandry, and depleted farm lands, we have to resort to the use of supplements. I am now convinced that high quality dietary supplements are a requirement for a healthy life. If you can't find any other books on nutrition, then this one might serve to get you started. However, steel yourself for the off-topic creationist messages.
