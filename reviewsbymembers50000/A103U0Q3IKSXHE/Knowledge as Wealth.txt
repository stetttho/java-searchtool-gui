 There is a thirst for understanding how to manage the "new" companies that are knowledge based rather than founded on product manufacturing. Here is a book to help with that quest. Sveiby explains  that, as an example, the public was willing to pay, in 1995, an average  price of $70 for Microsoft when their book value was about $7. In other  words, the shareholders saw about $9 of additional value for every $1 of  tangible assets on Microsoft's books. There is no entry on Microsoft's  balance sheet for that $9, and it represents a major trend in our  "post industrial" economy. How do we manage such an illusive  asset? 	Sveiby steps us through (1) understanding the era of knowledge  Organizations, (2) managing intangible assets, and (3) measuring intangible  assets. There are practical examples of measuring systems, how to organize  a company to maintain and transfer knowledge, and keys to developing  professional competence. 	Sveiby defines, for the purpose of this book,  knowledge as "a capacity to act." "One's capacity to act is  created continuously by a process-of-knowing. In other words, it is  contextual. Knowledge cannot be separated from its context. The notion also  implies teleological purpose. I believe that the human process-of-knowing  is designed by nature to help us survive in an often hostile  environment." 	I learned about the professional's three life  cycles - the super star, the statesman, and the normal professional. I  learned about the classic problem of organic growth in our knowledge  organizations. And I re-learned that "it takes time, experience, and  mental effort to turn information into useful knowledge. And since  recipients cannot know until afterward whether it was worth spending that  time, information that turns out to be worthless is really worth less than  nothing." 	For those trying to understand the new business model,  this book is well worth the time and effort. It will help you move your  company into the modern age.
