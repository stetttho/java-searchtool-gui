 Peter Block has updated his "consultant's Bible" and made it better than ever. This is becoming must reading for the consultants in our new firm. While the point of view of most of the book is from that of an "inside" consultant, the principles and ideas are directly related to external consultants as well. The layout of this book makes it an invaluable reference with easy to find topics, checklists, and guides for consultants. A final checklist is provided in the appendix that comprises all the information covered in the body of the book. The final list cross references back to the appropriate chapters so that as you go through the process of Flawless Consulting, you can easily review the material presented. Flawless Consulting encourages us to make sure that WE are NOT the cause of failure to either land a consultancy or properly implement once we do have the contract. But the best idea presented is that the secondary goal of consultancy is to teach clients how to solve the problem themselves the next time! Consultants are advised to be authentic, including stating their own needs at the appropriate times. Mr. Block provides real world examples to back up his theories and positions. I especially enjoyed the list of "organizational codes" that he gave with respect to communications: When people mean "I don't like it," they express it by saying "I don't understand it." Or when they mean "I don't want to do it," they will say, "Let's get more data," or "I'll get back to you," or "Let me talk it over with my staff." Whether dealing with resistance to change, how to listen actively, or how implementations go awry, Block's clear style and no nonsense approach to solving problems will serve internal and external consultants well and will undoubtedly provide superior results for the clients.
