 I found travel through this book to be difficult without the familiar sign posts of quotation marks! I'm not at all sure what this new "format" is supposed to accomplish, but this is the second book I've read that did not use quotation marks and I find it disconcerting. It was as if I kept passing beautiful landscapes or scenic rest areas and had to stop and go back to really enjoy the views. It seemed to me to be a waste of energy and a source of frustration just like driving in  an unfamiliar town where the street signs are obliterated or missing.     Still, once used to the terrain, I was able to appreciate the marvelous scenes unfolding in Holt. The people became real and their stories were that of middle American life. Their problems, concerns, and interactions were familiar, not fake or contrived. Heroes lost fights, good people made mistakes and normally thoughtful, caring people did thoughtless, careless things.     The values of individuals and the community can be discerned as we watch Ike and Bobby grow up. We see the work ethic as they deliver papers before school and their father takes over for them when they are out of town. We learn of human values of compassion as the McPheron brothers take in Victoria Roubideaux and give her a safe environment in which to live. We are witness to living, loving, and dying and the manner in which these rites of passage are received by the new friends in Holt.     Plainsong is the song of middle America. It is told in engaging detail, helping us feel at home in Holt. The characters are revealed to us over time, and eventually, we know just about the whole community. No wonder this was a New Yorker Book Award finalist. Well worth the read.
