 Ms. Goldberg takes us through the easy answers about how to avoid bad writing and gets right down to the bones. She clearly lays the groundwork for soulful, insightful writing that will captivate your readers. But it's hard work. Natalie doesn't let us shirk. That she is a worthy mentor is abundantly clear as you read her book. Her sentences are clear and easy to read, yet flow smoothly on leading you through the story and her thoughts. In true Zen fashion, we learn that the secret to great writing is subtracting rules for writing, not adding them. It is not easy to teach us, or anyone else, to unlearn what we've worked so hard to acquire. But Natalie's Zen training comes to her aid and she shares her insights with us in this excellent book on writing.
