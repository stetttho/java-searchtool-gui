 The size of this book is intimidating, so I purchased it in electronic format and am reading it now. I must say, it has truly captured my attention even though I'm not a history buff. And it has lived up to its reputation as being well written and very interesting. The liberal use of quotations from Adams' letters has made this book a window into the life and times of John Adams and I am thoroughly delighted to have read it. I do recommend using an electronic version if you have the equipment.   One is struck with the incredible integrity of John Adams and his faithful use of his ethical system. He was almost always consistent in his approach to problems and was therefore dependable and predictable. His commitment to our country was nothing short of monumental and in these trying times, it is good to read of a true patriot who understood that he and his country had to be held to a very high standard indeed. McCullough's book is definitely worth the time to read and one should not be put off by its size, the time will fly more quickly than you can imagine.
