 Ethics for the New Millennium calls for a conscious revolution in order to bring about world peace. The Dalai Lama's wonderful optimism shines forth as he paints a picture of civilization of compassion and true love for our  fellow humans. 	But this is not a hollow sermon with only the hope of  peace held out in front of us. It is instead a prescription for beginning  the long journey toward converting ourselves to fuller, happier human  beings. Through personal stories and experiences the Dalai Lama shows us  the way to re-think our position in the world. 	Despite protestations  to the contrary though, the Buddhist philosophy and teaching is pervasive  throughout. Yet there is never a lack of respect for other spiritual paths.  A path is set before us with definitions for Ethics of: Restraint, Virtue,  Compassion, and Suffering. We are given a clear understanding of the role  ethics plays in society. World religions are taken to task for providing  yet another reason for propagating hate and/or separating ourselves from  others. We are also left with an appeal for - "Love for others and  respect for their rights and dignity, no matter who or what they are:  ultimately these are all we need."
