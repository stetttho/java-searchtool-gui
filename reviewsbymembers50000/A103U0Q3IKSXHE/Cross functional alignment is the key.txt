 Many of our clients are struggling with life at internet speeds. If you haven't read this classic on speeding up your organizations product and service life cycle, now may be a good time to do so. Praise for this book, as listed on the back of the dust jacket, come from Ford Motor Company, Quantum Corporation and others with Ed McCraken, CEO of Silicon Graphics Computer Systems stating that this is; "A must read for executive who seek speed and competitiveness." Mr. Meyer utilizes an "ongoing case study" to make his points concerning FCT processes. This approach lends credence to his positions and gives the book a solid feel of practicality. In addition, frequent use of diagrams helps the reader visualize the organizations, processes, information flow, and cross functional activities of organizations. The layout of the book is logical and provides for continuity as Meyer builds on each preceding chapter. The book is filled with excellent observations and pithy sayings: "The responsibility for strategic alignment rests with senior management." "Any organization leader who seeks to 'empower' people should first create a clear strategic context that enables others to use the power with which they were born." "Research demonstrates there is a negative correlation between economic growth rate and the number of Nobel prizes won." "A sustainable FCT capability can be achieved only by learning faster, not by working faster."
