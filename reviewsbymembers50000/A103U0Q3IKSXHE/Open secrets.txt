 Exactly the book for our fast-paced lives lived in the headline modern world. Litman and Oman have pulled together transcripts from the Mike Litman show interviews with successful Millionaires. In each interview are buried nuggets of gold that will inspire new ideas and incite action in your life. The best part is, you can read each interview independently and in any order you need. The layout and the "let's get to it" approach matches our sense of urgency. I found this book especially interesting since I recently finished the One Minute Millionaire by Hansen and Allen. In fact, my on-line review of that book is how Mr. Litman found me and suggested that Conversations with Millionaires would be a logical extension of my reading in this area of self-improvement and motivation. Indeed it was for me and will be for you. But even if you have not yet read Hansen's book, Conversations will be an excellent introduction to the concepts explored in depth by Hansen and Allen. There are nine successful self-made millionaires who share their secrets with us through the lively interviews with Mr. Litman. The secrets will give you a leg up on the learning curve for how to diversify your income. I know it has helped me put my own multiple streams of income into perspective and validated some of what I had been struggling to organize in my mind. There will undoubtedly be at least one story in this book that will speak to you and light your path to financial independence. Conversations with Millionaires is success in action. It has managed to put into practice the lessons held within and is itself an example of positive thinking, tithing, and wisdom all rolled into one highly accessible book. Get it, own it, know it, and refer to it often to ensure your own Millionaire life!
