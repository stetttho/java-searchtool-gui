 City of God is one of the most confusing, yet enlightening books I have read in a very long time. It is like reading a novel in CNN headline news format. There are about five parallel stories intertwined with short chapters on each. There is little warning or way of identifying which character or story line you are following at any one time.      But while the story itself was somewhat difficult, the theology is right on. At the end, our main character, a Priest now converting to Judaism, gives a bit of a sermon at his wedding to the beautiful, intelligent, Rabbi. He has just cited a long list of the worlds murderers and dictators and their atrocities, and then says:  "Do you not find this a grave challenge to your existence, Lord, that we do these things to one another? That for all our theological excuse making, and despite the moral struggles and the intellectual and technical advances of human history, we live enraged--quietly or explosively, but always greedily enraged? Do you not find it an unforgivable lapse of Yours that after these thousands of years we can no more explain ourselves than we can explain You?"     One of the credits on the back cover states that City of God is the crowning achievement of E.L. Doctorow's career--"an astonishing modern masterwork of faith, mystery, and the search for spiritual authenticity." I cannot vouch for all of Doctorow's works. But I can say that this book was worth the effort to read.
