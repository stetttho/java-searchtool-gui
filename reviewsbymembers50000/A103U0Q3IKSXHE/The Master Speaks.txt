 While giving us a no-holds-barred lesson on what it takes to be a good writer, Stephen King also weaves the story of his life into this remarkable book. Complete with a reading list, this book will be a useful resource for the aspiring writer for years to come. Some simple rules are put forth: "If you don't have time to read, you don't have the time or the tools to write" and "Put your desk in the corner, and every time you sit down there to write, remind yourself why it isn't in the middle of the room. Life isn't a support-system for art. It's the other way around." Like one of his fiction novels, this book keeps you running from page to page. It begins with a fascinating account of Mr. King's childhood, and before you know it, you're in the middle of "how to write." At the end, after we are quite firmly on the hook, we get the lesson on editing. Ruthless editing. Mr. King shows us how to follow the 10% rule, that is, 2nd draft = 1st draft - 10%. We are given the detailed explanation for each of the editing changes, and it serves to drive home each of the clear lessons given throughout the book. It is an excellent summary section, and one that can serve as an example for any writer (or editor). In short, a necessary addition to an bookshelf.
