 I have read several of the Jesus Seminar series now and have many more on the shelf to read as well as books from some of the individual scholars. But what intrigues me about this volume is the cross reference work and foot notes that help me to better understand the context of the Gospels. In addition, there is the delight of gospels of which I had never heard prior to this book.  This work, and the companion work The Acts of Jesus, comprise an awesome set of references for serious New Testament work. The incredible amount of reference and cross-reference helps tie all the loose ends together for the lay person as well as professional. Another must have for the reference library!
