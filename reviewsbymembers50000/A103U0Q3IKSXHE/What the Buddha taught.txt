 This is definitely a book that will remain close at hand as I struggle through my meditation practice (such as it is, or isn't at times!). This guidebook helps to set up a meaningful meditation practice that will achieve results and give direction to the hard work of analysis and finding inner truth. The author writes clearly and makes difficult mental images come alive. Stephen Batchelor claims that "Ken McLeod's eminently practical manual goes straight to the heart of what the Buddha taught." Becoming fully alive, living joyfully and with compassion are goals that the reader can clearly see being set out and achieved. But this is hard work. I have read through the book once, but must read each step in the practice to keep on track. I think that this will be a life time endeavor and will, as pointed out in many places, eventually require a teacher.
