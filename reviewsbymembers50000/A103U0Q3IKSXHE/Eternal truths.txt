 Those familiar with Bishop Spong know they are in for an exciting ride with his up-to-date theology and take no prisoner positions with regard to interpreting the life of Jesus of Nazareth. In Rescuing the Bible, Bishop Spong certainly doesn't disappoint those of us who follow him and his refreshing look at Christian scriptures. This is definitely a work for those who wish to reclaim some meaning in the ancient scriptures in light of our modern world and our own life experiences in this post-modern environment. One doesn't have to abandon scripture to make sense out of the real meaning behind the stories, one simply needs to understand the context and accept that things are a bit different today. You must read this volume if you are a serious Biblical scholar - even if you disagree completely, it is worth understanding an alternative point of view. Be not afraid, Bishop Spong is striving to bring Christianity and the Bible to life for modern people. This is a revival, not a wake!
