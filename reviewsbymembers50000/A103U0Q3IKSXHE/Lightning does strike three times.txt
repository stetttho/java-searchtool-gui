 In this excellent sequel to Writing Down The Bones, and Wild Mind. Ms. Goldberg shares a compelling story of her life while giving us lessons on writing. She continues the theme of practice writing and emphasizes how important it is for success. Revealed also, is how important it is to read. From reading we learn what we like and don't like about writers, styles, and techniques. Of course, reading also gives us grist for the mill. Natalie comes through in this book. We know her and what drives her after reading this selection. The fact that we also learn something about her craft is almost secondary. Some may think we also learn more about Natalie than we need or want to, but if you think so,  then perhaps the point is missed. It is from our panexperiential existence that we draw meaning for life and Natalie teaches us how to translate that experience to the written word.  She does so not only by overt instruction, but by covert story telling all at once. Here books on writing definitely need to be on any writers shelf for frequent reference.
