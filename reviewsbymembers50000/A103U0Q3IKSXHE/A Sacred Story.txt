 This book is a gift from a dear friend and has already given me a wonderful belly laugh! In a litany of things needing to die and things needing to be born, Conlon pointed out that "Your right brain needs to be born and your left brain needs to be happy about it." Oh how true! Well, for me at least. This is a wonderful resource for meditation and introspection. Exploring our own humanness is sometimes difficult and painful. Conlon eases us into the hard work with beautiful words and meaningful insight. Through use of examples from his own life experiences, Conlon brings us into focus with our own world.
