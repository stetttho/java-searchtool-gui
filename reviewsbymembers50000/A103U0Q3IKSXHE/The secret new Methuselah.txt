 Kurzweil is one of my favorite authors. I enjoyed his book on the future of evolution titled The Age of Spiritual Machines, and I highly recommend that book to you as well. This book is a must read for all who are interested in personal health. Even if you do not believe it is possible or desirable to live a VERY long life, you will likely agree that as you do age, you would prefer to be healthy right up to the end. If you do agree, then this book about the science behind radical life extension will be of interest to you. I hope you take the opportunity to get a copy of Fantastic Voyage to learn how to control through life style and eating habits all those things that concern us from heart disease and cancer to Alzheimer's disease.  My criticism of the book is only that the authors are a bit "over the top" on what they are doing to extend their own health, and it is very expensive. Not everyone will be able to afford DNA analysis, weekly injections of supplements and 250 pills per day. Other actions that Ray takes are to drink six to eight cups of green tea per day and even more water on top of that. He walks every day and limits what he eats. All of this adds up to a self disciplined routine that the average person will not undertake to accomplish. Still, we can take from this what we can reasonably do while at the same time understanding that we could always do more to make our lives healthier and therefore happier.   The book is written in a clear and conversational tone. The science is explained in terms that I, as a lay person, can understand. And the authors seem honest about the efficacy of the supplements they are recommending - meaning that they state whether or not "clinical testing" has been done or whether the information is more anecdotal.  All in all, this is an excellent reference for those interested in enjoying a healthier life style and to improve their health as they approach senior years.
