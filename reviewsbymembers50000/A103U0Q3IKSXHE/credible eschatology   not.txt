 A thin volume that is very dense! John Polkinghorne is a physicist and theologian. In this well written book, he attempts to pull together our experience in this modern world with a belief in God. He uses the "model" of scientific thinking to support his theological thinking.      Many of the writers on my book page are taken to task here, and I admit to having a bit of a struggle following all of Rev. Dr. Polinghorne's logic. In the end, I was not convinced, yet the writing is compelling and I have now gone through much of the book several times over. I was looking for an understanding of ancient scripture that breaths new meaning for today. And indeed, some cases of "updated thinking" has given new life to the stories and metaphors of the Christian scriptures of my youth. But some must simply be abandoned. There is precedent to do so. Yet we seem, as a people, to stubbornly hold onto other literal interpretations and it gets us cross-wise of our intellectual understanding.      Polkinghorne has received recognition from the Templeton Foundation for this work. No doubt it is well deserved. For example, Polkinghorne has this to say about an updated Christian view: "A credible eschatology, which takes account of the eventual death of the universe and looks beyond it to God's new creation, is surely an indispensable component in realistic Christian thinking."      Still, I am not convinced that he has shed any light for the belief in God in an age of Science. Despite his credentials in science, his theology gave me no sound logic for "proving" the existence of God. In the end, it is still a matter of faith - you either believe it, or you do not. You either have it, or you do not and this book, to my understanding, did not change the picture for me. Yet I highly regard and highly recommend this book to you!
