 Mr. Schwartz is the author of Webonomics. In Digital Darwinism, we are presented with "7 breakthrough business strategies for surviving in the cutthroat web economy." They are: 1. Build a grand that stands for solving problems 2. Allow your prices to fluctuate freely with supply and demand. 3. Let affiliate partners do your marketing for you. 4. Create valuable bundles of information and services. 5. Sell custom-made products online, then manufacture them. 6. Add new value to transactions between buyers and sellers. 7. Integrate digital commerce with absolutely everything.     From a technical point of view, I found little new in these strategies, but perhaps that is because I work in a technology field. For those who are trying to bring a "old economy" business into the "new economy," this book will be a valuable source of ideas for the inevitable culture shock.     The writing style is clean and concise, and the ideas are clearly presented, illustrated with examples, and brought to us in a believable story form. Even the typeface and page layout make this book easy to read. At the end of each chapter appears a short summary of the key points which can easily serve as a quick refresher when thinking through the implementation of new strategies.     In the end, one must remember that the very lessons of the author will also render his book short lived. Things will change (and are already)! But there are definitely some principles for how to think about this new, evolving digital world that will help us move forward and maintain our position in the evolution of this digital world.
