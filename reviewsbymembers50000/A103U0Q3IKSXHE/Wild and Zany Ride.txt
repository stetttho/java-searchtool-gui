 I have heard so many references to this book recently that I had put it on my list of books to fill in between the more challenging reading I have to do. The last straw was when a visiting minister to our pulpit used this guide as a jumping of point to explaining the our religious practices to newcomers. So of to the on-line store and soon this nifty little volume was at my doorstep. What a blast! The antics of Arthur Dent and Ford Perfect are so zany that they have to make you chuckle if not laugh outright. And the perpetually sad robot, Marvin, infuriates the reader as quickly as the other characters in the book. So if you want a break and a thoroughly enjoyable romp through the Universe, this is the best place to start. I'm bound to pick up the rest in this series in order to continue to partake in this dry English humor.
