 Karen Armstrong is a leading commentator on religious culture. Her best selling books, A History of God and Buddha received excellent reviews. Having read Buddha, I was looking forward to Muhammad, and I was not at all disappointed. Somehow, I missed reading A History of God, so I will attend to that next.  "Muhammad had great spiritual as well as political gifts - the two do not always go together - and he was convinced that all religious people have a responsibility to create a good and just society." With this statement, early on in her book, Armstrong sets the tone for an objective look at the third of the Abrahamic religions. With clear logic and supportive historic facts as well as contextual interpretations, she lays before the reader the opportunity to understand the struggles of the Islamic faith.  Armstrong takes us through the development of Muhammad from his early days as the enemy of the establishment in Mecca, to his firm conversion to a man of al-Llah, through wars and political intrigue to, finally, the death of the Prophet. Throughout her journey through Muhammad's history, Armstrong enlightens us and helps us sort out fact from fallacy.  The picture of Islam that emerges is one that belies all the turmoil and hand wringing over the concerns of terrorists who continue to use religion to obtain their political ends. Instead, Muslim rulers agree to be held accountable for their actions, and ask their followers to "put them right" if they do not do well by their people. I encourage all who wish to understand the complex issues behind the turmoil and violence of today's world to put this excellent book on their reading list.
