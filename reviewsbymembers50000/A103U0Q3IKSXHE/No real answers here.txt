 Having read this book, with some difficulty in sticking to it, I have to admit that the word "shrill," comes to mind. I was disappointed with how Mr. Smith tried to approach this subject and confess to having learned a great deal more reading David Ray Griffin's book Religion and Scientific Naturalism. At least there, concrete steps for both Religion and Science were given. Mr. Smith, using broken flashlight analogies, diatribes against science, and references to fictional books (Kingsolver) tries to build a case for traditionalism. He is far from successful.  Still, there are passages that do provide some food for thought and a bit of enlightenment. I was looking for more concrete understanding of the opposing views. In the end, Mr. Smith seems to lay the whole responsibility for reconciling science and religion at science's door. Intuitively, one knows that religion owns some of the problems with the reconciliation, so what are they? Perhaps theologians have enough "world view" to understand how science can coexist with religion, but what about the masses who have to live every day with the conflicts between what they observe, what is accepted knowledge, what is practical and what is the religious instruction given to them to believe? I did not find real help with these questions.
