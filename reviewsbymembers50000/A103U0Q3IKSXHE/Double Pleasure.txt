 This book was recommended to me by one of my business Advisory Board members. It has turned out to be an excellent recommendation. Two great books in one - the left side of each page has a story for my left brain and the right side has a story for my right brain. This volume is full of ideas on how to develop multiple streams of income and leverage talents of those around you. From the Millionaire Ahas the authors take us through Mentors, Teams, Networks, and the manifestations of all that we've learned. This is accomplished with both the "text book" approach (left side pages) while weaving a wonderful story that exemplifies the lessons in prose (right side pages). I was so impressed with this book that I rented the audio version so that I could re-enforce the lessons while driving around town. Many say that today we are not just in a "jobless recovery," but that we are in a "job-LOSS recovery." Those in my network would agree, and they would also agree that this book shows the only way out of the dilemma for many people in transition. Whether you learn the lesson from the heart-rending story of Michelle Ericksen or from the more traditional approach, the One Minute Millionaire is more than worth your time, it is worth your effort to employ the lessons.
