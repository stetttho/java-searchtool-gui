 This is not my usual fare, but was loaned to me by a friend. I found the book so interesting that I immediately purchased a copy for myself along with the rest of the series! I am not a history buff and usually do not spend much time reading history. Yet this historical fiction of the people of the North American continent caught my imagination and provided grist for the mill in a recent presentation I made on the origins of consciousness.  A very well written story with detail of the lives of our ancient ancestors and how we might have lived, evolved, and dreamed. It is refreshing to have a shared hero and heroine, with the story of how our patriarchal society might have also evolved from the life of hunter-gatherers.  The Gears bring their considerable knowledge to bare in the weaving of this intriguing story of our heritage. It is obvious that they have paid attention to the details and are trying to put together the most plausible explanation of how life might have been in the transition from the last ice age. The people live in clans and are dependent upon each other for survival. They struggled for leadership just as any other group of humans and fought over the viability for the best ideas of survival. They fought change, they tried hard to maintain their contact with the spiritual side of existence and they were deeply respectful of life.  We follow the mammoth hunters as they struggle for survival during the stress of "others" forcing them from their normal hunting grounds and camps. They struggle with the balance of peaceful coexistence and warring to protect the life they know. And then they face the incredible challenge of going against all their accumulated knowledge to follow Wolf Dreamer under the ice to a new land. In many ways, this is a perfect "Campbell hero story" and as such, is inspiring, interesting, and has lessons for us even in this far removed time. I am looking forward to the rest of the series.
