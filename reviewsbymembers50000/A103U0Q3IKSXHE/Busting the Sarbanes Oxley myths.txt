 Boards of all shapes and sizes are wondering about the affect that Sarbanes-Oxley act will have upon their operations, accountability, and liability. But what about the managers running the day-to-day operations? Mr. Green kept his promise to "introduce groundbreaking and practical 'Control Smart' approach that not only meets the requirements of Sarbanes-Oxley, but also alerts you if operational controls stop working or are otherwise compromised."  While larger companies can afford to spend millions of dollars to implement control system monitoring tools, managers of small to mid-sized companies can be unsure of how to move forward if their budgets can't accommodate expensive advisors and systems. Mr. Green tells us in a forthright and clear manner that we must not depend on others to audit accountability into our reporting systems any more than we are able to test reliability or quality into our products. He places responsibility for our transparent transactions squarely on the shoulders of every manager and every employee throughout the organization.  The "Control Smart" approach to understanding where we need to make transformational changes and where we can live with transitional changes is easy to understand even as it is complex and difficult to execute. But we must all attempt to do so. Green insists that we can "walk our talk by taking the culture of our companies seriously. We are able to create positive values as company objectives and appropriately compensate those who uphold the company image." In this well written book, you will find the answer to just what it is that managers today need to do to implement the spirit and the law of Sarbanes-Oxley.
