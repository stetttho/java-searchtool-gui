 First I must start by saying that Taproot are one of the most compelling live bands I've seen in the last year(saw them Louisville/Jillians Oct,18).  I have had "Gift" since the week it was released in 2000.  I stand by that record as a defining point in what todays melodic hard rock/metal bands.  It would seem many bands are following the lead of both Taproot and Chevelle.  "Welcome" is a fresh start for Taproot, who were constantly considered a Tool/Korn hybrid with their debut album.  It's fair to assume that many fans will now say Taproot are a Deftones/Incubus hybrid. Granted, there are some similarities, but it would be a mistake to say that they lack originality.  People like to categorize everything especially now that Taproot are in a position to have their own unique sound.  They have taken a giant step in the right direction with "Welcome." First and foremost with "Welcome" the musicianship has improved 10 fold.  These songs are infinitely more complex than any song on "Gift".  The songwriting has an emotional and witty depth that was lacking on Gift as well.  Gift remains one of the best debuts I've heard for its intstrumental fury and emotional vocal outbursts, but Welcome is a very mature step forward.  While this may alienate some "quick to pass judgement" fans of Gift only the foolhardy would not give "Welcome" a fair 2 or 3 spins.  Stand out tracks include the catchy and hard edged single "Poem", the nearly-a-ballad "Art",the heavy but harmony laden "Myself" the mellow(but very well done) "Like" and the dark, heavy, yet errie "Dreams". Minus one star for not having any crushingly heavy songs like "Smile" "Again and Again" and "Now"(all three were live fan favorites).  But otherwise a worthy purchase for fans of Taproot.
