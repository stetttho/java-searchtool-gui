 Now here is an album that will pull you out of the all too crowded rap/metal genre and into something much more...Powerfull. Metal has never been more sleek.  Lajon(the lead singer) has a voice that is nearly extinct in the overpopulated metal jungle. Only a handful of singers can compare: Chino of Deftones, Maynard of Tool/A Perfect Circle, and Brandon of Incubus. Happily Chino shares his craft on this album.        When I bought Sevendusts first record I thought," This is good record but they could refine this, this, and that..." Surprisingly, everything that was missing or a little low key in the first album is back with a vengence. Morgan Rose, both drums and back up vocals(which are incredible)have been moved closer to the mic, so to speak. Every other member seems to have improoved by leaps and bounds. No sophomore jinx here folks, this is an epic making record if there ever was one. While this album is more introspective than the former there is no lack of crashing metal here. Home, Denial, LickingCream, and Bender are my favorites but every track is stellar. If you like this record check out the track "Fall" on the Scream 3 soundtrack it should have been on "Home" its a keeper, not a B-side.
