 Generally I try to keep my ears low to the ground, so as to hear the best underground acts before they arrive on the mainstream, and on my radio.  Mudvayne came as quite a shock when I saw them on Mtv(of all places) early last winter.  I was first exposed to them through their single "Dig", a frighteningly heavy song.  At first I was unmoved, and thinking; "Well look, its Slipknot 2." However, Mudvayne come from somewhere deeper and (you may want to sit down) "darker" than their dear friends in Slipknot.   Their singer wields a vocal style that can sound like John Davis of Korn or Maynard Keenan of Tool(I kid you not).  Their lyrics even seem to be (1 part Korn, 2 parts Slipknot, 1 part Tool), which basicly means, really creative, quite shocking, and for the most part disturbingly witty and intelligent  Their bass player stands out as well, while not quite the next Les Claypool, he stands on his own as one of the better bassists in metal today.  The drummer wraps the unussual package with frenzied drum patterns and a stunning display of double bass drum talent.  Their guitar player also shows a versatility uncommon to nu-metal or even just regular ol' metal today.  These musicians sound like weathered pros to be blunt.  If you have only heard "Dig" please dont base them on that frantic single. If you hear songs like "-1", "Deathblooms", "Cradle", and "Severed", you will quickly see where the Tool/Korn/Les Claypool comparisons spring from.  This is easily the best debut cd I've heard in the last 2 years as far  metal is concerned.  LD 50 is a worthy debut and points toward a more cerebral direction for metal fans to direct their faltering hearing.
