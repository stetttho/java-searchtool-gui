 Abandoned Pools' Humanistic is a supurb rock debut. Fans of Vast, Dave Navarro, Sunna, and A Perfect Circle will find alot to like here.  Former Eels bassist Tommy Walter has outdone himself lyricaly, vocally and instrumentally. While comparisons to the Smashing Pumpkins abound, and indeed there is justification for it, vocally Walter couldn't sound any MORE differnt from Billy Corgan.  If your desperate for vocal comparisons one might say he sounds like Jon Crosby of Vast and less often, but sometimes like Richard Patricks'(Filter) more melodic moments. Musically, Abandoned Pools are comprable to a less industrial and more straight forward rock version of Nine Inch Nails or Filter(their 2nd record anyway).  There is no goth/industrial overtones to be found on Humanistic. Just mild industrial undertones. Despite the use of a keyboard & synthesizers you would be VERY hard pressed to compare Abandoned Pools to Deadsy,Orgy or Godhead. Abandoned Pools are as differnt from(and better than) those bands, as Tool is from Britney Spears...which leads us to lryical content.  Tommy Walter's song writting style can be compared to the dynamic of Maynard Keenan or Trent Reznor. A varitable mastermind.  This cd would be at home in anyones collection (unless of course, u only listen to rap, country, pop, or blistering death metal).  If you like driving hard rock and the occasional mellow song <with several songs landing between the two extremes> this is your disk. Stand out tracks include but are not limited to the current single "The Remedy", the very well done ballad "Start Over", "Monster" a near perfect hard rock track, and the dark and haunting but beautiful "Flourescein".
