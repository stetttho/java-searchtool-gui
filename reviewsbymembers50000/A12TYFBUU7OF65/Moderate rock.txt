 While not a bad cd I can find little rave about.  Its very well done vocally and instrumentally but in my opinion not very memorable.  Feel so Stupid(the single, though I didnt know it till recently) is by far the best track.  The singer is very similar to Brandon Boyd and Doug Robb of Incubus and Hoobastank.  The emcee is a little harder to coral into a category however, though at times he reminds me of (HED)PE voalist MCUD. Genearally I steer clear of bands that stick to an obvious and overplayed pop format, and DWR are far from cookie cutter pop, but taking their sound to a more radio friendly territory would guarantee sales in an era where Alien Ant Farm and Lost Prophets dominate radio and MTV. If your looking for something less glossy and studio-perfect than Linkin Park but in the same genre give these guys a shot. This band has potential, their debut cd just lacks what makes their live shows so entertaining.
