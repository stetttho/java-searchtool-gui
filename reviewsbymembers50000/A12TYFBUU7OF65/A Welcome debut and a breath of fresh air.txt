 While there have been a few outstanding debuts from melodic/heavy bands(Flaw, Lifer,Chevelle,Taproot and Mudvayne) none sound quite like One Side Zero. The singer has a vocal style similar to the singers of the aforementioned bands, but sounds most like Aaron Lewis and Chino Moreno of Staind and Deftones.  The tracks range from mellow too thunderously heavy but more often than not, land somewhere in the middle.  Tracks like "Instead laugh" and "Holding cell" show the singer/songwriter's lyrical talent most vividly.  I've had the album for nearly a month and I find it safe to say that there are few if perhaps even zero lulls from begining to end.  This cd may not cut it for fans of Slipknot or Mudvayne, and there is no rap metal to be found found for Linkinpark, LimpBizkit, and (Hed)PE loyalists.However,OneSideZero held their own when opening for Sevendust in a Louisville bar (largely metal head, punk or mainstream rock audiance)and those in attendance responded quite favorably.  So If your looking for a moody progressive/melodic/metal band that may be a little heavier than Incubus and a little more tame than Taproot or Mudvayne, this is most likely what your looking for.
