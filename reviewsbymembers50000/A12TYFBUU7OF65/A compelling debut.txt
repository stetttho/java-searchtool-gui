 An introduction record of this magnitude is hard to come by. Comparable to the debuts of Vast, Korn, and Nine Inch Nails. This record will apeal instantly to fans of no brainer metal and the more picky fans of bands like Tool, Deftones, and Cold.  While there is an emphasis of rap/metal hybrid of some of the tracks the opening 4 tracks are pure quality.  The lead singer sounds like Maynard Keenans gifted little brother but they are in no way a Tool clone(i wish there were more). Their instrumental approach is all their own.  This band speaks to a younger audiance, but at 20 (still young i suppose)I can look back and say that i felt and feel the singers pain. Fans of Tool, A Perfect Circle, Finger 11, LimpBizkit, and Incubus can all rally behind this record,
