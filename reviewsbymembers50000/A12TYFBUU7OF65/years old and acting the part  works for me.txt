 Seven successful albums (2 of which were absolutely massive)and the Offspring are as high energy as ever, certainly more so that their last record. Conspiracy of One was a strong but quite scattered offering, unlike the massively popular and high speed "Americana" and "Smash", or the fan celebrated "Ixnay on the Hombre".  This album is a welcome return to the Offspring PRE-"pretty fly/original prankster".  And all the more power to em! The first radio single "Hit That" is about as slow and "Why dont you get a job?" as this album gets. Songs like "Lightening rod", "The Noose", and "Da Hui" are pure hyperactivity. And those songs certainly play to the bands strength: simple message wrapped in good prose and fired at high velocity. You cant ask for better from the Offspring. "Race Against myself" is the offspring playing with the more metal-guitar aspect of their sound, and it pays off in spades. Without a doubt one of the albums highlights for any fan.  True to the Offsprings sense of humor, funny lines abound when they're appropriate.  The "Worst hangover ever" is a common but humorous tale as told through the words of an unlucky slob having to face the morning sun after a kegger the night before. You cant help but sympathize.  Capping off the album is perhaps the most bizarre Offspring song to date.  "When your in prison", is a cautionary tale of how to watch oneself when in the titanium bars and concrete community.  This is one of those jokes thats funny by the way it's told not what it says.  Rather than spending 300 words trying to desribe the unique instrumentation or vocals of the song ill let the(patient, if your still with me)reader find out.  If you like the Offspring there is no reason not to get this record, it matches their best.  Minus half a star for a shorter than average record.
