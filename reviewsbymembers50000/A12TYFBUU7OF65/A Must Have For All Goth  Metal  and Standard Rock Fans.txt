 How can I put into words the incredible album that is Vast.  I am a  devoted fan of NIN, Tool, A Perfect Circle , Deftones, Econoline Crush, and  Stabbing Westward. If even one of these groups apeals to you this album  should be the jewel of your collection.  There are metal tracks that  neither Korn nor Metallica could hope to surpass, There are haunting  ballads that put Goo goo dolls, Depeche Mode, and Tonic to shame, and there  are energetic rock tracks that surpass the best of Nine Inch Nails, Bush,  and Smashing Pumpkins.  Each track is crafted to perfection(I dont use the  word lightly). John Crosby is a talent waiting patiently to be  mainstreamed, his vocal and guitar abilities soar for such a young muscian.  Having had the privalige to listen to "Free" from their new  album, and various other tracks, I can happily say that this is the next  epic-making champion in rock today.  While the new album has mellowed out  considerably, one can tell immediately that Crosby and his talented  bandmates are onto something......Much the same way Trent Reznor and Kurt  Cobain were prior to breaking into mainstream. If your still reading  "thank u".  Back to the album itself: I own over 100 cds and this  is among my top 10 favorites, its not because I favor a certain sound  because with Vast the listener gets virtually every kind of rock type(no  rap, sorry Durst punks) Why are u reading any further, This album is worth  its weight in whatever form of money u may handle. BUY THIS!!!
