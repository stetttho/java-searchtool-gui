 I've had this cd since their April 2nd show in Louisville with Mushroomhead and they were incredible. Hands down one of the best live shows/cds I've had the pleasure of hearing. Their vocals are varied(death meatal growls, Deftones-esque screams, and Mike Patton inspired singing.) but extremely potent. The vocal assault of the guitar player contrasts with the singer perfectly. The guitar riffing is top notch and the keyboard and piano work is actually done tastefully, adding a dimension to their sound that is uncommon and incredible. The bassist and drummer are exceptional, far better than many of todays more commercially successfull bands to boot. Tracks 1.(Double Minus X) 2.(King of the Hill) and 10.(The Infinity)<my favorite> are very well done.  After a few spins track 8.,Syndrome Down, became a a favorite as well. But nearly every song on the cd is a gem in its own right. Fans of Flaw, Tomahawk, Deftones, Mudvayne, OneSideZero and Lifer may enjoy this band a great deal.
