 I have liked Bush for quite awhile now. I'm not what one would call a ficle music fan.  If a band reels me in and stays fairly consistant with its sound and appeal then I will continue to buy their records. Granted, I am easy to please.  The latest installment from Gavin Rossdale and crew is "The Science Of Things" and as the title implies, there may be much learning to do concerning the inner workings of Bush. While the messages from song to song are as eratic as the dancing cats Gavin croons about, overall this a solid album.  "Warm Machine" and "The Chemicals Between Us" are quite remarkable rock tracks.  There is more sampling and sound effects (in contrast to their previous albums) which compels one to wonder if the success of the "Mouth" remix from 1997 encouraged this new twist in Bushs sound.  But dont let my mention of samplings fool you, Bush is almost unchanged from Razor Blade Suitcase.  Which is a good thing, slow evolutuion is how Bush can retain its massive grunge rock fanbase for the long run.  The most striking aspect of this album is probably the clean, polished, and practiced sound the band has taken on. There is a new sense of genuine quality here. Gavin and Nigel Pulsford seem to have a added a new dimension to their trade mark guitar bombast. If I had to point out one shining moment on the whole album it would be "Letting the Cables Sleep". A ballad that is far more grounded and twice as complex as "Glycerine" from Sixteen Stone.  Overall this is a superior album to Bushs previous albums, and while it may not weild as many radio hits(4 by my count)as the last 2 albums, the quality is undeniable.
