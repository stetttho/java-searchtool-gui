 Flaw are the personification of what (nu)metal is evolving into today.  Bands such as OneSideZero, Lifer,and Incubus are taking some of Korns heavy funk-metal influence and throwing in Maynard Keenan(Tool/A Perfect Circle) vocal stylings.  Its a powerful combination. Radio friendly versions of that sound (Hoobastank/Alien Ant Farm) are everywhere today .  Flaw however, are a far cry from radio-darlings.   The songs range from moody-semi mellow tunes to clamoring raucous metal tracks.  "Only the Strong"  kicks off the record and sets the tone immediately, it IS a perfect balance of the extremes of the whole album.  "Payback", the current single, is a fury anthem of errie Deftones/Tool sing-song verses that tumble into a screaming raging chorus thats nearly as heavy as Mudvayne or Slipknot, with Morgan Rose(drummer/singer of Sevendust) shout/growl style vocals. The album teeters back and forth continuously, "My Letter" is simply a well crafted and melodic masterpiece the conjurs A Perfect Circle to mind.  "Amendment" feels like a more intense version of "Ball Tongue" from Korns debut album.  I would suggest this record to fans of Tool,Sevendust,OneSideZero,Deftones, Staind,Lifer and Cold. For fans of those bands this is simply a stellar album.   Standout tracks include(sorry for the repitition): "Only the Strong", "Payback", "My Letter", "Get Up Again", "Whole", "Amendment" and "Best I Am". The other tracks are fairly effective but not as grand as those I mentioned.
