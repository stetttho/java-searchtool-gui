 Stabbing Westward, since mid 1996 have been one of my favorite bands(along side of Tool,Deftones,NIN,Filter) What made them unique from hundreds of other hard rock and industrial bands is Christopher Halls haunting vocals and moving lyrics, often even more personal than those of Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails fame. While I wasnt a fan of their debut album Ungod, their second album reeled me in, and their third album is a respected masterpiece of industrial/rock.  Their forth album, a self titled cd, is far more mellow and devoid of most of the industrial effects that made their sound so unusual.  Some might call this selling out, but I see it more as a progression. Once again Chris Halls vocals seem to be notably better, and his lyrics remain as compelling as they always have been. The bass and drums seem to have a more substantial role on this record, while the keyboards and guitar fade in and out at times.  Overall I give this record a 4 out of 5. while i was expecting the industrial punch that I've gotten with  "Whiter Blister Burn and Peel" and "Darkest Days", they nearly compensated for it with a high quality album that is equal parts ballad and hard rock.  In my opinion their best tracks are :Wasted, So Far Away, Remember, and The only thing.
