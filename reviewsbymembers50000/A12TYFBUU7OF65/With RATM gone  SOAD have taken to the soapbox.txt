 With Rage against the Machine split up there would seem to be a sudden shortage in the world of metal fueled by politics.  Worry not people, System of a Down have arrived. This metal outfit has built up a respectable fan base for having only one album to their credit.  After hearing the first track it is rather easy to deduce why.  They bring everything to the table that a nu metal outfit should bring, but theres more. An unmistakable sense of urgency and even chaos at times. Drifting between fast punk style guitar and vocals, to heavy bass and drum intensive "almost" goth metal, this album truely captures their live sound. I've had the album for more than a year now and having seen them on the Summer Santitarium tour with metal giants Metallica and Korn, I can honestly say they held their own. Despite being an opening act, they surpassed Kid Rock in audiance appluase I might add. Fans of Korn will appriciate SOAD because, like John Davis, their lead (Serj Tankian) singer seems to be teetering on the edge of insanity not just at moments, but at all times.  This does not diminish from his overall sound, it improoves upon it.  The rest of the band plays like a well oiled machine(not to be raged against). The bands message seems to vary from anti-genocide and subliminal mind control to gaining independence from oppression, not ussually subject matter for a metal outfit. Fans of Korn, Rage, Soundgarden, Static-X and the older material of the Deftones will gravitate to this record instantly.
