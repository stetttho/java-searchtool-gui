 If there are two trends I have come to notice regarding 311, it would be that each album is substantially differnt from and ussually better than the previous. I've had "From Chaos" for nearly a year to the day and I still find it in my car cd player.  What keeps this record from getting tiresome is diversity. One may even make the case that diversity is what 311 have been about since their debut, nearly a decade ago. Giddy bass driven songs like "Sick Tight" and "You Wouldnt Believe" are kept in balance by mellow and highly original ballads like "Amber" and "Champagne". "Hostile Apostle" showcases 311's distaste for ... acts and bands who brandish hyper aggressive lyrics to compensate for lack of talent...It doesnt take a rocket scientist to decode which multi-plantnum ... rap/metal band they are addressing. The band alternates from heavy, mild, upbeat and middle of the road seamlessly from "You Get Worked" to "I'll be Here Awhile", which is a light hearted and upbeat track that closes the record on a positive note. Also worth noting is the slight but noticible improvent in Nick Hexum and S.A's vocals.  They are a great vocal and lyrical team, one that few can compare to. One can only hope that 311's next record can match or surpass this one.
