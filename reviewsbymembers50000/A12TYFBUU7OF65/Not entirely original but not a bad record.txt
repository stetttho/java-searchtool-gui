 Godhead was introduced to me most recently and I must say i'm quite impressed.  Godhead conduct themselves with equal parts Industrial-goth and Pop-centric metal.  Its a very potent combination. Without hearing a note, it can best be understood as Orgy at their very best fused with Marilyn Manson(Godhead happen to be on his label). Orgy+Manson+ a tiny bit of Nine Inch Nails=Godhead.  The lyrics too, are in the same vein as Mansons more introspective moments.  Their singer, Jason Miller even sounds like Jay Gordon of Orgy.      Now that I have made it way too clear as to what Godhead sound like, I can praise individual tracks: "The Reckoning" the opening track, is nothing short of breathtaking, theres a sense of urgency and even giddy excitement, while the lyrics are morbid but intimate...yeah, kinda odd.  "Sinking" the fourth track, and my personal favorite, has the most compelling chorus and lyrics.   While other tracks stand out, none match Godheads take on "Eleanor Rigby" from the Beatles.  Its very well done overall and is even picking up radio airplay on modern rock and alternative rock stations.  Supposibly Godhead are playing to welcoming fans at Ozzfest this year with their mentor Marilyn Manson, he shares vocal duty on a track on "2000 years of human error" as well. From track one to eleven you will find little filler perhaps 3 tracks at the most.  This album is a breath of freah air for anyone sick of rap-metal.
