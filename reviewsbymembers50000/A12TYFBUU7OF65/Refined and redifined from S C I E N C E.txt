 Heres an album that came from left field without so much as a warning. Make Yourself is a massive improvement over the....Stellar...album that is 1997's S.C.I.E.N.C.E. While no song on Make Yourself is as heavy or intense as favorites like "NewSkin" and "Redifine" (a work of instrumental art)The over all quality is polished to shiney finish, almost mocking the raw musical chaos that composed Incubus' first album. Now that "Pardon Me" and "Stellar" have graced the radio, its probably safe to say that Incubus could pass for the giddy, childish but gifted offspring of morbid progressive metal outfits like Tool and the Deftones(embrace run on sentinces people). Cutting to the chase, if your a fan of Tool, the Deftones, or even Staind but you take a life a little less seriously than they do, pick this one up, you wont be let down.
