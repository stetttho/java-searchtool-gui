 It is very possible I am one of the only people in the godforsaken state of Kentucky that appreciates this group and its mastermind of a lead singer/song writter. This is a must have for anyone who bought the first album. MFP may disapoint fans, but only at first(kinda like radiohead) the more u listen the more u will grow to like it. While it suffers from lack of driving rock and metal songs(the first record sticks to a simple formula of rock,ballad,rock,rock,ballad) it still stands as one of the jewels in my 175 plus cd collection. I think if the 3rd album takes a little of what the first and second album have offered, Vast will hit the blissfully unaware mainstream radio like a stone thru glass.
