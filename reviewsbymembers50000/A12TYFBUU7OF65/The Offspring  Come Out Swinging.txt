 This is the one band that got me into rock. Period. I have been a fan since I was 13(now 20) and will most likely remain a fan for a long time to come.  The Offsprings last five offerings have been nothing short of incredible, each cd is presented in a differnt manner than the former.  This works well in the long run, as we get to see a new side of Dexter, Noodles, Ron, and Greg as they have progressed over the last 11 years.  With Conspiracy of One, the Offspring "Come Out Swinging".  The initial track is in the same vain as "Have you ever" from Americana, or just about any track from their 3rd record, Smash. "Original Prankster", the second track, is in manyways the hybrid of "I Choose" from Ixnay on the Hombre and "Pretty Fly" from Americana.  "Million Miles Away" is an aggressive track that fans of Ignition and Smash will appreciate as it returns to the Offsprings long sought after roots.  The intensity of the album as a whole is probably greater than any Offspring cd with the exception of their self title debut.  Long time fans can let out a sigh of relief as there are not many "pop" hits here.  The Offspring certainly seem to be more concerned with keeping their fans happy than getting a new batch of them with this record.  Having listened to this record five times straight, I can find no low points or lulls except that it didnt captivate me in the same manner as Ixnay on the hombre. We all have our favorite I guess. If your a fan of any or all of the Offsprings records buy this one, as it seems to be the missing elements from every previous record rolled into one polished and aggressive package.
