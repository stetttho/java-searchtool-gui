 One of my top 20 records of all time (I am 22, and own 300 plus cd's).  Richard Patrick can now sing ladies and gentlemen.  Not only does he sing, he soars. More importantly, the "sameness" that made Shortbus feel like you were riding one, is totally gone!  I was hesitant to buy it(a few years ago now...)It took a few spins for me to appreciate this record though.  Filter can now be declaired a seperate entity from Nine Inch Nails as well.  "Welcome to the Fold" and "Its Gonna Kill me" are pleasent reminders that Filter can rock as hard as ever, but what makes this cd complete are the haunting industrial tracks("Cancer" and "Miss Blue") and the moving but radio friendly balladry "Take a Picture".  Middle of the road rock songs such as "Captain Bligh" and "The Best things" flash off some clever lyrics in place of a highly unique sound of other songs and are very catchy.  As of now this album is platinum plus in sales and one can only hope Filters next album, "The Amalgamut" can match or improove upon the near perfection of this album.
