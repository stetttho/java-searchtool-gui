 Yank Morgan is a man that should be proud. His nieces' parents died while they were very young, and he's raised all three girls - Annabelle, Sophie, and Michelle - to be very responsible young woman. Yank's gone so far as allow his sports agency - The Hot Zone - to also become a PR agency, and all three women, with their business degrees, play very important roles in their joint venture.   Presently, Brandon Vaughn needs The Hot Zone to represent him. Brandon has bad blood with Yank. Formerly a fantastic football player, and having suffered a career-ending injury, his former wife drew him to Yank's competition. Now that Brandon is trying to create a business in his hometown, and missing the fatherly relationship he once had with Yank, Brandon needs someone to represent him. This is critical because there is some serious sabotage going on at the lodge Brandon is building.   With Sophie and Michelle busy with other clients, Annabelle Jordan is forced to take on Brandon. The only problem is that her reaction to him - and any jock - is all-consuming. Will she be able to work with Brandon, with all the explosive chemistry brewing between them? One thing is for certain, Brandon is not just another jock. He has some powerful values that surpass anything Annabelle could have imagined.   Carly Phillips writes another winner with HOT STUFF! The characters are wonderful, and the story is written with exceptional pacing. I was drawn into the family dynamics, with eager anticipation for future stories in this series. Also, the side story of Yank's love life, or lack thereof, was a really nice touch. This August Harlequin single title of Phillips' will be followed in August of '05 and '06 with HOT NUMBER and HOT ITEM.
