 Well - I haven't read all the ratings - but I glanced and am not surprised at all to see most are five-star. Well deserved.  I won't go over the specs, as I'm sure if you've gotten this far, you likely know what they are. But, I've decided to write a brief review for a product I love.  Have had the Tapwave Zodiac 2 since mid-July, and with 128mb RAM, and 2 card slots - and with memory being very affordable - the world is indeed your oyster.  One of the best feature is the music - with a third-party music program - either with or without headphones - but with good headphones, you will quickly forget your surroundings.  Use third-party software and encode your DVD collection - put them on your SD card, and watch movies on the go! The screen is an ideal size, and the processor is fine for watching .avi movies.  Games are unbelieveable, and getting better - especially when they are Tapwave- or Zodiac-ready. Tried Madden NFL 2005 or Tony Hawk Pro Skater? You won't believe the graphics!
