 I'm a professional reviewer of fiction books - and I've gotten pretty good at that. My desire now is to try to get into beta teting and technical writing. It's not going to happen tomorrow, but if indeed it is ever to happen, I need to use multi PDA platforms - so I asked one of my writing groups to recommend a PPC. I wanted three things: A thumb keyboard, WiFi and Bluetooth and a bright, bigger screen. So, this PDA was recommended, and it is now in my hands.  Though I still love and use my Palm PDAs - Tapwave Zodiac 2 and Palm Tungsten C - I find the SPEED of the WiFi radio amazing - no setting it up to find my network - it happened automatically. One of my favorite things to to read news or ebooks late at night without disturbing my husband. Granted I can read and review ebooks with my Palm PDAs, but the WiFi on the Tungsten C prevented me from surfing the web unless I was in the same room with the wireless. With the iPAQ, I can surf the web, and collect email anywhere in my entire eight-room apartment. I've even gone out to the front porch and still have access!   I got used to the thumb keyboard with the Tungsten C. I like the backlight that comes with the iPAQ, but admittedly, it'll take some time getting used to the keys being a bit different (location wise, from the Palm), but I'm a quick learner.   For someone who hasn't crossed PDA platforms before, I'm truly glad I did.   I highly recommend this device, especially since the price range on Ebay is quite reasonable.  Robin T.
