Perhaps ten years have passed, and more than a few women, but his feelings for Holly are as strong as ever. Dylan can sense his Midnight Angel-a special endearment he has for her-still has feelings for him.   Though the powerful sexual connection is still intense, the question is whether or not she can trust him emotionally in this sensitive and pleasantly intense tale by Ms. Phillips.
