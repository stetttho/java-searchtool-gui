 In this sequel to Missy's megahit TROPICAL STORM Dar and Kerry find themselves back in their usual hectic routines after the Christmas holidays with one complication thrown into the mix - there's a new face on the block - an old one from Dar's past hired specifically to challenge the brilliant executive and with a grudge to settle as even more incentive. In the coming days the two lovers will be pushed to the limits emotionally and professionally as they're forced to attend a work retreat where they must try to keep their tempers in check, and their relationship hidden from people who could use it to destroy them. Lots of atmosphere, exceptional storytelling, charming humor and a profoundly appealing vision of the love between two soulmates always ensure the quality of a Melissa Good story. Her latest gets my HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION!
