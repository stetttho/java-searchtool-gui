 Known to her online fans as "Wishes", Judith K. Parker is one of the most prolific and talented writers to emerge from the Internet publishing arena.  Equally proficient at writing prose or poetry, skits or  parodies, Judith has built a reputation for her incredibly sensitive  commentaries on the human condition and an economy of language in her  writing style that makes every sentence count - every scene, every allusion  come to life.  STONE PILLARS is an extraordinary collection of some of the  best poems by this marvelously talented poet including the piece which  gives the collection its title and which has long been a personal favorite  among Judith's fans.  Even readers whose tastes do not normally extend to  poetry will find themselves turning the pages here, riveted by the simple  honesty and quiet impact of these beautifully crafted poems.  A true  delight, STONE PILLARS gets my HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION!
