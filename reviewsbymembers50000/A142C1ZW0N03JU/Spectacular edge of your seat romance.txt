 In her commercial debut Sharon Bowers brings us a RIVETING story set in the glamorous and often deadly underworld of Miami - a world in which wealth, and seductive pleasures exist side by side with violence and death.  It is into this very world reporter Liz Gardener finds herself stepping  into as she pursues a story that has obsessed her for years now - the  sordid tale surrounding a  dark, beautiful and deadly ex-DEA agent by the  name of Jude Lucien who having gone over to the other side is now one of  the most powerful and feared drug lords in the business. With very  different agendas, these two women will find themselves drawn to one  another - sensing something very real in the other - sensing perhaps that  neither is quite what she seems... This story is a WILD ride that will  simply take your breath away as lies are told and hearts broken in the  desperate struggle of two souls to persevere - struggling valiantly against  the inner darkness threatening to destroy their love and the human foes  determined never to give it a chance. Sharon's two heroines are beautifully  depicted with incredible depth, rich emotional histories and engaging  personalities. This is a FASCINATING, solidly crafted tale with a very  contemporary feel to it and a well-paced blend of action and drama. It  receives my HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION!
