 This is an epic western saga offering a marvelous mixture of rousing adventure, heinous villains, heart-stoping action, outlaws-turned-heroes and a romance that will just warm the heart.  At the center of this story are two women - one, a deadly gunslinger, bitter from the injustices in her  past - the other a gentle dreamer trying to escape the horrors of the  present.  Their destinies come together one fateful afternoon when the  feared outlaw makes the choice to rescue a young woman in trouble.  For her  part Josie Hunter considers the brief encounter at an end once the girl is  safe, but Rebecca Cameron has other ideas. Enthralled by the enigmatic  figure of the legendary bandit, and desperate to escape a life that is  quickly crushing her spirit, Rebecca decides to follow her rescuer - much  to the older woman's chagrin.  It is at first a difficult relationship but  one which slowly begins to grow and change and deepen as the two unlikely  friends share adventures, share their joys and pains and hopes and dreams,  only to in time discover...they also desperately want to share their  hearts.  This  is a beautiful, passionate love story that develops slowly,  pulling the reader into this drama as the leads themselves discover the  growing intensity between them.  The authors spent considerable time  researching the Old West which shows in the tale's air of authenticity.   Set aside some time for this one because it is a long, thoroughly  satisfying read you WONT want to put down.  An impressive accomplishment  that gets my HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION!
