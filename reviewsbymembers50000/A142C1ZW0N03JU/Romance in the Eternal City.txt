 A sequel to Belle's action-adventure DARKNESS BEFORE THE DAWN, this new story finds Captain Catherine Phillips agreeing to spend a few days in Rome to watch over her recovering flight attendant, Rebecca Hanson. Feeling  responsible for the young woman, Kate plans on an ordinary couple of days  keeping Becky company but to their mutual surprise, the stay in the Eternal  City soon becomes a magical holiday drawing two souls together and pulling  down walls that have been in place for much too long.  Featuring strong  characterizations with two very likeable leads, Belle's latest also offers  that air of excitement, magic and romance that was a part of the classic  movie which shares its title. A delightful read - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
