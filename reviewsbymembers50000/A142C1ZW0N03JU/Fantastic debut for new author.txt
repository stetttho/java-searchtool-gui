 Set in modern-day Miami, this terrific new novel centers on the lives of two strangers whose destinies bring them together amidst the turmoil of a hostile corporate takeover. Wealthy, brilliant and deadly, Dar Roberts has  cultivated a well-earned reputation as one of the most efficient corporate  raiders in the Information Technologies business. To her bosses she is a  formidable weapon to be used in the never-ending struggle for power,  control and profit. To the people employed by the companies she assimilates  - the executive is a predator - cold and merciless. It is a reputation she  is living up to as she prepares to decimate the work force of a recent  acquisition. In charge of that work force is Kerry Stuart - a smart, young  manager whose life had been going well until the recent turn of events.  With dogged determination, Kerry has escaped the pressures of family to  make her own way in the world - establishing a career and rising quickly  within a small company - only to now have to face the prospect of those  efforts being for naught as a disconcertingly beautiful blue-eyed shark  strolls into her office.  Missy's many strengths as a writer are quickly in  evidence throughout the first parts of this story - rich descriptions that  engage your every sense - multi-layered characterizations that draw you  into the psyche of the characters and a story very much grounded in human  emotions, human frailties and strengths along with the raw vulnerabilities  that ultimately make us all seek the comfort of another soul. Working in  the Information Technologies industry  herself and a native Miamian, Missy  also imbues the story with a very realistic feel. TS is one of the finest,  most engaging stories I've ever read - a fantastic professional debut for a  very gifted storyteller.  It gets my HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION!!
