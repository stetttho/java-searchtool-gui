 I've been using the Orange-Marigold Shampoo and Conditioner for about two years for my hair.  It keeps my red vibrant, rich and stunning.  I use it when my hair looks dull, sometimes as much as every other shampoo.  It says not to leave it on hair, but I do leave on the shampoo for a minute, then the conditioner for a minute.  I think it enhances my results.  Be careful not to get it on fingernails/hands, as it can turn them an ugly yellowish orange.  Use gloves.--This is a product that really delivers what it promises.  I've used other red-enhancing products from other lines such as Aveda, Biolage, etc.  They do not do nearly as good a job as Artec.
