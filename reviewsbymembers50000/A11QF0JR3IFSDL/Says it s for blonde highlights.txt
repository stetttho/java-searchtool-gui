 I had my red hair highlighted with brownish/blonde tones.  I decided to forgo my usual Orange-Marigold shampoo & conditioner and use this one for a while.  I think it is far more red than the packaging lets on.  It looks very coppery to me and it has turned my highlights back to red (hopefully temporarily).  Open the bottle before you purchase it to get a better feel for what the product really looks like.  I was disappointed because I have such fabulous results with other Artec products.
