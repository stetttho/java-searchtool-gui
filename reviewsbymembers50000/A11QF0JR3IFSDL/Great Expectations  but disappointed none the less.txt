 This film stayed with me for at least a day after viewing it.  I thought and thought about what the ending might 'mean'--my thoughts led me to this conclusion:  This movie is just rambling and boring by the end.  Like other reviewers, I kept waiting for the suspense to happen.  Nothing.  By the end I was just glad to tune out.  Perhaps this film is apt to please those with wild imaginations (one person assumed Julie was a product of an incestuous affair...blah, blah).  I am glad I rented it, in that I know that it was over-hyped.  I also think it was well-cast.  I like Charlotte Rampling-- and Ludivine Sangnier is stunning.  I suppose it's worth a watch if you enjoy copious nudity--though I didn't find it particularly offensive, just ample.
