 I have to disagree to some degree with those who say this is a *completely* biased piece.  I also have suspicions that those who trash this work have not read it in it's entirety, if at all.  Anna is certainly an advocate for the Chechen people, but she also attempts to show, albeit in small bits, the human side of Russian troops.  Her writing is vivid, impassioned, but sometimes choppy.  It can be difficult to read sometimes, but that may be the translation.  I'm not sure how the September 11th attacks should obscure any opinions in favor of Chechen independence.  Those views expressed appear to be shallow, with a blind, "follow the leader" approach.  This shouldn't be an issue where you chant, "go team!"--Why not consider both sides?  If you go to www.hrw.org there are plenty accounts of Russian abuse of Chechens, to be fair there is also abuse from Chechen fighters on civilians.  This is a dirty war because it is corrupt on all sides.  You can also find numerous other articles, not just from Politkovskaya, that echo the same problems with corruption, human rights abuses, etc.  Steven Lee Myers of the New York Times is also a good source.  Why is it so unfathomable that soldiers might commit abuses, be xenophobic, rape, etc.  What about Elza Kungayeva's rapist?  He was a high ranking colonel.  Even though her rape was ommitted from her autopsy report and he was never actually convicted of rape, he still murdered her.  Is that okay?  Is that fair or right?  Is that not terrorism at it's finest? To form a solid opinion you really need to consider all sides; you need to look at the root problems, it isn't a simple issue.---And it's obvious that it cannot be resolved through military measures alone.  There really has to be some considerate discussion.  (Putin has blasted that idea so I don't think it will happen.)  And you cannot put blinders up and think that abuse is impossible, or even okay.  It's too easy to reduce the Chechens to a nation of terrorists.
