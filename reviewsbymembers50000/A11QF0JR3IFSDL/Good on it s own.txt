 It is clear to me that some other reviewers have neglected to see the movie and thus nullify their own opinions.  Enough said on that. I felt that this was a very solid CD from start to finish.  All of the songs flowed one to the other and made sense.--Especially if you saw the film (though I didn't particularly like it).  B&S are apt to tell stories as it is--listen to any song and you'll understand what I mean.  I must say that I have a great fondness for B&S and may be inclined to like this a tad more; however,  after DCW I can see that my loyalty is not blind.  This really is a good album.  Some may feel that it drug along or that it was boring, et cetera.  I thought it was beautiful, and I'm sure I'm not alone.  The instrumental F*ck this Sh*t was one of my favorites--and I loved Sarah's Storytelling.--By the way, Sarah is no faux Isobel as some have said.  Sarah is Sarah and she's in the band and Isobel is out. I would not buy this album if you are not patient.  I would not buy it if you thought Boy With The Arab Strap was the end all.  I would not buy it as a first glimpse of B&S.  I do recommend buying it if you love B&S--or can appreciate beauty.
