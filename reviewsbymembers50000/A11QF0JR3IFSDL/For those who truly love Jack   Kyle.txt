 Tenacious D are undoubtedly one of the MOST offensive bands ever.  I only say this after having watched the DVD, and the short films.  I have to say, I gagged more than once. ;)  But this DVD is worth it for those who truly love Tenacious D and can stomach them at their lowest humor.  Seeing the HBO show was fabulous as I'd never seen it previously.  This is a definate must for psycho fans such as myself.
