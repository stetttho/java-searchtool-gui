 I waited and waited for this DVD to be released and by the time it was I'd nearly forgotten how much I wanted it.--Needless to say, I remembered a few months later. Anyhow, when I saw the Amazon box sitting on my front porch I was giddy and smiley and ready to pop it into the player. I was not disappointed.  Finally, finally, I had a picture of them all. For me it was well worth the price of admission. I bounced about on my bed and sang along and was oh-so-happy. My husband came home a bit later and even though he's not a big B&S fan, he sat there with me, captivated by it all.--So I think it's well-worth having, and I'm assuming you're a B&S fan if you're reading this--so go along--buy it.
