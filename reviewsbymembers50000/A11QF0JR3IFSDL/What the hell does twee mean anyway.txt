 I guess I lost out on the meaning of the word, and if you know I assume you are better 'versed' than I in pop language.  I really don't care though.  I love Belle and Sebastian because they are beautiful, creative and perfect for a lady such as I.  There are the tunes set on a poppy landscape with melancholy lyrics that make you forget how sad it may be.  There are the tunes that make you want to sing aloud and maybe even dance to (if you have that luxury available)--then there are the quiet songs that break your heart and make crying in your car on the way to work okay.  Everyone has their own opinions, so I'll ignore the negative reviews, and just love them as they are.  There are no bad songs on this album.  It is strong from start to finish.  Each song is a story that is worth telling and I'm glad that I can have a listen.
