 I could only define myself as an adoring fan.  I've loved most everything B&S have done.  I even loved the Storytelling soundtrack.  I loved the instrumentals.  I loved Fold your Hands... when others didn't.  I saw beauty in most of what I heard, which is ultimately why I loved them so.--I even flew down to San Fran just to see them, taking more vacation than I had money--just for the pure pleasure of being in the presence of B&S.  Just to see them play.  That being said--This album broke my heart.  I just don't completely feel it, and I still don't, a couple of weeks later.  It's a pleasant background as I work in the back at my library job, but it's not what I would call fabulous.  I do love Piazza, New York Catcher--and for that I can be happy I purchased the album.  I also love Stay Loose, which (pardon the pun) loosely reminds me of The Cure.  The first two tracks are pretty and poppy and zip right along like a cartoon soundtrack.  I like them well enough.  Unfortunately, I didn't have the highest expectations of this album and I knew Christmas would be over when I unwrapped this gift.**Update** I have somewhat changed my mind about DCW.  Although I like it better than at first, the newness has worn off in a way I'd never experienced with their previous albums.  Funny thing is, despite having been a huge B&S fan prior to this album, I am no longer:  Just another band, another album... I'm not terribly fond of the religious references either, but that's my personal opinion.  Perhaps a Christian would find this album more pleasing.
