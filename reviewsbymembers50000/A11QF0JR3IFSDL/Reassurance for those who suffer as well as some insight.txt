 The first day I got this book I nearly read all of it.  It was that interesting, even to me, who also suffers from this wretched illness.  I felt like I had finally found a book that I could relate to.  Many of the previous books I had read relating to bipolar disorder were written by doctors who treat, not live, the illness.  It offered empathic and realistic insight into what those with bipolar disease suffer--and how they continually self-destruct.  It is a quick and easy read, yet it offers helpful advice, albeit mostly common sense.  It also offers point by point chapters that are easily accessible.  I think it would also be extremely helpful for loved ones of the mentally ill.  One warning for women with bipolar disorder:  ST. JOHNS WART CAN INTERRACT WITH BIRTH CONTROL PILLS. The author does not touch on this and I think it is important for women to be aware of this potential interraction.  I got pregnant as a result.  Since it was an unexpected pregnancy it threw me into a great depressive state that lasted the entire duration of my pregnancy.--Which leads me to my next point:  I would have liked to have read some things about bipolar disorder and motherhood.  Since many woman are diagnosed in their twenties, some of them may be parents.  She touches on her mothering experiences very lightly--as they were experienced as a step-parent.  I am told I cannot have any more children because of my bipolar disorder--I wish I could find a book by someone who had experienced this as well.--In any case, it is a good book.  I highly recommend it to patients, students, family, friends, etc.
