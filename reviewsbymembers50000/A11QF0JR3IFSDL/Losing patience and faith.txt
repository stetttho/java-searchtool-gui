 I've had this album for a month, or maybe two--anyhow, I've had it since it came out.  I had such high hopes, as I did for Dear Catastrophe Waitress.  Admittedly, there were some gems on that album, if you can ignore the ridiculous Roy Walker.  This album doesn't do anything for me.  As another reviewer said, they once had 'it' but that 'it' is sorely lacking here.  I love the cover art, I love the album name, but inside it's a vapid mess.
