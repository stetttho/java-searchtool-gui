 I bought this book in anticipation of Meier's extended coverage of the Chechen conflict. What I did not know when I purchased this book, nor was mentioned anywhere on the reviews or on the cover, is that THIS BOOK IS EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE CHAPTER ON CHECHNYA IN BLACK EARTH.  In essense, I feel scammed.  Do not buy this book if you already own Black Earth.  You'll find out by page one that this is just a chapter taken out, repackaged and sold as a separate book.  I could not believe it when I read the first few pages--this is absolutely shameful.  Did the publishers and Andrew Meier think that the reading public is so stupid and so memory lapsed that we would not see this right away?  I do not appreciate the fact that I spent extra money on an unnecessary and misrepresented book.
