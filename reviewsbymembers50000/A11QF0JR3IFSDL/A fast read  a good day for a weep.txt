 I read this book on a rainy, lazy Saturday.  I wouldn't call it brilliant for a novel; in fact it had a short story feel.  The novel itself up until the ending was a breezy read, easy on the brain.  The last few pages were what is worth the purchase of this book.  I just remember feeling this immense sadness at the end, so I re-read the ending again.  It made me weep, a great-sobbing weeping that was ultimately very satisfying.  I think the sadness comes from being a mother; however,I won't give away the ending.
