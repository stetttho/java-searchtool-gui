 You so-called *indie* people are sad.  Why not just be, eh?  Why not just like what you like without it having to fit into your sad prescription of indie identity.  Lame.   Anyhow, as for this CD.  I like it.  I like the poppy tunes, true, but as I delve deeper into the album--as the tunes roll over to 5, 6, 7--I find myself liking it even more.  I love most of the tracks and especially 'Bury me with it'.  I don't like track 3 all that much, but you win some, you lose some.  This is an interesting record if nothing else.     As for that gal who was offended by the swearing.--Grow up for christ sakes! We're not in kindergarten lil' girl.  This is *maybe* music for grown-ups, and sometimes grown-ups (OOPS!!!) swear.
