 Let's face it.  The Ultra Dance compilation CDs have gone downhill ever since they let USA DJs mix the music.  To find DJs for a good Dance/Trance/Techno compilation, Ultra Records should have went with a european DJ or group.  Dance has never truly existed here at all.  Listen to some Scooter and you'll know what dance is.  And this is far from. The music on these CDs is hip hop and ambient with some keyboard thrown in.   Very disappointing. The one track I do enjoy is the "Fallen" remix.  It's a great trance track but not dance. So, overall I would say do not get this CD.
