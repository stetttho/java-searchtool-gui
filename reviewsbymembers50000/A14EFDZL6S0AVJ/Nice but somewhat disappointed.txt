 I've been a fan of Gigi for a while and I already own Tecno Fes v2 and L'Amour Toujours.  I was pretty excited to get this because it came out this year and has 24 tracks!  However, the best songs are not by Gigi.  I was disappointed with D'Agostino's songs on this CD.  They were too simplistic to me and I missed the 80-ish rhythm of the songs in Tecno Fes v2.  However I do like  most of the songs on the album.  It's one of those love or hate kind of CDs.
