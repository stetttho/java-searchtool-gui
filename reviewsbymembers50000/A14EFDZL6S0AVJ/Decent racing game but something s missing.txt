 Don't get me wrong, this game is a decent game but definately not as good as people said it was.  It is extremely hard and isn't very exciting to me.  As the race wears on, it begins to get boring and the races seem repetative.  This game has it's strong points as well.  The ability to play your own music is a big bonus (for me at least) and the graphics are good.  There is a great amount of cars like a Dodge Viper, Aston Martin Vanquish, and many others.  This is a great bonus for car fanatics like me.  Is Project Gotham worth [$]?  I highly recommend you rent it before you buy it. Pros: - Graphics - Amount of cars - Music abilities Cons: - Hard - Repetative - Somewhat boring
