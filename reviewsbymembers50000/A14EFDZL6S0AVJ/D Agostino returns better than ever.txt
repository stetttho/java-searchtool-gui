 The "Silence E.P." marks an important time in D'Agostino's career.  Gigi D'Agostino has not released a new album since his "L'Amour Toujours" CD which mainly relied on the hit "L'Amour Toujours (I'll Fly With You)".  That album was released in 2001.  From 2001 to 2003, Gigi switched roles and produced two compilation CDs, "Il Grande Viaggio" in 2002 and "Il Programmino" in 2003.  Both this CDs featured Gigi songs but something was gone.  Now, finally, "Silence" brings back the real Gigi, better than ever.  I must say that this is one of the best electronica albums I've heard in a long time.  Each song is amazing in it's own way, never sounding similar to another or getting boring. Although "Silence", "Complex", "Sonata", and "Apache" are my favorites, the entire CD is a masterpiece.   It's great to hear Gigi back in action and I hope to hear more in the future.  I highly recommend this CD.
