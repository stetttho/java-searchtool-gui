 I've recently gone through a hard trance/dance phase in my many years as a techno fan, so when I saw this, I was quite excited.  Unfortunately, this CD is horribly mislabeled as the songs it includes are no where near hardstyle.  The first track that really made me realize that this wasn't hardstyle was "Posse! I Need You on the Floor!" by Scooter.  Are you kidding me!?  Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of Scooter but they are no where near hardstyle.  Try eurodance/happy hardcore.  Unfortunately, the rest of the songs fit into that same category.  I expected something harder.  Much harder.  Perhaps tracks like Public Domain's "Americana" or Yoji Biomehanika's "Hardstyle Disco".  But they are no where in sight.    Extremely disappointing.  If you really want to hear hardstyle, check out "Future Of Hard Dance 002" by Yoji Biomehanika.  Greatest live DJ mix CD I've ever heard.  But not this.  And if you do get it, please don't tell your friends it's hardstyle because it's not.
