 At first, I gave this CD four stars.  However, as time goes on and I listen to the CD more and more, it's amazing.  It's one of the few techno CDs I can really listen to start to finish.  The only other bands to successfully do that for me is Scooter and Rammstein.  Darude, you've definately moved forward since "Before the Storm".  Keep going in the same direction as you are now and you'll enjoy much more success along the road. Although the songs "Music" and "Next to You" are supposed to be the big hits from this CD, it's songs like "Passing By" that make the album great.  With most techno CDs, it seems that the album revolves around one or two hits and the rest is just stuff to fill in the space.  Not so with "Rush".   "Rush" is a great CD for Darude and techno fans alike.  By moving out of the mainstream, Darude's music becomes much better.  I can't wait to see the next release from him.
