 I owe Gigi D'Agostino a lot.  He was the first artist that I discovered and really got me into techno.  That was about 5 years ago.  And in those five years, I still think he's the best DJ/artist out there.  Original sound, crisp lyrics.  I've bought every D'Agostino album/compilation he's released including this one.  Unfortunately, this is not his best.    "L'Amour Toujours" is a great song.  But apart from it and "The Riddle", the others song seem tacked on.  "Another Way" is decent, but the rest seem to mesh together in a somewhat bland experience.  If you want to really get into Gigi, start with "Tecno Fes v2".  Not only does it have "L'Amour Toujours", but great songs like "Amorelettronico" and "Cada Vez".
