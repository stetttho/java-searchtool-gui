 Only 2 words can describe this song.  FREAKIN AWESOME!  It's the best song I've heard in a long time.  I had begun to loose faith in dance music lately but this renewed that hope I had.  By the time the song is done, you're left thinkin "Wow".  However, I have no other Laut Sprecher CDs except this one.  Hopefully there is some around! Edit! - I just recieved the Laut Sprecher album and am listening to it for the first time right now.  I love this CD!  Every song is a hit and I can already tell I'll be listening to this for a long time!  The CD is called "Mach mal Lauter" and is available on Amazon.de.  Go out and get it if you like Omnibus!
