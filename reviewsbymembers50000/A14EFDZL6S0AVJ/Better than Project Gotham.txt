 I'm a huge fan of games like this.  You go flying through a crowded city at 150 and on the verge of flying out of control.  Think of it as Fast and the Furious in game form.  It's got a decent story line, is able to play your own music, decent graphics, and good controls.  The biggest bonus is the variety of cars.  Everything from a Plymouth Barracuda Hemi to a Dodge Viper to a Dodge Charger.  They're all here.  I'm very satisfied with this game.  The only bad thing is that there's too much light in my family room to be able to play night races during the day.
