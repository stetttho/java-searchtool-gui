 This group, the 4 Strings, is a lot like any other trance group based on a woman's voice (ie: Ian Van Dahl, Lasgo, etc.)  And, like all of those groups, have a reputation based on singles, not albums.  "Believe" proves it. The CD has a handful of good songs.  "Take Me Away" is a good start for the album, but once you get past "Diving", the CD begins to lack it's main appeal.   In my own view, techno/trance/dance has to find an artist that can make more than a couple good songs.  I have yet to find a good techno album where I can enjoy it the whole way through. If you can find "Believe" for under $10, go for it.  Any higher and it's a waste.
