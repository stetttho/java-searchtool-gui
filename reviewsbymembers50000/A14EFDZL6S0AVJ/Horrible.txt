 For a long time, I thought DJ Tiesto was nothing more than a rip-off.  In an attempt to become more familiar with the "worlds #1 DJ" I bought his DVD "Tiesto in Concert" and was very impressed with it.  Soon after I bought "Nyana" and enjoyed it as well.  Yesterday I decided to pick "In Search of Sunrise v3" and I cannot stand it.  The music is so lifeless and lacks so much energy.  Yes, trance is meant to be soothing but not enough to make listening experience bland and boring.  And that's exactly what this album is.   After hearing Andain's "Beautiful Things" on Nyana, I was sure I'd at least like the album for "Summer's Calling".  Wrong.  Slow and uneventful like the album itself.  The only song I really enjoyed was the "Southern Sun" remix by Tiesto himself but I had even heard that before so it was nothing new. Extremely disappointed in this CD and Tiesto.  For being #1, he sure has problems with releasing good albums consistly. I would NOT recommend this CD.
