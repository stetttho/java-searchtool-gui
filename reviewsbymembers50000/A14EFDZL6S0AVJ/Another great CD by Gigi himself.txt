 If you have listened to Gigi D'Agostino CDs and compilations before and liked them, do not pass this one up.  Not only is it better than his earlier compilation "Il Grande Viaggio..." but it has 2 CDs instead of one!  However, its similar to that CD in many ways. 1) It has it's sure of "pop-ish" songs, which is not bad.  However, if you're looking for hardcore techno, then it could pose a problem. 2) Gigi put a few new songs of his one this CD much like he did on the others.  Pretty good if you ask me. 3) You might find yourself skipping a lot of songs to get to ones you like, which is normal with compilations. Overall, I love this album.  I'd recommend it to everyone.
