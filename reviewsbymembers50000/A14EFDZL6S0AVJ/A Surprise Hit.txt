 With all due respect, anyone that throws a CD out of his car within 15 minutes of purchase and then writes a review shouldn't be reviewing at all. I found this CD in a local store and it was cheap so I picked it up.  Surprisingly good.  I agree, the beginning of the CD sounds stupid (begins with a radio commercial for the event), but the meat of the mixes is great.  Finally, some energetic trance!  Great melodies.   NOTE: Look at the track list.  36 songs.  This is a ONE CD album.  Basically, almost none of the songs are complete.  The mixes cut in towards the chorus and main melodies to fit the entire event on one CD. Overall, go out and get this CD.  Looks cheap, costs cheap, but the music is not.
