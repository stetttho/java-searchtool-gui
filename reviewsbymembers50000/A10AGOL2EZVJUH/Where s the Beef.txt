 The only factor that saves this release is the acoustic portion of the show. Equal in quality to the Reckoning release, you won't be dissapointed if you liked that album.  Things don't go so well for the electric portion of the show. Very much like Dead Set, we get some very lackluster versions of Dead classics. Fire on the Mountain, the same version from Dead Set, is very short. It makes me wonder if they were actually trying to appease some producer for a future release. That's pretty much the whole feel of the show (that we see). Although aptly played, each song lacks the X-chemistry edge expected for a hot night. Saint of Circumstance turns out to be the only tune that shows a glimmer of a spark. You know your fishing in a pretty dry hole if the highlight is here! The most bewildering aspect of all is that 1980 was a time of very intense and incredible jamming by the band. Its a shame that better representations of this period have not been released.  Dead Ahead does for 1980 about what Steal Your Face did for 1974.  And we all know what kind of year that was, right?
