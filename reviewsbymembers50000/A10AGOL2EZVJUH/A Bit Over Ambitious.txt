 This album is a cult favorite within a sector of the band's fan-base.  You either love it or not.  My theory tends to be that if you like Jethro Tull and other progressive rock groups where concept albums are the norm, you'll probably enjoy it.  If you find those kinds of projects boring and pretensious, you should probably avoid it.  Aside from Gottle of Geer, I'm comfortable recommending ANY other Fairport record over this one.  Had it been the only album the band ever made, it certainly would have merited a better grade than the one given here.  However, given the band's output, both prior and after Lee, it pales by comparison.
