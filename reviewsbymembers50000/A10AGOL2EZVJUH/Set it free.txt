 The Albion Band is an institution - more a laboratory than an actual "band" in the traditional sense.  Constantly shuffling new blood into ever-changing line-ups, Ashley Hutchings' experiments are usually most rewarding when they produce material with a timeless quality.  The music "captured" here does not meet this criteria.  Most of the original material seems very dated with a late 80's / early 90s studio slickness prevalent when these line-ups recorded them.  There have been some very sucessful Albion line-ups before and since this period.  Look elsewhere.
