 Before it's re-release on cd, NO ROSES had been a holy grail of sorts for Fairport fans. If you were lucky enough to find the long-deleted lp, a high price was usually in the asking. The reason - this album boasts the Leige and Lief line-up (minus Sandy and Swarb) with an army of other players including Maddy Prior and John Kilpatrick. I must warn you that more than one person has been disappointed with this work. Shirley Collin's singing is kinda like licorice; either you really like it or really hate it. She's an acquired taste, so repeated listenings might win you over. Despite the predominance of Fairport players, the song arrangements and playing are more reminescent of Steeleye's first album, HARK, THE VILLAGE WAIT. If you like that album, this should be a sure thing. The arrangements vary between pleasant and engaging. Thompson's guitar is represented well in the mix and will give the listener another opportunity to hear the master's earlier playing. I personally like the album, but understand it's detractors' criticisms. Triumphant classic or for completists only? Who cares! You'll have to decide. It's certainly worth the price to find out. Buy it!
