 Raven Records has done a nice service by releasing these two gems on one CD.  It makes perfect sense. Swarb released the records separately, but they were culled from the same sessions. And what sessions they were!  Half of the material here is performed by none other than the entire FULL HOUSE line-up!  All of the tunes are instrumentals, save for Swarb's pleasant vocals on Sandy Denny's It Suits Me Well. If you have all of the Fairport classics and are unsure about risking your bucks on the later material, this is well worth your time (and money)!  It's head and knees above the Fairport albums that had just preceded it (Bonny Bunch of Roses, Tippler's Tales and Farewell, Farewell).  An unsung Fairport treasure!  Get this CD and enjoy it with a six of Old Peculiar.  You will not be disapointed.  "For tis now, a holiday"!
