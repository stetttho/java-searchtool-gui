 I recommend this collection to any sunday school class that has fallen into a funk.  Produced and broadcasted on the BBC, each episode is both masterfully directed and acted by veterans from the British stage and film industry.  As the title would suggest, these stories fall into the creepy, if not macabe, worlds each of the charactors have created for themselves.  These are not tales of inspiration, but lessons of tragic failure and missed opportunities for salvation.  Pain, loneliness, shame, despair, bitterness, selfishness - all of the dark corners of the human experience are revealed in the rooms of the madhouse......rooms for which Christ is only a memory and no longer welcome.  The purpose of this collection is not to raise the fear of damnation.  Instead, it is a contempative exercise most suited for those who have already chosen the faith, yet humbly acknowledge their own shortcomings.  There is insight to be gained from every hell presented here.  Believe me.  A single viewing of each episode will not be enough.  Repeated viewing will inspire new discoveries each time.  Highly entertaining and provocative!
