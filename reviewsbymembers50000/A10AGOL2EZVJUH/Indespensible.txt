 A remarkable overview of an overlooked yet brilliant performer and writer!  Even if you own her entire catalog, this one should be added as well.  Yes, certainly for the unreleased material, but even more for the loving approach and design of the track sequencing.  The success of introducing Reynardine out of A Sailor's Life is not unintentional - Fledgl'ng knows what its doing.  Songs flow into each other with an ease and logic throughout.  The third disc, alone, will take your breath away.  A retrospective with perspective.  Buy this one for the soul - your's or someone else's!
