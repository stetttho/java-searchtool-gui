 If you already have this version of MacBeth on video, post it on [line].  Polanski's film must be seen in the original theatrical format that a DVD offers.  I remember seeing this film at the theatre as a child and being awed by it.  Later, in college, I convinced some friends to rent it.  Frankly, I wasn't impressed......even bored!  "So", I thought, "I guess these folks think I just wanted to expose them to out-of-focus gore and nude witches all night!"  However, some years later, I saw the film again on cable presented in letterbox form.  INCREDIBLE!!  I was forever a converted widescreen perfectionist after seeing it this way.  The dramatic cinematography feeds on Shakespeare's words and compels the viewer to absorb the entire experience.  The fullscreen version of this masterpiece, with its constant unfocused panning, is a crime.  Colorizing CASABLANCA would be insignificant by comparision to this atrocity.  The letterbox presentation provides a crisp, beautifully focused and awesome experience.  Plus, you'll see a lot more naked witches this way!
