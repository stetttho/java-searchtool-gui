 Let me get one thing straight, I LOVE Fairport Convention!  I love all  periods of their music.  I've been to Cropredy and I want to go again...and  again!  However, this album stinks.  Even if Thompson and Denny were on  this album, it would still stink!  With the exception of the notibly awful  Gottle of Gear, Babbacombe Lee is Fairport's worst effort.  How can it be  so bad if you're a fan?  Well, it's a concept album with not much  "concept".  The story-line could have fit nicely into one 4 verse  song, that's it.  Weak song's about nothing.  Pretentious, boring and  uninspired.  Okay, you're a fan and you want it all, right?  I recommend  getting the LP version.  At least it's got stickers and stuff - if you find  the right copy.
