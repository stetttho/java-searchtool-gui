 Will the Dead's music continue to be sought and traded a hundred years from now?  Perhaps, but regardless of that possibility, this book and its two proceeding volumes will continue to stand as unique testaments to the art of the band.  Currently marketed as resources for tape traders, these volumes will evolve into something much more vital as the members of the band and their fans fade into time.   Never has music been more thoroughly documented and described in the context of it composers.  Unprecidented!  Imagine a biography about John Coltrane that included descriptions of each performance of his career!   If future generations are curious about The Grateful Dead, they will be interested in the band's art, not the personal flaws or outside experiences of its individual members.  I believe these volumes will outlive all the many conventional biographies about the band.  They cover the things we should be allowed to know about The Grateful Dead.  The rest is "better left unsung."
