 This album has received a lot critical acclaim through the years. Many believe it to be Clark's most adventurous work. It certainly had the biggest production arrangements of anything since the Godsin Brothers album. There must had been a lot riding on it. Unfortunately, it was not a commercial success. Gene would make only one more solo album for a major label. How does it stack up to Gene's other work. I usually prefer Roadmaster, White Light or Fantastic Expedition. However, No Other has some beautiful material on it. Silver Phial is extremely powerful; one of those swirling anthems only Clark could pen. Life's Greatest Fool, Silver Raven, and Some Misunderstanding are classic. The more peculiar, but nevertheless excellent title track and Strength of Strings have arrangements unique to the rest of the Clark canon. If you have already ventured into Clark's catalogue, you really need this album (for Silver Phial alone!). If you're new to Clark and/or coming from the the Byrds' nest you might try something else. Eventually, you'll come around to this one. Put it this way: While its arguable as to whether this album reaches the level of his other masterworks, No Other still outshines ANYTHING produced by the other soloing original byrds. Gene, God Bless you, sir!
