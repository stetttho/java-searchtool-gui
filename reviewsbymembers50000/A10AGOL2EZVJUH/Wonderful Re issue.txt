 5 stars might (slightly) exagerate the overall quality of the original album, but this is unquestionably a 5 star release.    Folks with fond memories of the original release will be VERY pleased with the bounty of added material here!  The "unreleased album" is as strong as its predessor, while BBC cover versions of Gene Clark's Spanish Guitar, The Byrds' Time Between and Richard Thompson's Poor Ditching Boy are absolute jewels.  Also a treat are two acoustic versions of Even the Guiding Light; one live, the other studio - both unique in their perspective arrangements!  Most importantly, the added material gives us a much better appreciation for the band's range, with musicianship at its finest and jaw dropping harmonies!    The remastering is superb.
