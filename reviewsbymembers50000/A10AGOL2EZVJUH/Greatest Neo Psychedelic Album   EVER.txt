 One of my favorite records! Fans of the Byrds and early Pink Floyd will find a home here. Essential and required! EMERGENCY's appearance in '84 was mindblowing. An album of its type had not been seen since '67-'68. Given the trends of the time, it was totally unexpected, but ohhhh soooo welcomed!! The album stands on its own feet, relying on inspiration from its forbearers instead of nostalgic plagarism. The DNA might be obvious, but the mutation is completely unique - as it should be! Ghostly Floyd-inspired organ lines collide with Byrdsy Rickenbacker chimes and harmonies.  Along with True West, The Long Ryders, Green on Red and Dream Syndicate, I was hopeful that a second golden age of psychedelic-folk music was beginning to flourish. Alas, this was not to be. By '87 Rain Parade and most its compatriots would be gone.  But for a while there.........Oh well, at least we were left with this wonderful record!! A WORD OF URGENCY: This disk has had a history of going in and out of print quickly. If you are a fan of fine psychedelic music, buy it immediately! It deserves a rightful place along side PIPER AT THE GATES OF DAWN (Floyd), NOTORIOUS BYRD BROTHERS (Byrds), and ANTHEM OF THE SUN (Dead)! Enjoy!!!!
