 My home shop seems to be growing crowded with my newest edition (Delta Drum Sander), so I decided to order one of these mobile bases to help in moving tools around to allviate crowding.  I am very happy with the product.  It went together easily and seems quite sturdy.  It can effortlessly be configured to fit any home shop-sized tool.  My only complaint is one that has been echoed several times, the cam to raise and lower the base onto the fixed feet are thin aluminium and I fear they will not last as long as the rest of the unit.  However, regardless of that I plan to order two more.
