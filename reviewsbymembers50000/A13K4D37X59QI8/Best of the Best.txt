 I own every Seldom Scene album that is in current release.  I love all of them, but this one without any doubt is my favorite.  I particularly enjoy the original lineup with John Duffey and John Starling providing most of the lead vocals.  The live club recording is a refreshing departure from the standard studio recording.  The vocal and instrumental range on this album is awesome.  If you are interested in either Bluegrass or the Seldom Scene, buy this album.  You won't be disappointed.
