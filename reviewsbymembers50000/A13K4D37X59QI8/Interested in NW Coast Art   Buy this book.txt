 I picked this book up because I thought it looked interesting.  Prior to reading this book, I essentially knew nothing about NW coast indian art.  I read this in an afternoon and thought it was tremendous.  I have read it twice more since.  It won't make you an expert on NW coast indian art, but it is a great starting point explaining what to look for, details of the style, and gives lots of examples to illustrate his explanations.  It gives enough background and pictures of pieces to spark an interest and give the reader a great start on looking in detail at this beautiful stylistic Indian art form.
