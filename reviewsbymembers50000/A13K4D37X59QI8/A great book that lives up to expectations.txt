 In this book David Pye accurately and concisely differentiates between hand craftsmanship and modern machine done work.  He writes his philosophical yet practical, personal ideas on craftsmanship.  It is a great discussion for anyone interested in fine workmanship.  It attempts to answer questions (or at least provide an entry point into discussion) of why hand workmanship is important, why it appeals to us, and want makes it fundamentally different from machine build crafts.  It does not focus on any specific craft (thought Professor Pye is a woodworker himself), but is meaningful and accessable to anyone interested in crafts and hand workmanship.  This is a great book.
