 I recently built a new workbench, and figured it would be nice to attach a Vise to the end of the top.  So I choose this vise after looking through several vises.  It is one of the largest vises available (both jaw width and opening depth).  I am not sure it is any better for my uses than a smaller versions of a similar vise (Record 52ED and 52-1/2ED), but it is a great vise.  The quick release mechanism works great and makes it a much easier to use.  The vise is quite heavily built and will withstand plenty of abuse.  It is so handy, I don't know how I got along without it.  The only bad thing I can say, is that it was very poorly packaged when it arrived (it was placed in a cardboard box with some paper), but the vise is well enough built that it survived the journey just fine.
