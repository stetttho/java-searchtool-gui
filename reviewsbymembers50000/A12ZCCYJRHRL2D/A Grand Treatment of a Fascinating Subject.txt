 The turn of the sixteenth century witnessed the beginning of a revolution in warfare at sea, a revolution caused by the marriage of artillery to ships capable of true oceanic navigation. As a result, the countries of Europe spread their influence across the globe and made the world we live in today. But the galleons which carried black powder and European hegemony across the seas did not spring "full blown from the brow of Athena." They were the result of a combination of technical and historical factors which historian John F. Guilmartin examines in his latest work, Galleons and Galleys. In concise analytical chapters interspersed with case studies, Guilmartin traces the history of ships and gunpowder across 350 years from the mid-Atlantic to the South China Sea. Readers familiar with Dr. Guilmartin's earlier masterpiece, Gunpowder and Galleys, will recognize the format of alternating topical chapters and battle descriptions. As with the earlier work, many of the battles may be unfamiliar to lay readers like myself, but Guilmartin does an impressive job of putting the whole picture together.
