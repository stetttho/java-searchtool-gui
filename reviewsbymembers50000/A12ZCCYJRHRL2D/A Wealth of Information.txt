 The appearance of this book is deceptive. The full-color illustration on the oversized cover indicates a volume dedicated more to color plates than to substantive text. No impression could be further from the truth. THE AGE OF THE GALLEY is a well-organized series of chapters, each written by real experts in the field, such as trireme specialist John Coates and the brilliant John H. Pryor. Because each chapter has a different author, the quality isn't uniform; I found the chapter on medieval naval architecture to be a little obscure. Overall, however, this book is an excellent single-source collection for anyone interested in just how oared warships worked. Excellent line drawings and diagrams illustrate what the various vessels looked like and help explain the dynamics of rowing each type.  If you're looking for those color plates or stirring accounts of ancient naval battles, this book will be a disappointment. If you have a real interest in galley warfare and the capabilities of these vessels, THE AGE OF THE GALLEY is a must-have.
