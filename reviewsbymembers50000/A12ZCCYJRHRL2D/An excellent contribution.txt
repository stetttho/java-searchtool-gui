 N.A.M. Rodger's SAFEGUARD OF THE SEAS is an excellent work of analytical history, combining an elegant classical writing style with an erudite examination of technical issues.  In the tradition of John Keegan and John  F. Guilmartin, Rodger combines the written evidence of the chroniclers with  modern technological data (e.g. the performance of black powder artillery)  to create a convincingly real view of how naval forces evolved during the  period.  This book is an entertaining read for the novice and a worthy  reference for the expert.
