 The sixteenth century is a pivotal time in military history, when the increasing quantity of gunpowder weapons fundamentally changed the face of warfare. Mediterranean naval warfare was no less affected by this phenomenon than other spheres of conflict, but historians have had a difficult time analyzing the changes because they used an inappropriate model: the theories of Alfred Thayer Mahan. In this seminal work, John F. Guilmartin (associate professor of history at Ohio State University) looks at Mediterranean galley warfare from a fresh perspective, and goes a long way towards unravelling the complexities of -- as the title puts it -- "Changing Technology and Mediterranean Warfare at Sea in the Sixteenth Century." I have done a fair amount of research into this topic over the last few years, and I find GUNPOWDER AND GALLEYS to be an unfailing source of enlightenment. Indeed, it is difficult to find a book written in the last ten years touching on this subject that doesn't cite Dr. Guilmartin's work. Guilmartin has a wonderful writing style that enables him to make even arcane subjects like long-term economic rhythms interesting. He places each of his topical subjects in context by providing a detailed account of a military engagement which illustrates the point. I know of no other work of history that packs so much analysis into such a small and elegantly-written package. Famed Historian John Keegan has read GUNPOWDER AND GALLEYS (it was recommended to him by historian Christopher Duffy) and describes it as "among the two or three very best works of military history I have ever read."
