 Pavia 1525 is a typical Osprey Campaign book (for those familiar with the type).  The author does a good job of identifying and differentiating between the different people and forces involved in this somewhat confused  campaign.  I found Mr. Konstam's narrative and analysis quite good.  While  Pavia may have been the "Climax of the Italian Wars," don't look  for a great deal of tactical or historical sgnificance.  The book's  greatest drawback is sloppy editing.  The text is occasionally broken up,  or even repeated.  The captions often refer the reader to some detail of a  postage-stamp-sized picture, indicating that the editor was more concerned  with page layout than informative content.
