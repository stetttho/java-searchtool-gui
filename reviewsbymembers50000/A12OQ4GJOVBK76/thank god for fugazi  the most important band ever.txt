 I look at the face of music today and am saddened by mall-walking pretty-boys posing as punk and suburban no-talents acting as if they can pull off being 'hardcore'.  There is less and less experimentation and more and more similarities in bands. And worse enough, many of todays decent underground bands are selling there souls to corporate america, so they can earn money, and be happy. Thankfully Fugazi runs strong today as they did 12 years ago when this album was released. This album changed everything in the punk landscape. There didn't have to be crude humour, in your face antics, or fast dirty paces that were near inaudible. Slowed down and clear, Repeater saved punk and brought about (sigh) 'emo'. 'Turnover', 'Sieve Fisted Find', 'Merchandise', 'Repeater, 'Greed', all the songs are anthems that are brutally honest and refreshingly catchy (at times).  My wish is that a kid puts down the Sum 41 cd, walks out of the Best Buy, and goes to his local independent record store and buys a copy of Fugazi's Repeater.
