 I heard so much hersy and conjecture on the poor quality of this album. I of course was in disbelief because I can't dream of there ever being a bad Hot Water Music album, or even a mediocre one for that matter.  The music proves the way-sayers wrong because it is a decent release from the kings of post-punk. The title track is one of the most powerful tracks from Hot Water Music I have ever heard and the following, 'Jack of All Trades' and 'Paper Thin', are two tracks that are bound to be HWM concert standards. No this allbum is no 'Forever and Counting' or 'Fuel for the Hate Game', but it is a wonderful release and just goes to show that Hot Water Music are the best at what they do.
