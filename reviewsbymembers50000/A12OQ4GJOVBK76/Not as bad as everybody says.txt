 It seems that everybody (mostly Guttermouth fans) think this album is an attrocity created by one punks greatest bands.  But it really isn't the black sheep of an album that people make it out to be. I will admit, however, that Teri Yakimoto does have a fairly, well, BORING middle section, but the standout beggining tracks and ending make it worth getting.  The first few tracks including "Use Your Mind", "7T's", "Generous Portions", and of course the title track are amazing, even though they aren't really comedic like most Guttermouth songs. If its laughs you are looking for than head over to track #8 and give "God's Kingdom" a listen.  However, the real surprise of the album comes in the second to last song, that is actually a medley of songs, called "1,2,3,4", the end, or should I say final song, that for the sake of the review I'll just call "4" is an amazing hard hitting OI! punk rock song. Then stick around for "Under the Sea" which is a great sing-a-long.  Get this album if your preparing to see Guttermouth live.
