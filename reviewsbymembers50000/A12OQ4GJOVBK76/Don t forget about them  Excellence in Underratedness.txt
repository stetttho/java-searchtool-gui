 Pop rock is all over the place these days. John Mayer leads the pop-singer/songwriter category, pop punk (or emo) is big among little kids, and almost every rock band out there on the radio has pop leanings.  The Gin Blossoms, however, were good; really good. So good in fact that this album spawned four Top 40 hits in a year when pop rock was the last thing you wanted to be.  But the Gin Blossoms stood out because the vocals and lyrics went perfectly together, the jangly rhytm section managed to still hit hard, and best of all the wrote catcy tunes without the cliche.  "Hey Jealousy" "Allison Road" "Until I Fall Away" and "Found Out About You" are all great songs that I hope will not be forgotten underneath the Stone Temple Pilot and Pearl Jam hits of the time.  If anything this band, who actually still tours, needs some sort of tribute paid to them; they were doing what has become so copied and watered down and nobody ever recognized them as good.  This album should be legendary and anybody owning Pearl Jam's "Ten", The Smashing Pumpkins "Siamese Dream" or STP's "Core" should not be without New Miserable Experience.
