 I, along with anybody else who owns this album, cannot keep this out of my  CD player. Less Than Jake really know how to write music, "Hello  Rockview" is proof of this. There are not any bad songs on this album.  "5 State Drive" and "Nervous in the Alley" are my  personal fave's. But there is also "All My Friends are Metal  Heads", "Motto", "Last one Out of Liberty City".  Let me put it this way, if you buy "Hello Rockview", you will not  skip any songs on it.
