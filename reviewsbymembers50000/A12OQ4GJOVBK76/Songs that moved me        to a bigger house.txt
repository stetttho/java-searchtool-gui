 Forget all the pop-punk/emo/post-whatever that is getting oh so popular. You need some spastic keyboard induced punk, thats where Your Enemies Friends come in.  While barely comparable to anyone, Selby Tigers, xBxRx, The Icarus Line, and Fugazi does come to mind when listening to them, but that hardly says anything.  While all music has its roots, this music is completely original.  Amazing melodic singing, even more amazing ranting and yelling, whether it be done be a man or a women.  The keyboard makes this feel like a carnival ride, and the garage-rock feel gives it a timeless quality.  Right about now you shouldn't be reading this review, you should be at your local indepent record store buying this. Buddyhead, what can't they do?
