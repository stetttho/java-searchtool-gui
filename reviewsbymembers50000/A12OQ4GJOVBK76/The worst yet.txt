 What is funny about these types of bands is their ability to make you believe that they are actually good. Unfortunately a song like "Are You Gonna Be My Girl" is a complete abomination of rock n roll.  Its trite, talentless, and style over substance. For those of you buying into this cheese, chances are you shouldn't of been born in the first place. You don't have to listen to it just because its new. This band is basically ripping off bands that got their formula from ripping off bands from the 60's and 70's.  This is music made for the background of commercials and late night MTV2.  This is a product, not music.
