 Well then, you are a member of the targeted demographic.  The liberal media commends you for your gullable ways.  They are very pleased that, even though music like this has been done by Zepelin, Dylan, Beefheart, Zappa, and numerous other REAL innovators, you still are a tool to their ploys.  Do you not realize how insipid, dull, and uncreative this band is? Can you not see the extreme lack in diversity in their sound? You have bought into the hype.  Whats the difference between "Seven Nation Army" and "The Hardest Button to Button"? Very little, thats for sure. You enjoy this because it carries the image of 'underground-groundbreaking-innovative-avant garde" but the truth is it is only 'monotonous-trite-dull-talentless-and very very image-driven'. Thank you America, you've prooved that you're idiocy once again. You have bumper stickers reading 'Bush is an Idiot' and Elephant in your CD player.  You are tools, clones, under the impression that you are original.  Perhaps you should listen to Nirvana a little closer next time.They really had an original formula going.
