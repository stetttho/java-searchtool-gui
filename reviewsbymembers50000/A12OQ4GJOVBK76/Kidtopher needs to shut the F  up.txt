 Heres the review: this is a great hip hop album, Sage is the man. Heres the diss: Kidtopher is an amazon user who made a list called 'Emo-rap and anti-hiphop".  This kid needs to shut up.  Don't ever refer to this as "emo" rap, thats idiotic. Go listen to your Taking Back Sunday album and talk about emo.  What the heck are you? A loser rock journalist; because it is those fools who invent lame terms like "emo rap".  Man, I really hate that guy; freakin' categorist.
