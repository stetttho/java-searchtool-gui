 Let me just start by saying that I just bought this book no more than an hour ago. As soon as I got home I picked it up and didn't put it down forr the next hour. As a huge "Dazed and Confused" fan, I was  extremely happy when I saw that there was a book to go along with the  movie. But the book is not just about the movie. It starts out with a great  introduction by the director and writer Richard Linklater. In this intro he  explains the time period, the pros and cons of the 70's, and where the idea  for the movie came from. Also in the book are synopsis's of all the basic  charactar (the best is Clints, the guy who beats up the nerd). This book  doesn't just follow along with the movie, it is an explanation of the  1970's, I enjoyed it considering I wasn't alive yet. So if you are a  hardcore fan of "Dazed and Confused" or a collector of 70's  memorobilia, than you need this book.
