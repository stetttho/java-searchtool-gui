 If you ask anyone about "Lookinglasself" by Snapcase, chances are you will get 1 of 2 possible answers. Either someone will say, "It was a dissapointment, not up to Snapcases later standards" or they will say, "This is the real Snapcase, what they are all about". Truthfully, I say a little of each answer can be used. While it is not as fast and fueled as later albums, "Lookinglasself" does have songs with great lyrics, and don't for a second think that the songs  arent heavy or hardcore. The quality is bad, but most reviews exaggerate, because the only real downpoint is that somtimes you can't hear the vocalist voice. But you must remember somthing about "Lookinglasself", it was Snapcase first. Within the period of 7 years that Snapcase has been around, they are going to change. All bands have to find their sound and come into their own, and Snapcase was still young when this came out. But the first tracks, "Filter" and "Deceived" really rock.
