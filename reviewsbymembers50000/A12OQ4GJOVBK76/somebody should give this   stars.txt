 ...Cave-In is better than any band that came before it and in the future there will probably never be a band as good as them either. These are two incredible Cave-In songs that are well worth the price. Buy it on vinyl if you can find it. Regardless of what style these guys play, they always play it better than any band before or after them. Cave-In, best band in the universe, I think so.
