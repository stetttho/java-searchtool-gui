 'Water and Solutions' is a wonderful album for jaded suburban teens wondering why it is that they are so damn sad. Jonah's voice sounds as though he is an angel who's girlfriend recently dumped him as it ranges from hints of desperation, to rage, to a kind of lighthearted happyness that makes the listener go to the verge of tears. The songs sound as though you are sitting in a white room trying to put your head under a pillow so that nobody will be able to tell  you are crying. "Bury White" and "Mother Mary" are first listen standouts as they are catchy as hell and maintain a youthful punkish disorder to them. "Really Here" and "Water and Solutions" are downer tracks that have the ability to put a smile on your face. "I Like It" and "You Wear It So Well" are probably the best tracks on the album, but all the songs connect in a way as though they were all part of an emotional epic. Emo, alternative, post-hardcore, no words used by the underground elite should be used to describe this album of pure astonishment. Buy this and cry, buy this and smile, buy this and rock.
