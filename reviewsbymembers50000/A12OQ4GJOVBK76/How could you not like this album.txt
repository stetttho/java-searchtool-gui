 Countdown to Extinction is without a doubt the best Megadeth album Ive ever heard. After the very overrated "Rust in Peace" it was the perfect way to renew themselves without having to sell out. There is no  specefic best song, my favorite is "Architecture of Agression"  but they are  all good songs when you listen to the album. With  "Risk", Megadeths latest album, they made a bad attempt to go  commercial. Megadeth needs to listen to "Countdown to Extinction"  and go back to the days when they were heavy.  In other words, any true  metal fan needs this album.
