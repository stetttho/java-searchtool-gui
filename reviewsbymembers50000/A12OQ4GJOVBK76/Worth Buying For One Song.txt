 I'll admit that STATE OF EUPHORIA is no where near as good as albums such as PERSISTANCE OF TIME and STOMP 442, but one song makes it a damn good album. The name of the song is "Antisocial" .  "Antisocial" is a summary of what Anthrax songs should be. From  the heavy Scott Ian riffs to the melodic chant of Joey Belladonnas voice  "Antisocial" is a diamond in the ruff when it comes to STATE OF  EUPHORIA. But I wouldnt recomend buying the album unless you are a hardcore  Anthrax fan.
