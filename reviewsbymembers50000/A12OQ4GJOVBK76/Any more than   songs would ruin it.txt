 What does "In a Beautiful Place Out in the Country" sound like?  Well, thats just it, it sounds like a beautiful place out in the counrty.  The beauty is there, definitely, and the pastoral atmosperic elements are represented.  Listening the this album is on par with looking at pictures of open spaces.  This album sounds mysty, it sounds windy, it sounds like the weather.  Kid For Today reminds me of wind chimes blwoing in the wind. Zoetrope is the most 'beat' oriented song to be found, it has a fairly aggressive (but quiet) backbeat to it.  I wouldn't complain at all about this being too short, I think BOC set out to create a certain sound to correllate with a certain emotion.  They really want to invoke something in the listener. And they succeed.
