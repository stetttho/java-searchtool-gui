 Spineshank has created somthing quite awesome with "The Height of Calousness". They have successfully combined hardcore with industrial. This album grooves to another level, but it still has the power of hardcore hitting you in the face with a skillet. The way SpineShank uses electronics is so perfect it is as if you are listening to science. The production on this album is outstanding, as every instrument, machine, and vocal comes out perfectly. "Synthetic" was there not-so-hit single, and I don't see why, it is an amazing song, and it follows a different formula than most NU-metal songs of today. Also check out "Malnutrition" and "New Disease", two lifechanging songs. "The Height of Calousness" dismisses everything know about industrial and is a farewell to industrial bands like Nine Inch Nails and Ministry. SpineShank are going to lead a revolution in music, pick this CD up now, so you can say you were there from the start.
