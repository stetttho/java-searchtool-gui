 It seems there are a lot of guys out there who are dogging this album. Well, that is because all they have heard is "Brackish" and possibly "Charolette". They can't stand the fact that girls can do what Korn can do, and even better. Also, why would you hate Morgan Landers vocals, she sounds like the female Phil Anselmo (of Pantera).  Further more, the tracks on "SPIT" are far deeper and inciteful than half the crap getting air play right now.  Its hard to believe that Kittie are all under 20. The girls also give a kick a$$ live show, they can thrash with the best of 'em.  Open up your mind and give "SPIT" a try.  This is the one album that all metal fans can love, fans of the NU-metal, thrash, death, black, and aggro will all fall in love with Kittie after buying this album. Check out "Do You Think I'm a Whore", "Charolette", and "Get Off".  One thing is for sure about Kittie, these girls have some balls.
