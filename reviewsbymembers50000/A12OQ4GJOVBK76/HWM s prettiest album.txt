 Hot Water Music has made a name for themselves by perfectly concocting the rough edges of hardcore punk with unbelievable original melodies that are as beautiful as they are crafted. No band will ever compare the their patented sound. 'Forever and Counting' was the first full length LP released by the band, and is without a doubt their smoothest. 'Just Don't Say You Lost It' and 'Minno' have a higher pedigree of sentimentality then most of the group's latter songs, yet songs like 'Manual' and 'Three Summers Strong' contain the Fugazi-ish hardedged melodies. Chuck's bass still flows and Jason's voice still sounds like a drunken madman, and it is proof that though not excactly the same, Hot Water Music have utilized their elements correctly through the course of their recording career.
