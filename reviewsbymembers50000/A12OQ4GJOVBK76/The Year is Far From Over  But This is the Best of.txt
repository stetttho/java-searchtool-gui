 It seems unfair that amazon.com censors these reviews, because when I talk about "Sing Loud, Sing Proud" by the Dropkick Murphy's all that I can say (or shout rather) is "HOLY F*****G S***". Because thats just about the only way to describe the diversity, energy, and to make up a word awesomeness of the album.  Its starts out with "For Boston" which is a perfect opener, seeing as it is fairly simple yet is still able to explain what all the Murph's are all about.  "Which Side Are You On" is a great song that tells a captivating story, which is also the case with "Good Rats", and "Heroes of Our Past".  The true Irish quality can be seen in songs like "The Rocky Road to Dublin" and "The Spicy McHaggis Jig".  But these guys are more than just drunk Irish punk rockers (and one Scottish).  They also show a serious and reflective side which can be heard on tracks like "Forever" and "The Fortunes of War".  But of course when you get right down to it, no song on the album is nearly as good as the straight forward hardcore punk rock song "The Gauntlet"-- STAND UP AND FIGHT!!!!!!!!
