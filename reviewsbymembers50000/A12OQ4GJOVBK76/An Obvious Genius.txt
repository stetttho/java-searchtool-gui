 Violent J, how do I respect thee? Let me count the ways.  I guess it was sometime after hearing Bob Dylans 'Blonde on Blonde' with a friend that he turned me onto a fellow by the name of Violent J.  I was intrigued by Violent J's take on the dustbowl/depression era United States when he released Wizad of the Hood; an obvious ode to the current state of inner city neighborhoods.  Violent J is outspoken and reveals much about himself and his perceived enviroment on this release.  "Shiney Diamonds" for instance is a track about the out of reach pleasures that humans are forced to believe they can achieve. "Let it Rain" is a great tune concerning the weather and it's unpredictability.  The standout song, without a doubt, is "Homies 2 Smoke With", this song is a somber allusion to the fact that as people, we need not concern ourselves with the materialistic aspects of life.  In reality, all we truly need are some homies to smoke with.  Violent J transcends the clown-rapper genre here and enters a realm which has not yet been infiltrated by rapping clowns.  This album is truly destined to be a cornerstone of modern clown-hip hop as well as a classic for years to come.  Truly a great outing as well as a realistic, gritty, down to earth sign of the times. Worthy of 10 stars.
