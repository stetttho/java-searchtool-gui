 When a fan listens to Slipknots debut for the first time, they will know that the best album of the new millenium was released in the old millenium. Slipknot, both the album and the band, is a masterpeice among all new music, going far beyond anything considered metal today. #8's (Corey) vocal are bordering that of the hardcore bands such as Earth Crisis. And that is what makes Slipknot so great-- the diversity. When you combine the growling vocals of #8, along with the samples, the turntables, the rip-roaring guitar work, and the most incredible percussion work since Rush, you get somthing that cannot be ignored. Skeptist must look beyond the fact that these guys wear masks, because when you hear them, you completely forget the masks, and are sucked into the vortex of extreme heaviness. Slipknot are not just some Gwar-like shock-rockers only wanting to be seen, they have somthing to offer in their music, and then some. I don't know if it has been said yet, but it will be, Slipknot is the new Metallica; for they have created somthing original out of a genre that gets so many recycled bands (Deftones, Factory 81, P.O.D). Check out songs like "(Sic)", "Eyeless", "Wait and Bleed",....OH HELL, just listen to the album and never ever skip a track. And don't expect Slipknot to fade away fast, they will be around for a long, long time.
