 Every Austin 'scenester' by now has either bought or downloaded the latest outing from hard emo rockers Recover. The EP entitled "Ceci N'est Pas Recover" (French for 'This is Not Recover, pretty lame in my book) is on Fiddler Records and can only be described as 'extremely alright'. Gone are the hardcorish screams of Robert Mann that kicked off the bands full length and are replaced with what sounds to be screaming as loudly as possible without actually screaming. The record is much darker than 'Rodeo & Picasso' and the songwriting is mildly improved. 'Bad Timing', the first track is a damn good live song, but fails to cut it just as well in the studio. 'Push Push' is by far the worst Recover song I've ever heard, but is followed up by 'Sleeper', which is INSTRUMENTALLY, Recovers finest song, with the possible exception of 'Sympathetic Sickness'. The last song "Inhale Water" is pretty good, but suffers from what I call the 'trying to hard to look artsy' disorder. All in all, this record isn't all that bad, but its isn't all that good either.
