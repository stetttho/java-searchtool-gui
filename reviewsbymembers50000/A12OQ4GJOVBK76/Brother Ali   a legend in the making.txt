 A white Nas...actually, maybe a little better, (in my opinion) this album is so reminiscent of the 'street-poet' vibe of ILLmatic it's unreal.  More than any hip-hop record I've been hip to in the last decade, Ali's "Shadows on the Sun" reveals an MC opening up and showing the listeners a past, pain, and a realistic perspective of life.  Brother Ali is a dynamic, top notch rhymer, at times reminding me of Nas other times Eminem and other times Sage Francis.  This album is wonderful because each and every stanza of his songs are connected, they are more than just verbal spouts that, while making good rhymes, have no real validity.  Ali is a story teller.  Many MC's attempt storytelling, and many more attempt original and effective rhyming.  Brother Ali has hit both directly on the head.  Listening to this album is like listening to urban Shakespeare.  Brother Ali is by far the best MC out there, and as far as I can tell should be raking in twice as much as Atmosphere is in no time. Now if only he would collaborate with El-P...
