 I thought no album ever could come close to being as good as  "...  And Out Come The Wolves", with the possible execption of Punk In  Drublic by NOFX. Leave it to Rancid to make the one album that is as  original and fantastic as "And Out Come The Wolves". Rancid 2000  is that darn good. Not only that, it is able to do it without sounding like  anything Rancid has ever done. I guess Tim Armstrong finally decided to  stray from his Operation Ivy roots. Rancid 2000 is more of a hardcore punk  album than a ska-punk album. Choice tracks are "Radio Havana",  "Rattlesnake", "Let Me Go", and the very expiremental  "Rwanda". This album should be in any punk fans collection.
