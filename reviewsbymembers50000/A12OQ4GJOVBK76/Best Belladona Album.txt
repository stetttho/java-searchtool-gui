 I usually like the John Bush Anthrax songs and albums better than The Joey Belladona stuff. But Persistance of Time can compete with any John Bush album. Songs like "Blood" and "Keep it in the Family"  really kick. But I would have to say that "Got the Time" is  without a shadow of a doubt the best Anthrax song past or presence, I even  like it better than any of the John Bush songs. And if you dont get POT  than get stomp 442;.
