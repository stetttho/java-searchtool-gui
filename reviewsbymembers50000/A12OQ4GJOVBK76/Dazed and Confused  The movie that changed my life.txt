 Its not just my personal fovorite, it becomes a fovorite of anyone who has ever seen it. After you see "Dazed and Confused" you begin to act like the characters and quote it without even realizing it. Its been in my  VCR at least 200 times and sometimes I even go to sleep listening to it.  The reason "Dazed and Confused" is so freakin' good is because  there is a character that everyone can relate to       -Theres the nice  guy- Floyde          -There is the little guy- Mitch   -Theres the  Jackass- Obannion      -And there are 2 main stoners- Pickford and  Slater    Not only that there are a whole bunch of awesome classic rock  songs and it has a kickass soundtrack. There a lot of hot girls and  beatiful cars too. "Dazed and Confused" also helped launch the  careers of many of todays top celebrities such as Mathew  McCaugnehey,Joey-Lauren Adams, and Ben Affleck.    Lets face it this movie  just flat out rules. "Dazed and Confused" is a must have.
