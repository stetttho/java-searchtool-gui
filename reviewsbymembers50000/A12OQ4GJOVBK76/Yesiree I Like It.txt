 For me when it came to ska, i was all about the PUNKIEST of punk/ska, yes I'm talking about bands like Less Than Jake, Goldfinger, and Operation Ivy. So when I picked up Five Iron Frenzies "Newest Album Ever", I was expecting somthing along those lines. However,  it isn't quite what you would expect from a punk/ska band. The horn section's presence is far stronger than most bands in the genre, and Reese Ropers vocals exude a Reel Big Fish like sound, but, believe me, FIF is far better than Reel Big Fish.  The first track "Handbook for the Sellout", is probably second best on the album, and it is a good example of Ropers vocal talents. "Has Anyone Seen Micah" is a song that you can hate at one part, and love at the next, and "Superpowers" chorus could make the song pass for a Weezer song with a brass section. The best song on the album is "Most Likely To Succeed" which is a catchy and upbeat tune, similar to a Less Than Jake song, but only with the FIF touch. Don't be thrown back by the fact that these guys are christians, because good tunes are good tunes.
