 After being dissapointed by a Meat Puppets concert, I went and listened to Meat Puppets "Monsters" to make sure that I still enjoyed them. "Monsters" is a mix of psycadellia and punk. The first song "Attacked by Monsters" is by far the best, with a great chorus, and great guitar work. The songs "Light" an "In Love" sound alike, but they are still great. Also is a very Alice In Chains like song "The Void" and the 70's guitar driven instrumental "Flight of the Weasel". Over all, although I think the band new line-up and music is really bad, "Monsters" is still good.
