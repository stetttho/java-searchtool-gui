 It's pretty easy to think that all modern cinema, well, .... When the top drawers are either little-to-no-story special effects-a-thons or toilet humoured shock comedies, it seems that either the audience or the directors are just getting less and less intellectual. Then I saw a short montage of scenes for Sophia Coppola's The Virgin Suicides, and I knew that this was one film that had to be more than "Just Okay".  The Virgin Suicides is more than just a look at five teen girls growing up in 1976, but rather a glimps of the tyranny and corruption that lie in middle-American suburbia. Kirsten Dunst (Lux) and Hannah Hall (Cecelia) give some of the finest acting job's I have seen in a very long time, this and the still have yet to enter their 20's (pretty big insult to the so-called "actors" in Hollywood today). Also James Woods and Kathleen Turner's portrayal's as the Lisbon parents are good reminders that just because an actor or actress isn't with the "Hollywood Elite" anymore, doesn't mean that they still outshine all other younger and "hipper" actors and actress's of today. Everything about the film is gripping, from the story of Cecelia, to smaller scenes (case and point when Mrs. Lisbon makes Lux burn all her rock records, pretty intense to a music lover like me). The best aspect of the film is definitely the score. Air does a fine job of creating the somber and surrealistic mood of the movie. Not since Dazed and Confused have I watched a film so many times back to back, I strongly reccomend this film to anybody that is bored and fed up with the lackluster films that Hollywood is pumping out today.
