 What is this?  Those will probably be the first words out of the mouth of a person who has just listened to Clutch for the first time. Clutch sounds like a garage band from Mars in this the self titled album. The first tracks "Big News 1" - "Big News II"  are like a rock 'n' roll slap in the face with there distorted guitars, slow to fast pace, and the grunting vocals. The highlight of the album is the lyrics. One must wonder what lines like "I have the body of Marlon Brando" means coming from a song called "I have the body of John Wilkes Boothe". Space and science fiction seem to be constant themes in the album. Songs like "Animal Farm" and "Droid" don't make a lot of sense, but the lyrics will keep you thinking, and have your finger on the repeat button. Also check out "Texas Book of the Dead" and "Escape from the Prison Planet". Don't expect to like "Clutch" right away, give it about 2 weeks to grow on youl.
