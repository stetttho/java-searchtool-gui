 I like Lagwagon's "Double Pladinum" alot, but it seems that they are incorporating more and more alternative pop-punk into every album.  Even if that serves true, i'll still like it, the reason I gave the album 4 stars instead of 5 is because HOSS is simply a far better album than this, and I couldn't help but make that comparison.  "Alien 8", "Making Friends", and "Unfurnished" are the first three songs, and each are so different from each other; "Alien 8" goes from slow and mellow to fast and raw, "Making Friends" has a trippy mid tempo sound, and "Unfurnished", which is the best song on the CD, is the most punk song on the album. Nontheless all the songs are great, especially "Bad Scene" and "To All My Friends".
