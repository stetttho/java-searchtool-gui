 Demons, explosions, and violence. Thats what makes this movie so damn awesome. Compared to its predaseccors the "Evil Dead" movies "Army of Darkness" looks like an oscar calliber movie. With great  monsters and awesome fights, this movie is like watching heavy metal music.  This movie is hardcore and chalk full of monsters and demons. Anyone who  says this movie is corny is just scared of the fact that they know how damn  good this movie is.
