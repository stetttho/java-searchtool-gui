 Let me just start by saying that I own every Vandals album exept  "Fear of A Punk Planet". And of all the albums. "Live Fast,  Diahreah" is defineitely the best. Not only that, but "And now we  Dance" is probably the best Vandals song ever too. Other great songs  are "Let the Bad Times Roll" and the title track. The follow up  to this album, "The Quickening" is probably one of the most  disapointing albums Ive ever bought. If your gonna listen to punk, do  yourself a favor and buy this album.
