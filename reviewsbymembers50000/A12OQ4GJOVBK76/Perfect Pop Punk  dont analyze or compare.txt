 Look at all these reviewers, analyzing and comparing Sum 41. First of all its punk, maybe pop-punk, but punk nontheless, do you think the Ramones were trying to write music in need of analysis, do you think Black Flag was trying to were trying to make music you need to break down to get the gist of? NO. Punk, pop punk especially, is simple music, and in the case of Sum 41's "Half Hour of Power", it is simple, catchy, with some incredible hooks. It opens sounding like an old Brittish Iron Maidenish metal song, and the good times roll on from there. Songs like "Makes No Difference", "Summer", and "What I Believe" are radio material, but will never get the play because of the huge musical barrier that MTV has set up. Another great thing about the album is its seperation of humour from the songs. All funny songs are seperated, in there own place, and there are only like two satyrical songs to begin with, the opener, and "Its What We're all About", a Beastie Boys/ Kottonmouth Kings immatation that is just marvelous. Sum 41 is poppy, but they dont need to put on a big immature act like other bands, bands that rhyme with Dink Fun-Maity-Chew, those guys ..., don't even make that comparison.
