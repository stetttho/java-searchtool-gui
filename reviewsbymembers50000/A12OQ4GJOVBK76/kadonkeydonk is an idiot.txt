 my name is kadonkeydonk, i like lame indie-rock that is style over substance because it makes me look like I am above people. To make myself look hip and quirky I listen to hip hop, but only pseudo-intellectual old school and modern hip hop put on by white folk.  ANYBODY WHO SAYS THEY LIKE HIP HOP AND THEN BASH EMINEM SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED TO LISTEN TO HIP HOP. Kadonkeydonk, why don't you listen to dearhoof and realize that this isn't 'noise-pop' it's crap performed by untalented communistist prostitues. It sounds like an entire album of instruments being tuned. You are an idiot kadonkeydonk, and more of a clone than the people you accuse of being clones.
