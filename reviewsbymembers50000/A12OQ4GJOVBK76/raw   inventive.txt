 Think of this album as a genius engineer building a masterfully powerful machine...out of an erector set.  'Selling Live Water' has powerful, very raw and clangy, beats.  Sole's voice is that of anger, frustration, and insight, but overall you can really here a guy having fun.  He creates incredible lines without using any proper rhyme scheme; his formula is to be dead on with the beats, and at that he is incredible. While Sole's rapping skills cannot be argued with, I must say that the beats are the star of the album.  Of all the hip-hop albums to emerge lately this one is 2nd only to El-P's 'Fantastic Damage'.  Exceptional songs include 'Da Baddest Poet', 'Salt on Everything', and 'Plutonium'.
