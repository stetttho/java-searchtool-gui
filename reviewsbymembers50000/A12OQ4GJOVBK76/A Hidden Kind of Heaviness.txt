 It seems today that heaviness in music is measured by the speed of the riff, bangage of the drums, and roar of the singer.  We have forgotten that heaviness is brought upon in other ways than just a crush. "The Moon Is Down" by Further Seems Forever captures an intense emotional heaviness that comes down upon the listener, immediately taking them away.  With intelligent lyrics and technical instrumentation, this album is a work of art that will move even the most jaded of "EMO" kids.  While all songs range inside the slow to mid-tempo range (except Pictures of Shorelines)it still has the ability to make you nod your head, move your feet, and sing along. My only wish is that this band would play Madison Prep live, it is a song the likes of which no member of the independent rock church has ever heard. God Bless Further Seems forever.
