 Snapcase's Design For Automotion was the first hardcore/victory album I ever bought, and I bought it the day after I saw Snapcase live. A fan of  thrash metal- Anthrax, Pantera, and of new punk- NOFX and Rancid, I decided  to look for a band that meets at a halfway point of the two genres. What I  ended up with was Snapcase. DFA is an album that expresses rage towards  everything corrupt about the world today. Rage Against the Machine shouldnt  even be aloud to make music after hearing DFA. Choice songs are  "Connector" and "Typecast Communicator", but every song  is fresh and good. Fans of punk and metal should all buy Snapcase, Design  for Automotion.
