 "Black Sails in the Sunset" is one reason why AFI is fastly  becoming my favorite band. This album takes AFI deeper into there  transition from straight forward punk to dark, emo-punk. "Weathered  Tomb" and "The Last Kiss" are amazing songs that you will  find yourself singing along to. I like this CD because they dont have to  sing about politics and girls, like so many other punk bands, they are who  they are. DAVEY HAVOK RULES THE MIC!!!
