 but, i can't help it when i keep on purchasing these quality items, such as The Alkaline Trio, by. . . . The Alkaline Trio. I hear words like emo and pop/punk get thrown around when describing this band, whatever genre they may be in, how about this as a 1 word summary of the band, smart. besides having great song titles, they also have incredibly intriuging lyrics. Its lines like , "like a new born baby cracking under work related stress," that just blow my f'n MIND! The best tracks are "Bleeder", "For Your Lungs Only", "Sun Dials", and , well it would just be foolish of me to name every track on the song. just a quick note before ending this review, this guy has a cool voice.
