 The five years that would come in between "The Black Album" and "Load" would be a major turning point in Metallicas career. Metallica would slow down, tone down, and go down. "The Black  Album" is Metallicas last great album. Though not as thrashy as  "Ride the Lightning" and not as powerful as "And Justice for  All" it was still hardcore metal. "Enter Sandman" is the  powerful beginning on the CD and "Sad But True" is an equally  powerful second track. Jewels on this album also include the eerie  "Unforgiven" and the hyper "Wherever I May Roam". But  for my money nothing is better than the powerhouse "Of Wolf and  Man". "Of Wolf and Man" features what might be James  Hetfields best lyrics and its where Jason Newsted gets his first chance to  shine. To sum it all up "The Black Album" is a proper good-bye  from Metallica the metal band- because what would emerge would be Metallica  the POPmetal band.
