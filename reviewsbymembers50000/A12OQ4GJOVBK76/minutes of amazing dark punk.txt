 This was the first AFI CD I ever got, of all the AFI ive heard, this is  the darkest and moodiest. Davey Havoks vocals are amazing and the opener  "Fall Children" will really catch your ear. Also includes and  amazing Misfits cover of "Halloween". If your familiar with old  AFI, dont worry, it is darker, but it is still AFI.
