 I'm 18 years old, but chances are I'm smarter than 90% of the people, regardless of age, reading this.  Truth be told is that most of the TRUTH that remains in this world is discovered in high school (which I'm out of, in college, by the way).  Basically the title of this book says it all.  If I could right a book about bleeding-heart liberals it would be called "Liberals: Only Doin' It Cause It's COOL for the last 30 Years".  Liberalism = Naivity
