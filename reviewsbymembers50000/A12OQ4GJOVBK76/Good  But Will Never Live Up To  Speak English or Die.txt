 I got into S.O.D at the exact time "Bigger Than TheDevil" came out. When i got "Speak English or Die" Icouldnt stop listening to it. Its funny fast and angry. Not only that, "Speak English or Die" talks about war and American military activity. All "Bigger Than The Devil" does is talk about Satan and Murder. Another thing I dont understand is the song "Skool Bus", I cant tell if they are kidding or not when they talk about killing minoritys. Putting all the bad stuff aside,this album does still have catchy tunes and its a little heavier than "Speak English or Die" (I didn't even think that was possible) All in all its not a bad album at all, its just that when "Bigger than The Devil" comes after a 5 star masterpiece like "Speak English or Die" it just doen't compare. But its still O.K.
