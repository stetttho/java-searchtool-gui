 Look, regardless of the negative sterotypes they may undergo, I like the so-called 'jam bands'.  I love the Dead, and if you don't you're a fool.  I'm a fan of String Cheese, Panic, and to a lesser extent Phish.  They are all wonderful and they always surpass what is expected from them. Now, there are alot of people out there who like to flatter themselves. Idiots in a dorm who find out it's 'trendy' to start these kinds of bands respectively do so. Enter OAR. OAR is a terrible band.  Very trite lyrics and though I can't say they are untalented, it isn't really true talent if all you do is rip off other artist.  Basically this is what happens when people who never experimented with the right drugs try to start bands.  OAR jams about as well as Phil Lesh with a broken wrist and is about as original as an Elvis impersonater.   I can imagine walking up to these guys and talking about how I love listening to BOB.  To which they would reply , "Dude! BOB Marley rules!"  To which I would replay, "You idiot, I was talking about Bob Dylan." Take a note you trust-fund hippies!!!
