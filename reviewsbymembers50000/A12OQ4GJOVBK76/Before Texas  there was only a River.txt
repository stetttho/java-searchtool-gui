 I don't actually own this EP, but I do own the original Riverfenix recording, before they had to change their name.  Besides that I do happen to know that "G.B.O.H" and "Minimum Wage" are probably the two best POP-punk songs I have ever heard; and "Skinhead Jessie" is a great ska song too.  Perfect Pop Punk.
