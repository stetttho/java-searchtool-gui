 Okay all you punkers and revivalist out there, don't be scared of the fact that this album is on a major label, because if it wasn't for that, you probably would never get to hear these young and extremily talented Aussies.  The Living End is Australias answer to Social Distortion, and as far as capturing the essence of classic rock-a-billy, well, they hit it right on the nose.  "Prisoner of Society" is the kind of song that you keep on repeat and sing when your pissed off; "Falling Down, Growing Up" is about the poppiest song on the album, and it is still audible, you'll be singing this one outloud.  These guys put instrumentation first, and add a singer whose voice just SCREAMS Australia.  Take Davey Havok from AFI and add an accent, and make Social Distortion the back up band, and that should give you a good idea of what The Living End sounds like.  These guys are the future of music, and the best thing to come out of Australia since AC/DC. Rock On!!!!!
