 Before "Scream", before "Nightmare on Elm Street", even before "Friday the 13th" there was "Halloween". "Halloween" is the original slice and dice movie; and Mike Myers  is the original silent crazed killer. Mike is the original White Masked  madman. Several films have tried to copy "Halloween" but none  ever work because we have all seen what happens before. Also there have  been several sequels to "Halloween" and with the acception of  "Halloween 6" and "H20", none are very good. But  "Halloween" is a great horror classic.
