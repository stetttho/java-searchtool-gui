 Imagine this scenario-- you go to the punk show, Lars Frederiksen plays and so do the Dropkick Murphys, what band could possibly be worthy of playing in between the two punk rock superbands-- the very underrated and supertalented Swingin' Utters.  Swingin' Utters capture the essense of the street and put it into an album with they're anti-pop and highly melodic sound.  This is good ol' punk with no need for categorization.  Amazingly these old street punkers are able to pull off what few in the genre have- they pull of experimentation within punk rock, just check out "Watching the Wayfarers", a song that can be described as Mariachi Punk, and one listen gives you the feel that you are standing on the streets of big city California.  Also on the album are punk rock anthems like "Pills and Smoke", "Taken Train", "Eddies Teddy" (for you Rocky Horror fans), "The Green Glass" which is sung by guitarist Spike Slawson (Me First and the Gimme Gimmes), and well, just about every track is amazing.  The best aspect of this quality peice of work is that it takes no time at all to grow on you, one listen and you will instantly be singing along with the choruses of every song.
