 Im not sure what, but I have never liked MxPx. Maybe it was because of their horrible live show, but MxPx always got on my nerves. . . with one exception, "Slowly Going the Way Of the Buffalo" . From "Under Lock & Key" to "Theme Fiasco", this is the kind of album that will make you smile, with songs about stuff that isnt really that important. Like throwing throwing a party, in the appropriatley titled "Pary, My Place, Be There"; there is also a very sensative side to MxPx, which can be heard in "Cold and All Alone". Basically, SGTWOTB is pop punk at its best, with songs about life and growing up, I just wish I liked there other stuff this much.
