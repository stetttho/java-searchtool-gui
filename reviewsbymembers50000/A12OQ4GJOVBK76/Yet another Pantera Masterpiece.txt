 I reluctantly bought "The Great Southern Trendkill" with a 20 dollar bill I found on the ground at the mall. Being a fan of bands like Megadeth and Anthrax, I figured Pantera was right up my ally. Afther  listening to GSTK once I knew that it was a masterpiece. That is exactly  what happened to me with "Far Beyond Driven". From the opening  with "Strength Beyond Strength" and several other kickass songs  "Far Beyond Driven" certainly does "drive" with amazing  force. The highlight of the album is the agressive and violent "5  Minutes Alone" followed by "25 Years". Although usually  Dimebag Darrel does an incredible job, I think that he is upstaged by his  brother and drummer Vinnie Paul, who plays as if he were firing a machine  gun during a war. So if you want an agressive fist pounding CD, than buy  "Far Beyond Driven".
