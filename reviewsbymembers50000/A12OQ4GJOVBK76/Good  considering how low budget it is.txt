 Marking director Sam Raimis first film, "Evil Dead" is the must have film for any gore and horror film. Even with the extremely low budget this movie was made  on, it still doesn't sease to amaze you with is  horrorific effects and good acting. Ash who is played by Bruce Campell is  the hero of "Evil Dead", and his acting is so good that you  forget how low budget it is. I did however make the mistake of seeing  "Army of Darkness" before I saw this movie. "Army of  Darkness" is by far a better movie than "Evil Dead", but  "Evil Dead" is still the originator. So get this movie, and make  sure you get the collectors edition.
