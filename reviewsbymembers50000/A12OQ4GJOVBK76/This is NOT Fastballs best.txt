 It seems so many reviewers think "The Harsh Light of Day" is so much better than all their other albums. Its an excellent collection of vintage sounding pop songs, but it doesnt come near as good as their Sophmore release "All the Pain Money can Buy". Whereas on ATPMCB every song was amazing and melodic, I somtimes find myself skipping tracks on the new release. On the upside their are the good songs like the super upbeat "Your and Ocean", with some great Southern piano by none other than Billy "Get Back" Preston. Also there is "This is not my Life", "Love is Expensive and Free", and "Funny How it Fades Away." The collectors edition features a pretty dull live version of "The Way" , but the two unreleased tracks will definitely get your foot tapping. It also features a cool book.
