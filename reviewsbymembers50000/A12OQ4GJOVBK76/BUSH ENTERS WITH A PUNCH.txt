 Once John Bush entered Anthrax, thrash metal recieved a new prince, Dave Mustaine is of course the king. "Sound of White Noise",Bushes first album, is a fast paced roller coaster from start to finish.  "Only" and "Hy Pro Glo" are radio caliber hits but  Anthrax once again felt no need to sell out. "Room for One More"  is the first song that actually gets stuck in your head, but soon the  entire album will get in your head and you will never look at Anthrax the  same way again. "Sound of White Noise" not only changed Anthrax,  but created an entire new sound for the pioneers of agression, and it  changed metal forever.
