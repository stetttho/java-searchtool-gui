 If we're lucky this bands major label debut will never see the light of day.  This band is yet another terrible New York band that tries to act like they are different than all the other bands with names like "the stinks" "the jokes" and "the no-talents".  These guys are the modern equivalent of Warrant. Spend your cash on a Black Sabbath CD.
