 "Up on the Sun" just might be the masterpiece that everyone says it is. But on the same day I bought "Up on the Sun"  I also bought "Meat Puppets: Monsters". I enjoy the relaxing mood and accoustic rock of "Up on the Sun", but I think "Monsters" fits the title Masterpeice alot better. But this is a "Up on the Sun" review. "UP on the Sun" is exactly what Meat Puppets frontman Curt Kirkwood says it is, " The Grateful Dead album for people who hate the Grateful Dead". I couldnt of said it better myself. The album is a soothing mix of accoustic instrumentation but it still keeps its punk rock edge. My favorite songs are "Up on the Sun", "Away", "Swimming Ground" and the "Hot Pink" instrumental at the end.
