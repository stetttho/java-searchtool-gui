 First off, I already reviewed this album, but ill do it again. Black Flag  is American punk, they are originators. They aren't fag rockers like some  people that like to call themselves punk rock . And they wrote music that  meant, no stil means somthing. This album would get 5 stars, but some songs  are straight up boring. This album is basically a chronical of Black Flags  earlier days, and its also and easy way to get hard to find tracks off of  their early EP's. Best songs are "White Minority" "Nervous  Breakdown" " Fix Me" and "Louie Louie". Buy this,  or at least somthing by Black Flag, or else your not a real punk.
