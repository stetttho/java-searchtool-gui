 If your like me, than you love adolesscant toilet humor. If you know Cheech and Chong, than you know to expect low brow pot humor. This movie is the best when it comes to dirty jokes and off-the-wall antics. Of all the  Cheech and Chong movies, "Next Movie" is the best. Many will tell  you "Up in Smoke" is the best, they are wrong. "Next  Movie" is far better than its predecessor. The best aspect of this  movie is definitely Cheeches Cousin Red, who is also played by Cheech  Marin. So buy this movie, its probably cheap.
