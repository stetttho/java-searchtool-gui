 First off anyone who calls Skid Row a big hair glam band doesnt know a damn thing about 80s rock. They had a look of a grunge band before grunge was popular and they wore no cheesy spandex or make up.I would compare them  to a more poetic version of Guns n Roses. This album is probably the  greatest of 1989 and one of the greatest of 80s metal period. songs like  "18 and Life" and "I Remember you" are great melodic  songs but the song that is worth waiting for is "Youth gone wild  " it is the ultimate party song. So damn it quit complaining about the  80s and buy this cd.
