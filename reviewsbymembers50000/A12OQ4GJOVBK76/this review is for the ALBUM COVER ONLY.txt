 Look, this review is satyrical, so don't mess yourself.  The cover of Aesop Rock's 'Bazooka Tooth', (an album which I have not yet heard and could be phenomenal judging by Aesop's previous outings) looks more like a pop-punk hot topic album cover than a hip hop album.  I'm saying this mainly because of how stupid the album cover is.  It gives the appearance of though there are songs within about being dumped after school and dreaming about the girl in biology class.  I don't know, it's just that the first time I saw this CD I thought I was looking at the new New Found Glory album or something.
