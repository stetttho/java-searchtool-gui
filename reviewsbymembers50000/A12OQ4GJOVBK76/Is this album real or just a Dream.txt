 I didnt know you were allowed to make albums this good. But Tim Armstrong  and company seemed to of create an album that goes far beyond any other  punk album. For the first time I think that Rancid can live up to the  standards of Operation Ivy. The Best songs are "Maxwell Murder",  "11th Hour", "Roots Radical", "Time Bomb",  and --- wait what am I saying, all the songs on ".. And out come the  Wolves"  are totally awesome, Im about to go buy their new self titled  album, I can only pray that its as good as this one.
