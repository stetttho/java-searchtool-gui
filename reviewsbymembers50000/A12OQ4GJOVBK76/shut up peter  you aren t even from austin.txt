 Before the review gets under way, peter, i'm sure you have no real knowledge of music, you just heard about this band from your friends and when it sounded different from the Foo Fighters and Linkin Park it scared you. Anyways, this is good music, and they are talented, but they don't play in an orthadox way. its like At the Drive-In only harder at the hard parts and softer at the soft parts. fugazi fans will appreciate this too. also check out further seems forever.
