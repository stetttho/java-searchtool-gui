 AFI is fastly becoming my favorite band. "Black Sails in The  Sunset" is a reason why. This is a dark album, somthing AFI hasnt  always done. Davey Havoks amazing emotional vocals will grip you, and it  also features some great bass work. "Weathered Tomb" and  "The Last Kiss" are the best songs on the album, the secret song  is pretty cool too.
