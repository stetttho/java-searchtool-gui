 Bad Astronaut is a perfect rock band with a real fresh sound. Joey Cape has to have is hands full between Lagwagon, Me First and the Gimme Gimme's, running a record label, and touring; all this makes a man wonder where he gets time to not only make a record with another band, but to make a completely original rock'n'roll masterpiece. I wouldn't call Bad Astronaut punk, I'd call it a new form of progressive space rock with punk and emo influences. cool, very cool.
