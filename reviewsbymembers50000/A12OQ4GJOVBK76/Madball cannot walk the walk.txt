 One word- posers. Madball talks so much talk in their music, but it doesnt come through in the end. They have alot of songs that are just about them being "hardcore". Hardcore bands don't have to say that they're  Hardcore, the just are, and it comes out in the music. Madballs music  sounds more like rapcore bands like Limp Bizkit and Papa Roach. In  "Hold It Down", they make fun of hardcore bands that make money-  what a bunch of hypocrites. Hardcore bands have to make money, so they can  eat. I dont care what relationship they have to Agnostic Front. Dont waste your money on "Hold It Down".
