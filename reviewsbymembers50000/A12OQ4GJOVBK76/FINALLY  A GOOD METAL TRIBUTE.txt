 Finally, tribute to a metal band that is not industrial. It seems that if a tribute album is going to be done its always that industrial crap,(for example the tribute to Metallica "Overload" and  "Megaded"- a tribute to Megadeth). Or its a bunch of bands from  Sweeden that you have never heard of and probably praise satan. Not Nativiy  in Black. This is the CD that got me into metal. With a great Megadeth  cover of "Paranoid" and an even better version of "Symtom of  the Universe" by Sepultura, I couldn't keep it out of the CD player.  But topping the list are 2 bands I had never even heard of-1000 Homo DJs  and Bullring Brummies covers of "The Wizard" and  "Supernaught" just strait up kick ass. If you are a metal fan  than this album is a must have.
