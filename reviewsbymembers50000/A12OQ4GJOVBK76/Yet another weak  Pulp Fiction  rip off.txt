 I was hoping this movie would bring somthing new to the world of cinema. But all "Go" brought me was regret for renting it. All I see in this movie is "Pulp Fiction" with teens wrather than adults as  the main characters. And just like "Pulp Fiction" this movie does  not go in order from beginning to end. And the first scene is set in a  diner with a girl and a boy talking, the scene later appears in the movie  all over again, identical to.... yes you got it "Pulp Fiction".  Other Pulp rip-offs include an outside drug-dealer , a character on  extremely to many drugs, and corrupt cops. So if you want to get the real  deal, than get "Pulp Fiction".
