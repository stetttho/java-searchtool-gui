 Well Ben Lee, at least you tried. And by that I mean you tried way to hard. You're songwriting is terrible, and you can't play guitar, which is probably why you put so many electronics on this album.  I heard two of your songs, and they were so terrible I could make the assumption, just from hearing two songs, that you are a terrible musician.  In that one really bad song when you say "To see the lights of San Francisco...at night" you don't need to say "at night" because if it was daytime, the lights wouldn't be on. Idiot.
