 people, specifically music fans, are going to look back upon the 1990's and think, "what a great period for musical developement, remember Nirvana and Radiohead and all those other ground breaking bands, remember Green Day and Weezer". Of course then they'll have to remember all the Limp Bizkits and Korns that appeoared towards the dismal end of what was supposed to be a crowning jewel for rock music. ( and then of course there is the hip ho, white rappers and ghetto thugs making millions, don't get me started.) ANYWAY, before I get completely off track lets all remember those hard-rockin' geniuses who said "to hell with guitars, lets make real rock". Thats what Ben Folds Five is, real rock, a combination of the bare essentials from the 1950's combined with the emmotional alternative that would be forever deemed as "Geek Rock". If you ever remember the song "Brick", forget it existed, remember whats really important, "Battle of Who Could Care Less", "Selfless Cold", "Kate" and the oh so many other songs that made you say, "YES, this is what I have been searching for". Ben Folds is great, but I sure wish I could of gotten a chance to see these guys play live.
