 Forget "Autin Powers 2" or "American Pie", "South Park Bigger Longer and Uncut" was and is the funniest movie of last year. It was much more original than the disaster that is "Austin  Powers the Spy Who Shagged Me". And it is alot more raunchy than  "American Pie". If your looking for a movie that you can laugh at  over and over again, get "South Park".
