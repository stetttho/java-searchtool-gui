 It is a real surprise that Ten Foot Pole aren't bigger than they are (of course a year and a half hiatus might be to blame for this). The combine catchy pop-punk melodies, thrashy guitars riffs, and a great punk voice to bring a sound that combines great elements of all punk genres. All the songs are great, and are more meaningful than most punk. The second track "John" is a great tune, and it's ending is a finale that will bring tears to the eyes of true fans of melodisism, "Daddy" is another great song that tackles serious subjects, and the end track "A.D.D" is probably one of the top ten punk songs this reviewer has ever heard (I know my music, and I've heard alot of punk in my days). Fans of Guttermouth, NOFX, and No Use should definitely have this in their collection.
