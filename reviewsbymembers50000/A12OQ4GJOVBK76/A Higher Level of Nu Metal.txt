 Lets face it, wheter its Korn or Staind, Limp Bizkit or Sevendust, Nu-Metal (or alterna-metal) is not the most creative music, nor is it the best quality stuff either. Luckily, I found Cold, a band which on "13 Ways to Bleed on Stage" echoes the Seattle grunge era, but adds the down tuned guitars of Deftones. Its hard to believe a band of such quality was discovered by the crowned prince of dullness Fred Durst. Cold is able to sing of angst yet is able to shed its Staind related image. A good example of Staind would be adding the vocals and grind of Godsmack with the mystique and creativity of Tool. But aside from comparisons, Cold's "13 Ways to Bleed on Stage" is somthing completely original in the dull conforming world of POPULAR Nu-Metal. The best tracks on the album are "Just Got Wicked", "She Said", "End of the World", and espeacially the spectacular "Send in the Clowns". The only flaw with this album is its lack of diversity in the music. But, still, if you are a fan of the MTV Nu-Metal, go outside the box for once and pick up this album.
