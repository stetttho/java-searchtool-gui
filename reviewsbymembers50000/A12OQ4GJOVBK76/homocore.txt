 i invented a genre. all the fans of this whole post-emo-pop-punk-core seem to do so. so i think homocore is pretty fitting. if you're going to scream, don't scream something like "MY HEART BLEEDS NO MORE" . Scream something like "HAIL SATAN! PRINCE ALMIGHT OF THE ETERNAL DARKNESS". Listen to Dimmu Borgir
