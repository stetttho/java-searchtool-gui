 You wanna know why S.O.D's "Speak English of Die" is so damn good? Because it has everything. Its got the lyrical content of punk in songs such as "United Forces", it has the lightning fast riffs of  thrash metal, in pretty much every song. And it has the roaring death metal  grunts of Billy Milano. Dont let the name fool you, "Speak English of  Die" is not an any way antagonizing non-americans, its just pointing  out the flaws in the American immigration system. But putting that aside,  its also a great album because Scott Ian and Charlie Benante from  Anthrax-THE GREATEST BAND EVER- are in S.O.D. So I can describe "Speak  English or Die" in one word-EXTREME!
