 One thing I wish is that all the whining fifteen year-old girls would stop whining about this album being "too different".  Last time I checked the band wasn't writing music for you and they were growing up.  "Stay What You Are" features much better music and much more originality than previous releases, and it just so happens that this is the album that has pretty much broken the band (in the positive way).  The album still features what I like to call Saves the Days pattened "dark-poppiness".  An album that can make you dance and still feature the lyrics "I slit your throat and drank your blood" is a work of art by my standards.
