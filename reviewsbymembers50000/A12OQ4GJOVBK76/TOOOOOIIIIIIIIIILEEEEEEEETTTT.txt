 In the punk world there is an ongoing argument on when old school punk died and new school took over. In a recent epitaph.com poll (June 2001) a vast majority of punkers cited 1989 as the specific year for the new school overthrow.  Funny that 1989 is only one year before Guttermouth recorded the tunes on "The Album Formerly Known as a Full Length LP". With the raw and offensive attitude and breakneck speed of old school, and the cartoonishness, catchiness, and yes poppiness of new school this album is probebly the nexus of the punk universe, where new and old meet up. Check out concert classics like "Bruce Lee Vs. The KISS Army", "Toilet", Race Track", "Oats", and my favorite "1-2-3 SLAM!"
