 Goldfinger is a mediocre band at best; but in the ska genre, they have far more originality than a lot of bands that are just Less Than Jake or Reel Big Fish rip-offs. "Hang Ups" isnt a bad album, nor is it a masterpeice. The songs that are good are fantastic; "Superman" will become an immediate favorite of anyone that hears it, and "If Only" is a great song for the hopeless romantic. The good thing about this album is that it showcases Goldfinger not taking themselves to seriously.
