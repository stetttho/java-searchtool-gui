 Not since the days of bands like Rush and Blue Oyster Cult has a band brought art and music together as well as A Perfect Circle. If you enjoy TOOL, don't think twice about buying this album, it basically is TOOL, except it is a little more mellow and artsy than the average TOOL album. If you are not willing to open your mind, then don't even bother buying this album. Mer De Noms flows lake an ocean, but the intense drumming by Josh Freese (of the Vandals might I add) is like a tidal wave in this mellow ocean of sound. A Perfect Circle pretty much is a NU-metal band, because they follow some of the same formulas as bands like Deftones and Nickelback, but they also have a classic sense to them. Judith, as everyone knows, was a break-out hit for the band, and it led many to believe that it was TOOL. But do not expect the rest of the songs to be as hard-hitting as Judith. Everysong features a different formula, ranging from soft and symphonic to heavy and powerful. Other tracks to check out are "Magdalena" "3 Libras" and "Sleeping Beauty". Fans of TOOL, Deftones, Clutch, or progressive rock will instantly like this album. It only recieved four stars because I am personally a fan of heavier stuff than this; although Mer De Noms contains a fair share of heaviness, it does fall soft at many parts.
