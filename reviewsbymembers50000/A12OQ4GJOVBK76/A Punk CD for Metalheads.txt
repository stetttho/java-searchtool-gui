 "Art of Drowning" by AFI is as good as, if not better than all previous material, and the songs still seem to do the same thing, they baffle me.  But, for me that is a very positive aspect to an album, because music is better when it makes you think.  The subject matter on the songs found here are AFI's darkest yet, check out "Days of the Phoenix" and "Smile", and the songs have become far more aggressive.  The dark quality and speed combined with aggression of "The Art of Drowning" prompts punks to ask the question, "how long will it be before AFI are an all out metal band?" Although that will probably never happen, the songs do have a very metallic aspect to them (and that being said, quit comparing them to the Misfits, they are better matched with Danzig's latter band Samhain.) Also, Davey continues his ballad crooning with the follow up to "God Called in Sick Today" (Black Sails in the Sunset) with the very somber "Morningstar".  This is good music to listen to in the dark, and it has the coolest book I've ever seen in a CD.
