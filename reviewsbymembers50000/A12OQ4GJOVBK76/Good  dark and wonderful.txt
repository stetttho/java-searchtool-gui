 Why do people always complain about AFI's transition to darker punk. I see  it as a change for the better. "Black Sails in the Sunset" is an  amazing LP of dark and complexed punk. "Weathered Tomb" is  amazing and "The Last Kiss" is probably the best AFI song I have  ever heard. This album is awesome, and original. The songs are punk without  talking about girls (The Ataris) or talking too much about politics  (Anti-Flag). Simply amazing.
