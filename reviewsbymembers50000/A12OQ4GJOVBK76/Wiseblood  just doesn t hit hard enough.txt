 I was expecting more when I bought "Wiseblood". I had heard COC's cover song on "Nativity in Black" the Black Sabbath tribute album, and it was pretty heavy. Now, "Wiseblood" is a good album,  but considering that COC is classified as a heavy metal band, it is kind of  a dissapointing album. Songs like "The Snake has No Head" and  "Man or Ash" are pretty damned heavy, but everything else has  more of an alternative sound. The most dissapointing thing about  "Wiseblood" is that when the album starts out with "King of  all the Rotten" its very heavy but as soon as vocalist Pepper Kennan  says "would you be my queen...." it kind of slows down, which is  sad because it has alot of potential as a song. Keep in mind though, the  songs sound good, they just aren't heavy enough.
