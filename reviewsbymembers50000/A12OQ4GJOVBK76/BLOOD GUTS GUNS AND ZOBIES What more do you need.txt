 I cant get enough of this movie. Its got everything a horror movie should have and more. Its got awesome monsters (even though it is very low budget). Its very gorey. And its also kind of funny too. Before I saw  "Dawn of The Dead" I thought zombie movies were all the same and  had no story line. "Dawn of The Dead" shut me up fast. Not only  is it action packed but it has alot of hidden messages in it too. Its very  psycological and makes you think. "Dawn of The Dead" is far  beyond some one dimensional slasher flick; it is and intense, versatile,  roller coaster of zombies,blood,and violence.
