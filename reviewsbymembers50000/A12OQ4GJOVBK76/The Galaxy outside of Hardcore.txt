 Last time I checked hardcore was growing, but this album is just mindblowing.  Whereas Cave-In was once a sister-band to Converge, they are now a little more comperable to a hardcore Pink Floyd.  Ladies and gentlemen, the fact that this album is slower and mellower than previous Cave-In efforts does not mean that they are no longer a hardcore band, for I believe this album is one of the most hardcore I own.  The tracks are long, the riffs are heavy, and the lyrics are beyond intellegent.  Jupiter is the most appropriate name for this album as its songs tempos and ambiance are like journeys through the outer realms of space.  It might be vain to say so, but after listening to this CD I actually felt smarter.  Cave-In is without a doubt the most original band to emerge from any scene withing the last decade.
