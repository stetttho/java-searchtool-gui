 Once it was thought that the only music to come out of Sweden was dark and satanic black metal, then again there was Refused, who broke up before they made it big. Well, it just so happens that the best of all of Scandanavian bands was hiding under a half-pipe somewhere. Out of nowhere Millencolin came with a record that knocked all who listened off their feet. Pop-punk with a funky Swedish dialect is basically the best definition of Millencolin. Track #1 "Bullion" is a punk rawk anthem, in which kids shout out at there brilliant live shows, "Jellygoose" is a good relationship song, and they also have a great sense of humour, as heard in "Killercrush", which is about dating a fat chick. And if meaningfulness, catchiness, and humuor weren't enough, they even through in a top-knotch ska song in the end with "Airhead". To sum it all up "Life On A Plate" is the new school punk record that doesn't leave any stones unturned.
