 First off, if you are familiar with the LTJ album "Hello  Rockview", then this album will be nothing you expected. The quality  is poor, but I have heard worse. The songs aren't as catchy, but they do  sound good. The main problem with the songs on "Pez-Core" is that  they don't have the emotion and passion like the songs of newer Less Than  Jake do. Im sure hardcore ska fans will enjoy this CD, but anyone only  familiar with "Hello Rockview" will be slightly dissapointed.
