 We've all had a point in time where we remember a certain band a say to ourselves, "Hey, I need to get all their albums". Any fan of metal, punk, progressive, or southern rock has said that about Alice In Chains. Of course, who is going to spend their money on one band. Say no more, because the Music Bank is all you need. Music Bank features both "Dirt" and "Sap" in their entirety, most of "Facelift" and tracks off of Alice In Chains self titled and "Jar of Flies". But the best songs in the box set are the 1988 demos, songs like "Whatcha Gonna Do" and "I Cant Have You Blues" combine elements of 80's metal, Grunge, and Southern Blues. Music Box is a must have for the Alice In Chains fan who doesn't own any Alice In Chains material.
