 Being a teenage scenester from Austin, Texas it is mandatory that I listen to the Impossibles. But then again, whats wrong with it being mandatory when the band is as great as they are. Many times when a ska/punk band try's to change their style, they often crash and burn (Goldfinger, No Doubt, even (some songs) scene favorite Less Than Jake). Impossibles, however, take it in a different direction, wheras instead of going completely punk, they added many Emo and Indie rock qualities, and it really works out. Many compare the "New" Impossibles to Weezer, I think this comparison is completely off as it is the most original than any album this reviewer has heard in a good long time. AUSTIN ROCK FOREVER!!!!!!!!
