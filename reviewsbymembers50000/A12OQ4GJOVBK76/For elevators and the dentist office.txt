 Did I just walk into a middle-aged mans house in 1988? Well, thats what John Mayer makes me feel like.  I wouldn't be surprised at all if Kenny G. made a few guests appearances on this tool's next album. Basically, if you like a Dave Matthews Wannabe who who plays soft-rock inspired by Steve Winward get this. If you are a true music fan who seeks out good and original stuff, don't come near this CD.
