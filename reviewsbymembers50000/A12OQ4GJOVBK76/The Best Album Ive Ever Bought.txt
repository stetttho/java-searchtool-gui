 Yes, "All the Pain Money Can Buy" is the best album I own. And yes, I am a hardcore fan of punk, hardcore, and thrash. So how could a person like me who enjoys banging his head and getting in the mosh pit love Fastball so much. Its probably because "All the Pain Money can Buy" is the only album I have where I know all the words to every song. The songs are simple you yet deep. These are songs that will cure even the saddest manic depressant. And don't expect all the songs to sound like "The Way" either, check out "Out of My Head", "Damaged Goods" and "Warm Fuzzy Feeling".
