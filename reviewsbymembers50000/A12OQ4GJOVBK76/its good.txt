 I'm tired of writing long reviews, the quickest synopsis of Nothing Feels Good by the Promise Ring that I can make is that is a poppy record that has absolutely nothing to do with pop. Elements of Lo-Fi, Indie, and Emo combine to make extremely intellegent and catchy tunes. Choice tracks for me are "Is This Thing On", "Why Did We Ever Meet", and "B is for Bethlehem".
