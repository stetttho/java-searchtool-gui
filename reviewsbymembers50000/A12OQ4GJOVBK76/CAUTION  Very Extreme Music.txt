 Imagine you are in heaven, and God allows you to have one listen to what hell sounds like, if Satan has taste, he will probably be playing "Violence" by Nothingface over the loud speakers. Just think about that super-nihilistic name VIOLENCE, just expect that when you put your headphones on, because this album is the soundtrack to violence. The first track "Make your own Bones" is like a sociopaths monolouge, which is followed by "Bleeder" which is probably the softest song you will get on this album , but that doesnt say alot. Now, after you hear those two songs, prepare for MAXIMUM "Violence", because the song "Same Solution" is pure nihilism. The lyrics, the percussion, the subject matter, "Same Solution" is the aggro-hardcore bands answer to Slayer, with lyrics providing imagery some what like Leatherface's basement. The album is loud, fast, with a killer percussion section. Slipknot, Mudvayne, Disturbed, get that if you want, but you would be better off getting Nothingface's "Violence".
