 Okay, I dont actually have this album, but I have just about every Anthrax studio album there is, and I have heard most of the remix albums too. Lets put it like this- Im a hardcore Anthrax fan. If you dont have any Anthrax  CDS, get this one. Because it features just what it says, their greatest  hits. See, Anthrax is a pretty hard band to get in to. They are the kind of  band that you have to listen to their songs a couple of times before you  get the knack of it. This album is good because it features most of their  catchiest tunes and some personal favorites of mine, but to buy an Anthrax  Album if you have never heard them is a risk. Espeacially if you are only  used to thrash metal bands more like Metallica and Slayer or new metal  bands like Korn and Staind, if that is what you are used to, chances are  you wont like Anthrax. But give them a try, but this CD.
