 Dumb swinger secret agent- beautiful assistant he falls in love with- dull yet wacky enemy. Sounds alot like another movie I know of, what was it called, oh yeah- The First "Austin Powers". The original was very  funny and original, it was a slap in the face to most comedies at the time.  Unfortunitely, "The Spy Who Shagged Me" is basically the same  thing, except Austin Powers goes back in time again. Its so predictable,  because it is all the same gags as the first Austin Powers. Now all these  kids are quoting this movie, and think that it is so hilarious, it was  hilarious the first time it happened, then they basically made a carbon  copy. Also, the original Austin Powers was a flop, not many people saw in  the theatre, but word got around, and every body saw it when it was  released on video, which is the making of a great comedy. If you already  own the original, you dont need to buy this, because you pretty much  already own it.
