 With "Hello Rockview", Less Than Jake proved to me that there is no better ska or ska/punk band out there... when I picked up "Loosing Streak", LTJ proved to me that there probably isn't a better rock band out there right now. How a band can accomplish so much greatness in less than a decade is beyond me, but Less Than Jake did it. The fast paced fury of SoCal punk is heard, backed up by the greatest horn section in the business. The first track "Automatic" just feels good to hear, and "9th and Pine" is quite possibly the best LTJ song I've ever heard. Fans of Sublime will fall in love with the mid-paced "Dopeman". And then of course there is the Less Than Jake anthem "Johnny Quest Thinks We're Sellouts", words can't explain that songs greatness. If you like any kind of rock music, even if it's death metal, pick up Less Than Jake's "Loosing Streak".
