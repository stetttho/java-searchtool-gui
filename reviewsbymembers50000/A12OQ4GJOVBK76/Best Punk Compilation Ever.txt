 I have Punk-O-Rama Volume 2 to thank for the entire fact that I listen to punk now. My brother picked it up at Hastings and once we got home, it  never left the CD player. There are NO BAD SONGS on this compilation. The  worst one (Thought Control by DFL) is still pretty damn good. The best song  is hard to pick, but it is probably Jukebox Lean by The New Bomb Turks. So  if you dont listen to punk YET, pick this CD up, its cheap, and I garuntee  by the time your finished listening to it you will be a punk fan.
