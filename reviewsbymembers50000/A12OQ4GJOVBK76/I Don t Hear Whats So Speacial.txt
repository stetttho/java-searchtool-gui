 First off, I don't want to say Minor Threat sucks, I just don't hear any passion in their music. Alot of the songs sound the same, and the sound quality is horrible, but not in that cool Black Flag way. I understand that they are the creators of hardcore, but how did they get that title and not a band where you can actually hear the Hardcore sound (such as Black Flag, Bad Brains). I guess if you listen to music solely for the song writing, you will like Minor Threat, but if your looking for melody and musicianship, this album is a waste. Stick to Hardcore bands like Ensign, Snapcase, and Shutdown.
