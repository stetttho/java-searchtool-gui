 face to face, no use for a name, pennywise, and now H2O, all bands that joined the ranks of once punk bands that softened up...... a wee bit.  don't worry all you people out there, just because you won't find any of the half-way hardcore songs that H2O was once known for, it doesnt mean you aren't any less of a man for liking it. just listen to "Shine Your Light" or "Songs Remain", I garuntee you'll like it regardless of heaviness. I mean, it isn't as though they are the Ataris all of a sudden, they're new stuff is still as hard Pennywise or No Use's heaviest material. and if that doesnt fit  you, quit crying and buy some Good Riddance, quit ignoring that band.
