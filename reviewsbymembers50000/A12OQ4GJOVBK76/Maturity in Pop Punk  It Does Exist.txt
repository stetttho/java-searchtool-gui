 Blink 182 made me temporarily loose faith in pop-punk. They made it seem like pop-punk was only a big comedy act, and you had to make extremely immature records to succeed. Luckily I came across Midtown and this fantastic peice of work called "Save The World, Loose the Girl". It begins with all three lead singers shouting in unisyn "God I Wish I Could Hate You For The Rest Of My!. . ." and its all good from there. The first track "Just Rock N Roll" is a mature song with great lyrics, and a sound that you can really sing along to. "Time" the second track, is about as close to emo as Midtown gets. Midtown sound is basically pop-punk sprinkled with emo. Thats why I'm suprised I like this album, because I HATE emo. But dont go off thinking this is an album with serious songs with emotion, "Just A Boy" is a great 40 second punk song done in the vein of groups like Pulley and the Descendents. And look for a special tribute to KISS at the end of track 7. Simply fantastic.
