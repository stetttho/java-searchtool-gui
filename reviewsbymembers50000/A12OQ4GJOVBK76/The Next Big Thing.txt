 I had to wait in a long line to see these guys open for Kittie, and I can tell you that even though I only saw them do 4 songs, they were only upstaged by Kittie, and there were 2 other bands there, including Factory 81.  "Statement" has a fresh sound and while still NU-metal, it doesnt follow the same path as most NU-metal bands. Nonpoint could be the next big thing, check out "Mindtrip", "Victim", and check out "Double Stakked" if you want to hear how much talent there guitarist has.
