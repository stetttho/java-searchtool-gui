 Rarity? Well if by rarity you mean the bands name I guess I'll agree, but you really don't have to dig very deep to understand that this sad excuse for an album is just a rehash of all the other mainstram nu-metal robots already playing.  Incubus, Deftones, Linkin Park are all bands that I, an intellegent muic fan would never be able to tell apart, and now Hoobastink have joined the ranks. The lyrics are trite (just look at the song names) and all pretty much about the same thing- pain of some sort; well guess what, your rock stars on a major record label who don't know what it is like to struggle on a club scene, cheer up. Basically what Im saying is, this album will not grow old with you, you will through it away when the next band and the next fad roll along. Indie rock forever.
