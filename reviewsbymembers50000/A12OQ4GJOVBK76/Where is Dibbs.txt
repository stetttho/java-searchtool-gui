 This album should be under the heading 'Slug' not 'Atmosphere'.  It's as good as your gonna get from Epitaph records.  Ant doesn't seem relevant here.  The songs are good, but not Lucy Ford/Overcast good.  My main argument is where the hell is Mr. Dibbs.  That guy is amazing and Slug should thank God everyday for letting him meet him.  This album would have 6 stars if Mr. Dibbs got more attention, after all, Atmosphere is a GROUP, not a guy.  If I wanted a Slug album, I'd get one.  Basically, the album is good, but money is better spent on the new Brother Ali album.
