 I bet "White Trash Two Heebs and a Bean" would be my favorite  NOFX cd, had I not already owned Punk in Drublic for about 4 months. White  Trash is a wonderful punk album, full of thoughtful and brutal songs.  Though nowhere as melodic or catchy as anything on PUNK IN DRUBLIC, they  are still great songs. For the longest time I could only stand "Please  Play this Song on the Radio", then last week (8 months after I bought  the CD) I found at "Stickin In My Eye" was on it, a song I saw  them play live. Then came "Liza and Louise" and "Johnny  Appleseed", so overall, this isnt a bad album. But "Straight  Edge"(the song, not the lifestyle.) pisses me off!!!
