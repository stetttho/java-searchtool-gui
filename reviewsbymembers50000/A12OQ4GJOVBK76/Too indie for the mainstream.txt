 No pictures of band members. No light-hearted sing-alongs. No hit singles. Pinkerton is an album hiding in the dark among the other Weezer albums. Why? Its still a mystery among Weezer fans. However, if you ask most hardcore Weezer fans which album is their favorite, don't be surprised when a majority say Pinkerton. For those who can't stand the new commercially pop Green album, or are a little bit burnt out on old Blue, this is the album. With Weezer's heaviest riffs (The Good Life), darkest subject matter (Pink Triangle, and purposely shoddy production (El Scorcho) this shows the audience the real indie side to Weezer. Don't worry though, there is still the classic Weezer love song,"I'm Falling For You", it's just a little heavier than the typical Weezer love song. Don't fear the fact that this is not a famous album, great it with open arms, and love it.
