 Being a fan of rough-around-the-edges movies such as "Dazed And Confused" I had to see this. In fact I BOUGHT it without even seeing it before. At first I thought it wasnt even funny and that it went no  where. Considering it was made in the early 80's I knew it wouldn't be as  bold as the shock comedies of today such as "American Pie". After  watching it a few more times I began quoting scenes such as "No shoes,  no shirt, NO DICE! " . And soon after that it was in regular  circulation in my VCR and I was reccomending it to all my friends. So if  your a fan of 80's movies or teen movies period, than "Fast Times At  Ridgemont" high is the movie for you.
