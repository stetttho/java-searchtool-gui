 Whats the deal with these "fans" who say, "I'm so sick of NOFX, they always sound the same" yet when NOFX does some experimenting (Heavy Petting Zoo) all of a sudden it's "This is TOO different, TOO poppy".  Oh shut up! The only reason this LP gets a bad rep is because it followed Punk In Drublic (the essential NOFX). First off, bands that remake the [same stuff] and end up [horrible] in the end-- look what happened to Pennywise; second if you want some real pop look what happened to Bad Religon. NOFX have done a great job at churning out good album after good album, Heavy Petting Zoo is no exception. Best tracks include Hobophobic, Whatever Didi Wants, Hot Dog, and Love Story.
