 What did 'Personal Journals' lack? Well, obviously not much, Francis had a near flawless release, upping the ante for post millenial MC's everywhere.  With the exception of Brother Ali's 'Shadows on the Sun' the 'Non-Prophets' national debut HOPE is an album that combines Sages unbelievalbe skill and insight with the one thing that 'Personal Journals' could of used more of; Big Phat beats.  Joe Beats is the backbone to Sage's skeletal system.  The album is also slightly more light hearted than that of the darkly undertoned 'Personal Journals'. Songs like 'Disasters' show Sage venturing out into sillier subjects while maintaining his amazing skill.  Sage is a new veteran of sorts. The man is a tried n' true mc, and Joe Beats is more than just Robin to his Batman; its like Batman teamed up with Superman.  Other good tracks to consider are 'New World Order' and 'Any Port'. Sic.
