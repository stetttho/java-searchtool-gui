 "Mallrats" was the comedic genius Kevin Smith aka Silent Bobs second hilarious flick. "Mallrats" is a take no prisoners, no apologies movie. It uses constant profanity, has many sexual inuendos, and  has a very long scene of gratutitous nudity, and you will love every second  of it. "Mallrats" main charactar Brodie, played by Jason Lee is  without a doubt a modern day Jim Belushi. I enjoyed this movie and if you  like dirty movies, then you will love "Mallrats".
