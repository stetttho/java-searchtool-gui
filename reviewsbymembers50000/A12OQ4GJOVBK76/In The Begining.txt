 In the begining, before there was a wave of "SoCal" pop-punk bands that hit, there was a band who was infamous for there ludeness for immaturaty, and what happens... they are signed to Epitaph, and sold to the public.  S&M Airlines, while not the best, was the first album to be manufactured in bulk for Fat Mike and Co. At first, it won't be the most liked album, but then you will here the last few songs. "Life O Riely" is an awesome song, with obvious ska influences, "You Drink You Drive, You Spill" is a humourous, yet serious song, "Screamin' For Change" is well... "Screamin' For Change", and you cannot leave out the hilarious cover of Fleetwood Mac's "Go Your Own Way". But don't just listen to the last few songs, go back and listen to the title track, and the "Day to Daze". This album is so great because, well because NOFX still hasn't changed after all these years.
