 Im gonna try to make this shorter than my innitial review, because I already reviewed the classic video version of "NOTLD". First off, no extra music is needed, no extras are needed at the end of the film, and  why do you need to sharpen this movies picture? Its some of the films low  budget bad quality that makes it good. So, dont buy this technological  mumbo-jumbo, get the classic video version.
