 I enjoy the way A.F.I combines elements of both punk and hardcore, but  "All Hallows E.P" is like somthing out of 20 years ago. The album  is dark, yet catchy.  I can tell this is the direction of AFI, and if so, I  like it. Davey has some of the best pipes on a punk singer Ive ever seen.  And, why does everyone compare them to the Offspring, these guys sound more  like old school punkers like The Misfits (only way better) and Black Flag.  Any punk should pick this E.P up.
