 I got this video for Christmas at the same time I got the "Music Bank" box set.This is an awesome video because not only does it have alot of great songs, but you get to see the videos. The best video is by  far "Away". I don't particularly like the song song  "Away", but the claymation is really awesome, plus it has some  creepy looking circus freaks doing messed up stuff. The main reason this  video is so good is because it shows how artistic Alice in Chains really  are. They have made some of the most amazing videos I have ever seen. They  boggle the eyes. So if you are an Alice in Chains fan, or a fan of good  art, than pick up a copy of "Video Bank"
