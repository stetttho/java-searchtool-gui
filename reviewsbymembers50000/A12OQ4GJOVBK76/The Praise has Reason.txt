 Although I still hold The New Amsterdams with higher regard than I do Dashboard Confessional, I can still listen to this album anytime.  Swiss Army Romance is an album that has universal appeal, yet is still as down to earth as a friend playing accoustic guitar in your garage.  The songs are catchy and pop-accessible, but by no means poorly structured. "Ender Will Save Us" has a splendid chorus, but Carraba makes the listener wait for it. This album also includes "Screaming Infidelities" which has a climactical ending which will keep the crowds singing. Carraba still features more songs on this album in his set than more recent works, this kind of staying power should tell the listener something good is going on.
