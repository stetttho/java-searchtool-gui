 We've all seen The OC on Fox. That show that features all those privalidged kids in their huge cars partying their life away and have wealthy parents to fall back on.  Well, imagine those kids trying to re-create In Flames.  Thats precisely what Bleeding Through is.  It's a little bit of AFI, a dash of Eighteen Visions, liberal amounts of the catchier Soilwork material, and a fondness for Cradle of Filth and what you have is a band of rich American kids pretending they know metal.  Oh, and don't forget, they have a cute girl on KEYBOARDS for good measure. Three things that are being abused in the metal world are females, keyboards, and female keyboardist. This album is sickening, its as boring as every other metalcore album released since the year 2000 (the same year Cave-In left metalcore, no coencidence at all) and whats worse is they try to MARKET they're image to all sorts of demographics. Its a little trendy, a good goth formula, edge-mentalities of straight-edge, and some gore for metal; and oh yeah, its OK to like them if you are a girl, because there is a girl in the band....on keyboards!  The bottom line is that of all the albums that could possible the deathnail for hardcore (not metal, mind you) this one has to be it. Bleeding Through seem to be created solely for Hot Topic sales racks.  If you want American metal try Fates Warning or Megadeth. If it's metal/hardcore that you want, I'd say this genre is pretty much dying, but Cave-In's 'Until Your Heart Stops' is amazing, as well as anything by Converge.  Bleeding Through however, well lets just call them AFI 2.
