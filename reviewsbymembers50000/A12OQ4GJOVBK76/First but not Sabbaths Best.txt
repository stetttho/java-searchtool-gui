 My father bought this CD and listens to it all the time in his truck. Now I have heard Black Sabbaths other stuff but never the early stuff. Though it has good music it is not anywhere as good as "Paranoid" or  "Mob Rules". Actually I would reccomend Ozzy's solo work over any  Black Sabbath album. But anyways, back tho the First LP. It is low budget,  and a bit darker than later Sabbath, but things change. The guitar work by  Toni Iomi is great and he does some really great solos, but his riffs are  nowhere as powerful as they are in "Iron Man" or  "Paranoid". Basically, this album is just like most metal bands  first, such as "Kill Em All" by Metallica and "Cowboys from  Hell" by Pantera- its good a good start, but it gets better.
