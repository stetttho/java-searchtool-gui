 When I saw this book in the bookstore recently I picked it up just to take a gander at it. Upon opening the book I heard a loud "Cha-Ching!" Everytime I turned a page I heard sound effects of carribean cruises, Elizabeth's first Lexus reving up, and the sound of Ed (her father) jumping into a pool of money just like Scrooge McDuck.  Gee, I'd kidnapp myself if I thought it would mean my family would become millionaires.   Guess what? Everyday a child is kidnaped and families go through similar torment. Guess what else? Most of the time these parents never see their kids again, unless its at a funeral. Having Elizabeth back should be reward enough. But no, they have to do the "Christian thing": which means exploit their tragedy and convert it into cold hard cash. First Utah loses Karl Malone, and now dignity.
