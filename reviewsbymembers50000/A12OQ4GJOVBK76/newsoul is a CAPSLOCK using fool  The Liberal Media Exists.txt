 Hey newsoul, you referred to Snoop Dogg's Doggy Style as 'The Fianl Death Nail' of hip-hop.  Well, it's ten years after Doggy Style and I just got some wonderful albums by Brother Ali and EL-P, wonderful hip hop, so you were wrong about that. Also, you seemed of been brain washed by the liberal media. So go listen to some more Prince and eat some tofu with your boyfriend and pretend that war is bad.
