 Deja Entendu translates to 'already heard'.  Which is pretty much a two word summary of the entire album.  This band, made all the worse by using ridiculous foreign language translations in their titles, is pretty much a gigantic peice of lame.  They weren't good on their last album, and because they have infiltrated the commercial world (actually, the entire world is one big commercial) they are all the more worse.  That one song is on MTV2, which means when you watch it, you are a loser. I don't know how that logic works, it just does.  If you like this music you might also consider suicide.
