 Everytime I listen to "Cut Your Hair" aka Track #4 on Pavement's Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain, I am taken back to Hawaii in 1995 when the pirate radio station began playing the song what seemed like every hour.  Though the song, as well as the other tracks, is raw, confusing, and most of all complexed, it still maintains its beauty.  Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain can basically be sumed up as the definition of indie-rock, as it is totally original, unpopular, and most importantly self-produced.  Pavement busted out onto the forefront of the Lo-Fi scene along with Sebadoh just at the time that the so called "college bands" were suddenly going mainstream.  If America maintained a higher degree of intellect, Pavement would of been in the place of Nirvana and Sebadoh in the place Pearl Jam.  Don't be the only member of the AV club to miss out on coffee shop classics such as "Silence Kit", "Good Soundz", "Heaven is a Truck", "5-4=Unity", and of course the headbangin'metal anthem, "Cut Your Hair." God Bless Pavement. . . and P.S, if your a Meat Puppets fan, then you most defineitely need this.
