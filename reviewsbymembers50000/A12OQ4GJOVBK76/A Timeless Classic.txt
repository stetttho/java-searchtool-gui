 In a time when hard rock and funk were running the show, somthing came from the mind of Donald Faegan and Walter Becker that is now a classic. From "Black Cow" to "Josie" Steely Dan's AJA is a soothing blend of rock and jazz infusion that come together to make somthing unmatched by any other album. One has to think what kind of geniuses were able to fit so much greatness into only the seven songs that are on AJA. Starting with "Black Cow", a song that could easily be mistaken as disco until Faegans relaxing soulful voice enters. "Deacon Blues" has some of the best song writing of any Steely Dan songs ever. "Peg" is a song about a famous girl, and it is just really fun. "Josie" is a song that can put you to sleep throught its relaxation yet get your toe tapping through it's beat at the same time. If you are ever wondering what one album from 1970's you should get, make sure it is Steely Dan's AJA.
