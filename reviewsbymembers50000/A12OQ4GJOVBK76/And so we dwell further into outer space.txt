 Well if Acrophobe isn't enough to take your senses and completely bewilder them, then this split with Armchair Martian should.  Once again Bad Astronaut (and Armchair Martian)perform wonderful material that bends rules and fits into no category. Fans of Lagwagon will like this, as will fans of Husker Du, who Armchair Martian is often compared with. Basically, as Acrophobe does, this short album takes you, mystifies you, and makes you feel really good inside. Lately these songs have been playing in my head and I don't care if they stay there forever.
