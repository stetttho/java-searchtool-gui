 POWERFUL POWERFUL POWERFUL!!!!!!Thats what I can say about Shutdown and  the masterpeice called "Somthing to Proove". It was so great to  listen to this after searching for a Hardcore band worth buying. 4 songs is  all it takes to blow you away. The best of these songs is "Dont Look  Back". If you are a fan of Snapcase you should defineitely infest 5  bucks into buying this EP.
