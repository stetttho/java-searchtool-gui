 With that out of the way I must say that I am very, very impressed with NORA's "Loser's Intuition" album. It combines the technical instrumentation of acts like Snapcase and Dillinger Escape Plan, but it doesn't place it on too hard, they let the melody shine through. With melodic hardcore becoming oh so popular with acts like Poison the Well (signed with Atlantic) and From Autumn to Ashes (great band, probably the next PTW) its good to find a melodic hardcore band, in this case NORA, that still lays down the CORE of it all, and it lays it down HARD.  As far as lyrics are concerned, I could care less what these guys sing about, just as long as they scream it to perfection like so. For a taste of the bands pure talent check out "Nobody Takes Pictures of the Drummer" and for a nice touch of their good melodic sense check out "Leadpipe Moment". This album definitely stands out in the over-crowded, and often redundant, hardcore marketplace.
