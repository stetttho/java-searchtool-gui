 I heard everybody say that Rust in Peace was the best Megadeth album, but I dont see why. First off I dont think this albumis anywhere near as good as  Countdown to Extinction. Hangar 18 is the only real good song on this  album. For one thing there is such a thing as over doing the guitar solos,  which is exactly what they do in this album . But its Megadeth, so i still  like it.
