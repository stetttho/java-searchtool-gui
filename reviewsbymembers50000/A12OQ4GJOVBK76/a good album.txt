 Look, I could sit here and make statement after bold statement about the death and commericialization of punk music, the poppiness and product placements of modern rock.  Without a doubt the All-American Rejects are a part of this.  They're videos feature them in all there pre-pubescant homo-erotic glory, they are currently on a cell-phone corporate sponsored tour, and the name of the band leaves little to the imagination as to what kind of band they are. However, this band stands out, and they stand out immensely. Among a crowd of Ataris, New Found Glories, and Saves the Days, this band never seems to me annoy me the same way the other bands do. Lets take a look at what they are offering that the others are not. 1.) Blatantly Pop -- this band makes no quomes about being poppy and they do it well. Not all pop is bad, (remember Hall & Oates), it just has become that way lately. 2.) Good Songs & Good Formula -- The aformentioned bands all seem to have a stagnancy to their songs, the content is similar, as is the structure, it's predictable and they all run together. NOT THE CASE with All American Rejects. Their bold blatancy as a pop band allows them to craft songs that are catchy as hell, overproduced in a decent manner, and each stand out as there own. 3.) The Last Song - Need I say more? Yes this album is pop, yes it might not last, but as far as the dismal playing field of a genre they are in is concerned, they are the best, BY FAR THE BEST. The best pop/rock since Joe Jackson.  Have fun and listen to Abraxas by Santana.
