 Here is my theory, in the summer of 1977 Elvis Presley died. His corpse remains in it's grave, however his soul went straight to Hell and returned to Earth in the demonic form on Glenn Danzig, lead singer and genius of The Misfits.  The Misfits Collection number 1 is a journey through horror, contraversary, and flat out original punk rock.  From the opening distorted crunch of "She" to the closing raw shock of "Wolfsblood", this collection is full of the violence and intellegence that is the Misfits.  This album is twenty jewels, some never heard until the release of this album in 1986.  Check out "Skulls", "Bullet", "Where Eagles Dare", and "Die, Die, Die my Darling". If you don't buy this and you are a fan of punk, make sure you are sane.
