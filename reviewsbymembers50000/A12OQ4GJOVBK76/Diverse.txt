 Most Indie record samplers showcase the way that most bands on that label are carbon copies of each other. The FBR sampler showcase several diverse genres in a half hour -- whether it be the The poppy alternative beat of The Impossibles, The cheery catchiness of The Stereo, the uncompramising attitude of Jersey, the metallic hardcore of Spitfire, the punk rocking punk rockingnous of Strike Anywhere, the funky beat of the Causeway, the pure straight-edge hardcore of Ensign, and of course, you cannot leave out the greatest band to hit the scene -- The Alkaline Trio, and there are many others, but it would take to long to list all the great bands feautured on the sampler.
