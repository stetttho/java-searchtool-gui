 "And Justice for All"  is no where near Metallicas best, but it has to be tough being the album in between two master pieces such as "Master of Puppets" and "The Black Album". One  dissapointing aspect of "And Justice for All" is that it has such  shoddy production. Jason Newsted's bass line is just about invisible, and  Hetfields voice is so loud compared to everything else that you dont hear  the hard hitting riffs of every other instrument. But on the pro-side, it  does start out incredibly powerful with the riff-happy   "Blackened", it pounds at your skull and just begs to be  headbanged to. Also there is "One" which is ten times better than  "Enter Sandman" and has a great solo. The album ends on another  powerful note with the anger filled "Dyers Eve" in which Hetfield  yells at his parents for their flaws. With all the good songs on  "...And Justice For All" its hard to believe that there are  better Metallica albums. I say start your collection with "The Black  Album" or "Master of Puppets"
