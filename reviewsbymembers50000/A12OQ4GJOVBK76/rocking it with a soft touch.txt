 Look, this is not punk, this is not emo, but why is that an insult? The kids today are really getting the wrong ideas about music, and wearing a Get Up Kids T-shirt doesn't make you mr. Underground punk rocker. The Get Up Kids are independent pop rock 'n' roll and they know how to right some catchy and touchy tunes, and I don't think any song will stick in your heads more than "I'm a Loner Dottie, A Rebel".... by the way all you cool kids, what movie is that from? HUH? Answer that.
