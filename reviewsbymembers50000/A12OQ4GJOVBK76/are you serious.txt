 nothing special here.  another boring artist that has fans that like music because of the image (that image being the one that supposedly doesn't have an image).  People that will enjoy  this most likely enjoy getting the same bobby dyed-black haircut that all there friends have, even though its completely original, right? Also, the electronics used in the background of this album are completely unoriginal and mundane.  This album can be summed up in two words: BOR ING
