 Lagwagon's "Hoss" was probably the easiest album to like. All  the songs are catchy and melodic. The sound of the music is a little bit of  pop, a little bit of hardcore, and a whole lot of punk. The best songs on  "Hoss" are "Violins" and "Name Dropping", and  then of course there is "Bro Independent", my new favorite song.  Whether you like pop-punk or hardcore, you should still by this album.
