 WOW! I just realized something, the whole 'insane depressed bipolar drug addict rockstar girl' schtick has been done all the way to the floor.  the music on this record is nothing great, trite guitar work, TERRIBLE AND MONOTONOUS drumming (does this guy even know how to play).  And the lead singer, well, lets just say I hope she ends up like Janis Joplin, and not in the musical sense either.
