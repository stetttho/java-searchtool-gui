 I cannot stand all these 'music fans' speaking in such high regard of these no-talent inbreeding rip-offs from Detroit.  Stop comparing them to Nirvana, because Nirvana happened once and will never happen again.  Instead of buying an album that sounds like a third rate compilation of Bob Dylan, Velvet Underground, Robert Johnson, and Zeppelin, why don't you actually buy those guys albums.  PEOPLE WAKE UP, STOP SUPP0RTING MUSIC THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN MADE. Meg is ugly. (and untalented too)
