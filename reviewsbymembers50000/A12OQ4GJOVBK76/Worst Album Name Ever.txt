 I've already stated my disgust for this Baptist Youth Group Jam Band in a previous review of anothe one of their waste's of recording time.  I am merely writing this review to state that "In Between Now & Then" is the lamest, most uninspired, unoriginal, trite, and meaningless album names ever.  I mean....EVERYTHING IS IN BETWEEN NOW AND THEN. Why not make an album called 'Red Means Stop, Green Means Go'.   P.S. - it's been used before as well P.P.S. - Brother Ali Rules
