 Turbonegro is the music equivalent of "Queer Eye for the Straight Guy".  What this means is that this band tries to be hip and cool by being gay.  Homosexuality is not a trend, and straight men should not listen to this music.  And what of the music, the same punk rock thats been hashed out from coast to coast for 20 years and still is crap.  Just because it's Norweigan doesn't make it better.  This isn't irony, this is stupidity.  "Oh dude! a haha, turbonegro pretend to be gay", so I don't care, Elton John actually is gay, and his music is ten times better (Elton John, as we all know, isn't that great either).  Man, punk is so dead.
