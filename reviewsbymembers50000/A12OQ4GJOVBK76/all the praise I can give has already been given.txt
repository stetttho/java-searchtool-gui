 It's already known that Hot Water Music is the greatest band in the universe. This album fits somewhere in between the mellowed raw attitude of 'Flight and A Crash' and the raw mellowed attitude of 'Forever and Counting'. "Turnstile" is definitely one of those good ol' fasion punk anthems wheras "Rock Singer" is along the lines of a straight forward emo pop song the likes of which you would hear on an old Jimmy Eat World cd. Basically this is without a doubt the best i have heard from HWM.
