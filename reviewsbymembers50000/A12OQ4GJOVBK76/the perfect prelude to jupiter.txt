 Cave-In's change in direction from grindcore to spaced out indie rock is documented in this 5 song collection. Track 1, 'Luminance' is closest to what the bands future direction would be as it is longer, the vocals are audible and it showcases slower tempo's and more experimentation. 'Sonata McGrath' and 'Sonata Brodsky' are both electro-fueled instrumentals that utilize a whoozy ambient influence as compliments to the album. The cover of Failure's 'Magnified' isn't comparable with old material yet still holds an edge over new material. Of course the real treat of "Creative Eclipses" is 'Burning Down the Billboards' which is an accoustic track that sounds like a cross between The Beatles circa '65 and the Velvet Underground. If you are a fan of "Jupiter" but don't want to wait for their major label debut, i reccomend seeking out this soon-to-be rare gem in the Cave-In discography.
