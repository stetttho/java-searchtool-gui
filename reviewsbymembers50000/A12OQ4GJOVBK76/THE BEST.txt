 What I mean by the title of this review, THE BEST, is just that, Punk in Drublic is the best. It is packed with 17 of the best Punk Songs to date.  Stand outs on this masterpeice are, "The Brews", a pro jewish  song, "Punk Guy" which is about a hardcore punk, and "Dont  Call Me White" which is pretty self explanitory. My personal favorite  is "Jeff Wears Birkenstocks" which is about hypocrites. But dont  think that there is a bad track on this album, there isnt, it is worth all  the money you pay for it.
