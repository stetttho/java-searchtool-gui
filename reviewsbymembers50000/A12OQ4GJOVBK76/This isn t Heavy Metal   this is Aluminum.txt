 I'd once heard Cradle of Filth referred to as the new Iron Maiden. I'd heard tales of how this Brittish band was going to punish us with their brand of brutal symphonic black/goth metal.  Another thing I'd heard was that Damnation & A Day was going to be a tremendous concept album.  Well guess what, none of that is true, and in fact, this band is quite the opposite of what everybody makes them out to be. First of all, if you are not haling from Norway, then do not attempt black metal; it was not meant for you.  Now that I've got that off my chest, let me say something about Dani Filth.  Heavy metal music is about balls, its about being brutal and to be a heavy metal singer you'd better have some pipes. I'm talking Jon Arch of Fates Warning, Dickinson, Belladonna, and Halford (no matter how into men Halford may be, the man can break glass and peel paint with his vox). Filth, on the other hand, sounds like a dying dog taking it's last breath. His singing style is similar to that of Patti and Selma of the Simpsons; he could very possibly have emphysima.  The songs are garbage, with guitar (key element of metal) tuned down so that Filth's vocals can be heard and more of those crappy keyboards.  Keyboards have really got to go in metal now, especially when they are utilized as terribly as they are by COF -- Soilwork and Dimmu can do it, countless other bands cannot.   Bottom line is this; Cradle of Filth is not a heavy metal band. They say nothing new and with songs like 'Manequin' they should be banned from being marketed. If you ever wanted to know what Brits who really wanted to be evil even though they live in the most girly country on the planet: well, Cradle of Filth is a fine example. And note to Dani Filth, you are really ugly.
