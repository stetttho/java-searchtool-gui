 If I could give this CD zero, or a negative amount, of stars, I would.  Of all the terrible bands to emerge in the past 40 years, and there are alot of them (Aerosmith, The Ataris,Coldplay) they rank among the worst of the worst.  If Poison was considered pop-rock 15 years ago, then The Starting line is flat out bubblegum.  The songs are all the same, same formulas, same themes.  No real instrumental talent can be found; and the catchy songs are forgettable.  Also, all these songs have pretty much been performed by countless other bands.  The lead singer is totally a word that rhymes with maggot.  And as for that one dude that sings back up vocals, well he's just dreamy, i mean, nevermind.  Look for this band to be on the Rock vs. Pop Reunion tour in 2023 with The Backstreet Boys and Warrant.
