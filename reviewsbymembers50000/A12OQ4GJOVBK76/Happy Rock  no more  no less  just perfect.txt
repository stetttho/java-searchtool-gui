 With Nintendoish keyboards opening it, 'Rock N Roll Part Three' begins as it becomes the anti-arena rock album of the new millenium. Dirty yet bold riffs, strong on the verge of hard rock drumming, whiny vocals, and the backbone keyboards make this an album you can both rock out and whistle to.  Forget any comparisons to a certain capitalist band that made one good record that was completely ignored, Ozma are happy-go-lucky dramakings and queens that write the poppy and catchy songs all underground music fans don't want to admit they've been waiting for. Not one song is bad, and they all sound different, a definite buy for the jaded rock fan.
