 Anthrax got famous with the 1987 release of theis thrash punk hardcore release. The song" Cought in A mosh " marks a milestone because it was Anthrax's first real hit. But the best songs on the album in my  opinion are the catch hit "Skeletons in the closet" because of  the loud screamin and amazing chorus and "Indians" because it  meant somthing wrather than just a headbanging song. This is a good album  if you want to hear what Anthrax is all about.
