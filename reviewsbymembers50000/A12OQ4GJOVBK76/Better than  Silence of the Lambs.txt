 It seems that everytime a new serial killer movie is released, they always compare it to "Silence of the Lambs". Well it is my belief that all serial killer flicks should have to go through another type of test,  they should all be compared to "Seven". "Seven" has got  to be the best written, most suspenseful, and most chilling serial killer,  no make that movie, of all time. Everytime you think you can predict what  will happen, BAM, you get hit with another twist. And they over do the  suspense. They don't make the villain some shocking unbelievable character,  it's the kind of person that would be a Real killer. So if your looking for  a real scary movie, than I strongly reccomend getting "Seven".
