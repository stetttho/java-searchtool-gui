 Hey toughguy, yeah thats right, you, mister rubber-burner.  This band isn't heavy. You don't even know what heavy is.  Read these lyrics. Is that Chris Carraba writing for this band. Oh, and this is supposedly hardcore? Buy 'I Against I', you idiot.  American heavy music is in a downfall. I miss PanterA. Those dudes had cahones.  Now this is what we get.  A bunch of untalented, unoriginal, high-school rejects playing mediocre (isn't that the name of the genre, medioCORE) music.  If you wanna hear what hardcore sounds like when its on the same record label as Dashboard Confessional and Saves the Day, well, here it is.  You don't even listen to Clutch, do you?
