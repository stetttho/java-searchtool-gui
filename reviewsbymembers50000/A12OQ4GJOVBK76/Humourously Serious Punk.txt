 Tired of listening to those punk bands who are only out there to spread some message about what they dont like? And at the same time that band just prooves that all they can do is talk in their songs, and have absoulutley no melody. Well not the Vandals. Vandals are a humourous punk band that are  serious about their music. "Hitler Bad, Vandals Good" probably  uses the most humour since the release of 1982's when in Rome do as the  Vandals do. The best songs are "Cafe 405" and "Ape  Drape", which is a hilarious tribute to the mullet. For serious music  listen to "Come Out Fighting", which is a tribute to the fallen  frontman of Pennywise. Get this CD and blow off all those punk bands  like Blink 182 and the Offspring.
