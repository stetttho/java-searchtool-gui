 That whenever people right positive reviews about these positively terrible bands they always mention something along the lines of: "This band is a perfect mix of Style A, Style B, Style C".  Go look through the reviews, you'll see what I'm talking about.  Wouldn't this just prove that all these bands (and the list of them appears endless) are just doing the exact same things. Doesn't every false-core band have a song called "Lipgloss and Letdown" or "The Beautiful Letdown" or something that would appear cool had it not been redundant or a redundancy. Truth is, you probably havn't noticed this, after all, you are lame enough to listen to this band.
