 I often wonder what horror movies would be like had "Night of the Living Dead" never been made. "Night of the Living Dead" paved the way for all movies containing scenes of horrific gore and  terrible spine tingling suspense. Since it was made in 1968, one should not  expect to see the gorey effects of a modern day slaher flick, but still,  you will not be dissapointed. Romero is a genius and this was the film that  introduced Romero to the world. The reason I gave this movie only 4 stars  is because it will never be anywhere as good as its sequel, "Dawn of  the Dead". Its very rare that a sequel is better than the original,  but keep in mind, this is Romero we are talking about, the man is a  underrated genius. So if you watch "Night of the Living Dead" you  will know that without it, we would never of seen "Scream" or any  thing else that tries to be scary.
