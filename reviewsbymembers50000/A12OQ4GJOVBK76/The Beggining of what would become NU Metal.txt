 You can try and try to prove that KoRn was the revolutionary band that changed metal, but that just proves to me that you havn't heard Sepultura- "Roots".  Even though KoRn put funk into the metal, you still don't get their influence as much as you do the influence of "Roots". "Roots" introduced the Ultra-melodic drumming that is heard in bands such as SpineShank and Slipknot. Not only that, but Max Calveras screaching roars are now heard in every band from Slipknot to Disturbed.  The title track "Roots Bloody Roots" is probably a summarization of this revolutionary album, and the 4th track "Rattamatta" is the heighth of their tribal experimentation.  The drumming, the down-tuned guitars, the roaring screach, more NU-metal bands benefitted from this album than any KoRn album.  "Roots" also helped Sepultura to break free from their thrash/death title and step into more of a hardcore realm.  It's to bad Max Calvera left after this album, not that Soulfly is bad, it just would of been great to see Sepultura put togeter another album like "Roots".  Fans of Slipknot, SpineShank, Nothingface, Disturbed. . . , you know what, if you like metal period, then why don't you own this album yet?!?!?!? Feel the influence.
