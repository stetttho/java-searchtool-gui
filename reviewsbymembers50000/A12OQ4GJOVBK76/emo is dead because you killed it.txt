 Juliana Theory is not a bad band. "Emotion is Dead", is, however, a horrible record that sounds as though it was targeted to pre-teen girls. I'm guessing that this was an attempt to get famous, which the band most likely regrets; because I recently read on the Tooth and Nail website that the band themself ARE NEVER GOING TO MAKE AN ALBUM LIKE THIS AGAIN. Again, they said that. Hopefully they will return to the days of "Understand this Is A Dream" on their next release.
