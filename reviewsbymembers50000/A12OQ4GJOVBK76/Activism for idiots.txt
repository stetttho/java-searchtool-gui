 Michael Moore is the left-wing equivalent of emo.  This is political activism that appeals to punk-rock kids who wear shirts saying "Bush is an Idiot". I'll admit I enjoyed "Bowling For Columbine" and "Roger and Me", but Moore is only revolting against the tip of a very stagnant ice-burg.  Not only that, he is diverting attention from the real issue. The real issue is this: Bush is in partnership with the illuminati and the globalist. 9-11, the war, Oklahoma are all plots that have been in work for years to bring forth the new world order. Gun control is a very detrimental thing.  The people must be armed in the event that the government becomes overly tyranical; we must learn to stop cowering in fear, and Michael Moore must be a pretty good fighter if he is willing to revolt without munitions.
