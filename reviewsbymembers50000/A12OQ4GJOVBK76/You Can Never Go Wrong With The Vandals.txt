 If you have heard "Live Fast Diahreah" and "Hitler Bad, Vandals Good", but never "The Quickening", be prepared to not like it as much, AT FIRST. But then you begin to get "Its A Fact" stuck in your head on the way to school; and at your cousins wedding you begin humming the melody of "Marry Me"; and every time you see a Muslim, you can't help but shout out "Allah", and lets not forget other hits like "Canine Youthenasia" and "Taste Like Chicken". And next time that bimbo in class talks to you, you'll just remember "But Then She Spoke".
