 I may be "out of line" here but to be truthful I'm not all that concerned.  Those of us that have read "Fight Club," and especially those of us that love "Fight Club" have one thing in  common, we often feel like those men mentioned in "Fight Club."    The book deals with underground boxing matches that lead the participants,  mainly a group of disgruntled and unsatisfied young men, into a life of  servitude at the hands of an insane, yet strangely sensible, character  named Tyler Durden. Now don't get me wrong, I don't advocate the methods of  attention that the book mentions, but there is definitely something  grabbing and satisfying about the way these characters deal with an  increasingly commercialistic and selfish society.  I don't think there's a  person out there who doesn't from time to time wonder if we would be better  off if credit cards had never been invented or mass media was less  concerned with the sensational. "Fight Club" is about more than a  group of militant crusaders out to change the world, it's a parable if you  will, something to be read and discussed and deciphered how you see fit.   Yes, some who read it could say it's nothing more than a tale of men gone  bad, but there's also those of us that see an appropriateness in the  characters increasing desperation at the loss of their individuality to  corporations and brand names. Don't miss this book.  It has some important  things to teach and it does an amazingly effective and entertaining job at  doing just that.  It's a definite must have.
