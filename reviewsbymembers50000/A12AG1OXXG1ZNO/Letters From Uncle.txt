 "The Screwtape Letters" is one of the more bizzare and popular books in C.S. Lewis' long list of literary accomplishments, but for those of you who don't know the book's premise, it's a simple one.  A demon  experienced in the art of temptation who calls himself Screwtape  corresponds with his up and coming nephew, an apprentice minion named  Wormwood. If this sounds a bit strange to some of you folks, rest  assured, it is.  But don't give up just yet.  Lewis puts together a quick  and witty story of the fragile human will and the devils who seek to  destroy us.  He mentions temptations of sex, of vanity, of money, and pride  to name just a few. The book also gives insight into the motivation of  hell's corruptors.   Fear.   A simple and effective tool used by who  the reader naturally assumes is Lucifer(he's mentioned by Screwtape as  "Our Father" and there's reference to the conflict between him  and God a.k.a "The Enemy")as an encouragement or motivation for  each demon to work.  There are no failures of corruption allowed.  Ever.    I guess the best way to describe this book would be as a "tap on  your moral shoulder." Lewis believes that the world is destroying  itself(there's no coincidence in the book's print timing-during the second  World War)and that a slip in conscience warrants the blame.  He goes out of  his way to warn readers against selfish and superficial acts, and expertly  weaves in an entertaining collection of narratives along the way.
