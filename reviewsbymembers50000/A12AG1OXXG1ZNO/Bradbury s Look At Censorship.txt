 Guy Montag is an ordinary fireman, if you consider a book burning, flame-thrower wielding zealot to be just that. Ray Bradbury(author of The Martian Chronicles and Something Wicked This Way Comes)tells the story of a  society so frightened by its own intellectual and creative potential that  "book learning" becomes a criminal offense. Montag, along with  his equally ambitious coworkers, burns the home of any man or woman  unfortunate enough to be hiding printed literature.  But when one woman  refuses to leave her home and then stoicly burns beside her collection of  books, Montag dares to wonder if all books are so dangerous as the  government has trained him to believe. Of course, I can't forget to  mention Clarisse, a young woman who seems interested in helping Montag  decide for himself whether or not his line of work is justified or  foolishly cruel. Fahrenheit 451 is about censorship and the lengths that  a future government might go to to restrict the public's ability to access  past knowledge.  Orwell's 1984 was a slightly better example of this kind  of story, but that doesn't take away from the satisfaction of Mr.  Bradbury's finely written classic.  The book's pace becomes incredibly  exciting as Montag learns of his mistakes and decides to go against the  common will.  The fugitive chase and scholarly transients who keep passages  of important texts in their memories(the Bible seems a popular choice of  Bradbury)is a near perfect final touch. Go ahead, read this book.  It has  a lot to say about an important and complex subject and easily keeps your  attention throughout.
