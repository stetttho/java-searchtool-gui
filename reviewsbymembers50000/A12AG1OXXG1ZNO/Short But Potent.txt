 Like many of you that have already read this book and like the many of you who right now are searching high and low for a copy will eventually need to do, I scoured the countryside(alright, just library shelves)before I found  this modern classic. "The Stepford Wives," short though it may  be, is still one of my favorite books.  It's a genuinely creepy story  written with a feminist touch that you can't help but appreciate.  It deals  with a young couple who move to the small town of Stepford and hope to  become part of its social scene.  But when the protagonist's husband  suddenly becomes involved with an exclusive and secretive men's club who  seek to control their wives in a fashion more sinister than any reader  could anticipate, she begins to fear for their safety.   Through time, the  term "Stepford Wife" has become a pop culture reference, and  deservedly so.  I'll let you have the satisfaction of finding out why.
