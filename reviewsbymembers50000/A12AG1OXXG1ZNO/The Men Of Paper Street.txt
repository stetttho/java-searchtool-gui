 David Fincher's Fight Club didn't exactly make a big name for itself upon its initial release last year(its box office gross was a mere 36 million dollars), but as nearly every Hollywood Exec. knows, video changes  everything. It saddens me a little to think that this film was so easily  overlooked by the people who now rush to rent, buy, and review it,  but(pardon the cliche)better late than never. Fight Club is a brutal and  dirty film(no, not in a sexual sense, but in its grainy stock and the  unhygenic characters who love nothing more than to befoul any corporatized  or mainstream institution)that lends the viewer a feeling of empathy for  the struggling men of Fight Club and their search for individuality in a  society more concerned with brand names and fashion labels.  I couldn't  help but laugh when Tyler and The Narrator(Yes, I know what you're  thinking, but let's not spoil the end for those who haven't seen the film  or read the book)lured a large number of diarrheic pigeons to a rooftop  near a BMW dealership with bird feed, or when an unnamed character placed a  "new and improved" version of an airline's safety and evacuation  guidelines in all of the plane's seatbacks.  I think most of us smile at  things like this because we all realize just how dumb "yes men"  think we are and its nice to see them squirm once in awhile.  Who hasn't,  at one time or another, wanted to shake the people around them and wake  them up to some sad truth.  It's a fact: Corporations think we're stupid.   Tyler knows this.  And it pisses him off. Fincher does an excellent job of  keeping to the heart of the book and each actor, not a single exception,  does an incredible job of fleshing out their character's dramatic and  humorous potential. This is one of the truly good films of the Nineties.  I  have yet to meet a person, man or woman, who thinks differently. Run ,if  need be, to your local video store. Better yet, just buy it.  You'll be  glad you did.
