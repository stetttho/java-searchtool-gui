 William Golding does a wonderful job of keeping this complex story at a reading level accessible to all respective age levels, although parents might want to think twice about letting more SENSITIVE children read the  book.  I say this because there are a number of scenes involving bloody  fights or deaths and less experienced readers might find them disturbing.  Overall, the book is great.  It's a story of a small group of children  marooned on a tropical island then forced to fend for themselves in its  wild environment.  As most of you probably know, a type of mutiny ensues,  and the small band of miserable castaways breaks into two groups, one  calling themselves "the hunters" led by a rugged and violent  young man named Jack who thinks the most pressing responsibility he has as  leader is to procure meat for his crew, and the smaller, nameless group led  by the book's youthful father figure Ralph, who believes keeping a lighted  signal fire atop a nearby mountain the most important island duty. The book  flows nicely and keeps the reader's attention.  It's a bit of a cautionary  tale much like Orwell's "1984" or Huxley's "Brave New  World."  The morals of the story are easily learned and hard to  forget, but I'll let you figure them out on your own. If you're looking for  something engaging to read, you won't go wrong buying this.
