 Please don't think me arrogant, but I've always thought of myself as a rather capable reviewer of the modern novel.  I've read just about every kind of book I can think of(Orwell to Hemingway-London to Stevenson-King to  Koontz- and yes, even those trashy little pulp novels with stories of  witches and heroes)and have enjoyed in some manner or another almost every  one. But, fellow readers, if I was forced to choose a single book, just one  to promote to those people eager to turn pages, it would be George Orwell's  classic story of Oceania. "1984" From its first paragraphs to the  final four words, this book grabs the reader's attention and just refuses  to let go. Orwell's story deals with a man named Winston, an employee at  Oceania's Ministry of Truth, who is responsible for the almost daily  altering and destruction of historical documents and photographs in an  effort to serve the political interests of a group known simply as  "the Party." With such activities as "Hate Week" and  public slogans like "War is Peace Freedom is Slavery Ignorance is  Strength" the forementioned party keeps to its philosophy of  Totalitarianism with a firm and painful grip.  And I won't forget to  mention the leader of it all, a pseudo-religious figure named Big Brother  who never fails to rid Oceania of its more troublesome citizens with the  help of the infamous "Thought Police," an elite and cruel  gestapo-like police force charged with the task of making those citizens of  Oceania brave or foolish enough to speak ill of "the Party's"  policies or even look unsatisfied at home(their is human as well as  mechanical surveillance everywhere)disappear in a discrete and timely  manner. "1984" seems more like a hint, a prediction if you will,  of a future disturbingly possible(it was written in 1949).  The book moves  at a quick pace and even the most casual reader would have little trouble  with the language. Don't miss this one folks. It's definitely worth the  time.
