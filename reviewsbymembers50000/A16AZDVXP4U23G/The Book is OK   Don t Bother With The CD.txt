 I used this book as a primary study guide for 70-240 and passed. This book gives excellent coverage of Active Directory and Win2K Server, but it tails off disappointingly on Networking and Win2K Pro. I'd suggest using the Win2K Pro Exam Cram as a supplement as well as the MS Win2K Core Networking Guide (or read the Win2K Networking sections in TechNet if you have access to the TechNet CD). The exam that I took focused very heavily on Group Policy Objects, Active Directory maintenance, AD backup and recovery, DNS, DHCP, and Win2K installation methods(RIS, sysprep, unattended network installations, etc). Learn this stuff in great detail! The exam on the companion CD is worthless -- don't waste your time with it. It does not question at the depth and scope required to pass 70-240 and it is full of errors. There is no substitute for Transcender. Get the "Core Four" and don't try to memorize the answers -- instead read and understand the explanations for the questions that you miss or are unsure of. It is equally important to understand that you need hands-on experience with both the Server and Pro products so, if at all possible, set up a home lab with two computers on a network (using a simple 5 port hub). Install the evaluation copies of Win2K Server and Win2K Pro, set up an mini AD domain and play around with DHCP, Terminal Server, DNS, etc. About 50% of the test questions that I encountered were scenario-based so hands on experience with the system is a must!
