 I will have to agree with some of the other reviewers that this book finesses a bit on number theory and some of the other mathematical fundamentals of cryptography. I am not dissapointed by this, however. After all the title of the book is "Applied Cryptography." Schneier gives the reader a lot for his/her money. The books is well written and an easy (considering the subject matter) and interesting read as well. "Applied Cryptography" covers a lot of territory - you get the basics of cryptographic theory, detailed treatment of many of the most commonly implemented cryptographic algorithms and protocols (including their potential weaknesses), and lots of source code. If you want to know the sordid details about number theory or pseudo random numbers, there are plenty of books in print that go into great (and often laborious) detail on these subjects. The title says it all -- this is an excellent book on applied cryptography!
