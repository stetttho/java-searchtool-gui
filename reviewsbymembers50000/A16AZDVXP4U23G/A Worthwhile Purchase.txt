 I am an NT systems developer, but I was recently tasked with writing a shared library to support a Unix server side application. After looking through the the huge and hyper-expensive "Advanced Programming in the  Unix Environment" (not a bad book, but it says nothing about shared  libs), I picked this book in desperation. After looking at a few chapters,  I was able to get pretty much what I needed, so it definitely saved my day.  I'd have to say that it paid for itself.
