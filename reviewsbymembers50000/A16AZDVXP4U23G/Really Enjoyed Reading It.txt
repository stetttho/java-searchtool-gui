 There is no other way to put it -- this is an excellent book. Not only does Mr. Smith give us a detailed analysis of the major authentication protocols that are used in today's IT environment, but he also points out the relative strengths and weaknesses for each protocol. This is really important stuff to know -- all too often the marketing hype for systems such as PKI, biometrics, Kerberos, strong passwords, etc would lead one to believe that each of these solutions offers a bullet-proof approach to authentication security. It isn't to say that any of the protocols covered in this book are inadequate, but it is important to understand how each of them can be subverted so that one can intelligently weigh the risks of compromise before implementing a specific protocol. Add to that that this is a really enjoyable book to read -- that makes it worth the purchase price and the time to read it.
