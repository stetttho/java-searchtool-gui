 Anyone involved in Windows NT/2000 security development would benefit from adding this book to their library. Brown definitely does an excellent job of explaining one of the more difficult aspects of Windows NT/2000 development -- in fact, I'd say that his treatment of ACLs, security descriptors, desktops, window stations and access tokens is among the best that I have read. The only reason that I don't rate this book with 5 stars is that it does not include anything on the LSA APIs. These are some of the more intimidating APIs that a security developer will ever tangle with, but they are essential for such handy little tasks as joining workstations to domains, creating and/or modifying user or group machine rights, or coding replacement GINA dlls. You can find some pretty decent refrences to these APIs (as well as some decent code examples) on msdn dot microsoft dot com, but you have to hunt for them. Having the LSA included in a handy reference such as this book would definitely make it worthy of a five star rating!
