 How you tend to rate a book often depends on what you are looking to get out of it. For my purposes, this book leans a bit too much toward the high-level end of the spectrum. For example, the discussions on how viruses and anti-virus software solutions work is presented from the 10000 foot level. Much of the content seems to focus on the management/policy making end of the problem space rather than the technical point of view. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but as a techie, it just wasn't what I was after.  Oddly enough, the author rates Roger Grimes' Mailicious Mobile Code as a mediocre to poor reference on the subject of computer malware. Even though Grimes' book is Microsoft-centric, I consider it a far better reference from a technical standpoint.
