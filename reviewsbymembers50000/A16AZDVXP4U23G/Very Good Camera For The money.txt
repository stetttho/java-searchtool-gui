 I bought one and I love it! The image quality that this little jewel produces is awesome. This one is fitted with a Nikkor 28-85 mm equivalent zoom lens and like all Nikkor lenses, it's sharp as a tack. The color saturation is fantastic and it takes great black and white shots as well (if you really want to have some fun get an infra red filter play around with it a bit). And it is absolutely fantastic with macro shots!!! As far as the image quality with the built-in flash (seems to be a gripe that some have expressed), I seem to get acceptable results if I set the white balance for flash photography; however, I've never seen a camera (digital or 35 mm) that has a built in flash unit worth raving about. For the best results, I'd suggest a good dedicated flash with a swivel head to support bounce flash. This camera will accept just about any Nikon flash unit. I haven't found the filter adapter to be much of an issue (with the exception of setting a polarizing filter). However, setting a polarizing filter is a pain on any rangefinder camera. The shutter release delay is a digital camera thing -- I work around it by depressing the shutter release half way in anticipation of the shot, then gently sqeezing a shot off at the right moment. The response is instantaneous. You just have to change some of the habits you learned from using 35mm. As far as the LCD in bright sunlight -- that is also a digital camera thing. You can buy a third party shroud that helps with this (or make your own). This brings me to several of my "nits" about the camera. The viewfinder is too small, and it you tend to get more in the image than you see through the viewfinder. This can mess up your composition in a quick shot. The power zoom is a bit slow, and I'd like a bit more zoom at the telephoto end of the focal range. But overall, I think the CoolPix 5000 is an excellent value. You just can't argue with the quality of the images that this little camera produces.
