 I have never used the Exam Cram series books as a single source to prepare for any certification exam. I believe that their intent is to provide a good final review of the subject matter in preparation for an exam -- sort of like the old Cliff Notes that we used to buy in college. Coupled with the PrepLogic exam on the CD (you would do well to purchase the complete set of questions), it is an adequate preparation tool. The only criticism that I can offer is that the material in the book (as well as the PrepLogic practice exams) tends to err on the easy side. I found myself scoring consistently in the low 90's on the first take of each practice exam, whereas I passed the actual test with a score of 828. The Security+ exam is not an overly difficult test, but it is not a pushover either. If you use this book as it was intended to be used, it will probably help you. If you use it as your sole source of study, you will probably be disappointed with the outcome.
