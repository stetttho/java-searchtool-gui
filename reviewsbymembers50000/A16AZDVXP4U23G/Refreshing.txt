 For years I have believed that Biblical literalists have failed to get the true message of Christ. That is, that God is to be found within ourselves and that the true meaning of Christian love embodies unconditional tolerance for diversity (as in the parable of the Good Samaratan), and the revelation of God to others through the example of how one lives his/her life -- not through proselytization and judgemental dogma. Fundamental Christianity has always frightened me a bit. To assert that one must conform to the tribal beliefs of a given church to be worthy of the grace of God is only a breath away from stating that if one differs from those beliefs, then one is not worthy of life. History has shown us time and again the tragic outcome of this mentality, and sadly we humans seem bent on repeating it. This book does not answer all qustions concerning the nature of God. It cannot because God is internal to all of us, and because of our diversity, each one of us will experience God in different ways. Therefore, each of us has a personal responsibility for getting in touch with the spirit of God that graces every living being and allowing it to guide us in the realization of our fullest potential as unique instruments of God's peace. This is something that is a lifetime effort. It is not realizable through the spoon-feeding (or force-feeding) of creedal dogma from those external organizations or individuals that have annointed themselves as proxies to God.   If you read this book, and then re-read the books of the New Testament, I have no doubt you will definitely see the teachings of Christ in a new and refreshing light!
