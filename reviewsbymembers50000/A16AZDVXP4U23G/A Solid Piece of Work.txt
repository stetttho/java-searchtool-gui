 I was called on by my company to develop a servlet application that uses jndi to interface an LDAP database. While I had done done previous work with servlets, I had no experience with jndi. Buying this book definitely  paid off -- the chapter on jndi helped immensely and the chapters on  servlets provide the information that is required for most servlet  implementations (if you need to know all the sordid details about servlets,  buy one of the books that specializes in servlet development). This book  worked for me -- I'd definitely recommend it.
