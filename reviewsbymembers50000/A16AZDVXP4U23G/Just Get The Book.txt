 I read both the book (MCSE Win2K Accelerated Test Guide, Shinder, et al)in this set and the Coriolis Exam Prep book and felt that this book was overall the better of the two. The coverage of AD was good as was the coverage of Win2K Server. Win2K installation (RIS, sysprep, unattended installation, etc) was covered quite well and the coverage on Win2K Pro was OK -- could have had a bit better detail on regional settings and accessibility options, though. Overall, the coverage on Win2K Networking was above par, but I felt that the book finessed a bit on DNS. If you are reasonably strong on your Windows NT 4.0 knowledge, this book along with the Transcender "Core Four" will probably be enough get you through 70-240. It wouldn't hurt to dig a bit more deeply into some of the networking stuff (particularly DNS) in Technet, though, if you have access to the Technet CD. Don't waste your time on the test question booklet or the sample exam on the CD. These just don't test at a level that will be required to pass 70-240. For self-evaluation, Transcender is the way to go. Study the book and take the Transcender exams. Don't try to memorize the answers, but study the explanations on the test items that you miss or are uncertain of. Then go back and review the items in the book. If your employer has not yet migrated to Win2K, I'd advise setting up a lab at home using at least two networked computers with the Evaluation copies of Win2K Server and Win2K Pro. This book has many useful lab exercises and you will gain a lot from working through as many of them as possible. Bear in mind that the book assumes that the reader has a solid handle on NT4. If you don't have this, then you will probably not benefit from this material (and you probably won't pass 70-240). I'd definitely rate the book at a solid 4 stars, but the other material in the boxed set falls way short. Just buy the book...
