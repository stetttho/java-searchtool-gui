 If you are new to TS/Metaframe, but you have a solid handle on Windows NT/2000, this will be an easy and informative read for you. While you will already have a solid grounding in file system an regsitry security, system and group policy, user groups, performance tuning, and system configuration, Thin Client Solutions is full of detailed information on how to apply your NT/Win2K savvy in these areas to the TS environment. Mathers covers both the TS and Citrix products in detail. You'll get coverage on everything ranging from the differences between the two products, to installation, licensing, optimization, security, and application integration. And don't forget, the appendixes are also chock full of useful stuff such as a TS/Metaframe command reference, file system security configuration scripts, registry security configuration scripts, and more. A word of caution, however. If you don't know Windows NT/2000, you'll probably be lost -- Mathers assumes that you are on a pretty solid footing with the Windows environment. If not, you'll need to bring your Windows NT/2k skills up to speed before this book will be of benefit you.
