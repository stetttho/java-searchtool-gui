 At over 1300 pages, this is one hefty book! If your goal is to just pass the NT exams, you could probably do just fine with the Exam Cram books and the Transcender tests (unless you literally don't know squat about  NT);however, if your goal is to learn the material, this book is full of  useful information and, as far as I can tell, has few errors (if any). If  your objective is to be something more than a "paper" MCSE, this  is a worthwhile book to own.
