 Quite honestly, I believe that the material covered in Hacking Win2K Exposed should be covered in the MCSE 70-220 exam -- but it isn't. These guys not only cover all the tricks of the Black-Hat society, ranging from screening and enumeration to password cracking to privilege escalation exploits, but they also give the reader important information on how to implement countermeasures against these attacks. Out of the box, Win2K will do a better job of protecting the OS than NT -- for example, the default domain group policy settings will prevent user enumeration, even though they permit null sessions (stand-alone systems, by contrast, are just as vulnerable to enumeration as NT 4.0). However, by default, the system is just as vulnerable to to attacks against legacy LM based password hashes as was NT -- this book explains how to avoid this while still maintaining compatibility with legacy consumer Windows products. And the named pipe impersonation privilege escalation exploit was one that I had not heard about. SP2 fixes it, but it's definitely something that you need to be aware of. This book is a treasure trove of security-critical information for Win2K administrators. You will learn how to apply group policy to effectively lock down your Win2K systems against many of the attacks commonly used against Win2K. You'll get links to all kinds of freeware ranging from hacking tools to intrusion detection software so that you can assess the security of your own Win2K network. You'll learn about the vulnerabilities of IIS, SQL Server, and Terminal Server as well as how you can deploy these services securely. This is real-world stuff. You just can't learn it by studying for 70-220. Hacking Win2K Exposed is probably the one book that I'd try to grab off the shelf if my library were on fire.
