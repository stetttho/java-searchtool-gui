 This is not a particularly difficult test. After reading this book, I took the Boson practice exams and then took the real test. I finished in 20 minutes with a score of 90%. This book has everything that you need to pass exam 218 -- it is complete and accurate as well as easy to read and understand. I doubt that I really even needed to take the time with the Boson tests, but if you want more experience with answering test questions, it is probably worth the extra [money] to get them.
