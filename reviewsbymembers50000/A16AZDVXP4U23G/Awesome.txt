 Everything that you ever wanted to know about AD but were afraid to ask! This book really gets down to the "nuts and bolts" level of Active Directory, yet it is surprisingly easy to read. The authors make even the more arcane topics of replication, kerberos authentication, and PKI easy to understand while still covering the subject matter at a depth and scope that even the most avid geek will appreciate. It is not all theory, however. The book is full of practical information that will prove highly useful to IT professionals in both large and small enterprise settings (the stuff on DNS was some of the best I have read anywhere). Worth every penny!
