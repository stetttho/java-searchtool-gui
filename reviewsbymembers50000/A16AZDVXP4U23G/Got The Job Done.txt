 I used this book as my primary study reference and passed. Overall, I found this study guide useful, accurate, and reasonably complete, although the answers to the questions at the end of each chapter were incomplete. As always, it helps to combine practice exams with study material. The practice exams on the CD were OK, although I thought the Boson tests were better. If you are going after your Solaris 8 certs, it'll get the job done.
