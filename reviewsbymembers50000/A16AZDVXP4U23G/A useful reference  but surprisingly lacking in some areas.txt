 Overall, this book provides the reader with a good reference to the basic Win32 API's, and I use it frequently in my work. The sample code is good overall, although I have found a few examples that are in error. The  biggest disapointment, however, is that the book completely omits a  reference section for the Windows messages -- something that was included  in the old Windows 3.1 API Bible and should have been in this one as well.
