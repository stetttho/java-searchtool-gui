 I've never, ever, in all my life read anything like this book. And I've read everything. Most of these "I saw heaven" books are weird and poorly written. This book, on the other hand, is in a class all its own. I find Sister Rountree's account to be credible and written with a keen matter-of-fact style. Sister Anna graciously spares us from religious cliche and Bible catch phrases. Instead, she's direct and unapologetic, adding very little personal interjection. She kindly tells us what she saw and experienced and lets us have it as close to first hand as possible without actually being there ourselves. This masterpiece left me numb for days--literally. There's so much in here to digest. I read it straight through in one day. I'm about to read it for the second time. I'm sure I'll read it a few more times, too. Folks, there's nothing out there in the same neighborhood as this book. If there is, please email me!
