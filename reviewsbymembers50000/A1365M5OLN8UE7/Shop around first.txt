 This printing of the NKJV is good for one, and only 9one, reason--the margins. But there are a good number of other bad points that one might consider before buying. Thick pages make this a very thick Bible, thicker than most study Bibles. This wouldn't be a problem if it prevented markers and highlighters from bleeding, but it doesn't. They bleed just as easily as thin-paged Bibles. So the thick pages offer nothing. The font is printed fairly blurry and inconsistantly fromn page to page. And also, the words of Christ are not in red. For the same price, there are many other Bibles out there made better. But if you've shopped around and are sure this is the one for you, then by all means, have at it.
