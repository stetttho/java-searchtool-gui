 Next to an exaustive Strong's Concordance, Vine's is the most important stody tool in my arsenal. Actually, I consider the two to be one unit, as the Vine's is keyed to Stong's reference numbers; an excellent study system. The price is a bit steep but considering the value it's had in my Bible studies over the years, I'd gladly pay more. It's a must have for all Bible studiers.
