 This ain't no plastic thing offered by Jack LaLane or that other fellow with those big, white bushy eyebrows. This is a top of the line juicer at one heck of a price. It's built like a tank; much of it is solid stainless steel. And those parts which are plastic are heavy, thick plastic, nothing flimsy. In addition, it looks very nice sitting on my kitchen counter. The stainless housing looks very stylish. I can only think of two gripes, minor ones. First, it is VERY loud. I realize most juicers are, but this one screams like a bat out of hell. Second, it gets awfully warm and will heat up your cold fruit juice before you can drink it. I've solved this problem by adding a few ice cubes to the cup first. Other than that, I'm quite happy with this juicer.
