 With the introduction of SoL and many accompanying features introduced to the game, we're now seeing the end of the game as we know it. EverQuest II is due to be released at the end of '03 and there's no doubt that Sony will want everyone to switch over. But why? Weren't we all happy with EQ I? Yes, but they'll apparently be able to make more money off EQII. And so, they've got to compromise this edition of the game in many crucial ways so as to ensure we'll all make the conversion. The first way was to introduce the KEI spell. Now, anyone with this cast on themselves can dramatically increase the amount of killing they can do, thus level much, much faster. As a result, high level characters aren't as meaningful as they once were.  And now with PoK, traveling the world with a level one character is entirely doable. In the old days you had to walk or hitch a ride off a Druid or Wizz. This forced you to learn the land--the ins and outs--for youself. It also taught you to get to know people and learn to interact with those that were in a position to help you. The world was much larger in they way players percieved it. Now there's no sense of vastness to the lands at all. Erudin is as easy to get to as Ak'Anon. Just hit a PoK book and off you go. EQ has created a number of ridiculous expansions but this one takes the cake. I'm still an avid EQ fan, and I'm sure I'll be first in line to try EQII but I see what's happening and I don't like it.
