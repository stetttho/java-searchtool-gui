 Dr. Atkins, who recently passed away, was without question the pioneer of the low-carb diet. His work showed us conclusively that it wasn't the fat persey but the carbs in our food that were causing so many of us to retain weight, keeping us from losing it without great difficulty. Since then, the big dilema has been how does one come off carbs if they've been so dependant upon them for years. Many found Dr. Atkins' methods to restrictive and unreasonable. His princepals were good, but his methods needed work. Many have offered their own plans and diets based on Dr. Atkins' research. Most notably was "Sugar Busters," but even celebrities like Suzzanne Summers offered their own versions of the Atkins diet. I think Dr. Agatston's 'The South Beach Diet' has gotten it right. Yes, the first two weeks will be tough but overall the plan is easy and it works! If you're already familiar with the Atkins plan but can't seem to get it working for you, here's the diet book for you! If you've never studied the Atkins plan but would like to, this book will be a great start.
