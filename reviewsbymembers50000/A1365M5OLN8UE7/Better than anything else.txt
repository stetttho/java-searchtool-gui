 If you're using "Van Halen I" as the benchmark, you may be slightly displeased with this album. However, if you compare it to anything else of its time, it stands out head and shoulders above the rest. It's understandable that it would be overshadowed by its predecessor "VH1" as it was clearly one of the best rock albums ever. Some say that a band's first release is its best and then its downhill from there. Not true for Van Halen. VH2 particularly may not have measured up to some people's standards but one mustn't forget "Fair Warning," the band's 5th album, definately an unforgettable record; and then "1984,"-- number 6 --their largest success with Dave. And don't forget all the Sammy-era albums! (...but let's just forget Van Halen III ever happened...) VH2 tucks nicely into the bands history of album making.
