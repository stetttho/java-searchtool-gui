 I just recieved my copy today. Although my copy will recieve lots of use, it's a true collector's item--plenty of well-done maps, a very good concordance, a very nice dictionary, and useful center-colum references. Construction is absolutely flawless. The calfskin is wonderfully textured, the paper is quality, and the printing--I read another review that with a notable complaint--my copy is printed dark and sharply. Even the box it came in is nifty and worth keeping. **I have one, and only one complaint, the words of Jesus are NOT red. Granted, the item was not described as such, but in my mind, it's a given that a Bible at this price would. I am a 100% satisfied buyer. (Psst...it's got the Apocrypha!)
