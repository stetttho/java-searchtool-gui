 (I own 0785205462.) If you read my other reviews of Bibles, you'll see I'm a stickler when it comes to various printing and Bible construction methods. I'm not the biggest fan of Thomas Nelson because they always seem to have trouble printing up their Bibles with an even ink color from page to page. This one is no exception, but I'm very pleased by it being available in the New Living Translation. The Open Bible overall is very good. But if you're interested in investing in only one study Bible, I strongly suggest Thomas Nelson's "Nelson Study Bible." I'm happy to have this one in my library. [addition] Almost forgot; another great plus is there's a very good dictionary in this Study Bible. The great this is they've placed it before, not after, the Bible. I really like this idea because now Genisis, Exodus, etc. have a nice buffer between themselves and the front cover. This will greatly reduce the wear to the front books of the bible because your opening Genisis 1/4 into the book! Well, I think it's great. Cheers!
