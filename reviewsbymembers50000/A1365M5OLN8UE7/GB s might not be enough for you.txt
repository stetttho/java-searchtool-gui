 I absolutely love my iPod. I mean LOVE it! I use it everyday approximately 7 - 10 hours a week, and I've had it for months. It sounds great. It's small. It's awsome. Many other good reviews have already been writtien about the iPod's features and supposed bad points. I'd love to refute some complaints I've read, but I'm going to limit my review to whitch amount of GB's is needed for this unit. I own the 20GB. It was the biggest I was aware of when I decided to buy an iPod. Let me assure you--it's more than enough memory. I have mp3's on the thing that have been on there since the day I bought it. I have yet to exaust its capacity yet. In my mind, the 10GB would have been an adequate amount, while 30GB is excessive and unnecessary. 20GB is plenty, folks. The only way I could see 30GB being absolutely necessary is if you're absolutely sure you need 30GB. I admit, if I were buying my iPod again, I would go for 30GB; that's just my nature. But it's completely unnecessary. 20GB is a dream. 5GB leaves you wanting. Enjoy!
