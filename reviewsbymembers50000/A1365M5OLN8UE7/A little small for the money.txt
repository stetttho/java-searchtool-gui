 We just got this a few days ago. I had a globe as a kid, so perhaps my criticism is based on my comparisson to it. Note: the globe itself is not 12 inches. It's 12 inches from its base to the very top. I just think it could've been bigger. Had the globe itself been 12", I'd probably be more happy with it. I'd still recommend it, however, as I assume it's not posssible to get anything bgetter in this price range whitch is plenty for a globe.
