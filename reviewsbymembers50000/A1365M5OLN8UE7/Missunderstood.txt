 This is obviously the first VH album featuring Sammy Hagar as lead singer. It was noticably different from all previous albums. Most attribute this jarring shift in the bands sound to Sammy, but it really wwasn't his doing. Listen again--it's actually Eddie that changed so drastically. There are only 9 songs; 3 are synth-driven. Of the remaining 6, only 2 are heavy guitar songs, and even those aren't the heavy-handed style we've come to adore Ed for so much. Ed obviously made a decision to depart from his signature sound for the sake of branching out, I suppose. But it's poor Sammy that gets blamed for it. Overall, 5150 is a fantastic album, and contrary to what another reviewer wrote, it has aged beautifully. "Love Walks In," "Dreams," "5150," "Summer Nights," "Best of Both..." And the list goes on. In and of itself, it's a wonderful album, a classic. But when held up to the Dave-era standard, it will never satisfy the die-hard old VH fan.
