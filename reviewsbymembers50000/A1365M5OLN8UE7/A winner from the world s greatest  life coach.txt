 I think Tony Robbins is brilliant. He's simple and very logical in everything I've ever read or heard by him. When I hear of what some of his critics say, I have to wonder if they've ever even read his books. There's nothing spooky here, folks. Most everything he teaches is a "no brainer"--things you can't believe you wouldn't think of on your own. More than anything else, Tony reveals the obvious, things we were probably too busy or wrapped up in our daily lives to see on our own, hence the term "life coach." "Unlimited" is a classic, probably the most important book written on personal life strategies. (This or "Awaken the Giant Within.) It this book, we are introduced to Anthony Robbins, whom I consider to be the worlds leading authority on self improvement and motivation. He's straight forward and balanced to the utmost. No mind manipulation or emotional hype here, folks. Tony isn't a spooky guru. He's not a cult leader. He's simply a man who has studied and successfully practiced self improvement to the degree that he has become a master in the feild. Get this book. You'll be glad you did!  10 stars if I could!
