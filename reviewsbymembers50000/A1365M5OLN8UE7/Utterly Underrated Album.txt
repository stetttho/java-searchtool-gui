 Extreme II: Pornograffitti was released at an akward time in music. Guns N' Roses was at their pinacle, and it was their success that spurned the 80's hair spray band revolt that culminated with Nirvana's rise to power and "Heavy-Metal" being replaced with Grunge.  Extreme was a band caught in the cross-fire of this cultural revolution. They were drastically better musicians that most everyone that came out in the 80's yet they were still too closely related to that passing sound to survive in the 90's.  Nuno Bettoncourt's guitar work on this album is breath taking. Gary Cherone's (3rd and now former lead singer for the mighty Van Halen) intelligent, yet poppy lyrics and fantastic singing style are equally impressive.  EVERY SONG on this album is superb. There's no filler here, folks! Truly one of the best, and least respected bands and albums.
