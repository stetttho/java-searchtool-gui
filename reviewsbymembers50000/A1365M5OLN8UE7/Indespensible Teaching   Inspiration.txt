 What an awsome addition this work has made to my personal library. Although it makes a marvelous reference for topical Bible study, I found it equally as rewarding reading it straight through. My one complaint is that it didn't have nearly enough biographical material for my taste (only 15 out of nearly 1000 pages). Otherwise, this compilation is priceless.  Liardon recieved the support and assistance of many members of the Lake family. Lake's Grandson, John G. Lake III wrote the forward to this book.
