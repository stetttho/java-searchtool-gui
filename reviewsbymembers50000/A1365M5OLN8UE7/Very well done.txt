 This study Bible is actually the new and improved version of the now discontinued "Open Study Bible." Therefore, my review will be in two parts--the first for those that already own the "Open," and the second for everyone else. The "Nelson" doesn't have much more than the "Open." The main differences are in layout and extra colorized feature pages. Also, I happen to prefer the "Open" with its dictionary at the beginning of the book, as it makes a nice buffer between Genesis and the cover. It greatly reduces wear in the spine in the first couple of books. The full color pages in the "Nelson" that I just mentioned make thumbing through the Bible a little difficult, as your page flipping becomes hindered by passing a glossy thick page every fow hundred pages. They just make the book overall open and lay awkwardly. The "Open's" layout is simpler and better, I think, and leaves much more Bible text per page. It's not cluttered with hundred of magazine-article like topic headings. In short, it's not worth the money to switch to the Nelson. Now, if you have neither, I suppose the best idea is to get a "Nelson." For one, the "Open" is discontinued, so I guess you'd have no other choice in most cases, depending on which edition you're interested in, although there are still a few "Opens" for sale on Amazon. Overall, the "Nelson" is very full and informing. It makes a great secondary Bible, and if you don't mind many pages containing only a few paragraphs of Bible text, a great primary Bible. Doctrinally, the "Nelson" is fairly middle of the road. Pretty much any Christian would find this Bible usefull and non-threatening to their personal beliefs. Of all of the major study Bibles, the Nelson is quite the best choice for anyone.
