 All the RioVolts in the SP line (90, 100, 250) are great. I have the 100. It's anti-skip is wondefully good. I almost never am able to get mine to skip, especially when playing mp3's. It's built well, has a great shape for holding in your hand, and sounds great, too. I really don't see the purpose in getting the 250 unless you're absolutely sure the stations you'd be listening to will come in clear on it. You'd likely be better off buying a seperate little radio that would deffinately get better reception and cost you 1/4 of the price difference between the 90 and the 250. And the fact that the 250 is firmware upgradable and the 90 is not is not a big deal either; my 100 is upgradable, too, but it was fine before I upgraded it! In any case, any of these RioVolts will make you happy to own one.
