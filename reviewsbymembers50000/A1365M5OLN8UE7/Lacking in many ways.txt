 I have the utmost respect and admiration for Pastor Benny Hinn. But I must admit how disappointed I've been with his past few books. This one is no exception. It's obviously ghostwritten to a large degree. My guess is nearly 80% is qhostwritten, and that not even terribly good writing to boot. I expected much more from this particular book, as I'm well aware of the influence Ms. Kuhlman's had on him. Unfortunately, this book is quite a disappointment and I'd have to suggest that one pass on it if they're considering buying it.
