 Madame Jeanne Guyon's guide to prayer is by far the most imortant book on the subject I've ever read. I could never recommend a more useful guide to prayer. The book is short and sweet--to the point. And although it can be read in a single sitting, you'll definately want to slow down to digest each page. In fact, that's precisely what Madame Guyon recomnmends of her readers. She teaches one of the most significant principles of prayer: felloship with God through meditating on portions of His word (the Bible). She recommends sitting down in a quiet place with your Bible and reading it slowly and carefully. And when you happen upon a particularly moving passage, slow down and dwell on that passage in a prayerful, meditative fashion. And there is so much more here, too. Too much to mention in a brief review.  It's enough to say that this classic is an irreplaceable guide. Anyone will be made better at prayer by this book. It's definately one of those books one will return to year after year, ever refreshing their spirits with the simplicity of Madame Guyon's methods of prayer.
