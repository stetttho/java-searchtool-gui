 I'm not sure the issure here is wheather or not (the original) VH1 is a good album. It's without question among the most important albums in Rock history. Instead, this remastered version of what I used to listen to on 33 LP and eventually cassette, is a revelation of just how far beyond their time Van Halen was. Especially Edward. His original rig was little more than a 15 year old Marshall Amp and a few foot pedals bolted to a piece of ply wood. Yet, his sound is still as fresh today as it was 25 years ago when they debuted. Listening to this new CD, especially with headphones, is a real treat. You can actually hear the clicks and pings of his tape-driven delay machine, the Ecoplex. Dave's Appachee war cries are awsome and Alex's drum work is magnificent. And guess what? YOU CAN FINALLY HEAR MIKE'S BASS!
