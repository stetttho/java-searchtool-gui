 All I want to do is burn CD's. I want to burn mp3's. I want to burn audio CD's. I want to burn my favorite software. I want to burn anything of value to archive and back-up. Nero makes all of this easy. I just select the particular kind of CD I'm going to burn and then it shows me my hard drive, after which I select whatever files I want to burn. There's a disk space meter at the bottom of the program window. It's especially helpful when burning mp3's. It's quite easy to go over the limit when adding files to burn, and Nero will show exactly how much space your disk will have, or how much space you need to free up if you've added too many. Adding files is as easy as clicking and dragging. One window is your harddrive, the other window is the files selected for burning. I suppose there are more complicated, feature-rich programs out there but Nero is everything I need to burn my CD's easily, quickly, and painlessly. I got my copy free with my CD burner, but I'd gladly buy it if I needed to. It's worth every penny.
