 If you have the computing power, SoL is a very nice addition. However, it's not enough to say to those whose PC's aren't up to par, "UPGRADE OR DON'T BUY IT," as SoL has greatly compromised the quality of old-world gameplay, without SoL, on systems that are otherwise in good shape. Before SoL, I had 128MB of RAM and a TNT2 32MB Graphics Card on a PentIII 550 computer. After SoL went live, I found many of the old world zones to be way too laggy for me and I on occasion crashed in-game. The thought of expanding to SoL was unthinkable. I went ahead and added 256MB RAM and a new GeForce2 64MB Graphics Card. I'm able to run SoL now and the old world--even retextured--zones run great. I certainly enjoy giving my characters a face lift, too. But the land of Luclin? Forget it! Verant has lots of work to do. It's a laggy mess up there. We all know Verant ca$hed in on this one. I'm upset with the way they went about it, but I still love playing EQ and will continue to do so. Overall, 3 2/3 stars.
