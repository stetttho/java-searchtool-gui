 I purchased ISBN:0195283600. This particular edition differs a bit from other reviews I've read--no portraits, etc. It's an Oxford, so if it were possible for me to have gotten an NRSV with the Apocrypha in genuine black leather from someone else, I'd have done it gladly. Oxford generally cuts corners in the Bible-making process. Because it will be a secondary Bible for me, I'm not terribly peeved about Jesus' words NOT being red, there being no concordance, and there being no dictionary of any kind. The leather is nice but a bit stiff. The spine, however, is sewn and very flexable--a major plus for a long-lasting Bible. I like the fairly handy size very much. Bibles are gennerally made way too big. The paper is very quality and the font selection and paragraph-style page layout is very nice as well. Reguarding the translation itself: I'm particularly pleased with the traslating of the Old Testament and Apocrypha, well done and very readable. I'm not at all offended with the gender-inclusive rendering with certain passages, as footnotes mark each diversion from the originals. When I began reading the Bible, I started with an original Living paraphrase because the KJV was just too much for me. I soon learned that the translation was so terribly compromised for readability, I was missing out on a lot of important meaning. The NRSV is a fantastic balance between readability and  accuracy, if you ask me. Thinking of giving a Bible to new believer or someone just starting to study it? Give them an NRSV!  If you're considering this particular printing for your main Bible, I'd suggest shopping around first. But overall, I'm satisfied.
