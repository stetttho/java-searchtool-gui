 I owned another HP printer before this one, a DeskJet. For its time it was top-of-the-line. But it was a complete piece of junk. It was loud and shook alot and made big cracking noises. I was glad to be ridding myself of that old, over-priced thing, but wasn't too fast to buy another HP. In fact, as I shopped around, I avoided HP's, as I assumed I'd find something better from another company. I was wrong. I set out to find a printer that just printed things. I didn't need to print posters--or billboards for that matter--I just wanted to print essays and what not, fast, quietly and inexpensively. The HP LaserJet1000 fulfilled all of these requirements for a fantastic price. No, it doesn't print in color. But I never used color anyway! If you need a very good printer to do all your standard, basic printing, here's the printer for you!
