 I've been a Photoshop user since version 2.0, I believe. At least 5 years of using this program have given me so many hours of enjoyment, education, and thousands of great graphics which I've used for everything from pamphlets, web pages, t-shirts, buisness cards, book jacket sleeves, and touching up family photos. 7.0 specifically is simply the best version of Photoshop yet. Heck, I was happy with 2.0! So you can imagine how elated I am with 7.0. ImageReady is a great feature. It kind of a scaled down Photoshop. I especially like it when I need to do a "quickie"--a quick fix, or touch up, when I don't need to load up all of Photoshop. Photoshop's place in graphical art is unequalled by any other program in any other feild. Nothing even comes close to Photoshop.
