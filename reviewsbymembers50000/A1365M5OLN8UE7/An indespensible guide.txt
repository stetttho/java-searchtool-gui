 I'm not Jewish. I'm actually a Spirit-filled Christian. My branch of the Church tends to emphisize prayer, personal devotion, and intimacy with God. As a devout student of the Bible, I've always looked to the ancient Jewish Prophets and Mystics to learn how to grow closer to God. Years ago I came to the conclusion that deep spiritual meditation was at the center of their spiritual lives, yet I was not terribly familiar with what their meditations might have been like. The fear of being "new-agey" kept me from experimenting on my own and so I spent a great deal of time searching out the Bible for hints of what the people of Bible times did in meditation. I really didn't get much clarity on the matter until I read this book. Kaplan graciously spares his readers from spooky, impractical tecniques and gives intelligent, balanced explanations of the various forms of meditation that more than likely were employed by the greats in Scripture. This book is an indespensible part of my spiritual library now. I will never be without it. Give someone you love this book; you'll be giving them a gift that will last forever.
