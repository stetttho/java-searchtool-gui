 I like Bono, too, but it matters little what endorsement Bono gives Dake's material, as it stands on its own. In my opinion, Finis Jennings Dake is the finest Spirit-filled, Faith-oriented theologian/Bible teacher of the 20th century. Although many have set out to undermine the reputation of this dear saint of God and giant of the faith, they can't shut him up; his writings live on, the most prominent of which is "God's Plan For Man." It's all here--1000 pages of the most concise, balanced, and profound doctrine concerning everything from the pre-adamic world to the return of Christ. There are also hundreds of pages of teaching on the basic "how-to's" of everyday Christian life--how to pray, what promises are available to the Christian today, the baptism in the Holy Spirit, a step by step exposition of the Lor's prayer, holiness, faith, putting complete trust in the word of God, miracles, deamons, angels, and everything else--EVERYTHING! There are a few teachings that many will be troubled by, but I implore you to read such teachings in the context of Dake's overall view of man and his relationship to the spiritworld, God, angels, deamons, etc. Dake rightly contends that the beings of the spiritual world (angels, demons, and even God Himself) are as real and physical as we are, sighting a limitless number of scriptures to support his teachings. And that is a point I can't stress enough: Dake profusely refers the reader to the Bible. My guess is he has cited tens of thousands of scriptures. I have yet to read a single claim made by Dake that is not generously supported with scripture. Although most would use this work topically, I stronly suggest one sit down and read it all the way through. It will take a while, but it will surely be the most rewarding extended Bible study you've ever embarked on. "God's Paln For Man" is a must for every Spirit-filled believer! P.S. Get the Dake study Bible, too!
