 I absolutely love my iPod. I mean LOVE it! I use it everyday approximately 7 - 10 hours a week, and I've had it for months. It sounds great. It's small. It's awsome. Many other good reviews have already been writtien about the iPod's features and supposed bad points. I'd love to refute some complaints I've read, but I'm going to limit my review to whitch amount of MB's is needed for this unit. I own the 20GB. Let me assure you--it's a great deal of memory. I have mp3's on the thing that have been on there since the day I bought it. I have yet to exaust its capacity. In my mind, the 10GB is probably a better choice in that i have yet to exaust 20. I, therefore, would have to guess 30GB is excessive and unnecessary. 20GB is plenty, folks. The only way I could see 30GB being absolutely necessary is if you want to use none of your PC's hard drive for any mp3's whatsoever. But that just isn't practical. Usually the way it works is you have 20-40GB on your hard drive and once you've compiled and organized a full collection of an artist or a playlist you'd like to have on the iPod, you then load it onto it. I admit, if I were buying my iPod again, I would go for the 20 GB, or even the 30GB--that's just my nature. But it's completely unnecessary. 20GB is a dream. 10GB is just enough. 5GB would leave you wanting. Enjoy!
