 I was introduced to "Sound and Fury," and Faulkner for that matter in college. I was wholly unprepared as an average American videophile for reading on this level. Without notes I would've never made it through. But now that I've got this one under my belt, I'm infinately better for it. It truly expanded my reading capacity. I'm also better for having experienced Faulkner's story telling. The dialogue -- Benjy! -- is so very well done. I always considered Twain to be the premier Southern American novelist, but now I'd argue for Faulkner.  To date, I've read this novel three times and have also read two others of Faulkner's. If you're new to Faulkner, begin here. "Sound and Fury" is a cake walk compared to "Absalom, Absalom." But once you tackle "Sound" you'll be more than able to go after anything else of Faulkner's. And you most certainly will!
