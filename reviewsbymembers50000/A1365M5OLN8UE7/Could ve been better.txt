 If you're a full-bore VH fan like me, you already have all the hits included in this collection. Therefore, the only reason you'd need this CD, other than for collector's purposes, is to get the new tracks recorded with Dave and maybe for the "Human's Being" track that was recorded for "Twister," that awful tornado movie. I, like most, see Edward Van Halen as being the primary force behind the band's success. But my gripe is the order in which the songs were placed on the CD. Of course "Eruption" should've been included, but first? Perhaps "Ain't Talkin..." or "Unchained" would've been more appropriate. I also think that there were other guitar solos that could've been included, too; "Cathedral," "Spanish Fly," etc. I'd definately recommend this CD for a VH newbie, as I think it's a fair representation of the hit side of the band's appeal. There is the other, more musically significant side of their importance, however. They were and still are one of the hardest, fastest, and greatest Hard-Rock bands ever! By the way, Van Halen can still level any of those young rap/rock whoopersnappers out there!
