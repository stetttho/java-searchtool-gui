 I think Tony Robbins is brilliant. He's simple and very logical in everything I've ever read or heard by him. When I hear of what some of his critics say, I have to wonder if they've ever even read his books. There's nothing spooky here, folks. Most everything he teaches is a "no brainer"--things you can't believe you wouldn't think of on your own. More than anything else, Tony reveals the obvious, things we were probably too busy or wrapped up in our daily lives to see on our own, hence the term "life coach." "Awaken" was a fabulous follow-up to "Unlimited Power." I was pleasantly surprised to see that Tony didn't simply piggy back on the success of his 1st best seller by simply pumping out another book of lesser usefulnees and quality. On the contrary, Tony did a fantastic job with this one. It's packed with useful information and suggestions. In my opinion, it's a better book than "Awaken" but not by much, as "Awaken" is a priceless book in its own right. 10 stars if I could!
