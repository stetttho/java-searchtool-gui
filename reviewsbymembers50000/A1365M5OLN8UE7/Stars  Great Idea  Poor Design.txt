 Look at the photo carefully. See the tub up on top where the water goes? It's not attached permanently. It just kind of wobbles up there with a small gasket around the hole in the bottom where the water is fed into the motor. In other words, if you were to remove or bump the tub while it has water in it, it will spill over everything. Also, you can't leave any water in it and place the mouth piece in its holder or set it on your counter for a moment, as it begins to slowly drain water if it's not held higher than the level of the water--a syphoning effect occours. The tube that extends from the unit to the mouthpiece is cheap and way too short (hardly 3 feet) and it's so strongly coiled it ends up hardly being able to reach 2 feet. The motor is very loud and sounds like an old rusty boat motor and shakes itself around my counter. (I learned setting it on a towell helps to immobilize it, and quiet it a bit, which is good because I'll also have a towell ready in case I bump into the tub.) Why then do I use it? Well, because it actually works! Once I mastered the art of using this half-baked contraption, I found my mouth, teeth, and gums are cleaner than ever. The stream of water it puts out is very powerfull and "Piks" up where brushing and flossing leave off. I'd gladly buy a better brand if one existed, but to my knowledge, WaterPik are the only ones making such a machine. I think that explains why WaterPik has cut so many corners making this thing--no competition! No one else wants to make them.
