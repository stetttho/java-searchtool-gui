 If you live west of the Mississippi, so to speak, this clock would be an awsome thing to have. But I live in Boca Raton, FL and it syncs itself to an AM station in Colorado. It cannot recieve the signal in the room which I'd like to have it. I had to take it onto the poch for it to be able to sync. Basically, without the automatic sync feature it's just a really expensive digital clock.
