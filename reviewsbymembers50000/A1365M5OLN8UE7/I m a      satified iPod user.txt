 I absolutely love my iPod. I mean LOVE it! It sounds great. It's small. It's awsome. Many other good reviews have already been writtien about the iPod's features and supposed bad points. I'd love to refute some complaints I've read, but I'm going to limit my review to my personal experience with this unit. I'm a stickler with everything. I'm never happy, especially when it comes to electronic gadgets. If I buy a camera, the next thing you know something better and cheaper comes out the moment I buy mine. I always end up wishing whatever gadget I've purchased could do this or that, or was better at doing such and such. And before you know it, another piece of crapola ends up in my kitchen's junk drawer. Not so with my iPod! I have been using mine for nearly 6 months, 6 days a week, 3 to 4 hours a day. I still have yet to be disappointed with anything this unit does. It goes everywhere with me, and I have all kinds of uses for it. I play it in my car to and from work, I excersize with it, and I listen to it at night while I'm in bed. The best part aboout it is, I have nearly every mp3 I regularly listen to occupying less than 10GB's, with an additional 10GB's free and ready for anything new I might wanna throw on it. This is one of the few purchases I've made in a long, long time that I've remained satisfied with longafter the fact. It was worth every penny to me, and I hope it will be for you, too. Enjoy!
