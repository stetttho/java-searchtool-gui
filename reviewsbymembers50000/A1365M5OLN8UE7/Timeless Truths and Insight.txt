 (I own ISBN#1566192978) Of course, most of us Amazon.com visitors do not command an army. And most of us will never be involved in war. But this timeless writing is one of the greatest revelations of human nature, both to understand the individual as well as organizing people in numbers. I can see that many, many others have discovered "The Art of War," but whenever I pick it up and breeze through a few pages, I feel as though I'm reading secret information that only I am privy to. No one I know has even heard of this book, yet here I am, able to tap the resources of this work and have an advantage over everyone I come in contact with. I'd say everyone needs a copy in their library.
