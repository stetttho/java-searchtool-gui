 (I purchased ISBN:019528335X) Overall, I'm quite pleased with this printing. I'm very happy to finally have an RSV with the Apocrypha. The annotations and section/book introductions are great. It also includes a VERY well-done intro to the Apocrypha. The binding is sewn and flexible--a big plus. The paper is quality and the paragraph-style page layout is great. I have a few peeves, however. The genuine leather is acceptable but a bit stiff, I'd say. Jesus' words are NOT red, granted it wasn't advertised as such. Oxford has very oddly placed all of the Apocrypha and it's indroductory notes at the very end of the book, past the end notes that proceed Revelation. They just kind of slapped the Apocryphal section between the extra blank note pages and the maps. Why they didn't place it between the Old and New Testaments is a mystery to me but that's Oxford for ya! Well, as long as it's got the Apocrypha and all those great notes, I'm happy.
