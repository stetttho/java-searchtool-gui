 I just purchased the 92-capacity wallet. It's very roomy and built tough. I'm sure it'll last me forever. My gripe with it is in the fact that you can't open it and lay it flat. It will not stay open on its own, making putting in or taking out CD's a pain. You have to hold it open with one hand while trying to figit with the CD sleaves with the other. Overall, it's tough and will protect your CD's nicely, but you might want to shop around first.
