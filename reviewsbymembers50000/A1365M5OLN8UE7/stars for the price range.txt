 I purchased this player in Feb of 2003. All I wanted was to play DvD's. That's it. Nothing else. And that is exactly what I got in this player, and much more. The fact that it plays CD-R/W's and CD's and MP3's (contrary to another review, THIS PLAYER DOES NOT PLAY .MPEGS or .AVI's!) is a delightful bonus, and one I expect to take full advantage of. Overall, I'm happy with this player for the price. But there are a few minor complaints worth mentioning. The remote is feature rich, however its layout stinks; the buttons are oddly placed. It is very slow to load a DvD or CD and be ready for play. And here's a legitimate bad point: it can not be powered up with the remote; you can only operate the standby feature from the remote; you must hit the on/off switch on the unit itself. And also, the power button is so stiff I have to hold the unit down to push the button, otherwise I'd push the unit clear off my TV. Other than that I'm quite happy. 5 stars!
