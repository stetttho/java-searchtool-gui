 It does what it's supposed to do and does it for a reasonable price. The last car charger I had felt cheap and hollow and wouldn't stay put in my lighter. This one seems to be a fairly well-built one. I have 2 vehicles with a few VERY oddly situated lighters. This adapter has no problem in either, and for that I'm elated. 5 stars!
