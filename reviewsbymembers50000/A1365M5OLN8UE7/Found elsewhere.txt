 If you're just looking for a light sample of Brother Lake's messages, this is the book for you. However, if you'd like something more substantial, I highly recommend "John G. Lake: The Complete Collection of His Life Teachings" by Roberts Liardon (Compiler). For little more than what you'll pay for this, you can get a 1000+ page volume of nearly everything ever transcribed for or written by Brother Lake. This book is a classic, however, it's touched so many, long before Liardon compiled his volume, and I prefer to have a copy in my library. You will, too.
