 I just bought one and what a great little TV it is. It's very well made and its reception is wonderful. The screen is a bit grainy, even when on a station that comes in clearly, but still very viewable. The single speaker on top sounds very good and is capable of very high volume; I usually have my volume set at around 3 which is plenty loud. I'm able to get stations from other cities easily, and even a few stations that are too far away to get a perfect reception, the sound generally comes in clearly enough to listen to comfortably. And when I'm tuning my way through static, the sound of it is very diminished and not as annoying as one might expect. I really like the tuning line that appears on the screen; it makes tuning in stations a sinch. Add a quality set of walkman-like headphones and you'll be set. The only downside I can think of is probably comon to all handhelds like this: it's a battery hog! My solution is quite simple, I use rechargable batteries which last about 3 hours, whereas normal batteries will probably get you 5 hours. I highly recommend this TV!
