 I absolutely love my iPod. I mean LOVE it! I use it everyday approximately 7 - 10 hours a week, and I've had it for months. It sounds great. It's small. It's awsome. Many other good reviews have already been writtien about the iPod's features and supposed bad points. I'd love to refute some complaints I've read, but I'm going to limit my review to whitch amount of MB's is needed for this unit. I own the 20MB. Let me assure you--it's more than enough memory. I have mp3's on the thing that have been on there since the day I bought it. I have yet to exaust its capacity yet. In my mind, the 10MB is just a tad too little while 30MB is excessive and unnecessary. 20MB is plenty, folks. The only way I could see 30MB being absolutely necessary is if you want to use none of your PC's hard drive for any mp3's whatsoever. But that just isn't practical. Usually the way it works is you have 20-40MB on your hard drive and once you've compiled and organized a full collection of an artist or a playlist you'd like to have on the iPod, you then load it onto it. I admit, if I were buying my iPod again, I would go for 30MB; that's just my nature. But it's completely unnecessary. 20MB is a dream. 10MB leaves you wanting. Enjoy!
