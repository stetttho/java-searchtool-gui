 This is a perfect little radio. The reception is very good (much better than a few headphone/radio setup's I've owned), and it is very well made. It's solid and tough. And it's smaller than a pack of cigarettes. There are only 2 downsides I can think of: 1. It doesn't have a digital tuner. This can be a major problem with this radio if you're a profuse channel changer. Dialing in your stations is a bit tricky as the slightest adjustment to the tuning dial will send it across many channels. But if you're like me (I pretty much stay on one channel all the time), you'll find this radio to be perfect for you! 2. The headphones stink. They do the job, but the radio is actually much better sounding than the headphones allow you to appreciate. It takes only one AA battery and it will last a VERY long time. A set of two AA's will last you dozens of hours. I recommend this radio highly.
