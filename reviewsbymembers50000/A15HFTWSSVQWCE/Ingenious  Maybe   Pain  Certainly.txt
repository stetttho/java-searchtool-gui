 Perhaps it is not fair of me to review a book that I didn't finish, but I bought the book on the basis of other reviews read here.   The concept of a person born with out the capacity to feel physical pain is an intriguing  one indeed.  Unfortunately, it is the reader that really suffers the pain  of this book.  The first 20 or so pages were so stuffed with descriptions  of autopsy, blood lettings and other painful and disgusting practices that  I finally had to put the book down in revulsion.  I still cringe thinking  about it.  Perhaps there is an audience that would enjoy reading this book,  I however, am not among them.
