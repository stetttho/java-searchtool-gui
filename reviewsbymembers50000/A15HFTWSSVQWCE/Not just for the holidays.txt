 Marcy Goldman's A Treasury of Jewish Holiday Baking is a good addition to any cookbook library regardless of religion or ethnic background.  Her introductory notes contain a wealth of information that proved useful to  me, although I would consider myself a seasoned baker.  I also enjoyed her  anecdotes about her family and their holidays and baking experiences.  The  information she includes about where to purchase specialty or hard to find  ingredients and baking items finally pointed me in the direction of a  certain honey dish I have been searching for for years. The book is  organized according by holiday according to the Jewish calendar including a  brief description of each holiday as an introduction.  Every section  includes both recipes for the novice as well as more difficult and  complicated ones.  Some of her directions may prove too ambiguous for a  novice baker (just how sticky is a sticky batter meant to be?) and I found  I had to add more flour than was called for in her Mandelbroit recipe; but  overall this is a very good general baking book.
