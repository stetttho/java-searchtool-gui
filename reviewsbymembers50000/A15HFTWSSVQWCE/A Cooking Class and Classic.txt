 As a child I enjoyed watching Julia Child on TV and as I read From Julia Child's Kitchen it's in her own voice that I am hearing her words.  The text is so clearly written that anyone, at any cookling ability level can easily follow her instructions.  The pictures were a bit disappointing being small, older and all black and white, but besides that the book is a  gem.  If you are looking for just a collection of recipes - look elsewhere  - but if you want a course in master cookery from a master chef  - this is the book for you!
