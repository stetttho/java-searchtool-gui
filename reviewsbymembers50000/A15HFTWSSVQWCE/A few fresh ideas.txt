 Mindy Ganz Ribner's book is definitely geared to first time cooks, so much so that her writing style often feels condescending.  She begins her book with a primer for setting up the kosher kitchen.  Her tips and suggestions  are both clear and helpful.  She includes lists of cooking equipment and  suggests which ones are needed for which areas of kosher cooking (meat,  dairy or parve [neutral]).  This introduction makes this book a good gift  item for a young bride or a beginning cook with no on-hands knowledge of  the laws of keeping kosher. This is a big book, with over 400 pages and  300 recipes.  The recipes are for the most part original and easy to  follow.  It is her cutesy writing style and habit of giving nick names to  so many of her recipes that I found to be a turn off.  A few of the cookie  recipes I tried were flops and I found the cakes to be more fussy than the  end result called for.   Overall this is an okay book but not the best of  the lot.
