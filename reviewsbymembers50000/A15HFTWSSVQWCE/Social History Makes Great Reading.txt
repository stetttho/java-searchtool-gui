 I ordered this book because the price made it attractive, I have hardly put it down since it arrived.  For anyone interested in the social history of the 20th century, anyone interested in the history of the rise of  women's consciousness or anyone who likes to peek into other women's lives  - this book makes great reading.  Through women's own voices you get a  sense of how attitudes and beliefs towards things like integration,  premarital sex, working mothers and many other social issues changed over  the course of the 20th century.  I find this book both educational and  enjoyable reading. The authors, a mother and daughter team, take a step  back and allow the women themselves to tell the story of a century.  The  editing and writing is seamless and the book flows beautifully.  I highly  recommend this book.
