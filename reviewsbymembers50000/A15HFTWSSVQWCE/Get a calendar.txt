 I am a cookbook collector, and I specialize in Jewish/Kosher cookbooks (I have over 60 in that category alone) and I must admit this is a beautiful cookbook, really more a coffee table book than anything else. There are gorgeous photos of ancient Judaica and interesting bits of history on almost every page and many of the recipes are tempting.   BUT... although the book is organized by season, beginning with Autumn and the Jewish New Year, the holidays are listed in the wrong order! Chanuka is listed as the Winter holiday and then we immediately jump to Spring and Passover, followed by Purim which is also included in the spring section.  Hello?!  How hard is it to go to your local Kosher butcher and get a Jewish calendar? Or look on the internet?  Presumably there was at least one Jewish person on the editorial staff who would have known whom to ask. Purim falls in Adar which coincides with February and/or March - clearly still winter in the Northern Hemisphere.  Purim is followed by Passover which is THE spring holiday followed seven weeks later by Shavuout (which translates as Weeks in Hebrew, because of those sevens weeks).   Hadassah places Purim between Passover and Shavuout! This major error continues to be so much of a turn off to me that the book sits on my shelf gathering dust and causing aggrevation whenever I think of it.
