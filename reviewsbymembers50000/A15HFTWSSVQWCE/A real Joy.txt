 Sharon Tyler Herbst's Joy of Cookies has just about everything that I look for in a cookbook.  The introduction gives a brief history of the cookie and then a detailed description of cookie baking basics, equipment,  ingredients, techniques, all accompanied by simple yet clear line drawings.   The recipe section itself is organized according to cookie type: bar  cookies, drop cookies, etc.  The recipes, complete with country of origin  and the cookie's name in that language are clear and easy to follow.  The  book is full of full page color photographs that are clearly labeled.  The  book is an odd shape and gives the impression that a previous edition may  have been larger overall, but that doesn't take away from the book's  usefulness.  This would make a fine present for a budding baker.
