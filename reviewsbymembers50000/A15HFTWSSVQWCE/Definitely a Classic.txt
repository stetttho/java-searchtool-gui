 Whenever I am invited into a home I have to peek at the cookbook collection, the way some guests peek in the medicine chest.   I have found Sara Finkel's book in many, many homes and I have yet to find a copy that  isn't well used, stained and dog eared. One friend recently went out and  bought a second copy so she could keep it separate for Passover. I think  this just about says it all.  There are certainly recipes in this book that  didn't appeal to me, but even those I have been told are big hits.  Her  meat recipes tend to the sweet (she uses grape jam in one roast recipe,  Coca Cola in another) which is not to my taste, but her chicken and turkey  recipes are all winners and her cookies and cakes are unsurpassed.   Most  of my friends started out borrowing from one or another, or copying recipes  out longhand, but one by one we all broke down and bought our own copy.  No  one I know has been sorry.  I strongly recommend this cookbook to anyone,  Kosher or not, who is interested in having a repetoire of good, easy,  surefire recipes to make at home.
