 Although I had an already vast collection of Kosher cookbooks I was thrilled to add this one to my library.  The Garden of Eating was obviously written as a fundraiser for Yeshiva Degel HaTorah in Monsey, but it far  surpasses anything I've ever seen of that genre.  In addition to all the  traditional recipes one would expect to find (gefilte fish, kugels, soup,  etc.) there are many new and innovative recipes that reflect today's newer  eating styles.  Many use whole grains, vegetarian ingredients (including  Tofu!) and contain much less fat and sugars than the more staid versions of  the same dishes.  With the exception of the dessert section, all recipes  have nutritional information as well.  There are creative ideas for  children's parties, Shaloch Manos (Purim Gift Baskets) and enertaining that  I found both interesting and helpful. This book would make a welcome  addition to any cook's book shelf, from the novice to the true balabuste  (capable homemaker).
