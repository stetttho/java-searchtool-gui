 As a wheelchair user, I use my muscles differently than the able bodied person so an exercise book geared for the able bodied is usually not useful to me.  I found this book to be very helpful, with the use of theraband  exercise aids (those long, stretchy neon colored things you've all seen) I  can work out specific muscle groups and areas of my body as I need.  A  large number of the exercises can be done in a seated position.  The line  drawings are clear and very helpful.  This would be a good book for anyone,  able bodied or not who wants to ease into fitness following an injury,  surgery, or just years of couch potato life. The spiral binding made it  easy to keep the book open in front of my while doing the stretches.  This  is a very practical consideration usually overlooked by writers of exercise  manuals.
