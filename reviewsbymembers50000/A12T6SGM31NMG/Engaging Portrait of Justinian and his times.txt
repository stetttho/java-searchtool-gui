 This is a very good, readable account of the reign of Justinian and Theodora.  The author does a commendable job of providing a concise  overview of the political, religious, social and economic issues of this era of the Byzantine empire.  Architecture and art are also addressed.  The author is clearly knowledgeable about the subject matter and knows how to tell the story in an engaging manner. He is adept at bringing many of the key individuals to life and describing the political, diplomatic and military activities among the Byzantine empire, the Persian empire, and western Europe.  A nice set of illustrations and maps are also included.  Highly recommended.
