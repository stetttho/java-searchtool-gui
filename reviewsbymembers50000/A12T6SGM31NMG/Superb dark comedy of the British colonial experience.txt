 It is easy to see why this book won two important literary awards.  Boyd has produced a highly readable, literate, darkly comic story of the British colonial experience. The characters are superbly developed and believable, the plot is extremely well paced and engaging, and the strengths and weaknesses of the human character are fully explored.  A great piece of literature, very highly recommended.  Boyd's many other novels, including An Ice Cream War, The New Confessions, Brazzaville Beach, The Blue Afternoon, and Any Human Heart are equally terrific. Boyd is clearly one of our most talented contemporary writers of fiction.
