 Julian Rathbone, the author, has done a remarkable job of telling the fictionalized account of the life of an engaging, adventurous man of the Napoleonic era.  Joseph, as a character, is so interesting and well developed that you feel you know him very well.  Other characters are similarly developed and portrayed.  Furthermore, the plot is fascinating and well-paced, taking the reader across the map of Europe, through villages, battlegrounds, etc.  Mr. Rathbone clearly researched his subject well, as he has a clear command of the era in his descriptions of the life of the times.  As a reader, you become completely immersed in the story and learn much about this important time in European history.  The book was shortlisted for the Booker Prize, and it is easy to see why it was.  I have also read Mr. Rathbone's book, The Last English King, which is equally, if not perhaps, more wonderful.  Fans of well-written, literary historical fiction will be richly rewarded from reading these books of Mr. Rathbone.
