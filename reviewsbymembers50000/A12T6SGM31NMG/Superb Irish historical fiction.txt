 This is a superb fictionalized account of 19th century Ireland with the main focus on the terrible famine.  O'Connor very skillfully transports the reader to this time and place with an interesting, believable cast of characters representing the diversity within society.  While much of the plot and action occurs on a ship filled with emmigrants heading to America, O'Connor frequently shifts attention back to the lives led by the characters prior to their voyage.  This shifting of time and place adds even greater depth to the overall story.  A subtle murder mystery adds to the drama.  Moral issues regarding the cause as well as the response to the famine are also explored. The writing style is highly engaging and readable.  Very highly recommended.
