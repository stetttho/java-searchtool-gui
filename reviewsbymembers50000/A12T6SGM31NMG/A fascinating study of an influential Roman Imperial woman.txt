 Overall, this was a very good biography of Agrippina.  The author should be commended for writing a biography from the perspective of a highly influential and important woman during Imperial Rome.  The author certainly takes an academic approach to the study, and appears to have done a good job with research and use of sources.  His treatment of Agrippina seems fair and even-handed.  The author does a very good job of providing the story of Agrippina, the Imperial family, and other important Romans. My only criticism of the book is that somewhat more background about Roman society, social classes, the economy, foreign affairs was needed.  Nevertheless, the author has provided us with a very informative and entertaining biography.  I will undoutedly read his newest book on Livia.  I highly recommend this biography of Agrippina.
