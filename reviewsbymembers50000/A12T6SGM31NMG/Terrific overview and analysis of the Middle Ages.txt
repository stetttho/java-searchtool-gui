 I cannot recommend this book more highly.  In just 200 pages, Strayer provides an excellent summary and analysis of the history of western Europe during the Middle Ages.  Unlike many other books on history, Strayer is very adept at not only presenting the facts, sequence of events, etc., but also at describing the key trends and patterns of history, and analyzing and interpreting what happened.  Furthermore, he ties the patterns and trends of the history of the Middle Ages to later history, including our own times. His writing style is very clear, organized, and fluent.  There is also a very useful bibliography included.  My own criticism of the book is that I would have liked a few maps included.  Nevertheless, this is a very, very excellent book.
