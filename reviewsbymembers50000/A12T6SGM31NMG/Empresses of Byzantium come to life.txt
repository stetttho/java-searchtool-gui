 This is a very good book.  It is academic and well researched, but also very readable.  The author focuses in on the lives of three empresses and their importance to the history of the Byzantium Empire, as well as their impact on West European history.  There is a very good introductory chapter that lays the historical backdrop of the Byzantium Empire and the city of Constantinople. From there, the author provides a triple biography of the three empresses, highlighting their characters, importance to politics and religion, and the other main characters in their lives.  The author makes a compelling case for the importance of the empresses' efforts to restore the veneration of religious icons, while also highlighting their achievements in both domestic political concerns and foreign relations.  The book also contains several excellent maps and beautiful color plates.  For anyone interested in women's history, the medieval period, and the Byzantium Empire, this book should greatly satisfy.
