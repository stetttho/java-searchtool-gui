 There are many books available on the history of Venice, but there is probably no book as beautifully illustrated as this one.  It contains many beautiful prints of paintings, sculptures, etc. as well as excellent photographs of the city.  The book also provides a very good general overview of the history of Venice.  The author is somewhat biased, by his own admission, about the "glory" of Venice and its history, and, thus, some degree of objectivity may have been lost in the telling of the history.  Nevertheless, for anyone who is interested in Venice and its history, this book will provide many rewards.
