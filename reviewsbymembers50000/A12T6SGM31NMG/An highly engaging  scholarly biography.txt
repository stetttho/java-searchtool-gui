 This is a superb, well researched, highly organized, and very readable biography of an important Russian emperor.  The author provides an indepth description and intelligent analysis of Nicholas' personality and character, the emperor's orientation to autocratic rule, Russian political, economic, social, and cultural history during his reign, and the importance of the political, economic, and social influences of Western European nations on Russia. Lincoln goes much beyond just presenting a chronology of events, by explaining why historical events happened as they did.  The final epilogue nicely places the reign of Nicholas in the broader context of Russian history that preceded his reign and the events that would unfold subsequent to his time.  My only slight criticism of the book is that maps were not included.  Nevertheless, it is one of the best historical biographies I have ever read.  Lincoln's larger worker, The Romanozs is equally terrific.
