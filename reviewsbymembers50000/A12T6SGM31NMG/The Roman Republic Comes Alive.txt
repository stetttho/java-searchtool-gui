 This is a highly readable, well researched, very engaging study of the Roman Republic.  The author possesses a remarkable ability to tell the history of the republic in both a learned and entertaining style.  He goes beyond a description of events and facts to analyze the reasons events unfolded as they did and to present the personalities and motivations of the historical figures.  I did wish occassionally that more background had been provided.  For example, more description about the differences of the positions of  consult, tribune, praetorship would have been helpful. I also wanted more background or description about events, motivations, etc. that led up to the civil war between Caesar and Pompey.  However, overall the book is excellent.  The inclusion of several maps and illustrations is a plus.
