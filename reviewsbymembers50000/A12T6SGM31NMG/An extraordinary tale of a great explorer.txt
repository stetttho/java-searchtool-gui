 This is a highly absorbing account of the three voyages of Captain Cook.  The author has done a very commendable job of describing all the people, places, and cultures that Cook and his crew encountered.  His descriptions of the populations indigenous to the  Pacific Islands, New Zealand, Austrailia, the Pacific Northwest, etc., and of the geography of these places are well researched and fascinating.  The interplay of cultures between the British explorers and those they encountered is emphasized with great effect.  The personalities and motivations of the key figures, including Cook, are brought to life as well.  The account of the voyages reads like an adventure story, while simultaneously being based on very solid research.  Included are a number of excellent maps and a large number of excellent illustrations, primarily of paintings and sketches done by artists who accompanied Cook.  Very highly recommended.
