 Overall, this was a good biography of Augustus.  The author clearly resarched the subject thoroughly.  The book does a very good job of portraying Augustus, his personality, and those closest to him.  In some ways, the book is almost too focused on Augustus, without adequate attention to the background of Roman society.  While the author does address background factors, these  sometimes seem to get lost in the very detailed focus on Augustus himself.  This book would probably be most enjoyed by those looking for a fairly academic approach, and those who have read other books on Augustus.  Despite some of my misgivings, I still recommend this book.  I enjoyed it, and learned from it.
