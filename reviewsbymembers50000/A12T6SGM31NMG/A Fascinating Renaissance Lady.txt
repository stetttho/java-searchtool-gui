 This is a fascinating biography of Felice della Rovere, illegitimate daughter of Pope Julius II, the great Renaissance pope.  Felice, however, was important and influential in her own right, and the author, with thorough research, has vividly provided an engrossing story of Felice's life, including her childhood; marriages and children; her complex relationship with her father, the pope; and her rise to power, political influence, and wealth within Renaissance Italy.  The author convincingly contends that Felice became the most powerful woman of her time, and yet, strangely, her story has not been told before.  The biography of this remarkable women is enhanced with the backdrop of life in Renaissance Rome and the surrounding Italian countryside; the life of the city streets, the day-to-day workings of the great palaces, how the economy worked, wars, the lives and works of the great painters Michelangelo and Raphael, and the intrigues of the nobility are all described. Dozens of beautiful black and white illustrations are placed at the beginning of each chapter, and an attractive set of color plates highlights key persons, important paintings, and castles and palaces of the era. Strongly recommended for readers interested in women's history, the history of the Renaissance and the history of Rome.
