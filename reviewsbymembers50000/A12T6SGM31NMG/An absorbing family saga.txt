 This book is an excellent tale of several generations of an Indian family (the Dorais) living through the first half of the 20th century.  The author has performed a splendid job of developing the various characters, creating a story that is very captivating, and portraying the historical backdrop of India during this time period. The interplay and relationships among the Indians and the British are clearly presented, and the different manner in which the various generations of the Indian family (the Dorais) adjust and respond to the British rule illuminates much about the history of the country.  The author has an extremely engaging writing style, and the descriptions of Indian culture, landscape, buildings, etc. are fascinating.  This is apparently Mr. Davidar's first book, and I can only hope he will write another.
