 This is a highly engaging, well written epic.  Hensher has produced an absorbing historical fiction of a point in time that has implications for our own times.  His story of imperalism in central Asia during the 19th century is a timely commentary on current events.  Hensher engages the reader with a broad cast of characters from diverse cultures, and the story interestingly moves among locales in Afghanistan, India, England, and Russia.  While the story seems to ramble just somewhat in a few spots, this actually seems intentional as part of the broad sweep of historical events, cultures and people.  While the author concedes that the story is loosely based on historical facts, his skill at describing events and locales, creating believable and interesting characters within believable plots, and attention to detail transports the reader into the overall story. This is truly an excellent, literary historical fiction.
