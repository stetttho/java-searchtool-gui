 I love historical fiction, and, in general, can be somewhat picky about what I read.  The Glass Palace is one of the finest works of its kind I have ever read.  From the first page, I was totally engaged. Ghosh is a master story teller.  He has done a very impressive job of providing an exciting historical background of Burma, Malaysia, and India over many decades, interwoven with well developed characters across generations. I will read this book again someday.  I very highly recommend this book.
