 Boyd is undoubtedly one of our best living writers, and is my favorite writer of fiction.  Any Human Heart is quite simply wonderful.  Boyd has given us a completely believable diary of a complex, interesting, and flawed man, Logan Mountstuart, who lived through most of the 20th century. Mountstuart's life story is filled with highs and lows, loves, struggles, triumphs, intrigues, and most importantly a resilence of the heart. The story compels the reader to reflect about what's really important in life, as Mountstuart does more and more as the story unfolds. Mountstuart's life is told with great sensitivity and thoughtfulness.  Mountstuart experiences many of the important events and changes of the 20th century, and this backdrop adds yet another interesting layer to the story.  Boyd's immense talent as a writer lies in his ability to produce great literature through a highly compelling and fascinating story, often with a historical backdrop. Other books by Boyd that are also terrific include The Blue Afternoon, An Ice Cream War, Brazzaville Beach, and The New Confessions.
