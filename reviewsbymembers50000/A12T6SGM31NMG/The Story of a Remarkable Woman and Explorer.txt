 To the Heart of the Nile is an exceptional work of historical writing.  Pat Shipman has produced a very engaging, well researched biography of Lady Florence Baker and her husband, Sam Baker, from Florence Baker's early days spent in an Ottoman harem to the courageous journeys she and her husband made exploring the Nile river. Shipman skillfully provides a description of the relevant history, politics and culture of the Ottoman Empire, Great Britian, Egypt and the Sudan during the life of the remarkable Florence Baker and her husband.  The characters and personalities of Florence Baker, Sam Baker, and many others are brought vividly to life.  The book reads much like an adventure story, yet stays true to solid historical writing.  Shipman does take some liberties with ascribing conversations and thoughts to the Bakers and others, which I initially had questions about.  But this is done with very careful regard to the source material, and results in a more engaging tale.  The book also contains excellent maps of the Nile River explorations, and a large number of beautiful illustrations.  One of the best biographies I've ever read. Very strongly recommended, especially to those interested in women's history and the history of exploration.
