 This is a well told account of exploration and scientific discovery in the Amazon during the 18th century. Most of the book is concerned with a team of French mapmakers' investigation to determine the exact size and shape of the Earth, which was a crucial scientific question of the day. The author has skillfully utilized both primary and secondary source material as well as his own knowledge and travels in South America to write an engaging history.  The cultural, social and political backdrop of 18th century South America, within the context of European exploration and colonization, is well described. The mapmakers' explorations, mainly around the Amazon, are brought vividly to life, reflecting it seems the author's own experiences in this land, as well as his study of primary source material.  The part of the story (reflected in the book title) concerning one of the mapmaker's wife's arduous journey to find her husband actually comprises only the last part of the book.  In this regard, the book seems mistitled, which has been mentioned by other reviewers.  One wonders if the book title was for marketing purposes, and if so, this is somewhat unfortunate.  The book is beautifully illustrated with drawings of the exploration and other scenes of the times.  A helpful list of characters and maps are also included. Highly recommended for readers who enjoy books on exploration, scientific discovery, and history of South American and European exploration.
