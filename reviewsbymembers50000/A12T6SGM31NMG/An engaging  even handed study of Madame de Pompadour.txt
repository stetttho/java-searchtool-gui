 Overall, this is a well-written, engaging portrait of Madame de Pompadour, as well as other important persons of the times, including Louis XV, the aristocracy, Pompadour's family members, etc.  We learn much about Pompadour, her personality, how she managed her rise to prominence, the court intrigues.  Her involvement in politics and the arts are addressed.  I would have liked some more information on other aspects of French society (e.g., life of different social classes, the economy, foreign affairs) than is provided.  I recognize that the main point of the book is a focus on Pompadour, yet I believe this additional information would have provided a fuller picture in which to understand Pompadour.  Nevertheless, I would defintely recommend this book to a reader who wants to learn more about this important woman and the court life during Louis XV's rein.
