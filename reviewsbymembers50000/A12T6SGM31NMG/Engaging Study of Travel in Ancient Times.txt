 This is a unique and highly interesting account of the many facets of travel in the ancient world.  The author covers types of travel, reasons for travel, accomodations, major historical attractions, the mail delivery system in ancient times, and many other topics.  In general, the book is highly informative, readable, and entertaining.  Descriptions of holiday travel, inns and restaurants, the Roman road system, the trade routes of ancient times are quite fascinating. In a very few places the book seems to bog down in perhaps too much detail, but overall, the book is quite good.  The author's perspective is also primarily on the Western world and the Near East, including Egypt.  Thus, other ancient cultures (e.g., China) are mentioned only briefly.  The book is a very unique contribution to the study of the ancient world.  Highly recommended.
