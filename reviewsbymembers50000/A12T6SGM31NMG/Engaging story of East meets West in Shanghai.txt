 This is an engaging historical novel of both Shanghai and China.  The main plot and various subplots move along nicely, the main characters are interesting and generally well developed, moral issues related to imperalism are addressed, and the political and sociological background of the city and China are portrayed well.  The author definitely captures the exotic mystique of the city during the early part of the 20th century.  A definite read for those interested in historical fiction about Asia.
