 This book is a good one volume history of France.  The author, Alistair Horne, who has written numerous books on the history of France, has provided a brief chronological overview of many centuries of French history in an engaging narrative.  The major historical periods and events are summarized, from the rule of the Capetians to the presidency of Mitterand of the late 20th century.  Horne seems particularly adept at describing French history of the 19th and 20th centuries, vividly bringing to life events such as the Nazi occupation of Paris.  He describes the major political, social and economic forces across centuries and also highlights how key historical figures (e.g., Louis XIV, Napoleon) have shaped the country's history.  The book, however, almost seems too brief.  I was left wanting more information and more detail about specific historical periods and events.  The book also does not provide much on the history of France prior to Philippe-Auguste.   In addition, more explanation and background about important events, such as the Commune of Paris and Communards, would have been helpful.  The inclusion of French phrases that are not translated is unfortunate, and the Index could be more exhaustive (e.g., the Index does not provide any page references to 20th century French literature even though several pages are devoted to this topic).  Despite these concerns, I would recommend the book as a good, popular history. It is a highly readable and informative portrait of a fascinating country.
