 First, let me point out that Mona Charen believes, among other bits of amusing malarkey, that the Clintons had Vince Foster assassinated. We are not dealing with someone who has a great respect for facts. Now, her argument seems to be that 'liberals' (a term that seems to include everyone from Thomas Friedman to the Weather Underground) have historically been what the John Birch society used to call "comm simps" that is, ardent fans of totalitarian communism. Look at the long list of liberal commie-lovers: Harry Truman, who started the Korean war to keep the DPRK from owning the whole Korean penninsula; JFK, who started the Vietnam war with similar goals in mind; Lyndon Johnson, who stoked the bloody mess still further. You would have to go pretty far left to find anyone who still defended the USSR past the early fifties.  Meanwhile, in the name of fighting communism, we have bombed dirt-poor villagers in Vietnam and Cambodia, murdered the democratically elected president of at least one nation, funded murderous rapists in Nicaragua (people whom Ronald Reagan called "the moral equivalent of our founding fathers) and generally caused mayhem on a scale the Soviet Union only dreamed of.  What did it achieve? Why did we do it? I seem to recall we were listening to the Ann Coulters and Mona Charens of the day,  and losing our sense of human decency in the process.
