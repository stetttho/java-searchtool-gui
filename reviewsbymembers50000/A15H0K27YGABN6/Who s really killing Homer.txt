 As a Classics grad student, I have to say I do not recognize the Classics departments he describes in this book. The Classics scholars I know (and I've met many of them; it's a small field) are dedicated fair-minded scholars, not 'careerists.'   Furthermore, Classics was one of the first areas of the humanities to acknowledge the debt the West owes to the East (back before it was fashionable) and if Hanson thinks the venerated M.L West was some dippy postmodernist, he'll have to go through me.  Finally, Classicists have never gone wholesale for the New Historicism/cultural relativism that has paralyzed, say, academic English departments. The whole academic world needs to be dipped for these ticks, but Classics less than most.    I think Hanson is endorsing the same antique parody of the Classics field that our multicultural critics use against us: tweedy, irrelevant conservative white supremacists. Classics has not been like this since the days of Basil Gildersleeve. Classical scholars of the 20th century have achieved the difficult feat of balancing progressive ideas with sober scepticism, and they deserve some kudos for it.  Let's let Victor Hanson go duke it out with Martin Bernal, and let the rest of us go back to teaching, writing and keeping the flame alive.
