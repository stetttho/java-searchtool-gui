 This was the first Stanley Bros. record I bought. It's not their best, but it's a good introduction. It's loose, some songs are repeated, the comedy is endearingly awful, and there's a lot of banter between songs. However, this would have been sixties folk audiences' introduction to the band as well, and one gets a good flavor of their stage presence. Note the contrast between the two performances; the 1959 one has lots of hortfelt gospel tunes and flourishes, but by 1964 they've streamlined their sound and cut out the comedy -- a better performance, but it's missing something genuine that the earlier one had. By the way, Ralph's banjo is absolutely scorching, his solos on this record beat the bloomers off the studio versions.
