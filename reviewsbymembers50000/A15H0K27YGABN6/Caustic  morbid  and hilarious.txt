 Tony Millionaire's MAAKIES is a nonpareil in comics -- the wittiest, most surreal dark humor I've seen since Elzie Segar's Popeye. There is nothing  arch or arty about this stuff either -- it will offend and scandalize the  pure of heart as sublime comics should. The draughtsmanship is  breathtaking, on a par with anything Hal Foster (of Prince Valiant fame) or  Walt Kelly ever did, but that's the least of it. The wit is gin-soaked and  angry, shot through with genuine pathos and not a thimbleful of sentiment.  By the time you encounter Uncle Gabby the ape charging a platoon of  Napoleonic alligators with his head on fire, yelling "I'm a barrel  full of hate boys, open me up!" you'll know if this painful hangover  cure is for you or if you'd rather just curl up and gurgle with "Mutts  Vol II."
