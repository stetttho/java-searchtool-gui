 This is far and away Barthelme's most trenchant and acidic work. The gargantuan Dead Father is being dragged to his burial ground by some dispassionate former worshippers. Along the way they navigate the country of the Wends, who father themselves, and read the hilarious and savage A Manual for Sons. There has never been anything like this book. Barthelme nearly matches Voltaire for satiric violence and wit.
