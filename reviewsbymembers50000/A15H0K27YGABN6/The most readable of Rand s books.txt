 For those of you who excroriate Rand for one-sided hatred of Communism, let me just point out that she was born under it, and she ought to know. The first hundred pages of this book are the best thing Rand ever wrote  --complicated characters, and a vivid, chilling depiction of life under the  Bolsheviks. Of course, then Rand the proselytizer elbows her way in, and  it's downhill from there. One can forgive Rand for hating Communism, but to  go a mile in the opposite direction and espouse such a brutal solipsism is  perhaps a sign of some psychological problems on her part. What would the  world be like if everyone were to declare himself a monomaniacal Dr. Doom  surrounded by foolish mortals?  Brilliant she may have been, but,  unfortunately, also totally nuts.
