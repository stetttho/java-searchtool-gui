 In the comics desert of the late 20th century, who could fans of the Great Old Stuff look to? The old heroes are gone: Elsie Segar, Geo. Herriman, Hal Foster. Who even comes close? The only strips that aspire to any kind of artistic expression are either saccharine crud (Mutts) or winky-snarky napkin-doodling (Life in Hell.) Five cheers then for Tony M! Maakies has all the seafaring verve of the old popeye, all the poetic strangeness of Krazy Kat, all the fearsome draughtsmanship of Prince Valiant. The humor? Maakies could only be a fin-de-siecle strip; its gin-soaked angst and violent despair could only get yuks from today's jaded mal-vivants, weaned on Celine and the Brady Bunch. It's not for everybody; only those with the sap necessary to face the maelstrom in the teeth will see its gritty resonance and ludicrous poetry.
