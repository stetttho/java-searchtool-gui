 I hate experimental fiction. Don DeLillo and his ilk, they bore me; it's just a lot of fake cleverness. But this book, while you can't deny the avantness of its garde, is...well...the first page brings up the question  of just what exactly is lodged in the supine, mile-tall Dead Father's  teeth. "Mackerel salad. At least we think it is mackerel salad. In the  sagas, it is mackerel salad." Wildly fantastic, caustically funny (  the sex scenes will make you fall out of your chair), prosodically  innovative ( I believe Barthelme has invented his own verb tense) and yet,  easy to follow and, really, with an old-fashioned plot. It is a parable  about the overthrow of old tyrannies -- and in spite of all the literary  smartaleckitude it is tender and genuinely moving. You have never read  anybody like Barthelme, and if you can find this book anywhere (out of  PRINT!  how DARE they? ) treasure it. Nothing like it has ever been  written or will be again. Sixty-eight stars (if they would allow it.)
