 The best feature of the book is the diagrams of each disease process on the cellular level. The care plans are broad and limited. Under each disease there may be a list of four nursing diagnoses followed by a list of seven interventions with no discussion of which intervention relates to which diagnosis. Too broad and general. Not worth the price.
