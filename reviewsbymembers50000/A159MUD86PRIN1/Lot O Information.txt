 This is an excellent reference, whether studying for the CCRN or simply take it to work and use at the bedside. Covers every body system, hemodynamic monitoring,, ethics and legal issues, pharmacology, and pain. It has a section devoted to advanced concepts in cardiac, respiratory, and neuro systems. Plenty of diagrams and drawing to explain set up of equipment and anatomical sites. Great section on dialysis and waveform interpretations. Also covers alternative therapy in great detail. Highly recommended.
