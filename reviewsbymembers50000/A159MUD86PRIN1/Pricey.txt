 This is an expensive book, however a good resource to keep on hand. This book is set up as an outline.  This is not a detailed text covering all the ins and outs of pathophysiology on the cellular level. It does cover pathophysiology but set up in an outline form, not a standard textbook. Easy to read and grasp information.
