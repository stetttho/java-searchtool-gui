 This is an excellent source of information for the new and experienced critical care nurse. The book contains a wealth of extremely detailed information with regard to anatomy, physiology, pathophysiology, and hemodynamic monitoring. This book covers equipment set up, maintancence, and trouble-shooting. It is full very useful information, for example, how cardiac output and pulmonary wedge pressures are effected by other hemodynamic parameters or outside influences such as PEEP levels and how to account for the increased intrathoracic pressure. Lots of calculations to show you how doctors arrive at decisions and numbers. The book is set up from broad to specific with great organization. Highly recommended.
