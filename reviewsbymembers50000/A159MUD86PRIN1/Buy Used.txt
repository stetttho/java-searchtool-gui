 This book has one very positive aspect: the study cards in the back. There are 32 pages with two cards on each page. They are cardboard and perforated to tear out and carry with you. Good information on them. The rest of the book, however is very basic. Too much wasted space. Each chapter on a body system starts with section-related tips for studying for the CCRN followed by a few pages of pictures of the organ, many tables and charts, and lastly fill in the blank sentences and fill in the blank pathophysiology, etiologies, and signs and symptoms. Too much information not in here. Too much space wasted on each page. Approximately 25% of the book is actual writing or definitions, the rest are tables, charts, and pictures. The majority of the book is blank for you to write and fill in the blanks. Not my idea of a review/study guide. This book is too general and still needed to use other study guides, references, and textbooks to study for the CCRN. I like all my informatin in one place. Lacks a pharmacology section. Save money and buy used or not at all. Plain paper is cheaper.
