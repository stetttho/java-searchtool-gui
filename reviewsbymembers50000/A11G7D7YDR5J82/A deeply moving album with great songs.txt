 I agree with most of the people who reviewed this cd except for the fact that they forgot to mention Narcolepsy.  I find it a great song that has the lyrical approach with a bit of humor.  As far as the last 4 songs on the album, I listen to them once and didn't hear them again till I saw 3EB in concert in march. It was then I rediscovered those songs.  My favorite song on the whole cd was Motorcycle drive-by.  It has a haunting kind of sound and it is very gripping.  Like Darkness on Blue, it is one of my depression songs it helps me get through my hard times.   track listing 1. Losing a Whole Year 2/5 2. Narcolepsy 5/5 3. Semi Charmed Life 4/5 4. Jumper 4.5/5 5.
