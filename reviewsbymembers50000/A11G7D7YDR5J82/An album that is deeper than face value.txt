 I have actually written another review of this album.  That was about a year ago when the only thing I had heard was Higher.  Later I bought this album and after many hours and hours of listening to this has made this album one of my favorites.  I bought My Own Prison because I wanted to see how much their style and sound had changed.  It has changed in the producing of it.  My Own Prison is a great cd too.  However it definatly has a more raw powerful edge to it, just like most grudge style music.  I do like some of the stuff on My Own Prison that I wish they had on Human Clay.   As far as the tracks on Human Clay they are difinately worth listening to, which is not what some people have done.  I would have to say that the best song on this cd is With Arms Wide Open, not because it is catchy or has a great success on the charts, but because the lyrics and the emotion as well as the sound all comes together really well.  Higher is great too.  It got overplayed and still is but it is still good.  Other good songs are : Are You ready, beautiful and Faceless man.   A Great effort by Creed.
