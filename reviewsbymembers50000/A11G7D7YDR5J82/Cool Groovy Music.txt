 This Album rocks!  I know that everyone has heard "All-Star" over and over again, even thought that is their best song on the cd, there are also cool songs besides that.  I love the slower beat to "Fallen  Horses" and the rcoking beat to "Come On Come On"  Also  "I Just Wanna See" is a cool vivid song.   If you even considered  buying "Fush Ya Mang" then you should definately buy this.
