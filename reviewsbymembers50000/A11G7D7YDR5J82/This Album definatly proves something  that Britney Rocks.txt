 This album proves that Britney Spears is not a fad or a passing phase.  She is the real deal.  To this date she has sold 8 million copies of this cd.  She is good.   As far as album material, I think it is better than Baby One More Time.  I like.  Oops I Did it Again, Stronger, Lucky, Dear Diary, and What You See I what you get.   The cd flows a lot better than the original.  I don't have to really pick and choose when listening to this album.  So Track listing.   1. Oops...I Did It Again 5/5 definately the best on the cd.  A good choice for an opening single 2. Stronger 4.9/5 a close second to my fav. song.  You can feel the energy in the song.  3. Don't Go Knocking On My Door.  4/5 A good song.  Sounds a lot like Pink.  4. (I Can't Get No) Satifaction 2/5 not Britney's Best.  Rolling Stones does it better.  It is also too quiet. 5. Don't let me be the last to know. 4.5/5 A good song written by Shania Twain and her ex-husband/mananger.  Really good.  6. What You See (Is what you get).  4/5  A good song that just tells it straight out.  7. Lucky 4.5/5 a good song that is meant to describe Britney. It was a little overplayed.  good message.  8.  One Kiss From You 3.8/5 Pretty good. not quite as good as others but good anyway.  9.  Where Are You now  3/5.  A little too slow, kinda drags on.  10.  Can't Make You Love Me.  3.5/5 a good moderate song that give you the right feeling.  11.  When Your eyes say it 3.6/5  Pretty good love song.  Still slow but good.  12.  Dear Diary 4.4/5  a good song that the story of how girls emotions work.  Very educational if you need that. Overall good Album
