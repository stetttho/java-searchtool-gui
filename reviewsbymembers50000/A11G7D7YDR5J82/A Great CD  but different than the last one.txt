 If you bought this cd expecting it to be exactly the same as their previous album, you will be sorely dissapointed.  Darren wrote the lyrics to Savage Garden's self-title album more like poetry and less out of  expeirence.  Affirmation is all out of personal experience.  I heard that  straight from Darren himself, at an interview I heard.    The song is more  emotional.  You can feel what he felt by listening to the song.  The emotion  sort of envelopes you.  It is really awesome.    The songs that have  definate emotion are I Knew I Loved You, The Best Thing, Crash And Burn, Two  Beds and A Coffe Machine, You can Be free, Gunning Down Romance and I Don't  Know you anymore.  Just reading the titles tells you that it is going to be  a profound song.  I like other songs.    I also like The Animal Song, even  though most critics don't.  It is a cool atmospheric song.    This cd is  great!
