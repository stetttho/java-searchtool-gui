 This cd has the depth and meaning that most artists never seem to reach in their careers.  Their style and sound is somehow similar to R.E.M. But somehow it leaves you more inspired than R.E.M.   The Explosive entry of We Are, sets the cd off right.  Then the frustration of You're A God hooks you and makes you want more.  That leads right into Everything You Want.  If you haven't heard it by now, then you are probably very lucky.  It was overplayed, like most songs, but if you look past that then it is a great song about failed romance.  The real gem of this cd is next.  Best I Ever Had (Grey Sky Morning).  The slow sad melodic voice of Matt Scannel.  You Say is another great song.  Finding Me is another great song that catches the mood. Another favorite of mine is All Of You.  It seems to almost catch you off guard but it sounds great.   Overall, A great cd that merits a good listen
