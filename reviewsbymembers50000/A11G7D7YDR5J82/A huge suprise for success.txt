 I bought Now2 because it had some songs that I thought were pretty good, but one hit wonders, I then bought Now3 because I thought it would be as good.  It has a couple of good songs but I was thoroughly suprised when Now 4 came out.  I watched the preview on tv and said "Oh my gosh!" They have Britney Spears, Backstreet Boys, Mandy Moore and Effiel 65 on the same cd!"  Then I looked at the whole album, they had Train and Blink 182 and even a bizzare Maci Gray.  For the R&B lovers there is Sonique, Joe, Aaliyah, and Maci Gray.  Whatever your interest in music is the is a cd for fans of any type of music.
