 I have Now volumes 2,3,4, and 5 in my collection.  I think this is the best one of all.  In comparison to the previous ones this is great.  It has a good variety of what is popular in todays music.  I too would have liked to have Nelly's Country Grammer and the Baha Men's who let the dogs out.  They would make this complete but this album is still great.  It has N'sync, Backstreet Boys, 98 Degrees, Jessica Simpson, Mandy Moore and Aaron Carter for you who have pop tastes; Destiny's Child, Mya, Sisqo and Mistikal for R&B/Rap tastes; 9 Days, 3 Doors Down, Bon Jovi, and BBMack for your alternative tastes.   There are some songs that I don't really care for, like Faded, or Don't Think I'm Not.  But overall a great album, one that's good to listen to while you are driving.
