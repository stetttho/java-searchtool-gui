 This cd is an excellent reason why CREED ROCKS!.  It had 4 #1's including Torn, My Own Prison (The Title Track), What's This Life For and One.  I first heard My Own Prison in early 1998.  I thought it was a great song, but it wasn't played very much.  When their second cd came out I bought MOP and was glad that I did.  This cd differs slightly from Human Clay.  It is a little more raw and harder.  The only downside to this cd is the swear words in What's this life for.   A great cd from a great artist.
