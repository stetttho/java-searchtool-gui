 If I could sum up the whole cd in two words they would be deep and profound.  This cd just rocks.  "Never Let You Go" (If it hasn't already made your toe start tapping) is a great song that most people have  heard.  Then there is their new release "10 Days Late" which is  also a great song.  Other good songs include Anything, 1000 Julys, An Ode  to Maybe, Darkness and Darwin. The most profound and by far the best song  on the album is Wounded.  The lyrics alone are powerful but add music and  it is work of art.   The thing that I don't like is that their record  company wouldn't let them put the original version  of Slow Motion, which  is kinda explicit, but It is so true.   A great overall cd
