 I know that Lauryn is a good rapper and some of the songs are cool, but overall it is kinda boring and just blah.  I liked Doo Woop (That Thing).  To Zion was a outstanding song and I like how Carlos Santana did the guitar  for the song.  It was ok.  Not earth shattering like Third Eye Blind's  "Blue"
