 I bought this cd for "Last Kiss" which I'm sure a lot of people did.  It was worth the money.  Especially that "Solider of Love".   WOW!   I also enjoyed the remix of "Freak On A Leash" by KoRn.   I liked that song and I didn't really want to buy the whole KoRn cd.    This is just my opinion.  If you don't necessarily like this kind of  music then you better look before you leap (listen before you buy).  I  thought it was an awesome cd.
