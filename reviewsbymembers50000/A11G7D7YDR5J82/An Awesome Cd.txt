 I wasn't expecting much from her, but when she came to my high school, I was intrigued.  So I bought it and WOW!  It is an awesome cd.  The best  songs are So Real, Candy (even though it does get old), Walk Me Home, and  Lock Me In Your Heart.  She isn't like Britney Spears, she is better.  She  may not be as old, but she is still soooo hot!
