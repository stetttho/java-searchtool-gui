 This cd is much different than their previous one.  If the reason  you like Third Eye Blind (3EB) is because of their popular songs , like jumper, semi-charmed life or how's it gonna be then you might be disappointed.  There are only a couple of songs on this cd that have that kind of pop appeal.  If you liked the last half of their debut album then this is the cd for you.  I actually like them both, in different ways.  Here is a track rundown. 1. Anything--A fast loud song that gets the emotion pumping.  A good song to start the cd off.  4/5 2. Wounded--A deep slow song about the dangers of abuse.  One of the best on the cd.  5/5 3. 10 Days late--a loud rocking song that is pretty good 3/5 4. Never Let you go--definately the best on the cd.  A song about trusting each other and how we fail that trust.  5/5 5. Deep inside of you--A deep power ballad with a great message.  4.5/5 6.  1000 Julys--A rocking pop song with a great beat. 4/5 7.  An Ode To Maybe--A cool song that has a fun sound. 4.5 8.  The Red Summer Sun--A deep melodic song with cool harmonies 3.5/5 9.  Camoflage--Another slow deep melodic song. 3.5/5 10. Farther--A great song about relationships drifting apart.  4/5 11. Slow Motion--It would have been a good song if Elektara hadn't decided to edit it.  It is really a good song that may or may not be too explicit for you 1/5.  (If you really want to hear it try downloading it on Napster) 12. Darkness--The second best on the cd, by a slim margin.  A deep dark song that I refer  to as my depression song.  It is so deep and powerful 5/5 13.  Darwin--A cool song about evolution and the scientist Darwin who basically is the father of evolution.  There is also a bonus track which is just another clip of red summer sun.   Oveall a great cd with minor flaws.
