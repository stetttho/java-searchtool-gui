 I thought this cd could have used some touching up.  Like adding that AC/DC song in it.  I liked the songs by Foo Fighters, Collective Soul, Fastball, Third Eye Blind, and Black Lab.  I really liked the Van Halen  song.  I wasn't born when they were popular and I thought "Hot For The  Teacher" was a pretty cool song.   I also liked the Theme song  Varsity Blue by Caroline's Spine.  It is a pretty good cd but could have  used some work.
