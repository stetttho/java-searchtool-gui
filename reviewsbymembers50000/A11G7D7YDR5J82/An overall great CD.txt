 Despite the fact that Carlos Santana doesn't sing on most of the album.  This is a great album.  It of course deserved all eight of the Grammy awards that it won.  Some of the songwritting isn't that great, but others  are undeningly profound.       I liked "Put Your Lights On" with  Everlast.  The vocals are outstanding and the lyrics are ok.  Anyone who  can't see or hear the magic of "Smooth" is just blind.  The  vocals are awesome and the lyrics are great.  Both the lyrics and the  vocals are done by Rob Thomas, the lead singer of Matchbox 20.  Smooth,  alone, won 3 grammys: Record of the year, Song of the year and best Pop  collaboration with vocals.  Smooth went to #1 on the Top 40 charts as well  as the Billboard single chart. It is an outstanding song.  I loved  "Maria Maria" with the Product G&B.  It is a cool song. My  favorite line is "See as the rich are getting richer, the poor are  getting poorer." Wyclef Jean wrote the song and he raps a little of  it.  I liked the Spanish song Migra.  It is a cool song and has excellent  vocals.  This is despite the fact that I don't know what they are saying.   Beyond those songs, the rest were ok.  The Lauryn Hill track was kinda  lame.  "The Calling" with Eric Clapton was lomg and boring.   These are the best songs in order: Smooth; Maria Maria; Migra; Put Your  Lights On; Love Of My Life; Africa Bamba; (Da Le) Yaleo; Wishing It Was; Do  You Like The Way; El Farol; Corazon Espinado; Primavera; and The Calling.   There is a pretty cool bonus track at the end of The Calling.  Overall the  fantastic guitar of Carlos Santana is what links this cd together.  A must  buy for anyone who enjoys great music
