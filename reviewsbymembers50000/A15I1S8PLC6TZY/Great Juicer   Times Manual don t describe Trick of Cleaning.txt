 REVIEW:----------------- This Juicer is a Great juicer, and if you know the ""Trick"" to cleaning it, well its a snap and makes this juicer a realy great Juicer.---------- First off, it is very quiet while juicing, and is juices very smoothly, no shimmying across counter top, like some customers have stated of other juicers. It does not foam up, and I have been able to juice over a gallon of juice, with only having having to spend 40 second to lift out baket, scoop out the pulp, and reassemble the juicer, before you are off again.-------- The citrus fruit juicer attachment, which is included at no extra cost, is well made with two sizes to juice large and small citrus fruit. It has safety features that will insure safe opperation while juicing citrus fruit, (some other brand juicers, will require you to purchase the juicer attachment at an additional price). The citrus fruit stainer is so great, you could can juice boxes of citrus fruit, while only having to stop and empty the citrus strainer after every about 30 medium peaces of citrus fruit.-------------------------------------For cleaning, it comes apart very quickly, without any difficulty, there is only two peices too take apart from the base unit.-----------------------------------------After spending many hours of researching the specs of different juicers out there. Then reading several customer reviews for many of the juicers sold by Amazon.com. I decided to purchase this KitchenAid Juicer.---------------------------------- And there was only one negative review concerning the KitchenAid Dual Function Juicer, about difficulty cleaning small food out of strainer, THERE IS A SIMPLE TRICK TO CLEANING!!! ------------------------------------ First off, the "Shaped Spatula", looks like part of the packing material, and was almost trashed, lucky I have always insisted, all packing materials are saved, and not put into the trash. Because if you loose this special shaped spatula, you might as well forget about cleaning this juicer.-----------------------------------TRICK TO CLEANING: Take the basket & the special designed spatula. Using the shorter size of the spatula scrap / scoop the left over fruit material out of the strainer basket.----------------------Then use the specially designed spatula's shorter side to scrap with on the outside of the basket. it will fit pefectly. Then put it under running water, and scrape the outside of the strainer basket, it will scrap off the the pulp that is stuck through the micro screen basket. As you turn the strainer and scrape under the running water, you will see how easyly the strainer basket is cleaned.................. Then repeat the process on the inside of the strainer basket while under runing water. Once you see the pulp clean from the strainer basket's inne sides. --------------- Then the next step is to cup your hand under the strainer, (vertical held), while the water is running. Since the pulp floats in water, the slight remaining pulp will float in the pool od water you have created, Then slightly tilt the stainer, and the floating pulp will float over the rim and out of your stainer. Leaving the strainer fairly clean. Repeat the prpocess as needed.---------------------------------------I am juicing 4-5 times each day, sometime as much as a gallon of juice at a time. It cleans quickly and juicer quickly and quietly. I am very happy with this product!!! I strongly recomend this item.Jeff
