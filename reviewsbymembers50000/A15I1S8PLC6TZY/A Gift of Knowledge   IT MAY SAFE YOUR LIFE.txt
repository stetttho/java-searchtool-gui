 A Gift of Knowledge & it may safe your life! The knowledge in this book saved my life.......... After VA doctors told me that I must accept that my 20 plus injuries and medical conditions can not be healed. I went is search of knowledge. As a ex-US Navy Corpsman who was with the USMC and addition medical knowledge, After reading this book, which A NON-MEDICAL PERSON could easy understand for themselves. I learned what types of "Food Supplement" added to my normal diet would help me.......The author says one should try a food supplement for 6 to 12 months. After that time, if you notice a difference for the better, than keep taking it, if not than stop taking it. THE TITTLE is a catchy way of getting a customer's attention. This book has so much more than just sexual nutrition. I TOTALLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK!!! -
