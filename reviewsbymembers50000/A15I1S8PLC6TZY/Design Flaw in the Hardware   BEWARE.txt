 I haave used Logitech keyboards, and never have I had the difficulties that this one and its replacement has given me, and it appears as a design flaw of the G15 keyboard itself. It happens during boot up of ones system, when your computer prompts you to hit any key to boot from your CD. Well the flaw, is many times,pushing keys, will not register, and they the only way to boot from your CD, is to plug a diiferent none G15 Logitech keyboard in. Since must people who play games, may rearly attempt to boot from oned CD, this design problem may not effect you.
