 As a collector of books of Illuminated Manuscript, pre-16th Century, I purchased this book, in hopes of it containing photographs (primary source), of pre-16 Century Illuminated Manuscripts or reference in regards to the illuminated manuscrpts, this book contained neither. With no prievious review of this book, and what it might hold withing in its covers, I took a chance in purchasing it. I was greatly disapointed in finding no illuminayed manuscrpts inside its covers, or references of illuminated manuscripts either. If you are seeking illuminated manuscripts, go somewhere else. I hope someone will finally read and post the 1st review of what this Book of Hours in regards to the thought the author was seeking to comunicate. Thank you
