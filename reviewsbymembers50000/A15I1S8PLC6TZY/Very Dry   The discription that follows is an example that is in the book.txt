 This book is dry and is not writen, so the reader will be unable to cleary retain what is writen. As you read the word for word reproduction of what you will find in the book, you will see it is Dry, and you may find yourself wondering just what it is saying. Just remember, I did not write this dry stuff, I am giving you an example of what you will find in the book, so you can decide if you wish to buy the book or not.   There may be people who bought this book, only to find it is not what they hoped. I am sorry if my honest review of the books, helps other who are thinking of buying this book used, to not buy it, cause it is not what they want.   Contents: History, Antiquity, Middle Ages, Renaissance Education, Renaissance Applications, Literature, Law, Science, Theology, Legacy, Manuscripts, 1600 & 1700 Centuries, 1800 Centuries, 1900 Centuries.  Example of the "Very Dry" wording in this book: --LAW:While early modern institutions of law in continental Europe was based largely upon Roman and Germanic legal traditions, England's were grounded in the so-called "common law" tradition. The common law constituted a body of customary unwritten law, approved by "ancient" custom and application, and communicated in extensive commentaries and reports of adjudged cases.  This is a example of what you can expect to find in this book, only worst. Most of photographs in the book, are photocopies of other books that "Commonplace Books" sells, all are black & white photographs....
