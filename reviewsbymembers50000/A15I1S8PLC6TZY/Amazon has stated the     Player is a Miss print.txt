 I have contacted Amazon about the ""1 Player", & is it correct or a missprint?.... Yes!!! Its a miss print, """Desert Storm II Back to Baghdad, The Xbox version features an exclusive four-player split-screen coopeative mode for brilliant multiplayer action. You can actually play through all the missions with three of your buddies.""" Amazon will see about fixing the missprint. I hope this helps.
