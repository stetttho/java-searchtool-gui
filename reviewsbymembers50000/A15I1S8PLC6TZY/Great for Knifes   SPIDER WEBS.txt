 Yes I have purchased and owned this knife block. It is great for holding your knifes. Your knifes are handy for quick access. I use to totally love this knife block. Right up to the point I wondered if those narrow slots that go all the way through to the botton of the knife block should be cleaned?............ God was I AMAZED to find spider webs inside the slots. My home is bug free due to Pest treatment each month. Yet there was spider webs inside those narrow slots......... Those slots are about 1/4 inch at its narrowest point, perfict for bugs to get into, and IMPOSSIBLE to clean!!...... Needless to say, it was the last time I ever used this or any other knike block. Now I use a wood silverware tray, in a draw just for my knifes...... An added point, is by not using the knife block, you can "child proof" your draw with knifes in it if you need too, while you can' do this to the knife block.
