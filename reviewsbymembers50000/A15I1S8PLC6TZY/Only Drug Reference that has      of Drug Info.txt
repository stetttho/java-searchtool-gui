 A PDR is the only sourse that has 100% of the information on the dugs. Some doctors feel the PDR is writen by attorneys, because it has every side effect a drug has ever given a patient. Or that the PDR has every scrap of information on any drug listed in it.............................  I have 38,000 hours of Emergency Medical System.................................... When persons make comments that the PDR does not make reference to drugs half life. In fact the PDR does state a drug half life. And it would be legally negligent for the PDR to list drugs in a catigory of half life, so a drug could be choosen for a patient, based on its half-life........... Drug advertisements, or drug info sheets "your" doctor gives you on a drug, is writen by the drug companies, and as a result, all the information that you would find in the PDR, is left off the drug info sheets they give to doctors, the same info sheets your doctors pass onto you.
