 Enjoyable once you see how the print flows on the page...Then becomes a book you can't put down! I bet that statement just confused you, yet it says just what is needed to make reading this book, and enjoyable experience. If you have read L.E. Modesitt Recluce Saga and his work of The Spellsong Cycle, then your expectations would be high for Gravity Dreams too. Before purchasing this book, I read the reader's reviews of L.E. Modesitt's other works, and they did not have the 5 star across the board reviews that the Recluse Saga had at the time I read those reviews. So I was a bit concerned about ventering into his other works. But I figured to give it a try. So after purchasing Gravity Dreams, I decided to read it, and found it was dry and slow to start, so I shelved it, for maybe later I would read it. After about 2 years, I tried it again, and then I looked at those dry area's of print, those area that were the highly complicated story of Fiction, was all in a altered print. So I then started to speed read or skim those areas when I came to those altered word of print. At that point, the book, became one of those books you just can't put down, that you find yourself running late, because you just have to keep read some more of the book. Author L.E. Modesitt it appears to have written this book, so those that enjoy those high discriptive and very dry areas may read them, and those that do not, will see the chagne of print on the page, and be able to identify those area's that are not that important to the story and can skim through that area, so all types of readers may enjoy this book, Well Done L.E. Modesitt!
