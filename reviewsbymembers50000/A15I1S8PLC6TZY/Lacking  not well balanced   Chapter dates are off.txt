 As one who love the Anne McCaffrey's ability to bring stories to life, so become one with the characters. One who owns all, but one of Anne McCaffrey's books. I was diappointed reading this book. A well balanced book is like counting to 10 slowly, the start, the build up before reaching 10. The Skies of Pern, started out great, then the story was like counting: 1..... 2..... 3..... 4..... 5..... 6..... 9.. 10. Two other times her books have been writen this way: "Decision at Doona" & "Treaty at Doona".Anne McCaffrey's other 15 Pern series are great, and her Crystal Singer series I have read many times.
