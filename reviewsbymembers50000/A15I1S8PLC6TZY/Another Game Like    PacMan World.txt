 I highly recommend this game for anyone who might have children who would need a game to play, This is a great game without any bloody details like morst games have. Which is why this game is so great for children.Metal Arms Glitch in the System, is very much like "Pacman World 2", so if you liked that game, you will love this one too. The graphics is a twin to "Pacman World 2". The level of play, from its tough levels to very fustrating levels of play, is "Pacman World 2" twin too. In the making of this game, some of the best points from games like Halo, Mechassault, & Ghost Recon have been programed into this game. So it is  fun game overall. You will need to keep the "automatic targeting" in the profile settings on, to get through the tough level of the "Zombieking". Once the Zombie king has frozen, if you run up real close and target your sights on the Zombieking's left hip joint, (that the hip to your right),  and toss the core charge into his mouth. It will greatly increase the change of killing him with time. It will take some practice to find just the right spot to aim, to get the core charge to go into his mouth. You will only have time to toss in 2-3 core charges before he will start to move. Also, as you start to kill him, othe monesters will come forth to kill you. ((When this happens, you will know that you have been successfull in hurting him)). ...
