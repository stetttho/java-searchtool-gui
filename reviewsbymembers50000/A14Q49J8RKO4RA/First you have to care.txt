 In my former hometown of Oregon City, John McLoughlin is an unavoidable figure. He virtually founded the city, is buried there, his home is a landmark, streets, schools and businesses are named for him. There every school child knows about Fort Vancouver and the Hudson Bay Company. In the rest of the world I fear he is an obscure personage. Ms. Morrison has done extensive, (colossal?), research on McLoughlin and this is the most comprehensive biography of the man we are ever likely to see. The book is also an excellent resource for information on the HBC and the lengths to which the company went to attempt to keep the country North of the Columbia River in the British Empire. McLoughlin is a towering figure in the history of the United States and deserves more fame and renown. His likeness even stands in Statuary Hall in the United States capitol. Unfortunately despite Morrison's best efforts he is likely to remain obscure outside of the Pacific Northwest. The story of McLoughlin and his Empire is all here...if you care.
