 Put this disc in your player, turn up the volume, turn out the lights and prepare to be fascinated, horrified, stunned, assualted, and dazzled. This is not art but artful propaganda of the highest order. The full impact is only realized by viewing it beginning to end without interuption. Stay with it through the seemingly endless troop review and you will understand why that interminable sequence exists. Leave the historical commentary for later.  This film is powerfully disturbing even 66 years after it was created. It is impossible to discern the power it might have had when first released. It must have at once reassured the German people and invoked fear in the rest of the world. The film is rife with premonitions of what the future will hold.  It is not easy to sit through 120 minutes of Hitler worship but it has it's rewards. The editing is flawless, the changing rythmn of the edits building to a crescendo. The metaphors, sexual and otherwise are everywhere. In our sophisticated age the manipulation of the viewer is obvious, but the very obviousness of it reveals the insidious intent. This is such a powerful film that it is impossible to communicate its effect. It must be seen to be comprehended. A must see for every student of the motion picture, politics, mass psychology, or the power of myth.
