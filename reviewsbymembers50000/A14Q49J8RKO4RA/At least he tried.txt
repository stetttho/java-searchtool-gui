 What saves this effort at all is the subject matter. The transcontinental railroad and its story is so grand that it is hard to screw it up. Stephen Ambrose has made a valiant effort but even with his great literary prowess he has proved unable to destroy the magic of the tale. Other reviewers have pointed out the repetitions, the errors, the plagarisms. I will point out just one strange one. On my copy of the book the rear cover prints reviews and raves for his Lewis and Clark book. At first glance you are prone to interpret it applying to this one.  Mr. Ambrose, we still love you and know you can do better.
