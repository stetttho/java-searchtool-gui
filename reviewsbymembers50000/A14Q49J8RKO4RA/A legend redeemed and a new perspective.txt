 This is an edit of my original review. I was chastised in a kindly manner by the author for some of my original statements, and as I reread my review I belive with good reason. Though I am entitled to my opinion I don't have the right to presume that which I do not know for a fact. Based on Mr. Carters comments I will remove the those which he has refuted or corrected. Mr. Carter, my humble apologies. The boys of my generation have a firm tribal memory of Cody. His career as a pony express rider, the "first scalp for Custer", the Wild West show performance before Queen Victoria is the kind of knowledge one just seems to "know". Perhaps the generations that have followed my own have forgotten and this book will redeem his reputation as well as rescue him from the haze of the 19th Century. It is a "good read" and is full of facts and anecdotes. Mr. Carter often presents the evidence and leaves it up to the reader to decide the verity of the story. This is a great technique and it leaves the reader with the feeling he has uncovered the truth. It might be called the multiple choice method of biography. However, it is the use of this technique that detracts from a well researched study. That said and in spite of some barbs on my part I do think this is among the finest and possibly best researched treatment of the man.
