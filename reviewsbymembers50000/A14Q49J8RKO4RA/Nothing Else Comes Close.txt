 The Journals of Lewis and Clark are about as fundamental a Western American treatise as you will find.  Tackling this leviathan is a daunting challenge but one with great rewards.  Clark copied Lewis word for word on many entries so it takes true dedication to read every word of the text.  Throw in the maps, the preparatory work of Lewis and related ephemera for good measure.  This will not only require a huge investment in time but several feet of book space.  At [the price] per volume you will also limit out your credit card.  Is it worth it?  No other work can provide the background for understanding the ensuing growth of the West.  Every single day of the journey is accounted for and there are tediously detailed accounts of the geography and navigational coordinates.  Be prepared for some of the most creative spelling ever recorded.  Once read it is an experience never to be forgotten and you will not regret the effort.
