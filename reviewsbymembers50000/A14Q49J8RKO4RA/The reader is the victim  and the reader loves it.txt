 Whether this book belongs in the non-fiction category is open to some question.  Without a doubt young Sam Clemens did escape the Civil War, go to Nevada with his brother Orion, and had many fine adventures and experiences.  But, there is always an uneasy  feeling that the reader is being had.   However, in this case you will enjoy being had and may even beg for more.  Clemens lampoons everything from Mormons to Hawaiian beauties and captures a rare moment in the history of the West... Some of it may actually be true!
