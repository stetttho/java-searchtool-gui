 Parkman was little more than a youth when he set out with a group of fellow greenhorns to tackle the Wild West.  The West really was wild in the 1840's and this book gives us a rare glance at what it was really like.  Parkman and his companions meet Indians, settlers, mountain men and wild animals and somehow avoid disaster and death.  Long considered a classic of western exploration it is also a saga of youth and freedom.
