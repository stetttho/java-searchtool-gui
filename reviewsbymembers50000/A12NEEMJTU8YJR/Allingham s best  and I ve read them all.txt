 Tiger in the Smoke is the almost unbearably tense story of a homicidal maniac on the loose in fogbound London.  Although her stock characters (Campion, Amanda, Lugg, Luke, et al) are all present, this story is utterly  unlike Allingham's other mysteries (only Tether's End is even remotely  similar).  The villain, whose identity is known early on, is possibly the  most terrifying in all of the classic British mystery genre. I could go  on, but you probably get my drift.  It's astonishing that the same author  who gave us leisurely, almost light-comedy mysteries such an More Work for  the Undertaker and The Beckoning Lady (two more of her best) could, using  the same cast of characters, produce such a taut, no-words-wasted chase  tale as this.  Allingham was certainly the most versatile, and probably the  most gifted, of all the classic British mystery writers. One last general  comment for those of you unfamiliar with Allingham's work. Her cast of  characters ages along with the author.  Albert Campion was born in 1900; in  the first book (The Crime at Black Dudley), published in the early 20s, he  appears as a slightly silly recent college graduate.  By the time of Ms.  Allingham's death in the early 60s, Campion was in *his* 60s, and fading a  bit. The other characters age correspondingly (except for the inimitable  Lugg, who couldn't).  We watch Campion fall in love, experience rejection,  fall in love again, get married, raise a family, and become a grandfather -  his character showing added depth and breadth all along the way. So, my  second time through (which I just completed), I read them in order of  publication, and I recommend that you do the same. You'll appreciate her  extraordinary gift for character development all the more.
