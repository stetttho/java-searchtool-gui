 Bill James may be one of the most brilliant baseball analysts ever, and he put Sabremetrics (the advanced statistical analysis of baseball) on the map.  But in my opinion he's even more gifted as a writer than he is as a statistician.  And somehow I feel that these days, he's mainly lending his name to the work -  worthy though it may be - of others, in order to give it instant credibility. Find yourself an old copy of This Time Let's Not Eat The Bones (or The Historical Baseball Abstract, or any of the early Abstracts), settle down with it on a rainy March afternoon, and you'll see what I mean.  Bill, wherever you are, it's time to stop living off your royalites.  We miss your inimitable, trenchant, hilarious PROSE!
