 Duncan is a masterful wordsmith; this no one can reasonably dispute.  But over the years, he has become so full of himself, so pretentious and self-important, that to me he is almost unreadable.  I give the book two stars because of a little bit of excellent fly fishing content, and because of Duncan's undeniable writing ability.  But before you buy it, you should read Donald Miller's hilarious send-up of Duncan (whom he labels Trendy Writer) in "Blue Like Jazz."  Don Miller -- now there's a guy who has something significant to say on metaphysical themes.  Duncan is merely showing off; Khwaja Khadir indeed!
