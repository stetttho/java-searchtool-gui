 Copan's book, at its core, is simply a defense of the Law of Non-Contradiction.  Consider the dilemma implied by the book's title.  Is the statement "all truth is relative" a relative truth?  If it's  RELATIVELY true, then the statement itself cannot be trusted, since it may  be untrue.  If it's ABSOLUTELY true, then it contradicts itself, in that it  simultaneously asserts and denies that there is at least one absolute  truth.  In other words, if it's true, it's false; and if it's false, it's  false. Or consider the relativistic religious statement, "all  religons lead to God."  This is a logical impossibility, since many of  them assert that there is only one way to God.  So either all exclusivistic  religions are false, in which case they do NOT lead to God, or else one  exclusivistic religion is true, in which case NO other religion leads to  God.  In either case, the premise is disproved.  I have a few questions  for the reviewers who downrated this book: Mormons, JWs and Catholics, as  well as evangelical Christians, all assert "truths" that  contradict some of the "truths" of the others.  So they can't all  be right, can they? Copan's logical scalpel cuts deep; you can't reject his  logic simply because you don't like its implications.  HOW is it  invalid? Perhaps one of you could supply some examples of the  "twisted logic" or "empty semantics" that demonstrate  the "sheer lunacy of religion" or the book's lack of  "heart".  Rhetoric is empty unless backed up with specifics. It  all goes to show that you can't fool Mother Logic.  A great book!
