 I'm a lifelong Texan, but my family and I have been vacationing in Montana off and on for many years.  We've done all the standard tourist stops several times over.  So this book provides just what we need. Here you will find the places and people that make Montana unique.  You'll discover Joe, Montana (yes, it was).  You'll drop in at the Jersey Lilly Saloon in Ingomar (pop. 10), home of internationally famous...uhh...beans.  You'll visit the Fairview Bridge, which could accommodate trains and automobiles - just not both at once!  You'll learn all about lefse, the potato-based, Norwegian version of tortillas.  You'll stroll through an incredible rock-garden recreation of the Bible.  You'll wander through the deserted streets of St. Marie - possibly the NEWEST ghost town in the U.S. So if you want to know where stay along I-94 near Billings, or what size trailer can be accommodated at Hebgen Lake Campground, this is not your book.  But you really want to get to know the state and its people, the Johaneks will take you there.  All in all, it's an engagingly-written, idiosyncratic, informative and altogether charming book.
