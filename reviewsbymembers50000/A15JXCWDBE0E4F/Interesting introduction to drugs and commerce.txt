 This book is great fun, not least because of the author's extraordinary skill in the efficient delivery of interesting facts.  The opening chapters, which detail the origins of the world's major drugs, are among the most informative I've read. The second half of the book, while still engrossing, is a less comprehensive historic analysis of drug use and prohibition. Courtwright concentrates on economics at the expense of culture, emphasizing production and commerce rather than demand and moral opposition.  Given the enormous social influences in the modern world, such as the American cultural war against 60's drug use and the pervasive use of alcohol and tobacco as social tools, the emphasis on money and power over cultural forces in the past strikes me as an incomplete analysis.  It leads the author to unconvincingly argue that American prohibition and its repeal were primarily the results of economic interests (a "contradiction of capitalism").  Oddly, the same events in the Soviet Union are attributed to "popular resistance", without any comparative discussion of the two nations.  Finally, the value of pleasure and the concept of individual rights are generally neglected. In the end, my main problem with is that Courtwright doesn't give culture the excellent and amusing treatment he gives commerce.  I can think of worse things to say about a book.
