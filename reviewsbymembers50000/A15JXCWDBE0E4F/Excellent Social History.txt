 "Embracing Defeat" is a fascinating and well written social history of the American occupation of Japan. It primarily concentrates on the cultural reconstruction of a defeated population, the Japanese reaction to "revolution from above" while simultaneously coming to terms with their nation's wartime responsibility. The relationship between the occupiers and Hirohito is given particular scrutiny.    Like many popular history books, the author relies primarily on writers and major political figures as sources of record. While the Japanese bureaucracy is frequently alluded to, relatively little is said about how it was able to adapt and recover under occupation. Similarly, there are very few details about the physical reconstruction of a nation of devastated cities. After reading of the enormity of the destruction and the massive homelessness which resulted, I wondered how one could organize such an immense rebuilding task -- particular given the national mood of resignation which is explained in excellent detail. Unfortunately I'm still wondering.    Finally, the politics of the book lean a bit leftward. It is by no means a polemic, but if that sort of thing gets you hot and bothered you might want to skip the chapter concerning the communist party.
