 This book is a excellent and surprisingly balanced history of the Soviet prison system.  Applebaum readily admits that it is an incomplete first attempt at the full story, but she has gone beyond the horror show and has seriously considered why and how the Gulag system came to be. "Gulag" offers no apologies for communist rule -- it begins by calling the prisons concentration camps and wonders why the Nazis are commonly seen as a greater historical evil than the Soviets -- but the damning tone of the introduction moderates when the details of the camps are discussed.  When passing on the grislier stories from survivors' memoirs, Applebaum often notes that these were generally extreme situations and that many writers' concentration on the politicals does not represent the general prison population, the majority of which was composed of the common criminal element that would be imprisoned in every modern society.  The camps themselves were not designed to torture and kill (although they did), but rather to be profitable (they never were).  Camp death figures are usefully compared to contemporary death rates in the greater Soviet population, which by modern standards were astonishingly high.  It is also made clear that reliable figures and non-anecdotal sources are still rare and much remains unknown about the administration of the camps.  This constant historical context and intellectual honesty makes Gulag an excellent first history of the Soviet labor camps. Gulag obviously, and appropriately, lacks the overwhelming literary flair of Solzhenitzyn's "Ivan Denisovich" and "Gulag Archipelago".  Applebaum has the adequate writing style of a journalist, which doesn't covey the grandeur often found in the best historical writing.  For the most part the tone is very matter-of-fact, filled with both anecdotes as well as statistics, with the exceptions being the damning first and final chapters.
