 Ackroyd's London is not history in terms of names and dates, Important People and their Parliamentary Acts, or hard statistics. It is primarily a series of vivid descriptions of human activities in the city, a history of London from the bottom up -- but not very far up. Overall I thought it was a treat to read, filled with engrossing lore and occasionally extraordinary writing. But when the prose fails, its pomposity is disastrous. Most difficult to take are the grandiose statements which end far too many of his paragraphs. Fascinating anecdotes are followed by gratuitously solemn and pretentious conclusions about how "The city's topography is a palimpsest within which all the most magnificent or monstrous cities of the world can be discerned" or overwrought metaphorical nonsense in the same vein. I enjoy this sort of thing when it is done with restraint, but Mr Ackroyd is frequently out of control. The book is also entirely devoid of any sense of humor, but then no one reads Ackroyd for his sharp wit.
