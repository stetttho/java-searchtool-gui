 Lincoln's "Sunlight at Midnight" has some excellent moments, but is frequently superficial and a little dull.  The book is primarily a cultural history of St Petersburg, featuring the usual cast of writers (Pushkin, Gogol, Belyi), poets (Blok, Akhmatova, Brodsky), and composers (Tchaikovsky, Shostakovich).  The Romanov rulers and their tastes in architecture are discussed extensively, as are the Soviets and their tastes in censorship. The first three chapters are primarily a cultural history of imperial Russia following Peter the Great's reign.  They deal mostly in court affairs and architects, neither of which are particularly interesting.  Next come descriptions of Petersburg's literary and musical history, which are spotty and do not compare well with the detail of Solomon Volkov's "St Petersburg". The tone changes abruptly when we reach the late nineteenth century, and the reliance on artistic sources gives way to a more popular account of the revolutionary period.  Events are well presented but the story is told too quickly.  The months between abdication and Bolshevik takeover, for example, pass in a single paragraph.  I would have gladly exchanged twenty early pages on the styles of palace facades for some details of the provisional government's failure and the October coup. The chapter on the Leningrad siege is a masterpiece of narrative history, but the book unfortunately returns to cultural matters and Soviet repression of artists in the postwar period.  This is interesting stuff, but not remotely as gripping as the events of the previous decades and written in a cursory style more suited to a review for a knowledgeable reader.
