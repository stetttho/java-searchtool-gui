 The Ancestor's Tale is an update on the current understanding of human evolution, moving backwards through the points of common ancestry with other species. Dawkins calibrates the certainty of each step, illustrates his points with modern organisms, and justifies his reputation as an excellent science writer.                                                                                  The book's greatest strength is Dawkins's skill in presenting zoology. "The Beaver's Tale", "The Duckbill's Tale", and "The Axolotl's Tale" are outstanding examples of modern naturalism. The classical genetics is adequate, but the molecular data is explained minimally and not compelling. More details on the challenges and uncertainties inherent in genomic sequencing and cross-species comparisons would have been helpful.                                                                                  When Dawkins is not discussing zoology, the writing is overly verbose and suffers the professor's conceit of assuming his readers are interested in his opinions on matters beyond his expertise, which are infused with the type of absolutism he criticizes elsewhere in the book. The poor, strangely moralistic mathematics and moribund politics are best left for the faculty lounge or starry-eyed students.                                                                                  This is a good 600-page book that could be a great 300-page book with some vigorous editing.
