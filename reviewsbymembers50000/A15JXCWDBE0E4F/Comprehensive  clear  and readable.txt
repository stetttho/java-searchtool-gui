 Misha Glenny succeeds marvelously at presenting a broad history of southeastern Europe as a combination of national and international forces.  He does not unduly belabor his points, he is generally fair to all his subjects, and he organizes an incredible amount of information into a coherent framework without relying on grandiose theories.  Some academic types may deride this as mere "informed journalism", but it is refreshing to read a history book of this scale in which the author relies on knowledge and literary competence rather than hagiography, melodrama, or overindulgent theorizing. Throughout the book Glenny tries to demonstrate that the region's contemporary problems are mainly the result of interference from the great powers rather than suppressed historical animosities.  Ultimately I think the book demonstrates otherwise, showing that while the great powers were excellent enablers, strife in the Balkans has consistently been fueled by local alliances, less-than-neighborly designs on Bosnia, Croat fascism, Serb nationalism, Albanian exceptionalism, etc.  That Glenny's point can be well taken but is not entirely convincing is an enormous credit to him as a writer even if it diminishes him as an advocate. The greatest problem I have with the book is that it is not long enough.  Postwar history, which reads as a comparatively brief outline, could use another two hundred pages.
