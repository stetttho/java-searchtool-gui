 Like other reviewers, I found this book hilarious, brazenly honest (adopting a baby to fulfill a book contract?!), and engagingly written.  The initial, pre-kid chapters describing the relationship with his boyfriend and their decision to become parents are, as expected, opinionated and funny.  Although he is by no means reserved, Savage tones down his aggressive sex columnist style and maintains an even humor throughout. The tale becomes more than merely fun with the introduction of the pregnant street kid who agrees to give them her baby.  Savage puts away the soapbox and tells a rather affecting story about pregnancy and birth without becoming cloying, cynical, or overly self-involved.  Incidental details about the open adoption process and gutter punk culture add a lot to the narrative. In the end I was amused to see that the only people who seemed concerned about the adopting parents' sexuality were the happy fathers themselves and that, political rhetoric aside, Savage is quite a family-values man.
