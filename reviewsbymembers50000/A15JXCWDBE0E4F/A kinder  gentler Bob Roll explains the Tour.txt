 "The Tour de France Companion" is a concise and well written introduction to the Tour. As other reviewers have noted, Bob Roll appears to have been working with a strong editor and/or sedatives, and the manic Bobke style only occasionally appears (it's most evident in his comments about Jan Ullrich).                                                                                              As a long-time cycling fan I can't say that I learned anything new about the organization or strategy of the Tour, but there are plenty of historical anecdotes to keep the reading interesting. There are also a few gems, like the 1994 photo of youngsters Armstrong, Pantani, and Virenque climbing together. Ten years and three tumultuous careers later, one wonders what they were thinking then. One might also wonder what Virenque was thinking with that haircut.                                                                                              And, yes, the book is Lance-centric. Sort of like the last five Tours.
