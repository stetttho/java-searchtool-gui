 Ted Conover's interest in the NY State Correction Officer's training program led him to spend a year working as a CO at Sing Sing Prison.  Unencumbered by polemical fervor, the resulting book is honest, graceful, and infused with respect toward nearly everyone on both sides of the bars.  The inmates are depicted with sympathy while not ignoring their initial crimes and menacing behavior in prison; the officers are presented as individuals performing a dangerous job without discounting their questionable acts.  The prison administration is the only side cast in a uniformly negative light, with its shortcomings detailed without a discussion of its limited resources and bureaucratic constraints.  When the author eventually states his own suggestions for reform they come without moralistic rhetoric of any sort, appealing to intellect instead of inflaming emotions. The informative, straightforward narrative is improved with engrossing historical background on the origins and evolution of Sing Sing, often drawn from nineteenth-century sources.  There is also a very interesting epilogue about the response to the first edition.
