 "A People's Tragedy" is a rather detailed account of the Russian Revolution which maintains an excellent balance of erudition and lucidity.  Figes convincingly presents the revolution as a 33-year process involving many contending interests without ever losing his focus on the eventual replacement of Tsarism with Communism. The first few chapters address the state of the Romanov regime in the decades preceding its overthrow, various parliamentary and cultural movements at the turn of the century, and the organization of the peasantry following the abolition of serfdom.  This background information later proves essential. One can see, for example, how the land management and village self-governance of the peasants led to the soviet structure used by the victorious Reds.  Figes revisits these themes throughout the book, depicting a Romanov dynasty that was more bumbling autocracy than cruel tyranny and raising the peasants from their usual role as a haplessly oppressed mass to a significant political force. I found the treatment of the Bolsheviks to be relatively sympathetic, and the book does not suffer because of it.  They are depicted as a ruthless and especially fortunate revolutionary faction, a group ready to use any means necessary to obtain power but, in the end, given a gift with the success of their unlikely coup.  Some readers may find this insufficiently damning but, while I would have liked a little more about how the nature of the revolution affected later developments, the abominable governance which followed is not Figes's topic.
