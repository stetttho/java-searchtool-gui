 Orlando Innamorato is an absolutely beautiful story.  It is in the same style as Orlando Furioso (by Ariosto), which is its sequel.  We follow Charlemagne's paladins as they traverse the world, pagan and Christian,  looking for adventure, fame, and especially love.  The Saracen princess  Angelica has captured the heart of the brave and chivalrous Orlando and he  will do anything to earn her love.  The only problem is that she remains  uninterested. It also seems that nearly every knight in the Christian and  Saracen world desires her too!  The Christians and Muslims are almost  constantly at war, so this is another obstacle in the way of poor, lovesick  Orlando.  With this premise, Boiardo narrates a story of epic proportions  that is enchanting, funny, exciting, and always beautiful.  He combines  irony, allegory, romance, chivalry and much more to create a masterpiece.   The stories contained are similar to the Arthurian legends, but are, in my  opinion, livelier and more exciting.  I agree with C.S. Lewis when he  wrote: "Our oblivion of these poets (i.e. Boiardo and Ariosto) is much to  be regretted...because it robs us of a whole species of pleasures and narrows  our very conception of literature."    This edition is beautifully  rendered into verse, but it is abridged.  The complete poetic text of the  story is not present.  However, the translator always summarizes (in  narrative form) those parts he leaves out.  There is also a useful  introduction and extremely helpful annotations that explain difficult  passages in the story.  I highly recommend this book, especially if you are  a fan of Orlando Furioso or Pulci's Morgante.
