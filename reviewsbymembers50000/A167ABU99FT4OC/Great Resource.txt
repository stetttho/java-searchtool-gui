 This book will lead the reader through an inspiring forty days in the company of St. Francis, one of the most popular Saints.  There are forty daily devotions that average 2-3 pages each.  They consist of a selected  Scripture verse (or verses), a passage from the writings of St. Francis  (prayers, excerpts from his letters, etc.) and a final prayer by the editor  that is related to the passage from Francis.  The devotions include such  topics as loving your enemies, God's transforming power, joy, and praise to  the Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit.  I wish the book were longer, but  overall it is an excellent devotional resource.
