 This is a good Bible for Catholics and even non-Catholics. The translation itself (NAB) is solid and on the conservative side, although some of the wording seems a bit bland at times.  The notes are also an important part of the text and provide lots of valuable information.   The St. Joseph edition includes illustrations, a Bible dictionary, and the  cycle of readings for Sunday Mass.  The low price is another plus.  I  highly recommend this Bible.
