 This is a great resource for anyone who has a good knowledge of New Testament Greek and wants a copy of the New Testament in Greek.  This is NOT an interlinear (first line in Greek, second line a literal English  translation); the Greek text here remains un-translated.  However, the NIV  and NRSV translations appear to the left and right of the block of Greek  text, which is the United Bible Societies' 4th edition.  This is the best  critical text available.  The alternate textual readings appear in the  Greek text only if they are found in the footnotes of the NIV and/or NRSV.   So, every alternate reading may not be present in this Greek New Testament. Overall, this is a very useful book, and as a student of  the Greek language, I have used it many times.
