 The Baroque period (1600-1750) was one of the most important in the history of music because many of our modern musical forms come from this time.  The baroque style is diverse, including such elements as contrast  and a deep emotionalism.  Although orchestras perform the songs, many  individual instruments are highlighted.  The baroque composers especially  loved strings, the trumpet, and the oboe.  The songs range from the vibrant  and the lively to the slow and the sad.  I have found this CD is excellent  as background music for studying, reading, or driving in rush hour traffic,  mainly because the music is calming and relaxing.  Baroque masters such as  Bach and Handel are still popular today and their songs are loved by many.   Fans of popular music will recognize a few of the songs on this CD.  "Air  on the G String" (Bach) was used by Procol Harum in their song "A Whiter  Shade of Pale."  "Canon," one of the most popular baroque songs today, is  often performed at weddings and has been incorporated into pop songs by  artists such as the Trans-Siberian Orchestra, Vitamin C, and Rod McKuen.    This CD is considered an introduction to baroque music.  It includes  some of the most famous composers and their best songs.  For example, Bach,  Handel, and Vivaldi each have three songs on this disc.  The liner notes  are sparse, but a brief history of baroque music is included.  Because of  the inexpensive price and the huge amount of music (25 songs, 74 minutes of  music), I highly recommend this for anyone who already loves the baroque  style or wants an excellent introduction to this beautiful music.
