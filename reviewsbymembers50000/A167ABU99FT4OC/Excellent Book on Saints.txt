 This book is a great addition to the library of anyone who wants to know more about the lives of the great men and women of the Christian Faith.  It includes Saints from the New Testament/Apostolic Age until the modern day.   Each entry gives an excellent description of each Saint's life and work.   It also has the reason for canonization (martyr, bishop, etc.) and the date  it occurred, the date of birth and death, and the person's feast day in the  Church (usually in the western calendar).  Although the entries usually  include only the basic information (about half a page on average), at the  end of each entry the authors have added a reading list for those who wish  to learn more about each Saint.  The book also has an introduction that  addresses such issues as sources, confessors, martyrs, and canonization.  A  glossary of terms is present, which includes a basic definition of words  that may be difficult for some (e.g. Monothelism and Cenobite).  The  Dictionary has a useful appendix that contains a list of patron Saints,  emblems, and a calendar of the feast days of the Saints listed.  Although  The Penguin Dictionary of Saints is very useful, I should mention that it  includes mainly Roman Catholic Saints.  Many of those canonized only (or  deemed more important) in the Eastern Orthodox Church are  not present, although the authors have included most of the universally  accepted Saints (and even many minor ones) from both the East and Great  Britain.  Overall, this is an excellent resource that no Christian should  be without; I use it all the time.
