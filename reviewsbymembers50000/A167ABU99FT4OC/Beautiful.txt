 This is a wonderful book that celebrates the beauty of nature in verse.   The book begins with winter poems, goes through spring, summer, and finally  ends with the fall.  The poems are usually only one or two pages long and  they are done in a variety of styles.  All of the poets are famous masters,  including Wordsworth, Milton, Blake, Shakespeare, Longfellow, Emerson,  Thoreau, Keats, and Tennyson.  Poems of Nature also includes many  beautiful, full-color pictures on nearly every page.  The book is small and  only contains 64 pages, making it an excellent gift for the lover of poetry  and nature.
