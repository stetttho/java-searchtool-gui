 This prayer book is excellent for personal devotion and for a glimpse into the life of the Church.  It includes a variety of prayers for many different occasions.  The book is divided into three parts: 1) The Christian Vocation:  This part includes prayers addressed to the Trinity.   It contains the Jesus Psalter, the Litany of the Sacred Heart, the Way of  the Cross, and the Devotion to the Five Sacred Wounds, as well as various  Psalms and other prayers.  2) The Sacraments:  This section has the  prayers and liturgy relating to Baptism, the Eucharist, and Reconciliation.   The latter is particularly useful in personal devotion since it contains  excerpts from the penitential Psalms.  3) Prayer:  This is the longest  section and has daily prayers (e.g. morning prayers), family prayers (e.g.  grace before meals), the Jesus prayer, and prayers for special occasions  (e.g. for peace, for the harvest).  It also has prayers to Mary and the  Saints. Although Michael Buckley wrote some of the prayers, most have  been taken from famous Christian authors.  They come from many periods of  Church history, ranging from the earliest days until modern times.  Prayers  by notable Protestants such as T.S. Eliot and William Barclay are included,  but most of the writers are Roman Catholic.  I would recommend this book to  everyone, Catholic or non-Catholic, who wants to enrich his/her prayer  life.
