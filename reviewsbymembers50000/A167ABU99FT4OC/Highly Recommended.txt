 The New Jerusalem Bible is an excellent version and I recommend it for all Christians.  The translation is easy to read, yet can be quite poetic, scholarly, yet also for the layman.  The notes that make up much of the  Regular Edition (which I recommend over the others) are also quite academic and informative (and come from a Catholic viewpoint).  Yahweh is used for the divine name instead of the more common  LORD, which will sound strange to most ears.  Overall, I highly recommend  this Bible.
