 The Good News Bible is probably the best version to read in order to grasp the basic meaning of biblical passages.  It is easy to read, but does not come across as undignified and overly colloquial.  This edition includes  the complete Roman Catholic canon and other books not considered inspired  (1 and 2 Esdras and the Prayer of Manasseh).  It also contains essays on  such topics as Biblical history, literature, and important themes.   However, these essays are the same ones present in many editions of the New  American Bible.  There are also boxes in the biblical text relating to  certain themes (e.g. the Dead Sea, the Jewish Calendar, etc.) that contain  additional notes.  This is not, however, a study bible in the true sense,  but there are a variety study aids.  Overall, this is a great addition to a  Christian's biblical library.
