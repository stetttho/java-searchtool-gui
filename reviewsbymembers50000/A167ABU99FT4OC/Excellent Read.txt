 Dr. Metzger has given the reader an invaluable resource for the study of the text of the New Testament.  The book is divided into three major parts.  Part one begins with a detailed description of the ancient method of  bookmaking.  Next, Metzger lists the major Greek manuscripts and codices as  well as a basic description of each.  He also lists the major non-Greek  witnesses (e.g. Syriac, Coptic, Latin, etc.) and discusses the role of  quotations from the early church Fathers.  Part two is devoted to the  history of the printed editions of the Greek New Testament from the time of  the Complutensian Polyglot and the Textus Receptus (the text used for the  KJV) through Westcott and Hort until the present day.  Part three is an  instruction manual for textual criticism, including the many theories of  criticism and the method of conjectural emendation.  In this section,  Metzger also discusses the many types of errors and deliberate changes made  by the scribes.  He then gives an analysis of several textually difficult  passages (e.g. Mark 16 and Acts 20:28).  The book also includes 16 photo  plates that show selected manuscripts.  A working knowledge of Greek is  helpful because Metzger often cites Greek words in the text and footnotes  without an English translation.  If one wishes to learn the basics (and  more) about textual criticism, then this is the book to buy.
