 This book could properly be called "The C.S. Lewis Reader," because it is a collection of Lewis' essays, sermons, and excerpts from his books.  The writings are arranged by topic.  On the plus side, this format allows the  reader to find out Lewis' thoughts about various topics.  His brilliant  mind tackles such issues as life on other planets, atheism, the Trinity,  and over 120 other engaging topics.  The negative is that many of the  excerpts are usually only two or three paragraphs long and this does not  allow a person access to Lewis' whole opinion on that particular subject.   Still, the book includes an index that shows which books the essays were  taken from.  This allows the reader to explore Lewis' views more in depth.   Overall, I highly recommend this book.  It acts as an excellent  introduction to the thought of C.S. Lewis for a new reader or a handy  topical reference for those already familiar with him.
