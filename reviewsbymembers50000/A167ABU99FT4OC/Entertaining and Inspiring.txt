 Francis is one of the most famous Saints today, although most only know him through his famous prayer ("Lord make me an instrument of they peace...").  This is the book to read in order to find out more about  his life.  The Little Flowers could in many ways be called the "Acts  of Francis and His Followers," as it chronicles their journeys and  miracles, and records their wisdom.  The stories are not historical  accounts in the modern sense, but oral traditions that tend to be on the  legendary side (e.g. he communicates with animals, talks to Saints in  heaven).  This particular translation by Raphael Brown is excellent for the  it also has The Considerations of the Holy Stigmata, The Life of Brother  Juniper, The Life of Brother Leo, and the Sayings of Brother Giles.   2)	Brown has added sixteen additional chapters of material that  have never before appeared in English.  3)	It contains a lengthy  introduction and an appendix to guide those who wish to learn more about  the history of the book and the life of St. Francis.  The appendix is  particularly valuable because it has a biographical sketch of the  characters and short annotations that illuminate difficult passages in the  book.   4)	The translation from Italian and Latin to English is  very readable.   If you want entertaining, amusing, and inspiring  stories in a quality package, then check out The Little Flowers of St.  Francis as translated/edited by Raphael Brown.
