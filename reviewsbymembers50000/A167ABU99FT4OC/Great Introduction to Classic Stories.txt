 This book is an excellent mythology reader.  The first section is devoted to the stories of gods and heroes.  The majority of the stories is from Greco-Roman mythology and includes such classics as Apollo and Daphne,  Pygmalion, The Golden Fleece, Midas, The Sibyl, and much more.  This part  also devotes four chapters to Eastern Mythology (Hindu myths, Zoroastor,  etc.), Norse mythology (Thor, etc.) and The Druids of Iona.  Part two is  made up of the popular Arthurian legends and contains many of the most  famous stories such as Tristam and Isoude, the quest for the Holy Grail,  and the Death of Arthur.  Much of this section is rendered in verse.  This  part also has the Mambinogeon and other myths of the British race (e.g.  Beowulf and Robin Hood).  The final section (my personal favorite) includes  the legends of Charlemagne, or more specifically those of his paladins.   This is where one can find stories of Orlando, Rinaldo, and Ogier the Dane.  These stories are not as famous as the Arthurian legends, but are just as  exciting.  There is a very helpful dictionary of names and terms and a few  maps and illustrations.  Also, the English is fairly easy to read and  shouldn't be difficult for the average person.  This book is not complete;  many of the stories are obviously abridged.  It would be nice if it  included annotations or a bibliography for those wanting to read more in  depth.  However, the introduction includes a very basic history of the  stories, which should help the more enterprising reader find the unabridged  editions.  Still, Bulfinch's Mythology is one of the best and least  expensive ways become acquainted with these classic stories.  I highly  recommend it!
