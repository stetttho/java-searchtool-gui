 Stephen Hunter's best novel of all time.  You absolutely have to read this book.  My wife, mother, and grandmoths also read the book and love it too, weird since it's a book about guns. Too bad Stephen Hunter's books peaked here, he hasn't written a good one to this level since.  They're all just wanna be novels. Buy it, you will love it no matter what your tastes.
