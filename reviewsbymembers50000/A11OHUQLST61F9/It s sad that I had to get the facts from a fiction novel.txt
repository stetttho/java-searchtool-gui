 This was a great book.  I read it two weeks ago and loved it but didn't bother to write a review until I read the paper this morning where it recounts how all the top scientists are saying this book is wrong etc. etc.  To say there is a slant out in media is an understatement.  I honestly believe that Michael Crichton went into this with an open mind and was willing to be persuaded either way.  It's rare you find a public figure with courage to say "I don't know" when they don't.    He really exposes our natural human arrogance that we're the end all be all of creatures on this planet when really we're just a blip.  Every now and then the planet shows us how insignificant we are.  The recent Tsunami's might be used as an example of that.  I've always assumed global warming was a fact, often finding myself blaming it for every weird quirk of the weather.   Excellent book with a good story, the global warming part is just a substory of a good plot.  Strong recommendation to read it.
