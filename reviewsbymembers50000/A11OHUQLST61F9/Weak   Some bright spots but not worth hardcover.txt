 I don't recommend this book.  I'm a avid Tom Clancy fan, I've read them all (the real ones, not the Op Center stuff) and love his work.   This one left a lot to be desired, mainly because the story is weak and Mr. Clancy's attempt to pass the torch by forcing a new Jack Ryan character down our throats to keep the series alive. My main problem is that in comes Jack Ryan Jr, the son of the famous Jack Ryan in all his previous books.  This guy annoyed me the entire book to the point I'd skip through parts where he was involved just to get to the other parts of the story (think Jar Jar Binks Jr.).  Clancy spends a lot of time forcing the fact the Jr. is "humble" by long dialogue about how his Dad and Mom are super and taught him this and that.  Problem is, he really doesn't "do" anything in the book significant and the other characters pull the load.   The other reason I don't recommend it is the story is weak.  A lot of Clancy's major events in his books are earth shattering, keep you reading all night kind of stuff.  It might be post 9/11, but it's a pretty standard terrorist event by today's comparison.  Maybe Clancy is shying away from giving terrorists new ideas (Debt of Honor's ending for example) or he's just under pressure to crank out X number of books a year. Weak story, not a waste of time but not worth hardback.
