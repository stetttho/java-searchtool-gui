 Ok, I'm 30 years old and wasted a good part of my life playing the last two Grand Theft Auto games and loved them. This one I've been playing for three days and am ready to pack it in already.  Why?  The game doesn't seem any different than Vice City so there's nothing really cool and new.  The main problem I have is the character, you're this gangster punk who wears his pants down by his underwear and cusses every 20 seconds.  I felt like shooting myself after seeing this loser.  I know it's weird but it's nice to relate to the character, this one is worthless.
