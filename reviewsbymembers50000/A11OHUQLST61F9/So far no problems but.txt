 I gave in and upgraded from 98 to XP.  I do admit it has reduced crashes and seems faster.  A little advice, you will lose all you have email wise if you use Outlook Express for you email.  All folders etc and everything in your in box goes bye bye.  Microsoft has a link on how to get it back FYI.  Don't buy the Windows XP Plus! software, waste of money.
