 I bought this and had it out for our Thanksgiving meal.  I knew in advance this thing would be the next breadmaker in our house (meaning the cool thing you use once or twice then put in a counter until it eventually gets sold in a garage sale).  But for $50 I figured we'd get the cool points when we had 10 people over for Thanksgiving.    Couple of notes: -  Forget what you think chocolate should flow like.  We melted about 4lbs of Hersheys chocolate chips with some vegetable oil to what I would expect to see in fondue and then put it in the machine as directed.  The thing started up sounding like a diesel engine.  We thought we bought a lemon but the instruction troubleshooting guide kept saying to add more vegetable oil so we did.  Eventually we had this stuff pretty "watered" down and the fountain worked and flowed great.  Although it probably didn't help its appeal when people saw us pouring tons of vegetable oil into this thing (lots of "wow, gonna be constipated tonight" comments. -  It really is easy to clean and break down and throw in the dishwasher.  The hardest thing we had to figure out was what to do with the leftover 3lbs of chocolate in the thing.   -  If you do this thing, set it up early and get it going before the party.  It has a heater so it'll just run in the background.  It will make people want to try it more seeing it the whole time.  Especially if they don't have to see you pouring eighty tons of oil into it.  Buy it, it's a nice gadget.  Just be aware that it's a ton of chocolate.  Strawberries worked best.
