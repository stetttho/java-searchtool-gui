 The most interesting parts about the book was descriptions of daily life but it gets rapidly boring (as real prison probably does too).  If you're seen the discovery channel about prisons, you probably have seen most of this before. He launches into the prison life from the beginning without telling you what happened to get him there, just when that gets interesting about 3/4 of the way done, he goes into telling us about his crime and what happened.  At that point I wasn't interested in that part (it's actually kind of boring, if a murder can be that way), I found myself skipping pages to get back to the prison to find out what happened to him ...
