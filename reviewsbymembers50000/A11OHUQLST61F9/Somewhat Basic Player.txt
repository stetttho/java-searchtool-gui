 I recently bought an HDTV with an HDMI connection.  Previous to that I had a non-progressive scan DVD player so obviously I was in need of an upgrade.   Frankly Sony was not my #1 choice in this case but the other upconverting models that I read higher reviews on were out of stock so I settled on this one.   This is a really basic DVD player in appearance, and Sony didn't exactly go out of their way to make it user friendly or particularly attractive.  The remote looks like any standard remote, hopefully you have something else that can control it because this one stinks.  I haven't bought a DVD player in a while, what was a shock was that these darn things are only 1/2 as deep as a normal component, there's just hardly anything inside these things.  The main reason any of us would buy this thing is for the HMDI and the upconverting.  On that note I was somewhat lukewarm on what it put out, not exactly blown away.  However, I think my bland response is because I just got into HDTV and any DVD picture, no matter how "upconverted" still looks somewhat lame by comparison to HDTV.    My recommendation is to stick to a nice progressive scan DVD player and wait until they change the DVD format over to something that does HD.  HMDI is over rated (plus the cable is expensive).    Update:  June 2005 - Not broken yet, but I'm just waiting on this thing to die on me.  I can totally see why these things are failing.  Terrible design.  I'm hoping you read enough reviews to not buy this junk.
