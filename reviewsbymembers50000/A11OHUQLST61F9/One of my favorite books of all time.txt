 I read a lot of books, and Point of Impact remains one of the best fiction books I've ever read.  I must have read this book 20 times, going back in it to read the main parts over and over again.  You don't need to be a gun nut to read this book, the characters and action alone are enough to hook you.   To be honest, I stopped reading Stephen Hunter's later books after one or two failed attempts to recapture the magic of this book.  All the later novels, despite being written as prequals to this, seem like spinoffs from a successful tv show and never as good as the original.  Day before Midnight was excellent but that's about it.
