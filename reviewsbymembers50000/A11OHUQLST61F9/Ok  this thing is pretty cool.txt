 I've read all the reviews, even Consumer Reports.  Yes, they are right.  This thing is really a mediocre vacuum cleaner.  However, we really like this thing.  We schedule it to turn on right after we go to bed, it's quiet enough to where you don't notice it.  Our dogs hate it because it seems to track them down to bump into them but otherwise it's cool.  Our house has two medium size dogs and a ton of hair.  We really should vacuum the house every day to keep ahead of them.  With this thing we do, but it requires no work on our part.  Our main floor is about 50% hardwood and the rest carpet and this thing probably gets more stuff off the hardwood than the carpet.  It runs daily and I have to empty it almost every day (it's easy).  It keeps ahead of the hair and we actually look like we have a dog free existence.    Yes, it's a low end vacuum.  But it does your work for you and does a really good job.    The scheduler thing is cool, but the price difference is enough to make me wonder if I should have saved the money and just hit the start button before we went to bed.
