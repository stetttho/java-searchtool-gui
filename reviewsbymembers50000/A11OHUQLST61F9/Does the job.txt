 Like most people, I have a bunch of VCR tapes with lots of memories on them and no way to get them to last a while longer since we all know VCR's are gone soon.  I had priced services that transfer the stuff for you and it rapidly approached the cost of this machine.  Combine that with the fact I needed a new DVD player and this worked out fine.  Look, this is an el cheapo unit but it does the job.  I have been recording DVD's all weekend and it has been working great.  Fairly simple to do.  Once you figure out the specific steps it pretty much does everything you need.  I read reviews saying the DVD-R's don't work and such.  I use Memorex DVD-R's that are 4x rated and I bought them through Amazon (actually through "Dynadirect" but bought through Amazon) for $15 for a 25 pack bundle.  They work just fine.  I have not done much else with this unit like watch movies or anything so I can't review on that.  I'd buy it again.
