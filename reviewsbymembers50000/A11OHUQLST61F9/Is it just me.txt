 I love the Lee Child books but Echo Burning was a disappointment.  Jack Reacher is an outstanding character but this book throws him in the most boring place on earth! He spends all his time on this farm in the middle of Texas trying to find out if this girl's story is true.  Despite the fact that he's a modern day Robin Hood, she jerks him around so much that by the time you find out you really don't care what her problem is.  Meanwhile these totally shallow assasins are roaming around and you know somehow they'll end up in Jack Reacher's way and...well the rest is obvious.       The weakness of this book is character development, a real let down. If you like the Jack Reacher character, get the book. Just don't buy into the amazing reviews about it.
