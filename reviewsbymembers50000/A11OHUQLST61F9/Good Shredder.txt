 Decided to write this just as I came back to buy a second one of these.  I've had mine for about 4 months and I use it in our kitchen.  It's nice when I get junk mail like credit card offers that I can just put the whole unopened envelope in this shredder and it's gone worry free.  95% of the time it takes the entire thing without a hiccup, sometimes it jams from the envelope having too much in it, but I just back it up a little and work it through.  I'm buying another one for upstairs, I like how it reduces the amout of times you have to empty the trash.
