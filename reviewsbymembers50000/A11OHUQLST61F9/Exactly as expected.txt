 I was getting tired of backing up all my important files to DVD's and was getting ready to wipe out my Windows and start over so I wanted a single source for dumping all my important stuff.  This hard drive worked perfectly, and at a good price.  I have the old USB connections and it works fine, I'm not sure if it's slow because I'm mainly dumping huge files on it for backup and walking away, not running programs off it.  The only thing that is funny is the "Designed by FA Porsche" thing.  Pretty cheesy if you ask me.  The thing is a freaking box with no styling whasoever.  Do they think we'll buy this thing looking for a spoiler or leather seats?  Jeese.    - Update (Oct 05):  Unit stopped working cold about a week ago.  Would not power up at all.  This would be an update to complain about it but I'm not because their service department took the unit no questions asked and whisked it back to me after repairs at no cost to me (lost the data).  Two things to take from this: Note the failure I had and compare it with other feedback, not sure if I got a lemon or this thing has a problem.  Also note they do great support work.
