 I love this game and can't stop playing it.  The fact that you can spend your time just causing mayhem in a completely unscripted manner is so awesome.  What other game on earth could you open up with an M-16 in a crowded street, when the cops and ambulance comes you shoot them too and steal the ambulance.  Of course then you end up in a running firefight with helicopters and tanks after you but that's fun too.  I love the full city and how different parts open up throughout the game.  The radio stations are great too.  This is definately a game for mature minded people, I know kids play this but only get it for kids who understand reality vs. gameplay becuase it's pretty "evil".
