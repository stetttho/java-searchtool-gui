 I love Grisham's books mainly because they are interesting and not too deep.  I liked this book because it taught me about torts which I previously knew nothing about.  Otherwise the story is pretty weak, nothing unpredictable happens, the guy starts at the bottom, gets to the top, then falls to the bottom and becomes "humble".  That's pretty much it.  I wouldn't say it was a waste of time reading it but it sure wasn't worth paying for the hardback.  Wait for paperback or borrow the book from someone.
