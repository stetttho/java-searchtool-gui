 I guess I'm considered the ideal source for info on the high end TV's.  I own three of the top models from Consumers and Cnet.  I have the Sony XBR960 Tube HDTV which is supposedly the best but it's a 34" Tube tv, I just moved and bought the Panasonic TH-42PX42U and now I just got the TH-50PX50U.  These things are in extremely short supply.  We loved our Panasonic 42" so much I ended up having to pay retail on the 50" (3999) just to get it.  I'm pretty sure Panasonic is either coming out with a new model soon or they're just oversold.  My TV says it was made in Jan 2006 on the back and it's mid Feb right now so maybe they're just not keeping up.  Like I said, I own the Sony XBR960 which is Cnet's best TV.  The one thing I don't think people realize is that on that TV the HD is absolutely perfect, awe inspiring type stuff. Problem is, it's a freaking 34" screen.  It's kind of like concentrated TV, of course it's going to look good.  Problem with that is the Sony's regular TV looks terrible, pretty much makes you leave it on those weird INHD stations all day.  On to the Panasonic 50".  The best thing about plasmas are the bright screen and the fact that all grades of TV look really really good.  That's the big difference I notice.  My wife is amazed by it.  It's hard to describe what I mean by "bright", maybe powerful is a better word for the picture.  HD looks better than standard, but what's great is all tv looks really great.  I actually have both my 42" and 50" Panasonics on table tops and don't wall mount them, I like them that much that I was willing to pay more just to get plasma.  (I also know I move a lot and you can do a lot more with a plasma in the future.  I'd hate to get stuck with a monster LCD projection and nowhere to put it).    Hope this helps.  Hope you can find one.  I bought both these TV's blind, just going off Cnet and Consumer reports and other folks recommendations.  They're awesome.
