 I've been using this for about a year now and am very happy with it. I like the two minute timer option a lot because I find myself "rushed" sometimes and only brush a little, this forces me to finish.  My teeth are a lot cleaner now.   Ok, the only complaint I have is with regards to the cleaning of this.  Disclaimer - I consider myself a typical guy.  I'm used to washing my toothbrush off and sitting it by the sink and that's about it.  You can't do that with this toothbrush.  I have to clean it off and dry it out before storing it on the charger.  Why?  Because the water and any residual toothpaste caught in the little crevices on this thing will start to stink in about a day.  Ain't nothing fun about going to use your toothbrush and it smells like, well, I'll just leave that area of the body off this post.
