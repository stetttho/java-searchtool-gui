 I'm was so impressed by the cover (yes, I'm an HP NUT) I had to have this one. The good news:  I learned a LOT about making movies and I'm an adult! (yes, I'm admitting I play with the Quantum Pad, too, ok? :) The bad news:  Daniel Radcliffe only plays a small part in this book.  There is no behind the scenes info on either of the HP movies or Danny. However if you're buying it because as usual Leapfrog has done an excellent job of making some pretty dreary movie facts fun and exciting to learn, then by all means, Hop To IT!
