 The music in my world mostly revolves around hip-hop, R&B, and Jazz.  I went through my little "punk-rock" phase in the '80s but country I shunned like the dickens, being way "too cool" for that. A friend of mine gave me a ride home from work about ten years or so ago and the song "Love,Me" came on.  Poor thing, she was being kind of enough to give me a ride home, she didn't expect to have to pull over and find tissues. I'd been a closet country listner ever since.  It's one of those things I hide from all of my friends (it's a country thing and they wouldn't understand).  But this cd is going to get played over and over and over again in my car, and I don't care who hears it.  I'll just have to make sure I have plenty of tissues again when "Love,Me" comes on. If you see the black girl in hip hop gear with braids bobbing her head to Collin Raye, say a how-do, because you'll know it's me.
