 Delia defies all that her family thinks they understand about her.  Her husband and kids are at an age where they take her for granted.  Her sisters seem to regard her entire life as the "baby" of the family to have been picture perfect.  They almost regard her as part of the scenery, but not a real woman.  One can only take this sort of treatment for so long without doing something drastic.  And she does.  She walks away from all of them and surprises herself by creating a new life.  She tries to live simply, not just because of small salary, but out of a desire to keep her new life uncomplicated.  She finds, however, that even a simple life has it's requirements and compromises.  In the beginning, she tries to keep her belongings down to one small box, but has to make a daily shopping trip to find things she needs.  She tries to be professional or remote in her relationships only to be drawn in to friendships and an extended family of sorts anyway.  Some of the reviews here seem to find the the ending disappointing.  I thought it was unexpected, but only if you're used to needless melodrama will you find the end lacking.  No superhero blasting the scenery to bits and scooping the heroine off for another adventure will be found here.  Only love and the people and motives that shape our emotions and actions are revealed.  I found this book and Delia to be sincerly human.
