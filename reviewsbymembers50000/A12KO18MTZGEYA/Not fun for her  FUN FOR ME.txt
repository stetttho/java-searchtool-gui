 This is an excellent place to keep the Quantum Pad and the books.  It gives you four spaces for the books and you can put two per space.  It's nice to have a specific place to put it all together. (Go put that in the bag dear, it's clean up time.) Only issue: Short changes you on cartridge space.  It only gives you four spaces for the cartridges and you cannot double them up. So at max you can store 9 books (1 in the pad, 8 in the bag) but only 5 cartridges (1 in the pad, 4 in the bag) unless you just dump them in the bag with the Pad. Not to mention if you have any other Leap Frog toys that come with cartridges, you'll have absolutely no place to put those either.  My advice:  invest in a little plastic box to keep them in. The cartridges are tiny and will be easy to lose with 2 dogs and a kid in the house but at almost $.. a pop we're keeping track of those little babies. I hate to give Leap Frog an idea for free, but they really could come up with a neat little thing to store the iQuest (another Leap Frog miracle I absolutely love) and the cartridges for that too or just an organizer for the cartridges would be nice. Hop to it Leap Frog.
