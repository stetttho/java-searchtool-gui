 I've seen a couple of review saying that they've had trouble downloading from the website.  I must say that patience in this case is truly a virtue. If you're expecting anything to download in seconds or even minutes, it's not going to happen.  I can wash a reasonable stack of dinner dishes before the download of more than one chapter of a textbook takes place.  Anything more than one chapter and you can be waiting for a good five to ten minutes, maybe more. You cannot hit the back buttons on your browser; you cannot stop and start all over again thinking the next time will be faster; you cannot keep clicking the buttons and finally give up in impatience. I read one review that said the downloads are hit and miss.  They're really not.  Either it downloads or you weren't willing to wait. However this thing makes no claims anywhere that I've seen to be speedy. The Mind Station so far has proved to be reliable and consistent but truly, it is not very fast.  Then again, good things come to those who wait; and the educational value it has rewarded us with just since Christmas is worth waiting for.
