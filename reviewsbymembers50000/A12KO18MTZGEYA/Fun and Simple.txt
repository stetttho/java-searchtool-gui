 I was afraid that at 10 years old, my daughter would be too old for this toy.  However I saw some of the reviews where people had bought them for children that age and they were absolutely correct.  She loves it.   I'm afraid there are no additional activity sheets for kids her age at the club at Leap Frog for this toy.  The ones I found only went up to First Grade.  The Books that go with it (purchased seperately) however are fantastic!  They are fun and I found my husband playing with one although I will NEVER be able to get him to admit it. Thanks to Amazon who always comes through with this great review system and stellar service even at Christmas!  They had exactly what I wanted, in stock, great price and delievered EARLY even though I ordered last second.  I ordered on Dec 20 they had everything to me on the 23!  Bless them over and over!
