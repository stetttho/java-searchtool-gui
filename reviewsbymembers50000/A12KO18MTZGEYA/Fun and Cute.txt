 We had a lot of fun with this one on Christmas.  Even the dogs chased her around.  OK, followed her around, she's zippy but not *that* fast. But it is fun.  I guess all remote controlled toys are fun.  You don't get a traditional remote with this toy; the remote is a minuture replica of Shannen's Scooter and you control the dolls movement by turning the seat.  Interesting twist if not a little akward.  Once you figure it out, she goes wherever you want.  Durabilty?  80 pound dog took a light swat at her and she didn't fall over.  Dog finally pushed her over but no damage or scratches whatsoever.  Impressive. Hard on batteries, but you're able to take her off the scooter and play with her.  My daughter loves Shannen alone; pretty doll with funky clothes.  The functional scooter is an added bonus. Hindsight is 20/20 and there are some things I wish I'd known going in.  First of all you can purchase this doll WITH the batteries included.  Also she comes in 2 versions:  A 27 MHZ and a 49 MHZ version.  I'm assuming the higher MHZ version is more powerful, but honestly for the price, the 27 MHZ version is a good buy.  I'm impressed that it does everything it says she does and works well.  I plan on buying another for my neice's next birthday.
