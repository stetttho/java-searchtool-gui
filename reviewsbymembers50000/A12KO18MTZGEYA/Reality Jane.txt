 We were forced to read Jane Eyre in high school.  My teacher was so derisive of Jane and the choices she made that I was turned off.  I reread this in my 20's and OMG, what I missed!  This book is the Victorian equivalent of a Jerry Springer episode.  Jane goes through hell and high water, and like most humans makes a couple of bad choices and mistakes but I kid you not, if someone was telling me this story now, I would have thought they got it off Oprah, Springer, or Dr. Phil.  If you can get past the old fashioned language and Jane's habit of taking the long way around explaining things, you'll love this book.  Jane is a friend to keep.
