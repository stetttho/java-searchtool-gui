 There is a Latin radio station in our area and even before I copmpletely understood the lyrics (my Spanish is very shaky) I loved this tune.  When I heard it on mainstream radio in English I was screamingly happy.  It's addictive, with the staccato rhythm of the verses going into the long, smooth notes of the girl singing the chorus.  In the English verion, the hip hop part throws it off for me.  It's like they threw in everything but the kitchen sink but it's enjoyable even for all that, from beginning to end.  I'm definitely going to pick up the CD now that I FINALLY know who this is.
