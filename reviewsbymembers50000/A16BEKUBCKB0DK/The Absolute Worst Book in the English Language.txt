 It is impossible to think how this book could be worse. The plot alone is laughable. But I'm the kind of reader who can forgive a lame plot if the book has good character development or interesting dialog. This book has neither. At first, the characters may seem complex, but they're not. They are either all good or all bad. Unfortunately, even the "good" ones are so unlikable that I rooted for the real "bad" guys to kill them. What's worse is the dialog. Try this one. Men are shooting at the protagonists. Mac, intrepid FBI agent, is lying on top of Laura, intrepid . . . (well, can't tell you that, it would be giving away the plot). Mac says, "Just hold tight, Laura. Think of me as your Kevlar vest." I did not make this up. It's no surprise that someone might write this drivel. I just can't figure out how it got published. Was the editor on vacation? I noticed the beginning contained no acknowledgements. That's probably because the author couldn't find anyone who wanted to be associated with such a miserable effort. Can I get my money back?
