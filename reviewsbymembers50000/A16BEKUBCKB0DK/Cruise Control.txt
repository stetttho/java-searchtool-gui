 If you liked Crusie's previous books, you'll like Welcome to Temptation, too. The good parts are really good and the rest is interesting enough to hold your attention. While I enjoyed Truly Madly Yours more, I must admit  that the characters in this book is more three dimensional -- particularly  the Phineas T. Tucker. The plot is more complex than Crusie's others, but  the steamy scenes are still guaranteed to fog up your glasses.
