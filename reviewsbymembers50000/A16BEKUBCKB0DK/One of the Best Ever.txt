 I first saw this movie years ago when it was first released. It is the ONLY movie I ever left, bought another ticket for, and then went back in to watch a second time. It is mesmerizing.  The film is beautifully shot,  often looking like a series of oil paintings rather than film. But the  beauty of the cinematography is nothing compared to the story itself. It is  a legal thriller and a classic romance.  While some consider this to be one  of Depardieu's greatest films, the real star of this movie is Nathalie  Baye, who plays Martin Guerre's wife. She makes believable the behavior of  the film's most complex character. Avoid the dubbed version even if you  don't know French. The actors who supply the English-speaking voices are  terrible.
