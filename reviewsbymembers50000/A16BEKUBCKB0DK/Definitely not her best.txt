 In the past three weeks I have read all the Stephanie Plum books. At the end of each one I eagerly grabbed the next. Not so with the sixth (which is a good thing, I guess, since the seventh won't be out for quite a while).  It is funny and the characters and some of the scenes are memorable, but it  just doesn't have the fire that the previous books did. One problem is that  the three main characters seem so watered down. Morelli and Ranger have  lost the element of sexy surprise they had in the previous books.  Stephanie's reactions to the crazy and dangerous things that happen through  the story are oddly subdued. However, you will probably get a big kick out  of the book. I read it in an evening and will certainly read the next when  it comes out. It just isn't as good as the others, which I thought were  great fun.
