 Fast Women is an ambitious book with a large cast of characters and a complex plot.  I didn't like any of the characters -- including the kidnapped dog. Unlike Crusie's past protagonists, the ones in this book are small hearted and mean spirited. There are so many characters that it is hard to keep them straight and some characters -- like the protagonists' own children -- get lost in the story line.     I hated the plot, which had grizzly little touches like a woman married to the man who killed her mother and a main character who gets even with her ex-husband by describing to him -- in a restaurant with lots of people around -- the lesbian affair she had with another sister-in-law.     I read in another review of Fast Women that if you like Janet Evanovich you'd like this book.  Don't believe it.  The Stephanie Plum books are laugh-out-loud funny.  There's a lot of very weird stuff going on and a lot of violence.  But the violence is tempered by a heroine who operates on excellent intuition, is funny as hell, and doesn't have a mean bone in her body.   Save yourself some time and money.  For a decent, funny romance, pick up one of Crusie's previous books.  If you're looking for a mystery with a complex plot, lots of crazy characters that is sure to make you laugh -- go straight to Janet Evanovich.
