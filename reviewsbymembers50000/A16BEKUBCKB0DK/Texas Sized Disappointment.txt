 The plot is one more of the four standard romance story lines. Girl comes back -- temporarily, she thinks -- to the small town she fled years before. Circumstances conspire to keep her at home and too close to the dangerous  male whose touch renders her helpless. In After Tex, the formula becomes a  tired one. The hero is stripped of his danger too early on.  There are too  many subplots and too many characters. To make matters worse, the author's  descriptions of the interaction between the main characters were insipid.  If you like your romances hot, skip this one.
