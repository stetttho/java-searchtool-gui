 Does your child's notebook explode upon opening?  Does your child do homework every night after supper and yet bring home dozens of missing assignment reports from school?  Does your child come home with the book but no idea what the assignment is?  Or perhaps with the assignment and not the book?  Does your child frequently have no idea what the words of an assignment actually mean?  Does your child weep over the tedium of homework assignments whose worth they cannot comprehend?  Does your child go off to school in the morning moderately happy but come home looking beaten down by life?  Are you looking for help for such a child?  If so, don't look for the answers in this book.  There is not a whisper of how to help the organizationally-impaired student.  (P.S., If anybody knows of such a book, or can write such a book, please let the world know.)
