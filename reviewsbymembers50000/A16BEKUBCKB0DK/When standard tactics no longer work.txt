 George is gay.  He lives with Nina, a beautiful soulmate who sentimentally saves photos and cards and clothes, but resists real intimacy. He teaches kindergarten with Melissa, who has a radical haircut but chooses boyfriends based on whether she can teach them to dress correctly. His obsessively neat friend Timothy advises him on love while scrupulously avoiding love himself.  But George is comfortable because his standard strategy for dealing with life -- changing the subject when confronted with the unexpected -- seems to work. Then, when Nina announces that she is pregnant and that she wants George to co-parent with her, the flaws in George's approach to life become achingly apparent.  Torn between his real affection for Nina and his wish for a truly intimate relationship, George appealingly changes the subject, agrees without agreement, and deflects complements and commitment.  This book is tender and funny and deserves a read.
