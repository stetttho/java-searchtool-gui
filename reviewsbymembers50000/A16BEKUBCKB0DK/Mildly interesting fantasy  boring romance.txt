 In this story line, girl whose mother abandoned her escapes overbearing but loving father to the woods of Vermont to find herself. She lives a storybook life with a magical "mother" substitute and is courted  by a tall dark handsome man who also happens to be a genius.  In short  order, she discovers the magic in her own heart. The romance is a little  loose in the loafers; I like my romances more torrid. However, if the world  of magic and fairies appeals to you, you might enjoy the fantasy.
