 I was fascinated by this movie from start to finish. There is so much to look at in every frame that one viewing just isn't enough. Mind you, I am an adult with a taste for the apocalyptic vision. (Road Warrior and Blade  Runner are two of my favorite movies.)  That said, my children were not  taken with the the pig's urban adventure. It really is not a children's  movie -- at least not for the under eight crowd.
