 A young, innocent girl is viciously murdered on a small island in Puget Sound. This homicide, the island's first, rocks the community, shaking loose endemic anti-Semitism and racism. The trouble is, the author  practically gives away the identity of the murderer early on and then has  to throw in many red herrings as a distraction. Finally, the conclusion is  frustrating and sloppy, leaving this ready mighty disastisfied.
