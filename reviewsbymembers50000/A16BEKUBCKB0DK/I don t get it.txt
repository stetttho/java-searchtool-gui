 I hated this book.  Yah, yah, the prose is good; but the promise on the cover of a "morally devastating novel" is not good. There are two parts to the book. In the first, 15-year-old Michael Berg begins an affair  with Hanna, a woman in her mid-thirties. That part of the book is good. The  writer seems to capture the logic and emotions of a 15-year-old boy quite  realistically.  In the second part, Michael is a grown man watching the  trial of his former lover. This is the part that really fails. There is no  sense that Michael has matured in any way. Also, the final message is not  morally devastating nor even believable.    I wonder about those who've  written that the book made them change the way they look at the Holocaust.  What, they never thought that ordinary, mostly decent people participated?  They never thought that many of the perpetrators were caught in events from  which they saw no escape? For a better discussion of these issues, read  Hannah Arendt, not Bernhard Schlink. If the book weren't so hyped, I'd  probably give it three stars, but I feel like there needs to be a leavening  influence here.
