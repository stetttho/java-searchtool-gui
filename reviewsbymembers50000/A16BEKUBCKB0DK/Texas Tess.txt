 In this entry, Tess is GTT -- gone to Texas. This mystery plays out on the streets of San Antone and Austin to great comic effect. Having lived in both Texas and Baltimore, it is a special hoot to read about Tess's doings  with the characters and the cuisine of the Lone Star State. Tess is a big  strapping gal let loose in a big strapping state. Unfortunately, as with  other Tess stories, the plot is a bit weak compared with the characters.  That said, this is a very enjoyable read.
