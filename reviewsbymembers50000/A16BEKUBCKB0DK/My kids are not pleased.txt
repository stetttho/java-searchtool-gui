 Always on the quest to find books that will please my 8 and 9 year olds, I tried Lemony Snicket. The novel starts with the sudden death of the parents  of the three Baudelaire children and the gutting of their home by fire.  Things go downhill for them from there.  The book is heavily ironic and  affected. It keeps an "isn't this clever" barrier between itself  and the reader. My kids snickered once or twice but they were obviously not  drawn in by the plight of the unfortunate Baudelaire orphans.  One  gimmick Mr. Snicket uses is to define some words within the narration.  Surprisingly, this was what my kids liked the best, particularly when the  explanations were for the utterances of the baby.  With Harry Potter and  Holes, my kids begged me each night to read just one more chapter and  failing that just one more word. Not so with Lemony Snicket.  We won't be  reading Book 2.
