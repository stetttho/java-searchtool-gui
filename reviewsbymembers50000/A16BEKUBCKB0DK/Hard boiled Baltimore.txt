 My favorite character in the Tess series is Baltimore. Lippman carefully maps out a city every bit as complex as any of the human characters. If you like Peretsky's Chicago or Grafton's Santa Theresa, then you'll love the  Tess Monaghan mysteries. While the ending is just a bit too pat, Tess and  her city are very convincingly portrayed.
