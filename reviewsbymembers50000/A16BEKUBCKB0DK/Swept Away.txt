 This plot is four standard romance story lines.  Girl returns for a quick visit to the small town she fled years before only to find that circumstances conspire to keep here there. And, of course, there is that  dangerous male whose kiss renders her absolutely helpless. That's okay  because this book makes the reader feel absolutely helpless, too. The  author describes the main characters  -- and their feelings -- in  tantalizing detail. Whether wildly entangled in the linen closet, or  accidentally touching at the town parade, the author writes so vividly that  you can almost feel what the characters are feeling. If you like your  romances salacious, you'll love this one.
