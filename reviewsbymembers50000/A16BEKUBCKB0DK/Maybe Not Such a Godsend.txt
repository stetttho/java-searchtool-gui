 The bottom line on this book is that you should stop doing everything for your children.  Coddling can cripple a child for life. That's a pretty easy premise to accept.  However, some of the promises made by this book are not so easy to accept.  The authors seem to imply that parents who follow their time-tested strategies can bring all children around.  They act as if all children are cut from the same mold and will behave reasonably when treated reasonably.  Unfortunately, this isn't necessarily so. On the other hand, regular family dinners and meetings probably won't hurt, either.
