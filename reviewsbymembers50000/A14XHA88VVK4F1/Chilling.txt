 This is one of the first DVDs I purchased, and the first Criterion DVD. The commentary by Jonathan Demme, Jodie Foster, Ted Tally, Anthony Hopkins, and John Douglas proved to be one of the most insightful commentaries I've  ever listed to. The supplementary materials -- "Voices of Death"  was especially chilling in its detailed narratives into the minds of some  of the most notorious serial killers. The movie and the supplements put a  familiar human face to the killers and victims, and remind us that people  aren't always what they seem to be.
