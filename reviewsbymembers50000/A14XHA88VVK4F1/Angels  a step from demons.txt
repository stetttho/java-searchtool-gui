 When a murder-mystery fiction involving the Illuminati and the Catholic Church become fantastical in the sense of impossible physics and soap-opera drama involving a mad priest and his lost parent, one has to wonder at the mind of Dan Brown, who had written, up to that point, a rather engaging and eloquent, not to mention passionate, prose on peace and conflict. I had to stop reading at verify that I was reading the same book.  I recognize that as something like a changeover, where it leaves everyone confused and scratching their heads, not knowing what's going on anymore.  The story is good. Its plea for the kidnapped cardinals was very moving. The idea of using your heart, rather than using cold, rational logic, was--while not a novel idea--a nice contrast in a sea of technical descriptions of antimatter and futuristic airplanes. We learn quite a bit about Robert Langdon, we learn to empathize, and identify with his character. But the narrative, the omnipotent 3rd person, seemed too knowing, almost condescending in its tone, slightly exasperated that the readers are in the dark as the rest of the characters.  Still, it's a good read, very engaging.
