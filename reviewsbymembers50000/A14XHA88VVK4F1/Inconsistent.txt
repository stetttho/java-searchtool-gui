 The thing about Portugal--the fattening and killing of the pig to using its bladder as a soccer ball--was wonderfully described. It's almost as if he brought us with him on the trip. But after that nothing really stood out for me, except his bashing (rightfully so, in my opinion) of Jamie Oliver and his memorable iguana eating experience, a hotel mascot no less, in Mexico. One can say, practically, these could have been found as chapters he discarded when he wrote Kitchen Confidential.  Do read the book; it's still a good read.
