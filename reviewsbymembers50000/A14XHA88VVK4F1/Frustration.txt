 I was at first puzzled that director Kim Peirce had placed Lana at the murder scene, but I realized later that it was her way of showing Lana's love for Brandon. Lana never felt deceived even as Brandon, standing in his  jail cell fully aware there is nothing he can say or do to hide the fact  that he is a woman, looks painfully into her eyes to hear her say, "I  don't care." In their own way, it was a cheerful, loving moment of  their relationship. Only the audience knew the doom; to Brandon and Lana,  it was the beginning. The killings were unjustifiable, but I really felt  compassion for the two killers. They weren't anonymous or cold, they were  human beings like Brandon, struggling to find their own identities. Peirce  painted a vivid picture of their dead-end lives, forgotten just for a  moment through alcohol and drugs. The time-lapsed cinematography of the  smoke billowing from the factories, the clouds flying through the sky, the  characters seemed suspended helplessly in their personal hell. Even as  Brandon is savagely raped, we're not asked to feel pity for Brandon, nor  anger at the rapists who were once his friends. It was a venting of the  frustration of their inability to be what they don't know how -- that only  Brandon was able to do -- be loving. From their broken homes, respect for  women, or even for themselves, was never on the list.  Boys Don't Cry. I  didn't cry, but I knew deep inside my heart, I was crying for Brandon,  Lana, John, and Tom, and the two innocent victims. It will never be the  same.
