 One must prepare himself to read McEwan's novels, as his prose elicits subtle, not-so-subtle emotions that are profoundly powerful--the kind that bursts into a thousand little jagged little pieces--leaving you out of breath and wondering about a lot of things. All have significant meanings, some--if not all--aren't full known or disclosed until it's too late.  The freedom to choose a course of action is something that can be easy to do. is a lifetime of regret worth the fleeting moment of hyperactive imagination? The idea of reconciliation is abundant in many of the novels out there, but McEwan's Atonement serves neither as complete triumph or complete failure of such; a sort of sad, bittersweet reminder that the novel, and to a large extent, humanity, is alive. That, like our lives. nothing is completely satisfactory nor unsatisfactory, and we live with the consequences of the thoughts and actions we take. His sublime novel, at times sardonic and at times breathless in its style, serves as that reminder.  And this book, as is all of his books, challenges us to explore the dusty, uncomfortable areas of our minds, areas we feel slightly, or perhaps entirely, apprehensive to discuss (let alone think about it). How you make of it is entirely up to you. Your investment in the exploration of regret is rewarded richly by this masterpiece of modern literature. One should read Atonement with Black Dogs and A Child in Time--similar exploration s in regret and reconciliation--or the complete lack thereof.
