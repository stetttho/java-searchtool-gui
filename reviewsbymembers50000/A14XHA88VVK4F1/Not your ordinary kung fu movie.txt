 Actually, martial arts is incidental. The story revolves around trust, love, and hope. With a deep, stirring score, I can't help thinking about my friends and loved ones, and my contentious relationship with my own self. Watch the movie, and see beyond the martial arts. Those who just expect standard kung fu fare would be disappointed.
