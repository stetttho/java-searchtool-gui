 Things happen, and they may be for better or for worse. One moment one can be in abject poverty, and in the next, events stream like a fast-moving river current to make things better or even worse. The reader, like the helpless characters, rides along in the current. Tossed, churned, pulled, seemingly in a random, indecipherable way, yet with a sense of purpose.   Atonement, Enduring Love, A Child in Time, Amsterdam, and Saturday has the same basic theme McEwan explores. Different circumstances, but how events utterly transform a person, a couple, a family, friends, and siblings so quickly are illustrated in painstaking detail. And the consequences a person pays: knowingly or unknowingly we choose our courses of actions, like the characters, but are we prepared at the repercussions, at the chain of events that transpires from our own singular action, or an insignificant thought?  Against the backdrop of post-9/11, the invasion of Iraq, and the growing pessimism (which still continues today) serving as context, the story unfolds. The tone is both optimistic and melancholic, realistic in the process of life and death, hopeful for the future. Like Henry standing by his window of predawn London, we observe, reflect, and perhaps ask for forgiveness, by forgiving others first.
