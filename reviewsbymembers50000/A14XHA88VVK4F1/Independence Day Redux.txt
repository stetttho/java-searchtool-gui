 I knew something was fishy when I saw the duo -- Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin -- but I was drawn by Robert Rodat (Saving Private Ryan) who wrote the screenplay. I'm not sure what this movie tries to be. It tries to pose itself as an epic, yet the story is shallow and characters superficial and 2-dimensional. You want to cheer for Gibson's character, Ben Martin, but he's certainly not as "cheerable" as Porter (Payback). You never learn much about the human element or drama because everyone serves as a stereotype (Slave, Reverend, The Loyalist, etc) and these characters are introduced and used only as needed. There could have been some wonderful opportunities to expand the Loyalist character (played by Adam Baldwin), yet all we see is 10 seconds of him troubling over whether he should set fire to the church. While Saving Private Ryan accurately (my guess -- how would I really know?) relentlessly portrayed the acute grimness of war with a semi-objective documentary style feel, and felt cold as a result, The Patriot is saddled by the two: Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin, of Independence Day. They tried so hard to make the viewers want to cheer for us Americans that they've simplified everything else -- the support, the enemy, the setting, that it feels like I'm watching the LA Clippers game: underwhelming and predictable.
