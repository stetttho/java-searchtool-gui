 ...than The Sixth Sense. Who am I? It's a question we haved asked of ourselves at some point. Some of us still do. How do I know who I am, without knowing who I am not? This movie is almost like reading a book. It takes time to develop, and it's in firm control as it climaxes to an unforgettable scene of realizations and surprising discoveries. The long scenes set the pace of the movie, and instead of feeling they're long, I was drawn further to the movie, and I felt like I was a part of the story as an observer, instead of just as a viewer. When Elijah Price verifies the man in fatigues has the gun David described, I was skeptical. When David lifed heavier and heavier weights, I began to believe. When David's son points a gun to his dad, in firm belief he would survive, I was speechless. Not because of the fact a son pointing a gun to his own father is shocking, but it's the fact that I was still unsure of David's power, as he is of himself.  Good directors control how much the viewers know. Most of the time, movies put viewers in a position where they know. Shyamalan is in control and only when he decides, the viewer is sure; I am sure who David Dunn and Elijah Price really are. In comparison to The Sixth Sense, I knew, the audience knew the boy's secret. It was a matter of figuring out, or waiting for the time he would tell of his secret. In that sense, I felt the commercials and trailers spoiled the fun.  Unbreakable really spoke to me. That's what matters, and when a movie goes beyond simple enertainment to actually talking to viewers, that's when you know a movie is good.
