 Why are there many different versions of Christian belief? Why are there so many rules to believe in God and His Son? This film answers these question simply, by saying, it's faith -- one's undying belief -- that matters, not what a church says, not what various Christian rules and regulations say how a person should believe. Those who felt offended may have missed the point of this movie. Don't take yourselves too seriously; in the end, we're all the same, and no one is better than another.  I may not believe in God, but I know if I were one, I'd have a sense of humor.
