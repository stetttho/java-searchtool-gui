 After reading Bear's foundation sequel and Darwin's Radio, I attacked this puppy with gusto. The tempo is off from the start - taking a vascillating first-person view, swapping around main characters. About half way through, the novel turns Clancy-meets...well...I guess VC Andrews?!? In the end, I felt cheated and wanting. Given the book had promise, it's saved from a single star...but it still feels as if I'm being generous. I suggest avoiding this one and let's hope the next Bear book is better.
