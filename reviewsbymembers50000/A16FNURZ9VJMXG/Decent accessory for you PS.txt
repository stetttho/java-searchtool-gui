 I was really looking forward to the GS2 being released; but I must admit that this equipment does not live up to what the GS for PS1 could do, in my opinion. The GS2 is of their CDX line, which means that the actual GS equipment similiar to a PS2 memory card (I was hoping for a USB device). In order to use the GS2, you MUST start-up your PS2 using the GS2 boot CD, and then swap the CD and boot into the desired game. The GS2 comes with two CDs: one with codes for PS1 games, and one with codes for PS2 games, and any hand-entered codes are stored on the CDX plug-in. I gave it a 4-star because it averages out the pros and cons on the accessory. Pros: Interact still makes the best darn cheatware on the market (good for those afternoons where you just want to switch into god-mode and frag everything on the screen), it remembers the last used game; Cons: it requires disc swapping, it takes up a memory slot (it does NOT require to be in slot 1, like the docs say, BTW), some of the codes don't make a whole lot of sense (what the heck is "M2 always on"?), and the documentation bundled with it stinks. All in all - despite the limitations and draw-backs, it's still better than everything else out there. I recommend it as a must-have in your PS2 ensemble.
