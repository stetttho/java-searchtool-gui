 What can you say? I picked Sony over the other cameras because of this diverse memory product. You can use it in a wide array of Sony products without having to buy memory all over again...and it's fast! Sure it's a bit more than the other flash cards (although that is finally changing...woo-hoo), but I use the same 64 MB module in my S75, my mp3 player, and my friend's camcorder. The only drawback is that this memory stick doesn't support the MagicGate technology, which is employed for commercial mp3 productions. But since this is still a fighting standard, it's not a big mark against it yet.
