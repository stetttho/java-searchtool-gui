 This is the first book of Bear's that I've read; I picked the book up to get a feel for the author before reading his sequel to Asimov's Foundation series. Although the book begins slow (as he tries to lay into the reader the complex issues of each of the main characters), it picks up about a third of the way in and keeps speeding up as the character's separate threads come together and intertwine. As a warning, there isn't really a "resolution" to the story - it leaves you wondering and able to walk away from the book thinking. The science is indeed top-notch and rides on a lot of very deep biological and Comp Sci principles of the human genome deciding when and how to upgrade itself. This, combined with an almost X-File-esque feel of governmental politics and intrigue, sets the scene for a rather excellent read.
