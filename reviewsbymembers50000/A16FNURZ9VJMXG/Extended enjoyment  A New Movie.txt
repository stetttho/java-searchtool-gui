 I really enjoyed the extended edition of LoTR:FoTR. The expanded scenes that come with the movie (even 30 seconds worth), completely change the feel of the film. As an example, the prelude of the film (the fall of Sauron and Isildur's death) are expanded to show Isildur slipping on the ring to escape the orcs and the ring pulling itself away to cause his death - in all, perhaps 30 seconds added that really brings a depth and sort of personality to the ring itself. The extended edition did what very few "new cuts" due - it actually created a different film. Sure it has all kinds of extra features (and the bookends are REAL nice...they're propping up my six-book Tolkein collection as I type; the National Geo special is interesting, and the commentary is awesome), but what really makes the edition WORTH it is the new movie. In my opinion, the LoTR: FoTR movie (theatrical release) was a story about Frodo - his travels and his struggles. With the extended release, we see a very different story - a story about the One Ring: the trouble it causes and the struggle against it by the Fellowship and it's bearer...Frodo becomes a main player in the story, instead of the story itself. And in this regard, the extended edition did what I thought was impossible - it brought the story even closer to the spirit of the book...and gives the Ring a bit of the creepy backdrop that was missing in the theatrical release - it really makes you believe It wants to be found.
