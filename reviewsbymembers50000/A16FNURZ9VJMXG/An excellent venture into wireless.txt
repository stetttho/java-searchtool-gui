 The wife and I are laptop users for work, so we both have laptops in addition to the home "core" PC. It got to a point where on the weekend we would have 2 100-ft cables strung across the room from our linksys router/hub to the various machines. We finally decided enough was enough and tried to go wireless. At first, we tried the big boy on the block - Netgear - but the wireless NIC kept locking up my laptop and didn't like the wireless hub was picky about interacting with other brand NICs (I found a Linksys wireless NIC works best on my Tecra). After a few trips back and forth to Comp-USA (those guys are so understanding), we had our best luck with the MS router - the range gives a very good signal across both floors of our 1400 sq foot apartment, and the configuration was a breeze. The only complexity came from connecting to the router once it's been secured. Once locked down, you need a string of hex characters (0-9,A-F) to authenticate a new card to the station; but the disk-based configuration actually even makes this a breeze. But even without the risk, the peace of mind the security brings is worth the one-time 90-sec investment of typing. :) It easily skates into 5-starts.
