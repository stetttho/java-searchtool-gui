 The storyline was much slower than expecting, more dealing with a long defection than anything really of note. Most of the action happens as background instead of at the forefront. Whether this is meant on a comment on a boring desk job or the early, slow-starting career of one who would eventually lead a nation. For once, I was thankful for an abridged CD, opposed to the unabridged version. But the reader helped breath some life into the novel, with excellent accents and almost enjoyable conversations between characters. It did help pass the time and made me grateful I didn't read the novel. For this book, in discussions with friends who actually read the book and from reviews on the book here, I would definitely recommend going for the abridgement.
