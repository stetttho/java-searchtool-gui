 I like this game a lot. The game's delivered on a DVD-ROM, giving slick graphics and lots of long driving music...you can tell they spent the extra time polishing this little puppy for the stores. That being said, the graphics are overly done (the car seems to float in front of the ground/background...obviously apart), and the music is overly prepared - better than the GT2 music, but not quite approaching the intensity and just roadlust of the first. Gameplay is much better than the second, but still lacking something from the first. They removed the different car vendors (you simply go to one place on the map) and the "tune up shop" means you go only one place for parts; and - personally - I miss the feel of "shopping around". Also, for the first car (and in arcade mode), the gameplay feels sluggish (if I rated after first day: 2 stars)...but that improves as you beef up your car...stick with it, it gets better. This stays in my top 5 PS2 titles so far.
