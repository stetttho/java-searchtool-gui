 Having read about half the book before taking a long road trip, my wife and I picked up the audio CD for the ride. As far as truth of the abridgement, I can attest that the first half of the audio CD stays true to the book (and I would assume that follows through to the rest of the book). As such, the story is everything the reviews say it is, and would have won it 4 stars. My only complaint with the audio CD is that the reader was at times difficult to hear over the car speakers and it was difficult to follow which character was speaking when not specifically cited (granted, I'm comparing this to a few Clancy audio CDs I have). Because of these two factors, it was difficult to really follow the reader without occassionally having attention drift off. For this, the review is knocked down to 3 stars...I don't regret the purchase and would recommend it, but it's not what I was hoping for.
