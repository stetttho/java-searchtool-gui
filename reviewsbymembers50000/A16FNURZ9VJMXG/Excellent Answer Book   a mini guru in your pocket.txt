 Although the book wasn't all I was looking for, it gave me more than I originally expected. I bought this book because I was tired of skimming through 10 different VB web sites looking for a quick and dirty answer to a question - and SAMPLE CODE. :) This book met my expectations very well, it answered more than half of the questions I had...and had answers to some questions I hadn't yet thought of asking. Although it doesn't hit many of the real advanced topics I was really hoping for (i.e., calling/using C DLLs...besides just knowing you can do it), I am more than happy with it -- and recommend it to other non-VB gurus. :)
