 I must admit, the cover is disturbing. However, please don't judge this book by its cover. Dollar-to-hour, this has to be one of the best investments I've made for the PS2! The game is a relative to the "Puzzle Bobble" games, which were derivative of the "Bubble Bobble" arcade game (the cute little dinosaurs are still there, though!). The game is a puzzle game where you shoot bubbles up to the top of the screen where a mass of other bubbles hang. If you line up at least three bubble of the same color - they pop! And depending on what is hanging from them/positioned around - you may only knock off the ones you lined up, or you may knock out half the screen. Throw into the mix various special bubbles ("knock out all bubbles of this color on the screen", cannon-ball bubbles, etc), and you get a very cool game that will keep you at the screen for hours. Add into this a couple 2-player modes with adjustable difficulty levels and an array of characters that have definite strengths/weaknesses against one another, and it makes a great party game. Trust me, you will lose days on this game in a BAM-daze. I've had friends miss morning meetings because of a two-hour BAM session that went on weeeeeeell past the previously agreed upon time. Only one caveat, if you have any of the BAM games for PS1, the only advantage to getting this game is slightly slicker look and colors - very very little in the game has changed. But if you don't have a BAM game in your collection, this is a MUST OWN! IGNORE THE (Charles-Manson-esque) BABY! :) You will not be disappointed.
