 I'm still getting the hang of the game, but I thought I would throw up my thoughts for anyone considering the game. I must admit, though, that overall it isn't one of 989's best and I was disappointed by the amount of time it took them to get the game out. Responsiveness - nice feel and time; Graphics - quite lacking for everything the emotion engine is supposed to deliver; Difficulty - rookie-mode is super easy, the other modes take some getting used to (probably an afternoon's learning curve); Fighting - I like the controls, but the setup for it is a bit contrited. Options - greater depth in on/off's and things you can do, but the computer always reserves the right to overrule (ick!). Control set up - throws you into the game too quickly and it's easy to run the wrong teams/players if you're not paying attention. So I guess this says it's not the prettiest of games, but one of the more playable (the game feels much more real-time than any of the hockey games that have been released over the past year - for any of the consoles). My score is hit by the fact that I was just honestly expecting more...and the fact that the goalie for the Flyers is not represented by a pic/announced in the game! :)
