 I must say, this one little piece of equipment has turned my ... DSL experience into bliss. For background, I'm a T1 kinda network person - plug it in and fly! Then came aDSL through the phone company - having to install 3rd party software (WinPoET) on my system and dealing with annoying "Would you like to connect?" "Disconnect now?" messages, and software incompatability issues. I was about ready to dump DSL and go back to the cable company (charging $... more a month) when a friend recommended this little baby to me.  Now the router manages my connection and handles all the PoET (PPP over Ethernet, I believe it stands for) interaction for me! It was honestly the first piece of hardware I've said "I love you" to. If you have DSL - I would whole-heartedly recommend this, and would chastise you for turning away at the price. For Cable modem users or other forms of connectivity, I would also recommend it (but won't berate you into it) unless you're looking for an really easier way to share a single IP address or simple firewall protection. For the price, nothing similiar really delivers.
