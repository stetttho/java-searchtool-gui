 The book was a very good read...excellent subway material. I really hate to make the comparison between the book and Douglas Adams, as, aside from both being tongue-in-cheek, it's really like comparing apples and oranges...somewhat similiar, but completely different texture and taste. Mixing it together with Gaimen provides a book with the cheeky comments commonly experienced in Pratchett books with the odd characters common to Gaimen's tales...but - I must say - Pratchett retains the largest portion of flavor in the mix, in my opinion. The main thesis of the book seems to be that through it all, it's the journey and the challenge that means something - the rest is just a label...and doesn't mean anything. It provides a nice context and reflections on western religon - providing an eastern take within the western framework...something more and more common. But it provides something different, and worth a read.
