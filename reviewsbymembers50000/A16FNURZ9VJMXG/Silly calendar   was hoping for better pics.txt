 This is coming from a coder stranded in cube-ville. I got the calendar to have something to hang up that makes me giggle. My only complaint about the calendar is that the best pictures are on the cover and back...the rest miss the mark, in my opinion. But how can you really go wrong with Mr. Winkle? :)
