 The latest addition to the Tekken series brings an updated version of the fighting game. All the standard fare is available as the prior four games (Tekken, 2, 3, and Tag) - including the extremely irritating Tekken Force mini-game. The graphics have been revisited, and some interactivity has been added...the game (graphics and interativity-wise) seems to be trying for the DoA title, but falls short. However, the updating has not come at the expense of the Tekken feel - still the best controls of all the fighting genre (in my opinion). Still solid, but could have been more...so 4 stars I give it. :)
