 I picked it up to finish the Foundation series; a good ending, I will maintain. It wraps up the idea behind the foundation and settles it to face squarely with WHY things need to be held together, and the justification for arranging things. It does change the tone of the series and is very long-winded and suddenly ended (kinda like...ok...ok...ok...huh?), but it does finally add some closure to the series and a feeling of completion - a reason behind why he even started the Foundation's Edge. For those looking for a thoughtful read and are a fan of the Foundation novels, I recommend; if your looking for more of a fun read, pass this book by.
