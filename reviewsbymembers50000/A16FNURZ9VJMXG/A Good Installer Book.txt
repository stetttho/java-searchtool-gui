 I've used InstallShield products for about three years now, and recently started using ISWI to package software - and became completely lost! As such, I turned to this book for help. The book first moves you through the Win 2000 deployment model and walks you constructing an Installer product using the Microsoft MSI SDK - which works wonders and really solidifies an understanding of the MSI data model and methodology. The book then drills down and explains, part by part,  the workings of ISWI nicely...Although it sometime reads more like an encyclopedia than what I really look for in a tech book. The only caveats is many grammer issues sprinkled through the book and screenshots that refer to an old version (although it does incite a sort of scavendar-hunt mentality that actually HELPS learning the product). However, the core of the book is solid and informative...if you have to work with ISWI - this book should definitely be in your reading list for the near future.
