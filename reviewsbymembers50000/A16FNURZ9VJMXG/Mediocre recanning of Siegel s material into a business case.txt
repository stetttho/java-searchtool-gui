 Personally, I found this book a bland read - more akin to the dry business case books I read back in college - this book is aimed almost exclusvely at project managers and shop/salon owners. That being said, the material presented is useful and very good to know. Hence three stars - 4 for content, 2 for presentation. For anyone looking for the same information, I would recommend David Siegel's books as something that is not only mentally engaging - but visually as well. His book has something for everyone, and gives you concrete "real world" examples while you read (and explanations of why you should use it) instead of "refer to chapter3\blah.doc on the CD-ROM".
