 I must qualify this - I really like shorts and I love claymation. I had originally seen the contents of this DVD as presented in a local movie theatre as a leader for "A Close Shave" (Wallace and Grommit...excellent!). The primary short featured ("Creature Comforts") is a collection of bits that Park et al did as gas company commercials over the ocean (aka the UK). In processing for the DVD, they took out the sales pitch for each commercial - which I think really took it out of context and left the watcher going "Why the heck did they do this?" It takes a collection of excellent commercials and turns them into a sort of unsensical [sic] short. By itself, I would give the DVD a 3-star - when used as a leader into another Park movie, I would give it a 5-star. I'll settle for a compromise...but still give it a recommendation to others. Enjoy!
