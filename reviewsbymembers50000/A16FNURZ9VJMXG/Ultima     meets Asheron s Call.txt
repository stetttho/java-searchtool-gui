 I bought the game a few days ago and have been wailing away on the local krug population. The game reminds me very much of the more classic Ultima PC games (with classless char development and the ability to balance fighter with magi skills) with a very Asheron's Call (AC) feel graphics-wise. As with AC, you get to customize the look of your char (skin, hair, basic clothing) and you have to walk everywhere(!bummer! Get me a TP). But the game rocks...everyone compares it to Diablo and D2, but it goes beyond the basic click-n-slash game that D2 is -- it's the RPG that D2 could have been. It allows group and formation control, and when you decide to attack a mob - you just click once...yes, ONCE...no clicking until your finger falls off to strike your blows, allowing you to worry more about the game than simple combat - awesome. I'm really looking forward to trying the multi-play features of the game. My only complaint thus far is the inability to keep a in-game journal or mark the world map with notes (an ability many of the larger RPGs allow)...as it's easy to forget where that one small cave is. Although not a game that will overwhemingly appeal to RPGers or hard-core D2 click-n-slashers, it's a decent hybrid that fills that certain need to trim down the evil monster population without getting a sore mouse-finger.
