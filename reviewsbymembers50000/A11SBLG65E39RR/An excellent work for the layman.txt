 This is a book about geological hazards in the United States. The general focus is on the West Coast, if only because that is the most tectoncally active area.  Some color plates, and a few black and white photos, are included, but the primary emphasis is on a well-written text.  The book is highly readable and keeps one's attention throughout.  The authors begin their examination with a review of the Northwest, discussing both volcanic hazards and the lesser known, recently discovered, but far more dangerous hazard of a truly giant earthquake in that region.  Every citizen of that part of the United States should carefully peruse this section. Attention then turns to California and the San Andreas Fault.  Author Sieh is a renowned expert on this transform fault, and thoroughly discusses the extensive research he and others have done on this peril.  Again, as with the Northwest, this section is very highly recommended. The earthquake hazards of the Great Basin and the volcanic hazards of Yellowstone are examined in detail, as are mid-continent earthquake problems in the central Mississippi valley. The book also looks at potential East Coast earthquake and tsunami hazards.  The authors use particular care in explaining geologic termnology in an understandable manner, and this is rare and impressive.   Many books of this genre are deficient in that they either oversimplify the material at hand, leading to inaccuracies and potentially dangerous distortions, or by making geology appear so difficult that the reader with a non-scientific background becomes frustrated.  The authors have carefully avoided either pitfall, and the book has profited though such care. If you live in the United States, you should own and read this book.  It may save your investments. or your life.
