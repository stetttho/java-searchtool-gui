 This book far outdoes any of its rival works on the Krakatoa volcano, particularly with respect to its stupendous eruption of 1883.  Instead of selectively culling lay and expert observations and reports about this phenomenal event, nearly all available reports are reproduced, verbatim, in chronological order, giving the reader an excellent view into the prologue to the great blast that was heard 3,000 miles away on August 27, 1883.  Of particular interest is Professor VerBeek's post-eruption analysis of what took place at the climax of the explosions.  Although the events were unprecedented in terms of formal scientific experience, VerBeek's report has largely stood the test of time and subsequent discovery, and remains a singularly epochal advance in the science of volcanology.  The book requires some background in volcano study to be most completely understood, but any person with a high school background in physical science will comprehend most of it easily.  Illustrations and diagrams are somewhat wanting. However, the excellence and organization of the textual materials overcomes this for the most part.  I greatly enjoyed this book, which came as a surprise Christmas present, and I will reread it a number times.  I recommmend it highly to all readers, even the rofessional geologist.
