 In a book that is regrettably out of print, Reader's Digest put forth a superlative effort to encompass the best drives in each state, together with discussion of listed attractions along them.  On a regional basis, beginning with the Northeast, each state, with exception of Delaware and some of the smaller New England states, is covered separately.  The map accompanying each state shows a clear highway diagram of the state, together with highlighted areas showing the subject routes.  The text for each route begins at a certain point on it, and follows the route back to the point of origin. Numbered paragraphs or sets of paragraph describe each number highlighted on the map for that route.  Excellent, beautiful, color photographs of certain, but not all, highlighted sites accompany each article and, in the Reader's Digest tradition,  do not distort what the traveler may expect to see. When my girlfriend and I travel, we xerox copies of all routes we may expect to follow or cross in part.  by this expedient, we have a unique travel guide that has led us to a great many interesting, beautiful places we never knew about and would not have seen/ enjoyed without the aid of this fine book. An introductory section to each region, East South, Midwest, etc., shows how the people farm and otherwise make a living.  Wildlife you might expect to see is discussed as well. This book is an abslutely perfect microcosm of the things one can see and do in our wonderful country.  You won't see every interesting place or wander each beautiful drive, but this omission only serves to whet the appetite, not dampen it. As the title of this review indicates, if you travel, you need this book.  Rated off the scale; a really good value and a great book.
