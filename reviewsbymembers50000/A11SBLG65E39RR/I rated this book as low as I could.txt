 It is truly a pity that people will actually read glop like this and come away thinking themselves to be well informed.  Right from the impossible event portrayed on its cover to forward as far as the reader can stand, this book is a fraudulent, wrong-headed depiction of a very real hazard.  Its readers, if they don't start out ignorant of science, will surely be rendered that way if they accept any part of this text.  I cannot be more plain: don't bother buying it, borrowing it, or reading it.  A hundred thumbs down on this epically bad work.
