 There is something more than vaguely disconcerting about those who marshall armies of fact, then, having done so, proceed to put a highly speculative, "must be a conspiracy somewhere, somehow" twist on it all.   This book would have been a lot better without Nostradamus, Genesis, and all that conspiracy glop.  As it is, I wasted my money.  Stick to the facts, and maybe, just maybe, someone will believe you.
