 This is an excellent review of nearly all European volcanoes.  The non-Ring of Fire volcanic provinces have received very little attention on a regional basis.  This book fills a large gap in non-professorial texts/trade books on volcanoes and volcanology. Volcanoes of Europe covers the volcanic provinces of Italy, Greece, the Canary Islands, the Azores, Iceland and Jan Mayen, and the dormant regions of France and Germany, in turn.  Most photos are black and white, but an excellent section of color prints adorns the middle of the text.  The photos are carefully chosen to demonstrate phenomena mentioned in the chapter. The writing is ably done, and well-organized.  The history of each volcano is meticulously researched,  and accompanied by an excellent bibliography.  As my lists will show, I have been a volcano freak for some years and I probably have 80+ books on the subject, some technical, many not.  This is one of the best. I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in volcanoes, regional geographers and geologists, and others who enjoy the study of our Earth and its processes.  This book is a real keeper.
