 It has been extremely difficult to obtain a quality book on this massive weather event, and the present text solves that dilemma.  I would have preferred a few more pictures from areas other than Murphysboro, Illinois, and the discussion of meteorological factors was somewhat attenuated.  These quibbles aside, the book is a feeling, sensitive chronology of the most terrible tornadic event ever to strike the United States.  The stories of human suffering and courage in the face of this awesome convulsion of nature will sometimes reach to your marrow. I liked the organization of the book, beginning with a few general introductory remarks, and then tracing the course of the tornado during its three and one half hour passage from Missouri to Indiana, narrating the horror of its fury at each point.  The author's own experiences in the storm. and its effects on his family and town, added flesh to the book, but did not overwhelm it.  I liked that. I note that some reviewers have complained that the author has simply recycled old news accounts, but what better way to show how the neighboring towns, and the outside world, viewed this stupendous catastrophe?  I believe any readers interested in regional history of the Midwest in the early part of the last century, weather buffs, and many persons who simply enjoy a gripping account of man being outmatched by the elements will enjoy this book.
