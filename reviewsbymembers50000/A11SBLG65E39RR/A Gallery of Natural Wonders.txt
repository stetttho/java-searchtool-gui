 It is regrettable that this book is no longer in publication.   It is an exquisite compilation of the national parks of Japan, stating at the northeast tip of Hokkaido island, and proceeding south to Iwo Jim and the Ryukyu island chain that reaches almost to Taiwan. It includes active volcanoes, even one that erupts almost every day.  The climates range from sub-arctic to tropical.  Also found are sand dunes, hot springs, waterfalls, forests, scenic calderas similar to Crater Lake, picturesque seashores of all sorts, and beautiful mountains, among them the incredible Fuji. The parks are divided into geographical groups.  Each park is described separately, and most have detailed maps.  The written text is excellent, but the highlight is the photography.  Many of the photographs are done in four-color format to accentuate the highlights.  Even if you never make it to Japan, and I haven't, you will derive hour after hour of enjoyment from this esceptional travel book.  I strongly recommend its acquisition, and equally,  against loaning it out.
