 This  book has no real peer at the moment.  Indeed, a comprehensive, detailed, but easily understandable book on marine reptilian predators of the Mesozoic has been long awaited, and overdue.  These animals approached whales in size in some instances, and easily dwarfed their terrestrial counterparts.  Indeed, a T Rex may have been only one eighth the size of the largest pliosaurs.  Yet, most books on Mesozoic life have, until now, relegated these marvelous animals to one or two back chapters or sections at the most. Author Ellis, a renowned illustrator, writer, and researcher, has produced a masterpiece.  His drawings of these seagoing reptiles are impeccable, if sometimes a bit speculative, and enable the reader to capably visualize these gigantic creatures. Likewise, the text is enormously informative, not only about such FAQ's as size, weight, methods of reproduction, etc., but also on more arcane matters, such as how these huge beasts propelled themselves quickly and efficiently through the water.  One glance at a long-necked, flippered plesiosaurus reveals that the answer to this problem is far from simple. After an excellent introduction, the author covers icthyosaurs, plesiosaurs, pliosaurs, and mosasaurs in turn.  Ellis then concludes with what seems to be the mandatory conclusion to any Mesozoic book; i.e., what caused all of these fabulously efficient, dominant predators to disappear in one fell swoop. I found this book enormously enjoyable, and it was one of my best Christmas presents in years.  I shall read it again and again.  Anyone with a high school background will enjoy this book to the hilt, and my recommendation is extremely high. By the way, this is the sort of book one loans out only very carefully.
