 This is an epic narrative of a single evening in the Argentine night mail service.   The chief character is the air manager, with peripheral characters being pilots, pilots' wives, and other personnel.   Without spoiling the plot, an unexpected crisis occurs in the way of a trans-Andean storm, and the pace quickens to unforgettable climax.        But read the book.  It's short, and not so much as a phrase is excess weight.  A spine-tingling thriller about men in crisis, and the women who wait alone.  You may grimace at the manager's resolve, but you will never forget him or the pilot coming from far southern Argentina.  A masterful insight into the days when character was a desirable thing and profit wasn't the only motive for excellence.
