 This book is about Patagonia, the southern part of South America.  Windswept, cool, rainy or dry, depending on one's location, Patagonia is the uttermost realm of the Earth.  This book, out of many, is the best I have ever seen on the area.  The writers, Paul Theroux, and the late Bruce Chatwin, are both very well acquainted with the region,  Each writer has a differing style, and each writer's commentary therefore varies.  Yet, both harmoniously intertwine into a fascinating mesh. In addition to each capturing the essence of the land and the harsh climate in his own way, both writers present fascinating vignettes on Patagonian history, culture, and people.  You will learn about the origin of Patagonia's name, its role in Shakespeare's plays, its history of sheltering Welsh nationalism, its ground sloth fossils, Butch Cassidy staying in hiding there, its glaciers and fiords, etc., etc., etc.  All of this is superbly complimented by Fred Hirschmann's stunning color photography.  In four-color format, these photographs form the most excellent composite for a book since Eliot Porter's masterpiece on the lost Glen Canyon.  Again and again, I return to these photos for their inspiration and beauty. Most of us will never visit Patagonia and taste the local calafate berry.  But if we can't, this book is the next best thing.   I prize this book very much and recommend it to the hilt.
