 Meteoritics and impact phenomena are a fascination of mine and, with some anticipation, I purchased this book.  I was disappointed.  The treatment of impacts and their consequences was cursory for the most part and frequently conclusionary rather then illuminating.  While the book contained a few facts not found in other, similar volumes, I felt book was written from hunger rather than love, if you will.  The science and logic were frequently off the mark, in my view.  Not the sort of book one would read for an in depth understanding of the topic.
