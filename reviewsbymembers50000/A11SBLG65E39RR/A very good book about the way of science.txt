 This book is 16 years old, and somewhat dated by more recent discoveries, such as the Chicxulub meteor crater.  Nonetheless, Hsu's  excellence as an author/scientific historian and philosopher transcends this seeming defect to a great degree.  Although the book's ostensible subject is dinosaur extinction and its causation, it soon becomes apparent that the real messages address the whimsical way of evolution, and the misapplications of Darwinian theory. Evolution is not a steady gradual process.  Instead, it proceeds apace until interrupted by a calamity such as a cosmic impact, enormous volcanic disturbance or climate change, or the like.  In such instances, writes Hsu, the list of survivors is a matter of good fortune, not design, and the process of new adaption and speciation begins all over once more.  So it was with the dinosaurs, and so it might be again.   It is impossible to divine a purpose or reason for such things.  The key is to accept them and to understand them, if possible.  Hsu's application of Oriental thought to the process is most enlightening.  His writing is informal, tight, and obviously very well thought out.  Hsu also addresses that perversion of the theory of evolution known as "Social Darwinism".  It is carefully pointed out that Darwin NEVER intended his theories to become a basis for claims of racial or ethnic superiority.  Hsu then demonstrates not only the fallacy of such beliefs, but shows why Darwin would have been equally disapproving of them.  You don't have be a scientist or philosopher to read this book, but reading it will give you great insight into both disciplines.  I found it fascinating from start to finish, and would recommend it highly to anyone past their early teens.  It is a real keeper.
