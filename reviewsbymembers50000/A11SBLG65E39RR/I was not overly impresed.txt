 The book is premature, inasmuch as the action against those who perpetrated the September 11, 2001 atrocities is still ongoing.  It is far too soon to sort out causation and effect.  This fact would properly daunt an objective historian.  No matter how much one may disagree or agree with the author's frequently novel viewpoints, and those he elicits, the fact remains that the episode is too fresh to allow a reasoned analysis.  One may fairly conclude, and will conclude from an objective reading of this opus, that Chomsky, as was the case with many of his other works,  has jumped the gun in an effort to promote his own subjective opinions to the prejudice of more reasoned efforts at a later time.   This may suffice as effective propaganda to some, but it is no way to record history.  Given the fact that the struggle is ongoing, it is a mere, nakedly political attempt to influence the course of events rather than report upon or analyze them. I do not recommend the book for that reason.  I believe that its purchase is a waste of better-used resources.
