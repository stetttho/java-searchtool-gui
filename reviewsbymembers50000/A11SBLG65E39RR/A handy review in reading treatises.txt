 As scientific dictionaries go, this one is fairly complete.  Good coverage is afforded esoteric terms.  Somehow, I have the feeling, though, that the book is more attuned to rockhounds than it is to professional geologists.  The book lacks diagrams or photos.  In a good many instances, this would afford a newcomer a bettle handle on the term being defined.   For all of this, it is a handy guide when looking at particular rocks or strata, but its real virtue lies in being at the student's hand when attempting to unwind a treatise confounded by excessive verbiage.
