 This book is superb, and you will love it.  Done in coffee-table book style, the photography is spectacularly colorful, and accurate.   The careful, caring text is evocative of many days I have spent wandering these lonely, yet intimate, wild regions of our Great Lakes.  Accurate to perfection in geological terms, the text further compliments the photography by elaborating on such things as rare plants and animals, unique weather, and human history of these places.   This beautiful book , finally, serves as an enduring reminder that these dunes are fragile.  They need our continued stewardship, now and in the future.   If you have seen these dunes, read this book before you do so again.  If not, this book will make you want to go climbing sand hills for sure.  Either way, you will be handsomely rewarded.
