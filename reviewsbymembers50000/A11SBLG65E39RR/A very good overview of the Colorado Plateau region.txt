 I am a Colorado Plateau freak, I must confess.  As this book so excellently shows, every nook, every niche of that region is festooned with some new, arresting wonder, or so it seems.  Canyon Country Parklands is first remarkable for its photography.  I have seldom seen the essence of this beautiful region captured so well.  Indeed, many of the photos catch that magical light that seems to leap from the rock walls themselves.  Even those parks long photographed, such as Zion National Park, attain a new height in beauty through the pictures in this book.  A magnificent effort!! The text is very readable and captures much of the magic of this region as well.  I especially recommend the sections on Plateau wildlife and on the High Plateaus.  The maps are also useful in reconnoitering one's position in this never-ending tableau of light and rock.  You will enjoy this book to hilt, and its reasonable price makes it a remarkable bargain.
