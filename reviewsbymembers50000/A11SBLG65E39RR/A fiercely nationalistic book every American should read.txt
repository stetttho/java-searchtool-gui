 This book was a million-seller in Japan, and was translated into English in 1991.  The author was a promininet Japanese politician.   The book is dated, and history has not always borne out the author's views.  Nonetheless, anyone attempting to understand modern Japan should read it.  Some of the passages will be very surprising and disturbing.  Author Ishihara avoids the conventionally polite Japanese protocol and forcefully states that Japan is the equal of the United States, that Japan should have its own defense forces, (and strong ones), that Japanese computer technology is second to none and should be used as a negotiating tool, and Japan will be the most influential power in dealing with Asian nations.  Ishihara berates America for racism, and contends that the atomic bomb was not used on Germany because Germans were white, and Japanese were yellow.  He asserts that nations colonized by Japan have been far more successful following liberation than those colonized by the United States.  The book exemplifies the growing trend toward national pride in Japan, and also forcefully addresses the feeling by many Japanese that their nation is misunderstood.  Plainly, the sentiments in the book foretell a troubled period in Japanese-American relations, and remind us that the Japanese have not forgotten Hiroshima any more than America has forgotten Pearl Harbor.  Ishihara's call for a constructive dialogue between the two nations is well taken.  Otherwise, the future looks cloudy at best.  Very highly recommended, even if slightly dated.
