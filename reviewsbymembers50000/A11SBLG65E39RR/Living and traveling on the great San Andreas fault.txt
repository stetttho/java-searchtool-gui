 The San Andreas Fault, one of the largest transform faults in the world, runs from the Mexican border north to northwest California, where it finally enters the Pacific.  Millions of people live by ths fault and its branches, and are subject to its powerful earthquakes at any moment.  Yet few are familiar with its exact route, what it looks like on the surface, and how to take simple steps to protect against its spasms of movement.   "Earthquake Country" addresses these things in a simple, direct, and easily understandable fashion.  The photographs are well-chosen and striking, and the directions to various places discussed are highly accurate.   A few years ago, I took a trip along the fault, from Pearblossom, northeast of Los Angeles, to Point Reyes, northwest of San Francisco.  I saw hills ripped in half, streets that had moved, fault lines in roads, streams that followed the fault, lines of sag ponds crossing hills, and many other amazing features and things.  Without this remarkable, carefully crafted book, I would have passed many of these features without knowing of their significance, or even their existence.  The chapters on the central sections of the fault around Cholame and Parkfield were especially informative.  As he takes you along the fault, the author also discusses earthquake protection, and seismic geology in a crisp, professional fashion.  This book is must reading for any Californian, or any tourist who visits that wonderful state.  I really enjoy the book, and recommend it very, very highly.
