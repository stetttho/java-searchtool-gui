 This book was published in 1979, and is now out of print. I seldom recommend such books, especially in a fast-changing area of science. An exception lies here.  This book is about Ice Ages, from the Pre-Cambrian to the present.  Although some of the text is outdated, such things as the Atlantic conveyer current not yet having been theorized when this text was published, I wouldn't be surprised if it is still regarded as a valuable instruction tool.   Brian John should be commended for having compiled an easily read, yet encyclopedic, text of all relevant aspects of this area of science as of 1979.  The photgraphs, although in black and white format, excellently depict the concepts being discussed.  Some are classics.   The book's remarks about the dissolution of the latest Quaternary ice sheets remain timely in light of the current controversy over the status of the West Antarctic Ice sheet and its ice shelves. Equally of great value are the discussions and photos concerning the formation of such post-glacial features as outwash plains, (sandur), eskers, kames, and roche moutonees.  I highly recommend this book to any student of glaciology or Ice Ages.  Indeed, I do not believe a library on such matters without this book is complete.
