 It's distressing to know that Barnum was right about one being born each minute. Otherwise, how does one account for the sale of a book that is a mixture of sensationalism, half-truth, and plain fabrication? Anyone with the slightest knowledge of weather knows the scenario of ten feet of ice and all that other glop is impossible under the laws of physics. Equally, one supposes that if all the blocks from all the as-yet unexplained megaliths were stacked on end, we could probably rebuild the Trade Center. But what would it all prove? Nothing, of course, and that's just what this exercise in wasting valuable paper does as well, in terms of climate studies.   The book has its value, though, in that it does show the Dark Ages, where superstition reigned and truth hid, are never that far away. The authors should go back to tossing burnt sheep bones and reading tea leaves, and not masquarade as scientific seers...What a commentary on our educational system! I weep for the future.
