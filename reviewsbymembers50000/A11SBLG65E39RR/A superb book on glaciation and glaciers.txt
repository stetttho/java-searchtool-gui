 I was distressed to see this book is apparently out of print, as I believe it is the best, most complete book on glaciers and glaciation/glacial processes for the uninitiated reader.  The graphic photographs lose none of their impact by being in black and white, and greatly aid the reader's understanding in following the matters discussed in the lucid, easily read text.   Another virtue of the book is to emphasize, on first use, each term with which the reader may not be familiar.  Learning of the topics and copics is greatly facilitated.  Finally, the book contains easily understood diagrams of glaciers, and the landforms they create. Having read the book, the reader has become very familiar with the basic knowledge of this most important phenomenon, and stands ready to tackle more detailed work if he or she so desires.  I recommend this work very, very highly.
