 Vice-President Gore is probably the most scientifically well-read aspirant for higher office in recent years.  The boook is replete with carefully researched references on all of the major environmental issues of the day.  Some of his cited data is questionable, as in his recitation of major, but undocumented eruptions from Hekla and Etna volcanoes, and some of the dates appear out of sync, but these are relatively minor quibbles. Less certain of reliance are the conclusions drawn.  Simply put, the author is a latter Cassandra on the order of the celebrated Ehrlichs.  Gore is of the opinion that the bulk of the problems confronting mankind are generated  by human activity.  As an example, the Vice President seems absolutely immobile in his beief that climatic warming is the result of excessive fossil fuel use alone.  Evidence of previous warming and desertification episodes prior to the Industrial Age is given short shrift, and I believe this hampers an objective analysis of the issue.  All this being said, I recommend the book to the interested reader.  It presents one of the more lucid texts on the "Green" theory of politics and energy.  The book contains many arguable points, but I believe all but the most closed-minded would find them thought-provoking, even if some are not ultimately accepted.  I read the book before the last election, and although I didn't vote for Gore, I came away with a deep respect for his sincerity and depth of knowledge in the matters discussed.   It is refreshing in these times of Enronism, Monica-gates, and so forth, to see an aspirant for higher office delve into matters not traditiionally associated with candidates, i.e., the scientific discoveries of the day and their implications.
