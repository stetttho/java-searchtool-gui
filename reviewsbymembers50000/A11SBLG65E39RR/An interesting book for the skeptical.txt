 This is the first Edwards book I have read.  I must confess that I remain skeptical, if less so, perhaps, about the claims Edwards makes.  Nonetheless, the book is entertaining and engaging.  It points out the trials one who is challenging conventional wisdom must face, and does so in a mildly sarcastic, but charming way.  It is one of the few books on such topics that does not cast the protagonist as a messianic zealot, but simply a person with a gift that is desired to be shared.  For that, the reader should be grateful. The book narrates, and does not proseltyze.  The person who loaned it to me is, of course, a believer.  I cannot share that belief, but at least the book made me more open to literature on the subject, and for that reason, I would recommend it.
