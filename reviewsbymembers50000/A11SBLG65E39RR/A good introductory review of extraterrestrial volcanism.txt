 Mention the word "volcano", and most people think only of the Earth.  However, as this fine book shows, such is hardly the case.  Indeed, the phenomenon of volcanic activity is widespread in our own solar system. The text is introductory in nature, and the book is unconfounded by spates of hypertechnical language.  Anyone with an average scientific backgound will easily understand the great bulk of the matters discussed.  Excellent photography, both from telescopes, as well as manned and robotic space vehicles, closely follows the text and contributes to its comprehension.  I believe the author occasionally leaves technical terms unexplained, however.  Also, the photography is largely in black and white. The book begins with chapters on Earth's own volcanism, and then proceeds to other planets and moon, including our moon, Venus, Mars, Io, and Triton.  I found the chapters on Venus especially fascinating, given the wide variety of igneous features.  Any reader will come away with a well enhanced understanding of both our solar system and the part that vulcanism plays in its ongoing development.  Recommended highly, especially for student of and devotees of planetary astronomy and volcanic processes.
