 I would have given this book a five-star rating, inasmuch as it is an excellent intorduction to the area of between cosmic objects and the Earth.  It is well-organized, and the many color photographs and drawings are among the best I have ever seen in this area of scientific endeavor.  Reader's Digest and author Steel, an Australian astronomer, are to be complimented highly. The book excellently summarizes the history of impact studies, including discussions of asteroids, comets, impact features on other worlds, and contains a sterling chapter on impact features on the Earth, both recent and ancient.  It ends with a discussion of the danger from such events in the future, and of the means that might be used to prevent such a catastrophe.  The book is readily understandable for someone with a limited scientific background, and is probably the best trade book of its kind. That much being said, I was a bit put off at the constant drumming of a questionable theme, i.e., that the Earth is imminent danger of another such collision at any moment.   This past century marks two large impacts, both in Siberia, which the book covers very well, and two possible events in South America.   None caused known casualties, and to extrapolate from this a contention that cities may be vaporized almost any day is a bit far-fetched in my estimation.  It COULD happen, of course, but global warming, etc. seem much more in need of immediate attention.  Author Steel was head of an Australian project to spot near-Earth objects, and his pique at the cessation of the program for lack of funds seems to pervade this work.  Also, there are typos that are sometimes significant, such as mislocation of certain features, and the like.  Having so kvetched, I would still recommend the book highly, but for the above reasons, I cannot give it a five-star ranking.
