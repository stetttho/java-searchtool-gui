 For anyone with an interest in paleontology, this book is very good.  For anyone with an interest in paleogeography, the book is indispensible and a treasure.      The 50 pages of maps, while assuredly based in some part on learned conjecture, provide an unmatchable sense of the history of drifting continents and where these may have been located at various points in deep time.  For example, one can view the formations in the Colorado Plateau, and read innumerable treatises on them, but only when this book illustrates where North America was during the Triassic and Jurassic periods does the arrangement and appearance of rock beds in such places as Zion and Capitol Reef National Parks make easy sense.  Even absent any other reason, if you are reading this review, you owe it to yourself to buy this book.
