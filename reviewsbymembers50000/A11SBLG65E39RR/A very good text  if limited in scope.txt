 I am an unabashed McPhee fan.  See my review of "In Control of Nature".  However, this book does not rate the usual five stars, owing to a decision McPhee probably had little hand in making: the book's title.  So far as he peoples this book with the usual McPhee genre of characters, and so far as McPhee explains the geological considerations he addresses, i.e., CENTRAL California, the book is a great read, and would easily serve as fine regional geology textbook.  However, the book neither addresses volcanic Northern California nor the area south of the Tehachapis to any meaningful extent.   In that sense, the book was disappointing.   I still recommend the book, but I feel potential readers should not be misled by an overbroad title.
