 First published in the turbulent '60's, this book has attained a sort of cult status for that time.  It reflects many of the mores and problems of that generation of young people, and is worth it for a read for that, if for no other reason. So far as bomb-making and all of that, the book is technically good, but the methodology involving use of nitrogen compounds, particularly red, fuming nitric acid and cotton, to make guncotton, is fundamentally ununsound and unsafe.  You could blow a hand off or worse very easily, following Powell's directions.  I think "The Monkeywrench Gang" and others of its genre are more in tune with today's eco-warrior desires.  Also, the book never mentions the superiority of Oxydol and its green beads, as a binding agent for homemade napalm.  For shame. Even with these quibbles, the book is entertaining, and offers a clear glimpse into the mentality of a now-settled generation.
