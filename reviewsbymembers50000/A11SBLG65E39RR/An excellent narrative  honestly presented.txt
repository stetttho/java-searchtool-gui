 General Douglas MacArthur was one of those war heroes about whom much favorable legend was created by his own concerted efforts.  This book exposes MacArthur's megalomania, presenting much evidence that the tragedy of the 1950 Chinese counterattack could have been avoided had the book's subject been more objective and less interested in his image. MacArthur and his close assistants were informed of the massive Chinese infiltrations and chose to deliberately disbelieve it. General Almon, a serious admirer of Fascist leaders and principles, continued to pooh-pooh the Chinese power even after it became apparent.  MacArthur knew of these beliefs on the part of his chief assistant, yet continued to keep him in his post.  The book carefully documents MacArthur's misguided attempt to widen the conflict by running his own foreign policy, and objectively traces his disgrace after Truman had to fire him.  You can find this book here, of course, or in most used bookstores.. The price is reasonable.  The information gained about a historical aberration is most worthwhile.  I recommend the book highly
