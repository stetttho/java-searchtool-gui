 I bought this book in Charleston, S.C., the site of the East Coast's biggest earthquake since the Republic was founded.  It seems less and less people know that.  Likewise, the Carolina Bays seem an increasingly obscure geological phenomenon.  This book will cure those gaps in the general public's knowledge and provide an entertaining, competent read at the same time. The State of South Carolina has many other fascinating features, each of which are discussed in a manner that is neither demeaningly simple nor unduly complex.  The book could have used more photos, particularly color shots of the state's western areas, many of which are subtle beauty spots the year around.   This book is a fine guide, however, and is one of the better state-based geology texts.
