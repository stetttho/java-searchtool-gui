 Author MacKay has a loving relationship with the island he terms "The world's last unknown.", and with good reason.  Although he writes in the first person, in this instance that form brings out the true beauty and significance of this awesome place.  MacKay's smooth writing style makes the reader feel that he is with the author each step of each amazing adventure. The amount of generally unknown information contained in the book is staggering.  For example, Papua New Guinea has over 10% of the world's earthquakes each year.  The Fly River discharges more water than the Nile.  New Guinea has some of the world's most poisonous serpents, and yet some of the most beautiful birds.  Its wildlife is very much like Australia's, not South Asia's.  And the examples go on and on.  Each chapter is a moveable feast of the amazing and mysterious.  When the superb text is combined with the breathtaking photography, a treasure worth buying and keeping is obtained.  Of all of my books about places I will probably never have the good fortune to visit, this one ranks near the very top.  Highly recommended.
