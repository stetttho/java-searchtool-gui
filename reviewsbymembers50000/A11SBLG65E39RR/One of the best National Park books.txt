 I have a rather extensive National Park library, and this book is one of the best.  It is much more comprehensive than most books of its genre.  Unlike many works on this topic, this volume avoids "preaching" about essentially political considerations and, instead, only  addresses the geology, biota, climate and features of the parks themselves. The maps are very precise and get you where you want to go.  The color photographs and artwork are exceptionally beautiful.  It would appear they were chosen from a different lot than the ordinary David Muench telephoto variety.  This enables the reader to obtain an excellent grasp of what he or she may actually expect to see at each park.  The traveler is not deceived in arriving at the intended destination. Each park, 52 in all, is covered separately, usually in a 4-8, or so, page text, admixed with photos, maps, and also drawings, if any.  The text is very well drafted, and easily moves the reader through the various features of each park, while simultaneously offering a great deal of useful back ground information.  Again, the traveler is given a very good idea of what to anticipate, and how to prepare for the visit.  My girlfrind and I have visited 37 National Parks over the years,  We have found this book, along with the National Geographic guide, to be the most useful works in preparing for each trip. Neither work has ever disappointed or misled us;  a rare feat in this day of careless proofing and poor research.  I value this book very highly.
