 Ray Atkeson was one of the premier photographers of the American West.  His life was spent turning out reams of high resolution, large-format photos of skiing, mountain and ocean scenes, and all manner of celebrated depictions of the varied panoramas of the West.  This book is arguably his best. Using an obviously very large format camera, and excellent color film, Mr Atkeson captures the Cascades in their finest moments, commencing with his indescribably beautiful jacket cover photograph of Mount Hood at sunset.  Mr. Atkeson had the eye and heart of a pure artist, and his photographs of the various large volcanoes and numerous waterfalls of the range must be seen to be believed.   An easily read, well-organized text follows the journey north from Lassen Peak to the North Cascades National Park.  This text movingly portrays Mr. Atkeson's love for this scenic region.  The book was published before the epic eruption of Mount St. Helens in 1980, and we can only wonder at the awe the author must have felt as he photographed that event.  The book, and the photos, are works of a master in awe of his subject and will beautify and enrich your life, even if you have never visited the area.  I recommend it highly, with caveat that you must never loan out the book.
