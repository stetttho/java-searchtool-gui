 The San Rafael Swell is a huge geological blister located in east central Utah.  It is crossed by several creeks and has numerous beautiful canyons, cliffs, mesas, slot canyons, and grottoes. It is also marked by spectacular cliffs of white Navajo sandstone, particularly on the east and southeast borders.  There are a few big arches in the Swell and a host of gargoyle rocks.  It's a place that, were it anywhere else, would be a National Park or Monument.  However, in the scenic wonderland that is southeast Utah, it's just another unexplored place for the most part.  Up to this book, the bulk of the Swell's publicity has come from occasional uranium strikes. Author Allen has turned out a masterpiece. The book extensively covers all the things previously discussed, and a lot more, too. Especially interesting is the history of the region.  The maps and hikes/tours are clearly described, although I would have preferred measuring in terms of distance rather than time.   Quite obvious is Allen's enthusiasm for the place, an enthusiasm brought out in the text.  The pictures are good, but I would have preferred some of them in color, given the fantastic breadth of colorful formations in this region.  I used the book last May in a brief Jeep tour of the Swell, and found it to be very accurate.  I recommend the book highly to anyone who wants to see/explore this magnificent region.
