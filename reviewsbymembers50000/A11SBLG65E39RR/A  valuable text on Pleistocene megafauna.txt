 Pleistocene megafauna lived in my home state until appproximately 8,000 years ago.  I am currently working on a possible trade book in the area.  Holman's book has proven invaluable as a research text and resource material.  It is well organized, well written, and entertaining.      While Paleozoic life in Michigan is not high on my list of interests, I believe anyone so inclined would apply my assessment to that topic as well.  A must read for the paleontology buff.
