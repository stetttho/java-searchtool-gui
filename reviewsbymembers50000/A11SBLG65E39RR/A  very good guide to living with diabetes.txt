 Within the past month, I was diagnosed with early-stage type 2 diabetes.  I received a prescription for Glucophage, and some dietary tips, and a blood sugar testing kit.  Naturally, I wanted to know a lot more than that, so I talked with some friends who have diabetes, etc., and got a welter of conflicting advice.  So, on the advice of a medical professional in the field, I got this book.  WAS IT WORTH IT!!! Under fifty separate headings, (hence the title), the book explores various facets of diabetes, how it affects one's life, and how to change one's lifestyle so as to cope with the condition at a minimal level of difficulty.  Each section is jam-packed with facts and solid advice about the topic heading, and each is well-organized and easily readable.  The book is not highly technical, and is within the grasp of anyone with ordinary reading skills.  Most importantly, the book doesn't coddle or mislead the reader with a lot of Wayne Dyer- feel good baloney, but honestly and bluntly gives the reader a fair idea of what is being faced. Since being diagnosed, I have lost 7 of the 60 pounds prescribed, changed my dietary habits considerably, and gotten back some of the energy I thought I had lost forever.  Life is more full, and I look forward again to the future.  I truly believe that this book was very material in achieving these things.   This book is highly recommended to any diabetic, recently diagnosed, or otherwise.  It has helped change my life for the better, and I feel it can do the same for others.
