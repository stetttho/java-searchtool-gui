 I am a Colorado Plateau freak who probably has better than 50 books on the area, and who has taken at least a dozen vacations to the area.   Of all of my own books and some I don't own, but have read on the area, this is one of the very best.    The Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument was created in 1996.  It was long overdue.  The monument (And it should be a full-fledged National Park, IMHO.), preserves the most single significant block of Cretaceous strata in the world, numerous exquisite arches and slot canyons of exceptional size and beauty, tremendous geological faults, colorful, spectacular rock formations, fossilized animals and plants, and irreplaceable Native American relics and structures.  The area is still being explored and more of these and other wonders are being located each year.  This excellent book covers all of these matters and more in considerable written detail. Magnificent color photography follows the text and lays open this wonderful country for all to see.   The text is carefully drafted, and the photos follow the text very well.    If you never have the good fortune to visit this area, this book will give a very fine glimpse into the need for its preservation.  If you have visited it, as I have, the book will evoke countless pleasant memories.  IF YOU ARE GOING TO VISIT IT, for the first time, or on a repeat basis, read this book thoroughly to make intelligent decision about what to see and do, since you can't possibly see it all in one trip.  This book receives the highest recommendation.
