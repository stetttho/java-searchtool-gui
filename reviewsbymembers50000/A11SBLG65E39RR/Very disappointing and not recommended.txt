 Being a geology maven, I am loathe to pan a book on my favorite subject, but it must be done here.  This book is very amateurish, displays no sign of proofreading, and is horrendously inaccurate on any of a number of fronts.  The writer has utterly no idea of how to prepare a geographically accurate map of large-scale features, frequently misspells ordinary place names, makes great misstatements of fact, particularly in the area of lists of features, such as the names and diameters of meteoritic impact structures, and glosses over or ignores numerous fundamental geologic rules and precepts. Up to now, I have had a tremendous regard for Facts on File as a publisher of books about the natural world, but the Erickson series is one that has slipped through the cracks of their quality control system, and this is one of the worst.  Don't buy this book, or take it out from your library, unless you want to be greatly misinformed and an ignoramus about geology and geological features.
