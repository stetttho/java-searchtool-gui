 Although you could probably find books on the Four corners, the Gulf Coast, the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, Chesapeake Bay, the Great Basin, the Ozarks, and the badlands/prairies of the Upper Midwest, it would take you a very long time, and a lot of money to find books covering these regions as well as they are covered in this single book.  As usual, the National Geographic photographers have done an excellent job, particularly with the Upper Peninsula and the Four Corners.  The text is simply excellent.  The writers rhapsodically catch the essence of these lesser appreciated pieces of the American fabric, and of the lives of their inhabitants.  I enjoyed this book for weeks after it came in the mail.  I still do.   This is truly an unqualified five-star book.  Get one ASAP.
