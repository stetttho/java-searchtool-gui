 This book is a natural five-star.  It clearly and eloquently discusses the threat from asteroids and comets.  The scenario of a SMALL asteroid falling in the Philippine Sea should be eye-opening to even the most jaded.  Also especially worth reading are the chapters on Mercury and on computer created scenarios of falls over a century's time.  The book maintains a steady pace throughout, and is a must for anyone interested in meteoritics.
