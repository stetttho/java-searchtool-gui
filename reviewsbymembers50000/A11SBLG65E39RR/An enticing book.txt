 This is the first of two books by photographer David Muench about Utah, each entitled "Utah".  It is the better of the two, because Muench hadn't yet come to rely so completely on photographih tricks and overuse of the telephoto lens.  In this book as opposed to its successor, the traveler/reader will actually see some photos of things he or she will recognize when the traveler arrives at the site.  The photographs are all in color and emphasize the touristic draws of the state, e.g. the National Parks, particularly Zion , Bryce Canyon, and Arches, and the national monuments. Little attention is paid to more out-of-he-way places such as the Escalante canyons and the San Rafael Swell.  Good pictures of Monument Valley and the Temple Square in Salt lake City are also present.  Again, however, the reader is cautioned that Muench's use of the telephoto lens may result in a pretty picture, but that the sight depicted will never be seen without one.  Hartt Wixom's companion essay is a compelling, evocative portrait of the courage and determination his Mormon ancestors used in making Utah their version of the Promised land.  It is well worth reading.  This book is worth having if picked up at a reasonable price.  It is a fine coffee table work.
