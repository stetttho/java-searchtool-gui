 This book is another in a series of conglomerations of pseudo-science, where limited amounts of facts are admixed with a surfeit of ad hominem conclusions, and presented as a finished exercise in studied thought.  To say the least, although an atmosphere of copious study is fashioned, the result is sheer balderdash. The theory of extraterrestrial cataclysm set out is extraordinary, and the supportive proofs meager. Instead, the book relies on superstition, obscure and mystical folklore, and speculation, and the hard evidence is lacking.   At least it was my friend, and not me  who wasted the money this time.  I got stuck on Bell and Streiber's "The Coming Superstorm", which was just as bad, if less artful.   Both books are in the category of being entertaining page turners for short-hop flights, but which should be taken with the proverbial grain of salt.  Don't waste your money on either one.
