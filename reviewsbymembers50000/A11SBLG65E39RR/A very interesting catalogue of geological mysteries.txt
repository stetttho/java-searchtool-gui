 William Corliss devoted his career to the advancement of science by categorizing and cataloguing mysteries that had not been adequately explained.  He felt this was the truest way to advance knowledge.  A reading of this most interesting, if somewhat dated, book will show that stimulation of curiosity is indeed a useful tactic in expanding knowledge. Many of the matters Corliss discusses have now been solved or, conversely, disproven, but this does not detract from the wonder of the infinite variety of matters addressed.  The book covers all manner of things, from suspected giant impact craters to gopher holes in an endless kaleidoscope.   Caveat:  Before examing the text on features discussed, you must carefully read the introduction to assure yourself that Corliss is not one of these aniti-science, New Age, people, but a serious scholarly writer.  This small effort will enormously increase your appreciation of his work.  Highly recommended.
