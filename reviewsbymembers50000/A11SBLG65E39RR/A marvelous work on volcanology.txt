 This reaches the high end of trade works on the subject, and I suggest that some exposure to the sciences, particulary physical geology, is probably appropriate before tackling this book.  Having so stated, I believe this is the best book I have ever read on volcanoes, period.  The author is a person of considerable dry wit and humour,  and has achieved a masterpiece by making the subject readily understandable through excellent draftsmanship.  The photographs closely follow the text, and are unusually helpful.  I was particularly impressed by the fine work on the emerging science of pyroclastic flows; that most dangerous of volcanic phenomena.  Notwithstanding the fact that this book is some 7 years old, the text is remarkably current, and a must for anyone interested in pyroclastic flows and their perils.   Although the author indicates otherwise in his preface, I really believe this book would be very useful as a collegiate text on the subject of volcanology.  Obiously, I recommend the book very highly to all.
