 This book was released in 1973, and, even though dated in terms of developments in historical research, would remain a leading text in terms of explaining geological events of the past through mythology.  Of particular interest are the last three chapters, which address the multiple legends arising from the great Minoan volcanic eruption at Santorini in about 1500 B.C.  In addition, the book explores all manner of other legends, including the Deluge, the Mount Mazama eruption that created Crater Lake, etc.  A most refreshing aspect of this book is its scholarship.  The author totally avoids the drivel associated with such fiction writers as Whitney Streiber and Erik von Daniken. There is no invocation of imaginary aliens or manifestations of vengeful gods, etc., but only use of narrative from ancient peoples to explain things they could not understand.  For that reason, the book is valuable from a historian's perspective.  I highly recommend it.
