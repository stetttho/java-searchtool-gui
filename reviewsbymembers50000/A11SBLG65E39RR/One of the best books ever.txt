 There may be people who find the narrative unbelievable. Regarding such people, one is minded of the definition of a cynic as one who knows the cost of everything and the value of nothing.  The book is an inherently believable narrative of one who was willing, with his companions, to risk all for freedom. So was the girl they met. That part of the tale will make you weep, as when the men gave her a flower for her hair. It should not surprise anyone that the girl was not raped, since, by way of background, she was one with the men.   It becomes a tragedy beyond words when the girl, and one of the men, die in the Gobi Desert, but the party perseveres, just as when people died on the Oregon Trail, and in first crossing Death Valley. These two episodes also seem unbelievable, but they occurred, thus refuting the mean-spirited.  Two more of the men die while crossing Central Asia and the Himalayas. But four of the original seven make it to India.   Far from being a contrived fiction, the book appears to this writer to reflect a triumph of the human spirit. It is also offers keen insight into the difference between "civilization" and the inherent decency of man to his fellows. The book will make you swell with pride, bring tears to your eyes , and cause you reflect deeply and repeatedly, but you will never forget it.
