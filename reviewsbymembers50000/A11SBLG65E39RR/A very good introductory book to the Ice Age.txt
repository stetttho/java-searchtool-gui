 I recommend this book highly.  It is well-written and easily understood by the newcomer, yet sophisticated enough for someone with an earth science background.  The photography is excellent, with some pictures being remarkable for their spectacular beauty.  Both the photos and the superb diagrams follow the text closely.   I was especially impressed with Chapter 2, on the disappearance of the large wild animals, and with Chapter 3, on the development of solutions to the "cosmic problem", of Ice Age causation.  Both show the development of science via the scientific method in an exemplary fashion. The best chapter to me was Chapter 4, however, which discusses challenges to the proposed astronomical causation theory.  while the currently fashionable "Atlantic Conveyor", isn't discussed in detail, only its recent novelty prevented this.  It is noteworthy that this book has been quoted frequently in scientific abstracts. The book won't make you a glaciologist or a paleontologist, but it will surely whet your interest and increase your knowledge in these fields.  Any natural science library is well served by this book's inclusion.
