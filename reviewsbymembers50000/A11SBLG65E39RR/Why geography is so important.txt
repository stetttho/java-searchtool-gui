 This book is the best I have seen at explaining the importance of having a working knowledge of geography.  I admit to prejudice, having had Professor DeBlij for SubSaharan Geography while a student a Michigan State University over 35 years ago.  Time has only increased Professor DeBlij's enthusiasm and ability to communicate his expertise. Dr. Deblij traces the evolution of geography as a useful scholastic discipline by superbly relating its relevance to day-to-day living.  Additionally, especially through his discussion of yet-to-be-born nations such as Catalonia, Coastal China, and others, he shows the path political and social evolution might be expected to take in the future.  Knowing such things aids us in planning investments, travels, and numerous other actions.  Dr. DeBlij's style is the same when I had him in lectures: sprightly, organized, and very enjoyable.  You will enjoy this book on first reading, and will make recourse to it frequently after that polint.  Highly recommended.
