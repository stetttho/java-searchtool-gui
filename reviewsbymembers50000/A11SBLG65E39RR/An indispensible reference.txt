 As one fascinated by the Ice Age, especially vanished megafauna, I looked for a long time for a comprehensive book on vanished Ice Age animals of North America.  This is it.      The treatise is exhaustive in terms of what was known up to the publishing date.  If it is read carefully, it will impart a knowledge of these interesting animals and also give the reader an excellent backgound on the Pleistocene ice advances.  The authors' discussion regarding the breakdown of time periods is excellent.      Even though the passage of time and new findings, particularly in Florida, have lessened the value of some of the data presented, the book remains a peerless review of a dynamic part of Earth's history.       Caveat:  The reader should have some background in zoology and anatomy, otherwise constant recourse to a dictionary may be required.
