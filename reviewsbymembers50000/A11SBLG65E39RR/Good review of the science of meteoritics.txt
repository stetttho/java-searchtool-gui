 The science of meteoritics encompasses meteors, meteorites, and the features made by meteorites when they strike the Earth.  All three are well covered in this pocket-sized guide. The basic forms of metoerites, irons and stones, are excellently discussed, as are impact craters. The book contains a particularly good review of the huge meteorite crater known as the Ries Kessel, (Giant Kettle), a 15-mile wide scar in Southern Germany. I would have liked color photography, but the photos are well-chosen, if sparse.  The text rolls right along and is rated as high school graduate level.  Author Heide has written a fine introduction to the subject of meteoritics, and I give the book a good recommendation.
