 Being a Michigander, I was not familiar with palms other than by appearance. When I took a Florida vacation two years ago, I went to a farm near Miami that exhibited all sorts of tropical crops, and found this excellent book. Anyone desiring to acquire one or more landscape palms should consult this book as a crucial first step.   The first of three sections covers nearly all landscape palms in an encyclopedic fashion, complete with one or more fine color photos of each described species.   Each palm is also reviewed in terms of its salt and drought tolerance, soil, nutritional, and light requirements,  its appearance and size, its uses, and whether it has irritants to people.  Also addressed are the pests the plant may be expected to confront, and how the plant propagates itself.  The second and third sections of the book, although a bit redundant at times, cover much of the foregoing material in general, and also offer more photos.  Climate maps and nicknames are also included, as are excellent material for diagnosing illnesses or deficiencies in palms.  Although I am not presently a resident of Florida or any other tropical or subtropical area, I think anyone who lives in such a region, whether it be a professional horticulturalist or a do-it-yourself landscape architect, would be well served by having and reviewing this book frequently.   I rate it highly.
