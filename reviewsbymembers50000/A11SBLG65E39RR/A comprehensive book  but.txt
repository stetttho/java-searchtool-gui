 As one who finds the Southwest, particularly the Colorado Plateau, to be the most beautiful, thought-provoking, and inspiring place on Earth, I purchased this book with a grreat deal of anticipation.  A cursory review at the Arches N.P bookstore revealed that the photography was excellent, even sublime.  The collection of photographs avoids the trite, road tourist views in good measure, and presents the topics from a fresh, seldom-visualized viewpoint.  The sections on slot canyons, hoodoos, and natural bridges were particularly entertaining.       The textual treatment was less impressive, dwelling in most part on fundamental things any roadie would glimpse.  I would have preferred a more detailed discussion on the "why" of the formations and features.  So far as gaining a deep understanding of what has made the Southwest the world's premier geological wonderland, other books may be more appropriate.      This being said, I was nonetheless enchanted by the book.  I have visited every national park, most of the national monuments, and many of the out-of-the way marvels.  So have the book's authors and I am impressed with their care of the subject. Especially for the first-time visitor to the Southwest, I would count the book an essential read.
