 This book will hurt to read.  The Eliot Porter photos show what has been lost to our generation by the grossly irresponsible act of damning Glen Canyon.  However the book also shows what has been saved in pictures of the Grand Canyon.  May we know by our failure at Glen Canyon what to  protect, and why, in the future. Powell's own narrative, of course, forms the main written portion of the book, and its direct, yet eloquent, writings should remain a strong part of the story of what it is to be an American.  Equal parts dry text and awed wonder, it is a must read. A spiffy book, in the same vein as the acclaimed Sierra Club format series, of which I suspect this book may have been intended to be part.  Enjoy this essential part of any Western library.
