 The book presents an interesting first-person study of how the 53 mile-wide Chesapeake impact structure was identified.  The 40-million year-old feature is not apparent from surface observation, and its unmasking forms this classic tale of scientific detective work at is finest.  The author is not hesitant in issuing praise to those who knew some atypical feature was present, but who lacked the means or opportunity to categorically identify the structure for what it was.  In this respect, the narrative is delightfully free of much of the acrimony that has marked so many of the works about the Chixulub dinosaur killer. The book's text is highly readable and explains in an unpatronizing manner many of the tools and concepts used in solving this great scientific puzzle.  Also, the book's author doesn't allow himself to be bogged down in minutiae, an all-to-easy peril in a work of this nature.  The book is recommended to any teen or adult with a limited background in science, and to any and all persons with an interest in earth science or the scientific method in action.  I liked it very much.  Enjoy.
