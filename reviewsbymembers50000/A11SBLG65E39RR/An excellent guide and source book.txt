 When it comes to geology and geological processes, rivers and lakes are rather prosaic for the most part.  Yet these features play as key a role as any process in shaping the Earth as we know it. Professor Pringle's book is one of the very few that discuss the physics, chemistry and mechanics of these everyday, but marvelous features.  Written in a well-organized, easily read and understood manner, the book also contains excellent color photographs and diagrams, depicting the nature of things addressed. You will learn how lakes are born, reach middle age, and eventually die.  You will become acquainted with why meanders exist and how they are a product of a river attempting to flow with the least possible energy.  A special chapter on the Great Lakes and Lake Baikal shows how true inland seas function.  I have been a geology buff for years and this is the best book I have seen on the subject, bar none, for the reader who does not have a specialized degree in the area.  I recommend the book highly.
