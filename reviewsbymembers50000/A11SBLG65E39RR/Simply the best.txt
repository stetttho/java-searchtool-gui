 This book is the one that got me started going out West over a quarter century ago. I've never regretted it and read the book about every other year along with "Slickrock", (another Abbey masterpiece), for old times' sake.   Ed Abbey always maintained he wrote to eat. He would have scoffed at allegations that his first book was a brilliant, evocative, militant, sentimental, enormously literate, invitation to help preserve what was left, (even though it is). Lake Foul, behind Glen Canyon Damn, broke his heart, but he remained a vibrant influence for free thinking until his death. This book, though it was his first, is still his best memorial. If you don't read it, it is your loss. There may be people who won't like it because it presents a viewpoint too easily eschewed in today's Enron-ethic climate.  They are the ones who should read it most.
