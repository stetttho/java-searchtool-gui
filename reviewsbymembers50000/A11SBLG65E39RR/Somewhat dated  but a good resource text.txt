 McCall is an Australian researcher with a very conservative bent.  He is much more inclined toward finding a terrestrial cause for craters and cryptoexplosion structures than he is toward offering, or accepting, an impact theory of origin.  Even so, contributions such as McCall's are valuable because they make they drive the impact proponent's research to be that much more accurate.  This book is not for the amateur, and a considerable exposure to impact phenomena is necessary before tackling this book, even though the dedicated amateur may find much of interest.  Anyone in the involvement of researching a possible astrobleme is well advised to be familiar with Dr. McCall's work.  I recommend the book highly to persons interested in impact craters and structures.
