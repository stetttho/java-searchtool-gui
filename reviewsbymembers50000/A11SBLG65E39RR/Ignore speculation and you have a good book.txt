 I liked the book, but do not rate it as highly as "Rain of Iron and Ice" by John S. Lewis and "Impact" by Gerrit L Verschuur.  However, it is much better than "Fire on Earth" by John and Mary Gribben.      My chief reservation about Steel's work is that he seems easily drawn to flights of whimsy such as Clube's and Napier's contentions regarding Beta Taurid cometary impacts that have affected history on a mammoth scale.  While these are captivating proposals, perhaps, there isn't enough hard scientific evidence for them clutter up what was otherwise a hitherto fine scientific presentation of a real problem  by Steel.  Up to the author's dalliance into the speculative, the book is a good read about a serious, overlooked, preventable threat.  His admonitions should be taken seriously.
