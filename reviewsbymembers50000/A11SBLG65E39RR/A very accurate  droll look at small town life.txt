 For anyone raised in a small Midwestern town, as I was, this book is fascinating.  It is dryly humorous, and never truly abrasive, as it wends its way through anecdotes of small town life and personal foibles.  If you're looking for Doestoyevskyan character studies, as one reviewer seemingly was, go elsewhere. But if you want te meet people, and institutions, that you loved, or scorned, or simply observed in passing, this is your sort of book.  You'll remember these folks and their stories a long time after you have forgotten more in-depth characters. I have often said there are two books anyone wanting to know about life in a small town should read; Main Street, by Sinclair Lewis, and this book.  Main Street is negative in chief, whereas this book is wistful, gently amusing, and equally accurate, if not more so.  It is a very underrated work, and I recommend it most thoroughly.
