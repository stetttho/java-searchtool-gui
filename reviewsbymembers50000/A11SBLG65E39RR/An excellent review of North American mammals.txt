 This book is a fine review of the many families of North Anerican mammals and of their individual members.  From shrews to whales and from opossums to man, this book is encyclopedic in sweep, yet easily grasped by all readers.  The photography in many instances is esceptional. and the descriptions and discusssion are scientifically impeccable.   Good descriptions on habitat, diet, bahavioral traits, and much more are included. The book includes a unique section on exotic mammals brought here by the hand of man.   I highly recommend this book to both the interested layman and the professional.  It is a valuable addition to any outdoorsman's library and excellent for children as well.  An exemplary effort, National Geographic!!
