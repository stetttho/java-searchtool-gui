 Most apocalyptic novels are marked by spectacular explosions, loathesome invaders, or the like.  This one is not.  Instead, in a very believable scenario, a rice virus develops in China, and the Chinese government tries to keep it secret.  However, when the great famine develops, the UN comes up with an isotope that stops it.  But the cure is worse than the disease, for this allows an all encompassing grass virus to come out of hiding. What follows is a civilization ending virus that kills all grasses, including all food grains.  So, in one swoop, livestock and grain are gone.   The Eastern hemisphere descends into famine and cannibalism.  In England, the site of the story, the government decides to use H-Bombs on the cities to alleviate the famine.   All well and good, and frighteningly believable.  But what isn't at all credible, and what detracts from the book is the tale of a few people who go into a small, secluded English valley to live on potatoes and root crops.  Except for a brief foray, the group faces no meaningful attack, and the book ends with the Western Hemisphere intact, and the valley's few survivors planning to build new cities.   The ending is a sop to the desire to give some hope where none would exist.  Personally, I much prefer George Stewart's much more honest approach in "Earth Abides."
