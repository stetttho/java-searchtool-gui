 This book is a part of the "Planet Earth" series  from Time-Life.  It well-written, well organized, and well illustrated.  Many of the photos are in color.  The first chapter, and a succeeding one, concern hurricanes, and the explanations of hurricane dynamics are excellently explained, abetted by well designed color diagrams.  The first chapter concerns the Great New England Hurricane of 1938, and is one of the better narratives I have ever read about this stupendous event.  Especially interesting is the disclosure that exactly the same sort of disaster occurred in New England in 1815!!!  The book also addresses tornadoes, albeit in less detail than I would have preferred, blizzards, and the not quite ordinary thunderstorm.  It seems tornadoes do not lend themselves to detailed narratives very well  I was very impressed with the chapter on how Norwegian scientists discovered and named the processes involving the movement of storms, air masses, and fronts.  This was probably the most re-read chapter of the book.  This bood will not make you a meteorologist, but it will enable a sensible understanding of the phenomena our turbulent atmosphere casts our way.  Recommended highly, especially for high schooler and weather devotees
