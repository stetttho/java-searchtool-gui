 This book's author, George Stimson, was a lifelong newpaperman. The book is a collection of much of the curiosities, trivia, and essential facts such persons need and accumulate over many years, and is an utter delight to read.  Now are there exactly 1,000 items covered?  Mr. Stimson doesn't say, and it doesn't matter.  You will learn the origins of sayings - "Pennies on a blind man's eyes", where things are, e.g, the Balkans, who first said a famous quote, how a unit of measurement originated, etc., etc., etc.,. This data is neither collected nor presented in a simple question and answer format, as is the unfortunate instance with many of today's cheap trivia books.  Rather, once the question is asked, the answer comes in a fairly lengthy or set of lengthy paragraphs chock full of tidbits and information about the subject, including, in almost every instance, things you never knew or even suspected about the topic.  Everything from soup to nuts to atomic physics to why things happen, or how they originated is found here.   Each turn of a page presents another pleasant surprise. You shouldn't sit down and attempt to read this book cover to cover in a few sittings.  Instead, just enjoy it a few pages at a time.  It is a fun book, with sprightly prose, and yet serious about the topics presented.  If I had to start a private library with one book, this would be it.  Very, very highly recommended.
