 This book is a fine introduction to the science, power, and beauty of volcanoes.  The text is written for the lay person and will not bowl the reader over with technical jargon or esoteric equations.  It is well organized and very well written.  A particularly good feature is the review of many of world's best known,(and some not-so-well known), volcanoes, by way of short chapters on each. Each volcano is described in terms of location, type of volcano, dangerousness. and eruptive pattern.  The book is excellently illustrated in what appears to be a four-color format.  These photographs alone would make this book a keeper.  Some are simply spectacular.  The book's numerous explanatory diagrams are also in color and seamlessly blend with the fine text and photographs to produce a comprehensive guide and text.    I would recommend this book to anyone with an interest in physical geology or volcanoes, whether neophyte or expert.
