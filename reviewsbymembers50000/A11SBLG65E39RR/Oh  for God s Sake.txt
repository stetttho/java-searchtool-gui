 Books of this genre simply prove the age-old adage that if you want to believe something is so strongly enough, you can  convince yourself of its existence.  The book's premise is pseudo-scientific, but its true underpinning is faith in the intangible, standing alone.  Such, of course, is a mere outgrowth of the human tendency to explain the inexplicable by an easy recourse to the Divine, rather than do hard thinking and research.   Now, please note carefully, I am not saying there is no God, but I am saying this author hasn't proven it by scientific means, as he endeavors to have you believe.  And it's not for lack of effort.  What people like the author do not realize is that matters of pure faith are beyond proof by scientific means.  The inevitable result is a laborious effort leading to a glimpse into the obvious, i.e., that the author believes in a Creator, nothing more.  There are a thousand books of this same type, and this one is just a different wrinkle on the same pattern of cloth.  If you think that by reading this book you will unlock the secrets of the ages, you are in for a severe disappointment.  Don't waste your money.
