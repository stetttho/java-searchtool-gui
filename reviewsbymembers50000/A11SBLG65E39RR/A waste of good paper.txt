 This is a good example of the typical self-delusion of creationism passing as serious thought.  All the book really proves in its pages is that if a person wishes something to be so badly enough, it will become so, but only in his or her own mind.  The stratigraphic "evidence" is selectively presented in a distortive, inaccurate fashion, so as to suit conclusions previously reached.  The serious reader on the subject is far better advised to read Kurten's "Not From the Apes", and not some drivel like this book.
