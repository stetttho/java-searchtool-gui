 This is my first Bernd Heinrich read.  It will not be the last.  The author is simply one of the best at translating his very considerable scientific expertise into readable, entertaining narrative that is easily understandable, entertaining, and enjoyable. This particular book examines the intelligence of ravens, birds that some disdain to their eternal error.   Primitive peoples, who were far closer to nature than ourselves, readily understood and appreciated the cunning, slyness, and outright cognitive ability and reasoning possessed by the remarkable raven.  Numerous legends, including Biblical references, prove the point. Heinrich refreshingly shows how scientists are rediscovering these traits, at long last.   I am no expert on birds or avian science, but I am a country boy who spent a good many hours watching birds in action.  Ravens were always interesting to me, and are far more so after reading this wonderful book.  I would have appreciated more photos and diagrams, but this is a minor quibble.   I recommend the book highly, and urge you to read it.  You will be continualy amazed, and the book will hold your attention to the end.
