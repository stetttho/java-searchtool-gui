 Harry Caudill was a native of Eastern Kentucky.  His narrative of life in what has become a monument to corporate greed is sensitive, feeling, and very much to the point.  The people of the Cumberland Plateau are a polyglot mixture, which Mr Caudill takes great pains to unravel.  This part of the book is truly exceptional, and is enriched, not cheapened by Mr Caudill's tracing of his own ancestry back to the times of the Spanish Armada.  Mr.Caudill shows how a wholly separate culture developed from the combination of escapee indentured servant, local Native Americans, and Eastern Europeans.  He expertly portrays the religious fundamentalism, outsider domination, and cynical exploitation that have held these people back from self-achievement over the generations.  Mr. Caudill tells you how the land, the rivers, and human lives have been repeatedly despoiled by King Coal.  He feelingly describes the squalor, poverty, ill health, and tragedies suffered by the region's people. It is not a tale for the overly sensitive, certainly. Mr. Caudill reflects the ethos of his generation by advocating large-scale government programs to allay the region's problems, a "solution' this writer views with some skepticism.  Nothwithstanding this, Mr. Caudill is a genius at showing how particular regions evolve very differently from their neighbors and what happens to those who are left behind.  I recommend the book to anyone interested in regional sociology, the South, and the Appalachian country.  It is well worth the read.
