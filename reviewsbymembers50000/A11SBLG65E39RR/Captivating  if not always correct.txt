 Any dinosaur enthusiasist should have this book.  The text is eminently readable, and many of the proposls made are ahead of their time and thought-provoking.  The drawings are excellent and more realistically approximate the probable apppearance of dinosaurs, especially ceratopsins, than any others I've seen. Bakker is entitled to his occasional displays of hubris given the number of times he has successfully defied convention and been proven correct.  However, I cannot agree with his theories regarding extinction of these animals, since the impact theory is simply too compelling in terms of hard evidence.  Only for this reason do I not give the book a five star rating.  Even so, it is a must read.
