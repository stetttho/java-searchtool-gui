 I believe this is the greatest book by one of the best authors of all time.   To open a St. Exupery book is to think of the spring sun on a cold, cloudy January day.  Where does one go from here?  To St. Exupery's soliloquy on finding a meteor in the sands of the Sahara?  To his tale of surviving the rigors of the desert?  To his description of night over the South Atlantic? It is a question that cannot be answered.  One should not even try, but should only linger rhapsodized over each description of even the most mundane things by this irresistable wordsmith.  Some people never wrote badly, even once.  He was one of them and the world is much poorer for his early departure.  At least he left this peerless work about early mail pilots.  Adieu, mon cher ami.
