 Most touristic field guides are remarkable either by a dearth of meaningful information, poor photography, or both.  This book, and its parent series, for that matter, suffer from neither, and form excellent works that are a proud part of anyone's library.   With respect to the instant work, the text is exceptional, containing many captivating facts about animals a lot of folks would regard as very ordinary and uninteresting.  Did you know, for example, that beavers were once wild in Florida, were trapped into extinction. and that they are now returning?   The great color photography closely follows the expertly-prepared text, and brings out many detailed facets of the creatures described.  I would heartily recommmend this book and its companions to anyone, tourist or native, who has any sort of interest in  Florida or North American wildlife or nature.
