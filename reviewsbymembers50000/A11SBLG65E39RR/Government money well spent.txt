 The title of this review may seem curious, but I believe the USGS quick response team and observatory are a prime example of what government should do. These folks saved innumerable lives at Pinatubo, and will undoubtedly do so again somewhere else at a place we don't yet know. The book is worth four stars for its description of the people, and the principles they used in thwarting a catastrophe in the Philippines. The narrative of how this eruption, as well as those of Ruiz and St. Helens, were confronted shows how far we've come, and how far we have to go. The villians, if any, are the print-first, save-people-second administrators.   The book is a comfortable read, not easily put down. It won't make you a volcanologist, but it will show you how you could be saved by one. A good book, and thought-provoking
