 The dangerous propensities of the midcontinental earthquake zone known by the name of the New Madrid fault system are part and parcel of life in the area where the Ohio River joins the Mississippi river system.  In 1811 and 1812, a bone-shattering series of earthquakes took place here, three of which are estimated at over 8.3 on the Richter scale, devastating this region, creating new lakes, making the Mississippi run backwards for a time, raising hills, and changing river courses.  If such a series of events took place today, the consequences would be almost unimaginable.  Atkinson's book explores these matters with a studied eye, an easily understoood writing style, and contains many excellent diagrams forecasting where future quake damage will occur, and in what amount.  It also contains a shocking series of narratives about how little has been done to prepare for the next emergency.  Make no mistake, the New Madrid earthquakes of the early nineteenth century are not the last seismic events in this region.   This book should be required reading for every local and state government official in this region and, especially for every civil defense person.  While no one knows when the next giant eathquake will occur, and it may be some hundreds of years away, the magnitude of the potential disaster dictates readiness now.  Examples would include strict rules regarding construction of building highways, bridges, pipelines, levees, sewage and water systems and the like.  This book points out clearly what should be done.  I recommend the book highly.
