 For the most part, our country's most spectacular natural sights are in our national parks. However, the discerning traveler can also find much to admire and photograph in our many fine state parks.. This book covers some of the best from each state. Some would even be in the national park system if not already protected by the states.  The usual excellent National Geographic photography attends a fine, readable text. Maps show you where to go and how to get there. I really believe that anyone planning a motor trip should consult this book before drawing up an itinerary. Otherwise, you run the risk of missing much that is great in our country.  A definite must for the traveler. I recommend it very highly.
