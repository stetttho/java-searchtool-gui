 This excellent book is one both residents of Florida and visitors to that state will enjoy, and refer to again and again.  The color photography is peerless and well-selected. The text is easily readable and proceeds in a logical, understandable fashion, beginning in the Northwest Florida panhandle and proceeding south through the Keys. Florida's Fabulous Natural Wonders review the jewels of Florida nature, as preserved in the Federal and State park systems.  In addition to such obvious topics as Everglades National Park, you will learn about, and see Florida's tallest waterfall; yes, it's 67 feet high, Florida largest lake, the biggest springs in the country, and much, much more. A particularly attractive feature of this book is a listing of all of these parks in the back of the book, together with their location, and what each park contains.  This is very helpful for planning entire vacations as well as simple day trips.  The Table of Contents is on the last page, but now that you have read this review, you know where to look. I suggest that any visitor to Florida should obtain this book beforehand, so as to plan ahead for seeing and experiencing the many wonderful natural things this increasingly populated state has managed to preserve.  This book is a fine compliment to "Florida's Natural Wonders", a book I have previously reviewed.  I recommend each book very highly on its own, but, together, they are exemplary.
