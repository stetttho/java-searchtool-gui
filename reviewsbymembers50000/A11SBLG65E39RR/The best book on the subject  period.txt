 This book is just simply superlative in every respect, bar none. It comprises a survey of the world's wetlands, continent by continent, following a comprehensive introductory section. You will surely read about wetlands areas of which you have never been aware.  You will see pictures of them that will simply amaze you by their beauty and form.  Each chapter contains vignettes on that area's most important wetlands, as well as a detailed map of each continent and its wetlands.  The written text is excellently organized and easily readable. Depending on the reader's preference, however, the most attractive feature of the book may be its incomparable color photography.  Some of it is so compelling as to present an almost surreal effect.  A good example is the cover photograph of the baobab tree, standing like a huge bottle over lily pads in an African pond.  Each chapter, as well as the book's conclusion shows the harm that is being done to wetlands, and the consequences that follow such activity.  This is a must read part of the text.  In summation, the book is endlessly fascinating.  I received it as a Christmas present a few years ago, and I have enjoyed it endlessly since that time.  I am sure this experience will apply to any person of a high school education with an interest in nature. My recommendation is so high as to be off the scale.
