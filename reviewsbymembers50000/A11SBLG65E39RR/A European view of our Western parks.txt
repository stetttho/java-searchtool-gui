 This book is a refreshing, VERY well-photographed coffee-table work on the national parks of our Western States.  Both author and publisher are British.  The text is easily read, and is organized on a park-by-park basis, following an introductory chapter.  The reader is given a photographic viewpoint different from that of the usual American brand of telephoto and wide-angle pictures that leave distorted expectations.  Most, if not all photos are realistic depictions of things a first-time tourist might honestly expect to see.  The treatment of the Utah and Arizona parks, and Crater Lake is especially good.   The book evoked many pleasant memories for me.  I heartily commend it to all, especially persons who have never visited these wonderful crown jewels of our nation.
