 (NOTE: Why Amazon persits in showing an incorrect jacket for this title is wholly unknown to me.) Now, then.  The area once called "Turkestan" is one of the most mysterious areas on the globe to most Americans.  It now consists of the independent nations of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan, all former Soviet  "republics".  It is that broad area north of Afghanistan and Iran, east of the Caspian Sea, and west of China. A great amount of the area is desert or barren mountains, but cotton farming is also practiced, and a great deal of the world's pistachio nuts are grown here.  This great place is the home of the saiga antelope, the kulan,  a wild ass, numerous birds, and the desert monitor, a large dangerous lizard.  All are shown in marvelous photographs. Also shown are a wild beautiful landscape, sand dunes, grassy and forested mountain peaks, and numerous photos of Issyk Kul, the world's sixth deepest lake.  There is an entire chapter on this amazing feature, and also a half chapter on the Kara Bogaz, an inland evaporation sump the Caspian Sea drains into on its eastern side. It is next to impossible to find any other book that examines this region, and, certainly, to find any book so enjoyable.  The author is a former Siberian, who captures the spirit and temper, not only of the Soviet government as it then existed, but also of the inhabitants of the region.  Mr. St George narrates his wanderings with an easy grace, complete with local idioms, in a manner that reader will find so comforting as to believe that Mr. St. George is telling the story personally. This book is a five-star keeper for anyone who likes history, geography, remote lands, biology or just simply, interesting writing about interesting places.  DON"T LOAN IT OUT. Very, very highly recommended
