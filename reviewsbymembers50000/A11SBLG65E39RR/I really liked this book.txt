 A cousin tipped me off to this little known masterpiece, which consists of a short, well-written series of anecdotes and tales about the West.  An expert in verbal imagery, Schultheis takes you gambling at Native American pow-wow, canyon ratting in Utah, meeting a jack rabbit who lures motorcyclists to their doom, and other esoteric topics with equal aplomb. His best tale, and the one you won't forget, is the last in order, a fictional episode during the next great Western drought, when the xerothermic climate brings disaster west of the Mississippi.   Schultheis is very readable, and each essay is thought-provoking.  I predict you will enjoy this wonderful book.  As the previous reviewer cautions, however, loan it out at your own risk.
