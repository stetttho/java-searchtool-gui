 I'm a Michigan snowbird.  I didn't know one shell from another until I purchased this highly interesting, informative book.  I have derived many hours of pleasure from looking at the colorful, spectacular photgraphs of the amazing creatures that make the depicted shells.  When one combines these with a text that is readable, finely detailed, and which closely follows the photographs, a book that should be part of any Florida visitor's library is obtained.  Get it, and read it, before you go, and enhance your trip!! I might note that my high recommendation extends to all books in this series.  Since purchasing this and other volumes in the series, I have been able to discard a lot of lesser quality materials purchased on earlier trips, and yet increase the quality of my library.
