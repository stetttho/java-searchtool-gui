 This fine book summarizes the results of the 1997 Sudbury conference on the titled topic.  The papers on terrestrial impact structures, both known and possible, are very well done.  Particular reference is made to the papers on the Acraman, Beaverhead, Manson, and Zhamanshin structures, each of which open the field of meteoritics to new directions.  Also well done is the paper on the origin of the suspected impact crater at Al-Umchaiman, Iraq.  But the main highlight, in my view, is the excellent, closing series of papers on the renowned Canadian structure located at Sudbury. This text is not for the rank amateur, but is very enjoyable and informative, if you are into meteoritics and impact mechanics/structures, either as a student or a professional.
