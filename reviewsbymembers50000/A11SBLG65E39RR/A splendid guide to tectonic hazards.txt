 This book is a five-star summation of the numerous tectonic hazards faced by human civilization.  It is impressively written and contains numerous, informative color photographs and diagrams.  Each discussion is separated and encapsulated into a mini-chapter; a format I find facilitates depth of understanding.  Target Earth!, by Duncan Steel, covering impact hazards from asteroids and comets, is similarly well organized. The book is very up-to-date in terms of the science involved.  The discusssion of the mega-tsunami hazard from La Palma volcano in the Canary Islands is especially impressive, and frightening.  The entire United States East Coast is threatened by a landslide and giant tsunami from this volcano.  All such cities will be destroyed if the worst case scenario takes place.  While the world very likely is not going to end tomorrow, it can be greatly readjusted by powerful tectonic forces leaving great destruction in their wake.  Anyone interested in geology or geophysics, or living in a tectonically active area should read this book closely.  The same goes for any coastal dweller, with respect to tsunami threats.  I recommend this book very highly.
