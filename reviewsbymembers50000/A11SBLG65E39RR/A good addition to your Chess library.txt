 I purchased this book about a year ago.  I have found it very useful in keeping my chess game sound and up to date.  I was particularly pleased with the analysis of the Benko Gambit, inasmuch as my previous books had not addressed that tactic.  The book contains analyses of other recent developments, as well. With reference to more traditional openings and defenses, the book does not measure up to Horowitz: Chess Openings: Theory and Practice, so far as I am concerned.  The variations of each opening, as well as theit nuances and theories, are simply not as thoroughly explored and explained. This book is a good work for the serious player, but I would obtain and read Horowitz' book first.
