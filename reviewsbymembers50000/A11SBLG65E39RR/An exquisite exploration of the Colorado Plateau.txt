 The number of photographic works exploring the nuances of the Colorado Plateau is seemingly endless.  Many can be browsed once and left behind.  This book is the scintillating exception.   Jack Dykinga's photographic work is simply exceptional, and beyond the pale.   Each color photograph appears as exquisitely crafted as a piece of fine crystal, beginning with very cover of the paperback edition.  One can only envy his great patience and expertise in composing each work.  Much of the photography comes from the Paria Wilderness, an area of the Plateau not usually treated to any degree in most works, and the novelty is refreshing.  A particularly enjoyable facet of the book is that use of a telephoto lens has been largely eschewed, leaving a series of scenes that the enterprising tourist can find and view with his or her own eyes, just as depicted by the book.  Charles Bowden's accompanying text is evocative and hearkens a wild diffusion of images and memories of the fascinating region.  It is an apt companion to Dykinga's superb work.  If you are limited to five or less books about the Colorado plateau, let this be one of them.  I enjoy it more every time I read it.
