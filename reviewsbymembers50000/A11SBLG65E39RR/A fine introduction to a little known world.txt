 The kelp beds along the central and northern California coasts are a vast botanical and zoological wonderland known by few, and probably appreciated by less, given their history of commercial exploitation.  Kelp are some of the largest plants in the world.  The book begins with an examination of kelp itself, its reproductive and growth processes, and its role in ceating a unique, delicate ecosystem. Attention is then turned to marvelous fishes, mollusks, birds, and and mammals, including the once nearly extinct california sea otter.  The book also addresses the many uses of kelp, and the nuances of its harvesting and its long overdue conservation.  The book is very well organized and written.  The four-color photographs are a delight, as well as being helpful in understanding the text.  I was fortunate enough to buy this book at the Monterey Aquarium, which must be visited, before actually seeing the kelp in the wild.  I found that reading the book was a boon in appreciating and understanding what I was looking at, particularly in drives along the Big Sur coast and in Point Lobos State Park, which is worth at least one full day on its own.  If you are going to this part of the world, or if you live there, this book is a must.  Very highly recommended.
