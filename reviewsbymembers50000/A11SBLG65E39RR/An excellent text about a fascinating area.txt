 The cypress swamps of the southern United States were badly treated for years and decimated in many instances.  However, their role in the ecology of the South became more appreciated as people became aware of the rare creatures and plants these forests and lakes held, and when they also became aware of their economic utility in such areas as purifying water, etc. This book brings out these facets of cypress forests as well as clearly and excellently discussing the flora and fauna found in them.  The discussion on these marvelous trees, themselves, is worth the book price.  Excellent photos abet this effort very well. The major swamps are covered on a chapter-by-chapter basis.  The reader gains an appreciation of the unique nuances of each. I found the chapters on the Great Dismal Swamp and the discussion of the mysterious Carolina Bays most enjoyable.  Being a Michigander, the cypress swamp is not an item with which I became familiar until I was an adult, and even then, I had a great lack of understanding of how this eco-system works and why it is important to preserve it. This book greatly filled those voids in my knowledge. Additionally, the book is a good vacation guide for anyone planning a trip to the South.  These swamps, or at least one of them, are worth seeing.  You will have a far better time, and understanding, of what you are seeing, if you read this book first.  I recommend it very highly.  It is one of the better regional ecology books in my library, and a real keeper.  Certainly, anyone who teaches geography or biological sciences should own it.
