 A friend loaned me this book two months ago.  I haven't returned it yet.  It is simply the best book on these two parks that I have ever read.  The authors accurately portray the very considerable geological power present in each park, and yet do not manage to make either park a fearful place to be avoided.  Instead, their writing is a persuasive invitation to visit these wonderful manifestations of nature for an extended period.  I was particularly impressed by the visitor's tour set out near the end of the book.  I took a part of that tour in 1994, and the narrative is very accurate.  I will certainly use my OWN copy of the book when I go back again this autumn.  (I don't want anyone to think I don't return borrowed books!) This book is an absolute musthave-mustread for anyone going to the parks or interested in the geological processes that have made the West. Enjoy.
