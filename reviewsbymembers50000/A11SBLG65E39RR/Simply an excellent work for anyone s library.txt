 This book is written somewhat on the order of Reader's Digest's Natural Wonders of the World.  It covers several hundred mysterious places, such as Easter Island, Stonehenge, Maya ruins, Jericho, Machu Picchu, Angkor Wat, Mesa Verde, the Bermuda Triangle, etc.  Many lesser known, equally interesting places are covered as well.   The format is a simple title heading followed by a page or less written description, usually in great detail.  Each heading is generally accompanied by one or more color photos that seem to have been carefully selected.  I have been fortunate enough to visit many of the places discussed, and I assure you that the writing is so evocative of their appearance as to bring back a host of fond memories.  Even though the book went out of print rather quickly, for reasons I cannot understand, it is a prize, and I believe it can be enjoyed thoroughly by teen readers and higher.  Archeology buffs will go wild over it.  I recommend it highly.
