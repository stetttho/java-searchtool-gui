 There are a good many textbooks in the highly competitive market for this subject.  This is probably the best.  The writing is clear and easily understood.  Needed definitions are introduced at appropriate junctures.  The excellent diagrams and color photographs are carefully selected to follow the text and add much to its substance.   Finally, the broad subject matter of physical geology, including plate tectonics, vulcanism, earthquakes and faulting, mountain building, various forms of erosion and sculpting, minerals, and rock-making processes, among many others, are all encompassed in this book.  Physical geology is the study of the Earth's physical processes, and is the opening door to further study of geology.  You can't understand the rest of geology until you understand physical geology.  Count yourself fortunate if your instructor selects this text as your guide.  Even if you aren't taking the formal course, this book will enhance your understanding of our wonderful Earth.  I highly recommend this superb book for anyone who has a highschool education.
