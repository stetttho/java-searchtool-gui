 Steve Crouch is that rarest of photographers: a true artist in the medium of photography whose writing skills are equally gifted.  You may need a dictionary at times to keep up with his lyrical flow of English, but, after all, isn't reading supposed to be a learning experience?  Don't be intimidated.  Crouch's precise English adds much to his description of one of the most beautiful places on the planet: the Monterey Coast and Big Sur of California.  Crouch became a resident of Carmel years ago, and begins his tale of the region with how that decision took place.  This delightful anecdote is followed by others equally evocative.  Mr. Crouch reviews the place itself, the human communities and their history, and closes with a fine, thoughtful epilogue.  The photography is in color, and absolutely outstanding.  In addition to the usual brilliant seascapes, forest and mountain vistas, etc, the author also offers a beautiful panoply of microphotography about local plants, houses, and the way of life in this Eden.  Here is an artist with a purpose. I bought this book a while back.  I have since vacationed in the area four times. One of the delights is to attempt to catch things in the same photographic light as Mr. Crouch did.  Not an easy task, but, surely, the enjoyment lies in the attempt. You will love this book from the moment you first see it.  Do yourself a favor and get it now.
