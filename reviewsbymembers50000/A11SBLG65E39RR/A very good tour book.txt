 This book excellently explains why the eastern half of the State of Washington and the lower Columbia valley are so curiously carved.   It also shows how a truly observant scientist works, even though his vindication may be slow in coming.  While some persons might wish for more color photographs, I believe the black and white format, particularly in the Grand Coulee region, better shows the power and scope of the floods that carved these otherworldly channels from bare lava rock.  The drawing of a typical Bretz flood has to be seen firsthand to be believed.  Another exemplary book on the geology of the West.  Don't see Grand Coulee or the Columbia Gorge without reading this book.
