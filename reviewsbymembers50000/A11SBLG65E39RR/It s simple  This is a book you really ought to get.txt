 This book is out of print, and that's too bad.  It lists over 200 places around the world, most of them natural features, that are truly amazing.   Some are large, (Antarctica), some are small and very remote (Rabbitkettle Hot springs in the Northwest Territories.).   While North America may have a few more items listed, even Africa has it s share, including many little known waterfalls and mountain ranges.   I was a geography major in college, and I was stunned at how many of the overseas phenomena I had never even heard of before.  The book is a continuing voyage of discovery.  The descriptions of each feature are factually excellent and well written.  The photographs are all in color and excellent. The maps supplied, in some, but not all, instances are clear  and well drafted.  Your world will be much broader and more full once you obtain and read this excellent volume.  Don't even try it all at once.  Just leisurely peruse a few items each time, and your sense of wonder and beauty will grow each time you do.  Very, very highly rated.
