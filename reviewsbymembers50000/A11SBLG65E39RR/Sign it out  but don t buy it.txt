 I read Winchester's, "The Map that Changed the World", and so I came into this book with high expectations.  I was sorely disappointed.  Krakatoa's 1883 volcanic eruption was one of the most stupendous geological convulsions in recorded history.  Much has been learned about it in recent years, as volcanology has advanced.  Yet, coverage of these advances in science is sketchy at best.   Rather, the book's chief thrust, if such a term can be used in rating a very disorganized text, appears to be a review of Dutch colonial policy and life in the latter part of the 19th century. Sketches of lives affected by the eruption are varied in quality, and, again, are scattered hither and yon, in no particular order, throughout the book.  A reader unacquainted with the history of this event may glean some information on several topics with which he or she is unrelated, but to persons who have previously read about the eruption, the book is a sad disappointment.  One is legitimately led to wonder if Winchester simply decided to hurriedly capitalize on his fame from his previous book.  I do not recommend the purchese of this book, but interested readers may wish to sign it out at a local library.
