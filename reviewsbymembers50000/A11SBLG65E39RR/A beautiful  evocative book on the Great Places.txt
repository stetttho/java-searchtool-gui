 Dewitt Jones is a master photographer.  His pictures capture the glow in the rocks that is so frequently referred to in conversations about the Colorado Plateau.  He seems to have just the right touch in bringing back memories of this wonderful region.  I can almost feel the chill morning air at Bryce Canyon, the heat in Zion, and the dust in Canyonlands.   Stephen Trimble is one of the finest of the younger Western author/naturalists.  As with Jones and his photographs, Trimble has a manner of expression that evokes nostalgia with every page.  The book is organized on the Navajo six directions: East, South, West, North, Zenith, and Nadir.  A seventh direction; the heart or center, is also discussed.  These reference are most appropriate, and it is fitting that the Navajo method of direction is used in discussing and photographing their home.  This beautiful book is one of the finest coffee table books I have ever seen.  You will enjoy it for countless hours, again and again.   Note: Don't cheat yourself by buying the paperback.  The hardbound version is infinitely better.
