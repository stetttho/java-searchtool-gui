 This calendar's purchase and examination is always a pleasurable event, and I have saved them for some 20 years.  The 2005 edition measures up well.  There appears to be a bit more emphasis on close-up photography in this year's edition, but the subjects chosen are very beautiful and some of the finest photography anywhere, I daresay.  Another splendid work.  Bravo!!!!
