 South America is home to many of the world's most spectacular natural wonders.  These include Angel Falls, the world's highest waterfall; Iguassu Falls, one of the world's largest waterfalls; the world's largest river, the Amazon; and the Patagonian Icecap, the largest in the world outside Greenland or Antarctica. All of these magnificent features and a host of others are covered in the text of this book.  Especially noteworthy as well are the Andean parks, such as Mount Fitzroy, Torres del Paine, both awesome mountain ranges, and Machu Picchu, the lost city of the Incas, discovered by Hiram Bingham in 1911. This book addresses various national parks in South America's  nations, including the parks that encompass the foregoing marvels. Good travel tips are included in each article, including where to stay, what to do, fundamental regional courtesies and idiosyncrasies, expedition tips, etc.  Each featured park description also includes a map and black and white photos.  The centerpiece of the book is a series of extraordinarily good color photos coviering the more spectacular areas. The text is easily read and provides excellent, frequently unanticipated advice for the North American or European traveler.  For anyone planning a trip to see the natural side of South America, this book would seem absolutely essential.  I recommend it highly.
