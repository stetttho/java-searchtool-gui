 This book was written shortly before the author's death in May, 1991.  He died in a pyroclastic flow from Mt Unzen in Kyushu, Japan.  Kraft's lifelong passion was volcanoes, and his wife, fellow volcanologist, Katia Krafft, who died with him, were  widely renowned for their skill and daring in obtaining the very best in photos of erupting volcanoes, and for their help to many in predicting eruptions and otherwise forwarding the science and popularity of volcanology. This particular book traces the history of volcano study from rank superstition to the latest in science at the time of the author's death.  Numerous passeges from others' writings are set forth as part of a very well conceived and edited text.   Numerous color photographs, old etchings, and other photographic and artistic aids augment and explain the fine writing. Volcano buffs, from the lay reader to the USGS expert, will appreciate and enjoy this book immensely.  Be one of them.
