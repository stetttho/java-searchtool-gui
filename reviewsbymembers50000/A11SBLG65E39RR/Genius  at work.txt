 This is a collection of short stories by J.G. Ballard, whose surrealistic approach to science fiction reaches its apex in this effort.  "End Game", a story of executions in the future, leaves the reader not exactly knowing if the imprisoned political leader is about to be executed at its end, but the character development borders on the fabulous.   Also recommended most highly are "Now Comes the Sea", and "Chronopolis", the latter being the story of a society where time measurement is outlawed, and of the outlaw who wants to bring it back.. You will never forget any of these stories.  V Very, very highly recommended.  This is a genius at his best.
