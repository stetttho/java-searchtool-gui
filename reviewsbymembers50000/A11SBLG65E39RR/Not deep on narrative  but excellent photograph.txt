 The basis history of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake of April 18, 1906 is well known, and will be repeated endlessly as the centennial of this geologic event occurs.    The present volume is a photographic glimpse into the awful events of fire and collapse that followed the earthquake.  The book is not long on discussion, but the clarity and starkness of the photographs reveal much that discussion never could.  For any student of geology, or of California history, the book is a valuable addition to one's library.  These black and white vignettes of a terrible disaster tell us much about the life and times of that bygone era.  I recommend it to all.
