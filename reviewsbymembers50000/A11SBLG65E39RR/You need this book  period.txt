 Fifty-five national parks are covered in this wonderful little book, which is knapsack-sized for easy storage and reference.   Capably written and photographed, this guidebook answers nearly all FAQ's about all National Parks except Cuyahoga Valley and Grat Sand Dunes.   If you want to know where to go, what to expect to see when you get there, the route to take, where to stay, what kind of weather you will encounter, what hazards to expect and prepare for, etc., etc., this is where you should look.  'Nuff said, except to note that I give the book a well-deserved five-star rating.  Buy it and enjoy.
