 This book proves much, but not in the way its author intended.   Instead of refuting evolution through a decidedly disingenuous "conspiracy theory" that all geology and most physical science are contrived constructs to support evolution, this book simply proves that religious extremism continues to be the enemy of knowledge.  Any person with a relatively basic background in science can readily decipher the lies and distortions presented.  In the place of combatting ignorance, a reading of this book  compounds it.  The author makes his his mind up at the start, and in a collection of faulty syllogisms and ignorance of reality, simply shows that lack of understanding  in a field comprises no basis upon which to explain it. Save both your time and money, and read something productive and logical.
