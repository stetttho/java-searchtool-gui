 This book, although texted for the 10-15 yer old reader, is excellent enough to be enjoyed by readers of all ages.  It briefly examines all manner of large creatures, both extinct and living, and by full-color, scaled drawings, with a man and and woman for visualization, shows how truly huge such things as apatosaurs and blue whales really could be.  One of the interesting features is that each and every creature is drawn in the same scale, so such things as triceratops and modern rhinos, and mammoths and elephants and tyrannosaurs, may be compared.  You will receive some surprises.  I recommend this book to all readers.
