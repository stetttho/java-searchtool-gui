 This book is an extremely interesting study of the gigantic cataclysms caused when the ice dam holding back impounded  glacier-melt waters in western Montana's Lake Missoula would periodically burst.  The consequent outrushes repeatedly resculpted lands in northern Idaho, and eastern and central Washington, resulting in the curious, almost eerie, landforms covering much of that area today.  Excellent photography amply demonstrates these effects.   Dr. Alt is a good writer, whose text carves a continuous, easily-followed thread that brings to life the events surrounding these floods, and their effects.  His enthusiasm is contagious. This book should not be read alone, but in conjuction with the book, "Cataclysms on the Columbia", written earlier.  Any tourist going to the Northwest, and certainly natives of that wonderful region, will enjoy both books, and gain a valuable, lasting impression of this most peculiar part of the Earth.  Each book will give directions to the most spectacular phenomena as well.  I highly recommend each, but again suggest both should be read in conjunction.
