 Utah deserves its PR-created title as "The Best of the West".  When it comes to bright, even garish, multi-colored rock formations, canyons, mesas, arches, pillars, cliffs, and grottoes, Utah has no equal.   What would be a national park or monument in any other state is a feature whose name isn't even known to most locals here. From Zion to Dinosaur, and all points south and east, Utah is a scenic wonderland par excellence.  This is the second of two books, bearing the same title, by photographer David Muench.  Here, the companion writer is Ann Zwinger, the renowned Western naturalist.  Zwinger's writing, of course, is peerless.  In a brilliant essay, she captures the nature of this beautiful, but difficult, land and those who have settled it.  I commend it highly. Muench's photography is another matter.  The subject matter is excellently chosen.  In this book, as opposed to its predecessor, Muench has left behind the obvious tourist magnets such as Zion and Bryce Canyon, to focus on such little known, but equally striking areas of beauty and wilderness, such as the San Rafael Swell, an area that could easily be a national park.  This is commendable. However, as with most of Muench's work, undue emphasis is placed on use of the wide-angle and, particularly, the telephoto lens.  The result is pretty pictures, but ones that are deceptive to the traveler/reader.   No one is ever going to see, except through a telephoto lens, the things Muench shows in this book. You may detect that I don't care for this form of presentation, and you are right.   I would much rather see photographs by Ray Manley or Fred Hirschmann, who obtain items of surpassing beauty without visual distortion being necessary. So, while the book is a nice loaner from a library perhaps, I was disappointed after having bought it.
