 Although an ocean of material has been written about the Holocaust, this book stands alone.  The author has chosen the best way to present the material; by simple factual recitation.  No amount of pejoratives would suffice, and even one would cheapen the book. Salut!!!!!!!! Davidowicz examines the underpinnings of pan-European anti-Semitism, its "legitimization" by the Third Reich, its consequences on the victims, and the awful results masterfully.  Especially excellent are the sections on why so little resistance was offered until the end, when resistance was a gesture, not a viable tactic.  You will never forget the first mayor of the Warsaw ghetto, Adam Czerniakow.  This book is unforgettable, and earns the highest rating possible.
