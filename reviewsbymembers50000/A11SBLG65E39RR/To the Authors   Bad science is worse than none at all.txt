 Admittedly, the book is not intended as a scientific text, but only as a page-turner on a long flight.  Even so, I expect that such books, if they are purportedly based on science, ought to at least try to get it right.  Here, no such effort is apparent. The narrative regarding the meteorite is so skewed as to make a knowledgeable reader wonder whether the authors ever read anything on coesite, other than to see how to spell it correctly.  Where's the crater?  Etc., Ad nauseam. When a book starts that badly it's at least even money it won't improve.  It didn't here.  The plot is murky. The characters are stereotypically incredible. The ending is disingenuous, openly begging for a sequel, which we can only hope will be better researched and better crafted.  Save your money.
