 For any s/f devotee, particularly Wells fans, this book is a must.  It is an absolute feast for the mind, disclosing any number of fictional but feasible possibilities, and how people cope with their unexpected benefits and dangers.  Most of the stories are tightly written, boldly imaginative, and always entertaining.  I and couldn't put it down, even after I had read it through the first time.   By way of examples, in separate stories, you will encounter a lost Inca kingdom where no one has eyes; two chemists who discover an alkaloid so powerful that men who ingest become equipped with the power to move at super speed;  orchids that anesthetize people and suck their blood; ants that become intelligent and drive people out of the tropics in South America: how the Earth barely ecapes destruction when two planets collide and pass by on their way to the Sun;  the tale of the first adventurer to descend into the ocean depths,  the man who discovers the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge in Eden,  and on, and on, and on.  In typical Wellsian fashion, each story is festooned with those small details giving examples of careful though and review.  for example in "The New Accelerator", the author is careful to not how the men's clothing becomes singed because they move so fast.  The number of things Wells envisons that have since come to exist include paved highways, powered flight, descent to the bottom of the sea in steel globes, and many more.  It is perhaps ths aspect of the book that is the most fascinating. For entertainment and intellectual stimulation from s/f, Wells is hard to beat.  This book is very highly recommended. DON'T LOAN IT OUT.
