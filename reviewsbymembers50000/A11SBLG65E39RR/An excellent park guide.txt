 The Eastern United States is underrepresented in terms of national parks.  The early settlement and development of our country precluded some sites, like Niagara Falls, from inclusion.  But others, thankfully, made it.  This book covers them.  As to the Great Smokies and the Everglades, so much has been written about them that this book offers an overview many will have read in the past at another source.   However, as to the two new Florida National Parks, Biscayne and Dry Tortugas, this book is an invaluable resource.  Our trip to these two outstanding areas this past spring was made much better by previous reference to this book.   Both are marvelous additions to the national park system, especially in terms of marine life, a factor well covered in this book.  Fine, capably selected photography attends an excellent text.  For the mentioned parks, as well as Acadia and Shenandoah, I can think of no better single text.  This book is a real keeper.
