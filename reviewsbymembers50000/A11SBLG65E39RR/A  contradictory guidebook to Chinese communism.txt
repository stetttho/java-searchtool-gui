 Mao-Zedong was the leader of China's Communist Revolution.  He was a man of many faces; soldier, military strategist, politician, revolutionary, poet, fugitive, and leader.  This book is a collection of quotes gleaned from his speeches, writings, and interviews over several decades.  Mao's utterances must be read two ways.  The first is as exhortations of the ideal.  The second is as justification for what was actually done.   Mao seems to encourage dissent and analysis as the basis for revoutionary improvement on the one hand, but the record reveals that his rule was as an iron dictator.  Equally, he exhorts the faithful to achieve stability, but history shows his ill-fated Red Guard movement nearly tore China apart.   I could go on at some length, but I leave the reader to make his or her own choices from the vast panoply of available material.  I do not believe this is a work that can or should be read without some prior knowledge of Twentieth Century Chinese history.  The book is important for understanding the Chinese world view as we enter dubiously into the 21st Century.  For that reason, I recommend it.
