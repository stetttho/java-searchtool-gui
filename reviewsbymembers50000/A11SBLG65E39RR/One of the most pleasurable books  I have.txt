 Despite its small size and paperback format, this is one of my most treasured books.  I am a resident of Michigan, and the fall is always a highlight of our year.  Michiganders, as an army, await autumn leaves and "leaf peeping", as young children await Christmas morning.  This is the ONLY book I've ever seen that really gives its reader a good understanding of this beautiful phenomenon.  The first 17 or so pages give a physical, chemical, and biological discourse on why leaves change, and on what goes into the makeup of the various colors.  The next 100+ pages cover all deciduous trees of northeastern North America, in turn, with a good discussion of each species being attended by excellent four-color photographs of the subject tree in various formats, including group, solo, and partial shots.  Finally a sixty-page section gives the same ememplary treatment to northeastern North American evergreens.  These, too, form part of the fall patterns, albeit in a more subdued way.  If you live in the area bounded by Ontario, Minnesota, Missouri, Tennessee, Virginia, Maine, New Brunswick, and Quebec, or are planning to visit any states or provinces in that area this fall, buy this book now, and read it over.   You'll be glad you did, this year and every year.  I would give this book a ten-star rating if I could, and recommend it highly.  An invaluable bargain.
