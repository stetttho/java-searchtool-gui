 If you are planning a trip in the United States, this is your book.  Most areas of the country are covered.  The chief attraction in a region, e.g. Sleeping Bear Sand Dunes, is covered in detail, followed by paragraph-or-so sketches of 15-20 other sites within traveling distance of the main attraction.  Good color photos attend the main attraction and some, but not all, of the secondary attractions are also photographed.   The book is well-organized and capably written.  I have planned numerous trips using this book as a main reference.   Had I not had access to the book, my girlfriend and I would have missed a great many interesting, beautiful, and educational places in this great land of ours.  Even though the book is now dated a bit, most of the listed attractions are natural ones, and so the age of the book is irrelevant to a great degree.  I prize the book highly and strongly suggest its purchase.
