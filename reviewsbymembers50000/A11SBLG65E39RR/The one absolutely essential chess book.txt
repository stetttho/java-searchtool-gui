 I have had my copy of Horowitz for over 30 years.  I don't think one can truly learn to play competent chess without reading it. Although outdated in some resects, the book is really timeless.  The notation is traditional, not algebraic, but I prefer it that way.  Horowitz' work is peerless in examining the theories and nuances of each opening.  His games are well-selected, and each offers a slightly different viewpoint into even the most pedestrian of openings.  All significant openings as of 1960 are covered. Horowitz has a gift unmatched by other chess authors in terms of enabling the reader to see what has already been accomplished, AND what remains to be accomplished in each variation.  The reader thus becomes a participant, not merely a rote memorizer.  I prize my tattered, dog-eared, scribbled-upon copy of this book almost more than any other book that I own.  My recommendation is off the scale.
