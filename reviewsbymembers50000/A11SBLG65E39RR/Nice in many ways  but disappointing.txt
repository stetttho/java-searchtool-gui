 I am a fan of the Colorado Plateau, particularly southeastern and eastern Utah.  I have visited the Moab area several times, and bought the present volume with great anticipation.  I like it, but...... Some the directions are a bit confusing, without a map being handy.  I would have anticipated either an enclosure or an insert.  A minor thing, perhaps.  The second, major disappointment lies in the fact that the book, except for its two color photos on the covers, has all photos in a black-white format.  The area around Moab is remarkable for its multi-color rock formations.  The brown of the Entrada, the cream of Navajo, the red of the Wingate, and the chocolate of the Moenkopi rocks each carry that layer's signature, and also provide a valuable guidepost for the tourist familiar with the differences.  Here, the reader is denied that information.  I wish the blurb for the book would have told me more about the photo layout.  So, even though the text of the book is sufficient for the most part, the foregoing factors prevent me from giving a higher rating than I do.
