 Lenin once said that "Chess is the gymnasium of the mind.".  This book is an exercise tool of that facility.   The book begins presuming one has never seen the game, and proceeds to take the reader through increasinly difficult themes by use of programmed learning, a most useful device.  The new player will strengthen his or her game quickly , and the intermediate player, such as myself, will benefit from refreshing forgotten themes, and occasionally discovering a new one.  If you are looking for new opening strategies, or detailed middle game analysis, go elsewhere.  This book is very short on theory, but long on training the eye and mind to spot lines of weakness and strength ahead of time.  It will enhance most players' appreciation of the endless subtlety of chess, and I recommend it highly, subject to the foregoing commentary.
