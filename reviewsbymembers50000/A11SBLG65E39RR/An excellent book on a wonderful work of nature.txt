 There are three types of redwoods; the sequoia, the coast redwood of California, and the smaller dawn redwood of China.  Like cycads and some other rare or endangered trees, redwoods are a relic of the Age of Dinosaurs, when they proliferated around the globe.  Now they are confined to relatively small sections of the world.  They are still capable of reducing all but the most cynical into a quick, silent state of awe.  In a well-organized book, capably and eloquently written, author Hewes brings the biology, history, and ecology of all three varieties home to the reader in a seamless, continually interesting fashion.  The admirable text is accompanied by excellent historic and modern photos, some of which are heartbreaking.   Examples include clear-cut areas of redwood forest and the senseless cutting and dismemberment of the most perfect sequoia, the Mark Twain tree.  The author manages to present all facets of the conservation controversy without taking sides, preferring to let the facts speak for themselves, a rare accomplishment in this Age of Advocacy.  Hewes is to be commended for this even-handed approach.  No one visiting Sequoia, Kings Canyon, Yosemite, or Redwood National Parks should go without first reading this book.  It will answer nearly all FAQ's about these fascinating plants from the Mesozoic, and will truly enhance any such trip. I recommend it very highly.
