 My primary interest in the area of meteoritics is impact strucures.  This book offers a fair discussion of that field, but is primarily concerned with meteorites and those who hunt, collect, and sell them.  In these respects, Norton's presentation is unparalleled.   The book is an easy, enjoyable read and may be perused by persons with no background in meteoritics.   The biographical sketches of Ninenger and Haag alone give unique worth to the book.    The only real reservation keeping this book from a five star rating is its Apprndix C, listing suspected impact craters.  Several of the listed items appear nowhere else in the impact literature I have reviewed and the listed size of many features varies from other calculations.   But, then, I should do so good.
