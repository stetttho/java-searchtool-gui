 It is ironic that the publisher lauds this book as "expertly researched".  Yet, I have never seen a book so rife with what are either typographical errors, plain misstatements of fact,  erroneous map locations, and the like.  I seriously wonder if anyone proofed this book before rushing it to publication.   For instance, the Soufriere volcano on Guadeloupe did NOT erupt in 1908 nor, obviously, did it kill 1,600 people that year.  Hibok Hibok volcano is located in the Southern Philippines, NOT off the northern coast of Luzon.  Many of the short narrative on Caribbean hurricanes are grossly in error.  I could go on for quite some time, but you get the idea.   The color photographs are attractive, although, again, mislabeled all too frequently.  The same would apply to the maps in the Gazeteer section of the book.  I cannot recommend this book for purchase, because there is simply too much misinformation in the contents.  This is unfortunate, as the pictures are good.  But many who would want this text would desire it for information on where they live, or intend to move or travel.  This book would do those persons a disservice.
