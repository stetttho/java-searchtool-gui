 For all the (...) hullaballoo, this book simply presents another example of the oldest story there is; the Eternal Triangle, and its consequences.  Granted, some of the facts are novel, i.e., a law clerk having repeated intercourse with a judge who was manifestly unqualified to be such, but who, even so, should have known better.  Of course, the law clerk tires of his wife, and so he kills her.  THE CONVICTION HAS SINCE BEEN UPHELD ON APPEAL, to no one's real surprise.  I live in the county where the law clerk and judge worked.  She was suspended, and then left office before the voters could throw her out.  We feel sullied by what took place.    The book is an effort to bolster the defense's case after the facts were adduced and the case decided.  Despite its one-sided nature, the book fails in its quest.  Mr. Fletcher is where he belongs, and the only amazing thing is that he didn't try to take the judge with him, so as to bring down his own sentence.  Apparently, even cold-blooded killers have some small vestige of morals.  The book addresses nothing really new in the human experience, caters to the tawdry, and I'm sorry I spent the few hours I did on it.  Don't even bother, unless you are really bored, and have absolutely nothing better to do with your life.
