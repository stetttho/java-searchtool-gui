 This book is one of several that surfaced after the Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 struck Jupiter in 1994.  It is not one of the best.  In the place of substantive science, the authors offer much in the way of conjecture, and while the book contains numerous interesting factual tidbits, the overall effect is to sensationalize the prospect that the Earth and its occupants are in imminent danger of being exterminated or terribly damaged and reduced by an impact. Large Earth-asteroid collisions are sufficently rare that one affecting all of civization to a damaging degree has never been recorded, and the Gribbens' effort to transform this basic truth defeats the credibility they seek.  This book will leave average reader uninformed and possessed of many a half-truth and sensationalized perception.  The reader is recommended to works by Duncan Steel, John S. Lewis, and Garrett VerSchuur, and to leave this text on the store shelf where it belongs, moved to realm of "documentary" science fiction.
