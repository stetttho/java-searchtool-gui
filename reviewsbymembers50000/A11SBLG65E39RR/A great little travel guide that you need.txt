 Since most vacations involve some travel on the Interstates,  a book that covers them is indispensible.  This is that book.  It is pocket-sized for easy carrying and jam-packed with useful information.  The book covers all major freeways, and has over 600 full-color photos and maps carefully selected to closely follow a well-written and well-organized text.  An excellent feature is that the discussion of each Interstate begins at one end of the road and terminates at the other.   This enables the traveler to briefly review the book at day's end to plan the following day's activities.  The book shows and discusses National and local parks, museums, historical sites, and major cities along each road. This book is an excellent way to capture the varied geography of the continental United States in a nutshell.  You will be amazed at the things you discover and at how many interesting places are near where you live.  Obviously, I recommend this book very highly
