 The chance of Earth being struck by a large asteroid or comet is neither more nor less now than it has ever been.  If nothing else, this book will bring out that fact.  So for all the folks who want to believe in the magical or the preposterous, such as Nostradamus, Velikovsky, and other fantasy spinners, go elsewhere If, however, you are a person who accepts things scientific, this is your book.  Professsor Verschuur is an excellent, lucid, organized writer who does not waste the reader's time with forays into the specculative or ludicrous.  Instead he forthrightly presents the overview of, and the detail behind, the genuine, if remote, danger that human society will receive heavy damage, if not outright destruction, from a large impact event.  He accurately points out that the remoteness of this eventuality is offset by the magnitude of destruction that will occur if a large impact happens.  I have studied impact phenomena for some years, and this book is the most-fact-filled, well organized book of its genre.  It is not only an excellent starting volume for a study of this branch of science, but is a good wake-up call for organizing attempts to meet the danger.  The Professor does not patronize his reader, but neither does he presume a level of knowledge beyond the ken of the average well-informed adult.  I recommend the book very highly and would urge anyone interested in this topic to make it a priority purchase.  It is the book by which all similar texts should be measured.
