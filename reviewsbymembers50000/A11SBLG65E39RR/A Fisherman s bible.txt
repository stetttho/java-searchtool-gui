 This entertaining, informative book covers all main North American sport fish, both fresh and saltwater, in separate chapters as to species group, e.g. trout, catfish, tarpon, and so on.   The written text contains answsers to all FAQ's about each fish, including fishing techniques, lures, geographical range, size, fighting ability, etc., etc.  In short, this well-drafted book is a gold mine of information for the beginning angler or the experienced veteran.  The narrative contains colorful anecdotes as well as more standard material and can be enjoyed by anyone.   Sharp, clear, dramatic color photos closely follow the text, and add a good deal to it.  I recommend this book highly to one and all.
