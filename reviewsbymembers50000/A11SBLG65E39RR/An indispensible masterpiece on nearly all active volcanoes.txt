 This book is one of a kind. I don't understand how anyone who likes volcanoes and volcanic phenomena could not go wild with this book. The book gives the location and height of each of the 1,511 volcanoes known to have been active in the last 10,000 years.  A few more have been discovered since the 1993 publication date, but this defect can be easily remedied by recourse to the GVP link on the Net.  More importantly, each known eruption is described by date, duration and explosive power.  Also,  each eruption of each mountain, no matter how many, has its chief characteristics set out, including type of eruption and fatalities and damage, if any.  The book contains copious footnotes for the serious reader and a thorough general discussion at the start.  Interesting black and white photos and drawing are occasionally found as well.  The total accumulation of presented data is immense.  However, anyone with a moderate scientific background will not be overwhelmed. Residents of the Western U.S. and Canada should read the history of these regions with particular care, since the book shows eruptive patterns and locations of many underpublicized volcanic areas with great precision.  This enables informed decision-making in the event of the next activity of any of these features. The only parallel I can find in any other book is The Baseball Encyclopedia.  If you want to know anything about a given volcano, it's probably here.  For the interested reader in geology, it is essential, and for the volcano "geek", it is Nirvana.  I've had it for over three years and I still peruse it regularly. VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!
