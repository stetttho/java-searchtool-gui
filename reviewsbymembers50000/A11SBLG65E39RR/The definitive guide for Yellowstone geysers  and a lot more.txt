 If the phenomenon of geysers interests you, this is your book.  It should be the yardstick by which all others on the subject are measured.  Superbly well organized, and written, this book readily conveys the author's enthusiasm for the subject.  I would have preferred a few more color photographs in addition to the cover, but this is a minor quibble.  The black and white photos are chosen carefully, and give a good idea of the feature involved. The book discusses all known geysers in Yellowstone, which park contains a substantial majority of these features on the planet.  Maps are supplied, and are easily deciphered.  Data is given concerning the eruptive pattern of each geyser, where known, and this proved most helpful during a recent trip to this magnificent area.  The feature I enjoyed the most was the detailed appendix, setting forth all known geyser fields anywhere on Earth.  I guarantee some of the locations and features will surprise you.  The author also discuuses which of these fields are most endangered by unwise development of geothermal power. Very, very highly recommended.  Indeed, I should say it is indispensible for anyone planning a trip to Yellowstone National Park.  Enjoy.
