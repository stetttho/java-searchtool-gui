 When someone says the word "Florida", most of us think of sandy beaches, Disney World and the other theme parks, palm trees, and the Everglades.  Did you know Florida has caves where you can walk about, and see beautiful stalactites and stalagmites?  Did you think Florida had small waterfalls and high sand ridges, or that it is one of the largest subtropical forests in the world, or that it was part of Africa long ago?  Florida also has many types of life zones, including tropical forest, savannah, dry canebrakes, swamps, and the largest freshwater springs anywhere. These and many other fascinating, little known facts, and places, are shown in this book. The text is well-organized, by region, and easily readable.  The four-color photos, using both 35 mm. and large format cameras, are simply breathtaking.  This book is the single best book about Florida's geology and ecology that I have read.  Whether you are actively planning a Florida vacation, or whether you live in Florida, you should read this book to learn more about the fascinating, off-the-beaten-path, natural marvels that abound all over this great, green peninsula.  You will never regret it.
