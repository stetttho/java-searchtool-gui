 Whitney Streiber, one of the chief instruments in dumbing down America, has outdone himself here.  Streiber has no knowledge of physics or other sciences, but cares not a whit.  In this extremely poorly written (lack of) effort, Streiber purports to describe a climatic calamity on the order of the recently lamented movie.  It is amateurishly written, marked by no real single plot, and absolutely worthless as either literature or science.  But people will probably buy it and buy into it, while books by real scientists, such as Richard B Alley, gather dust on bookstore shelves.  Barnum was right. I weep for the future.  I wouldn't even rate this book in terms of stars unless negative values could be used.   Don't bother.
