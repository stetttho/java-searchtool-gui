 I purchased this book at a close-out sale, and I guess it was worth a buck, but not more.   From the title and the blurbs, I expected to receive a rather strongly advocative report on global warming.  Instead, I got a poorly written, poorly organized ecological diatribe, marked by extensive use of the words "could", "possibly", and "might", among others.  The author wastes a good deal of time and energy, (the reader's), by wandering away from his appointed task to reminisce about his Greenpeace days, the relevance of which is marginal at best.  As to the author's apocalyptic forecasts, the proffered supporting "evidence" is largely in the nature of a self-drafted, unsubstantiated polemic on the evils of industrial civilization.  In short, the author fails to make his case.  Lest it be misunderstood, the evidence of global warming is all about us.  The material was avilable for a scholarly, even admirable text on the role people could play in ameliorating this condition.  Regrettably, as is the case with so many zealots, the author eschews this chance, and further degrades the already tainted reputation of persons legitimately concerned with this ecological menace.  As the credibility of such people wanes, so the power of ignorant anti-environmentalists like Bush and Cheney grows.   Why folks like Hunter can't see this is beyond me, but I wish they would stifle themselves and reflect carefully before they write.  I guess money talks for such writers the same as it does for others.  Not recommmended, even as a loaner.  Don't waste your time.
