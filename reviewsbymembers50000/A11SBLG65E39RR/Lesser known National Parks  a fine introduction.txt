 Biscayne, Katmai, North Cascades, Guadelupe Mountains, Voyageurs, Theodore Roosevelt, Channel Islands: Not seven of the best-known National Parks to be sure.  But each is eminently deserving of inclusion into the system of "Nation's Crown Jewels".  This book shows why. In a well-drafted, readable, interesting text, accompanied by excellent National Geographic photography, the ins and outs of each named park, including highlights, topography, natural features, climate, hazards, and accessibility are brought out in an imaginative, pleasant manner.  Each park is shown to be a microcosm of a facet of the American wilderness, and each chapter makes you want to visit that park.  I have been to Theodore Roosevelt and Biscayne.  both were fascinating, and this book helped whet my appetite.  I was never misled. This is a real keeper for any traveler's national park library. Five stars.
