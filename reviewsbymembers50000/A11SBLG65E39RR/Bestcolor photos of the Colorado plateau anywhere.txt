 Author Barnes and Utah Geographic are to be commended for this truly fine work.  The color photos, by many of the areas's best photographers, were obviously selected with utmost care.  The colors are so real as to brng back memories of being RIGHT THERE. You can almost feel the heat and smell the dust.  Barnes' text is equally outstanding.  It seamlessly addresses the main features you will see, the strata sequences, and, in a series of sidebars, the book addresses such things as slot canyons, fossilized sand dunes, arches, mesas, and other features that confront the visitor.  Seemingly, nothing is omitted in this extraordinarily well-composed review.   I bought this book several years ago at Arches national Park.  I used it all during that trip, and I continue to use it every time I go back to what I think is the greatest place on Earth.  It never has let me down.  'Nuff said. Very highly recommended
