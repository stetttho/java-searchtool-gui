 The only reason I do not give this book a five-star rating is that it is somewhat outdated.   This is understandable, since it was published when plate tectonics was still a doctrine in its infancy. Nonetheless, Dr. MacDonald's book contains much valuable information that is still relevant today.  Divided into chapters concerning the various kinds of volcanic ejecta and consequent landforms created by it, the book masterfully, yet easily, explains the different kinds of lava, tephra, bombs, domes, cones, cinder cones, shields, and plateaus created by the different kinds of eruptions.  The book also contains numerous black and white photos gathered from all over the world to illustrate what is being addressed by the text.  The photographs of Russian volcanoes and the different types of lava flows are particularly worthwhile.  The text is well-organized, readable, and may be understood by anyone with a high school or better education.  Even though it is outdated in spots, the book is a worthwhile read for anyone with an interest in geology and the way the Earth is made and rejuvenated.  I recommend it without hesitation.
