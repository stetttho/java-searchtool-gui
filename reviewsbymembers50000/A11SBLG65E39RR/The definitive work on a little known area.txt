 Labrador is the poor step-child of North America.  The word conjures up images of bleak expanses of bare rock and horrific swarms of insects.   There is much more, however, and this book shows the bad side as well as Labrador in all its grandeur.  Labrador's climate IS severe and cold, but the short summer occasions displays of wild flowers and animal life not seen elsewhere, all of which are covered by the text, and the magnificent photography, in this book.  You will be amazed at the deep canyons, magnificent waterfalls, abundant and beautiful seabirds, sharp mountains, and the many other wonders of this largely unknown region.  Other chapters point out the rigor of life in Labrador, and explain how the insects are the true apex of life.  A special chapter discusses the ill-fated Hubbard expedition, in which the leaders became lost, and died of starvation.  The goals of the expedition were eventually achieved by Hubbard's widow, and the story of this two-fold expedition is worth a book in itself. I learned a great deal about the friendly, tough people who inhabit the region, and about Labrador itself.  Labrador is becoming increasingly important, both as a huge source of iron and titanium ores, and as a waterpower giant.  A good part of what you see in this book is going, and you have a real chance to see the "bush" as it once was; one of the last magnificent wildernesses.  Very highly recommended
