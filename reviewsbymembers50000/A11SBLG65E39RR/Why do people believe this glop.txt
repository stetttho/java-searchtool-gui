 A friend of mine loaned me this book.  Thank God, (and, yes, there is one), I didn't expend money to buy it.     As noted, the author is an evangelist.  He has no familiarity with the principles of logic or physical science that I can discern.   OF COURSE, there are going to be more weather-related disasters in America than was so in times past, FOR THE SIMPLE REASON THAT THE COUNTRY IS BECOMING MORE CROWDED.  The tornado that chews up a subdivision today would have swirled the grass in an empty field just a few years ago, for example.  Does this mean God hates us?  Hardly, except to folks like McTiernan, perhaps.  This sort of writing dumbs down America in my opinion, and I certainly could not possibly recommend to any intelligent reader.
