 Author Linden's basic premise is that history fluctuates between periods of stability and instability.  The last half of the 20th century was stable.  The first half of the 21st promises to be anything but stable.  The book is tremendously well thought out, and persuasive. Linden visits nine areas, including climate change, increased population and larger cities, resource depletion, environmental degradation, religious fundamentalism/fanaticism, economic instability, etc.  These analyses are then followed by realistic, but speculative, scenarios describing life in the event of the anticipated change.  Author Linden does an excellent job in avoiding the Cassandra-style, apocalyptic language so common to writers in this area.  Surely, the facts alone are sufficient, and Linden is to be praised for discerning the difference.  All are well done, but I was particularly impressed by the chapter on religious fundmentalism.  As Linden so carefully describes matters, this fundamentalism, Christian or Muslim, is a response to the scientific and economic uncertainty of today's society.  The true believer yearns to return to a simpler, more certain, time, and is perfectly willing to throw out the baby with the bath water to get it, including equal rights, scientific advances, better living conditions, etc.  Anyone skeptical of this statement is invited to consider Iran, the Taliban, Creationism, and the like. I have not found Linden's peer in describing the origin and effects of religious fundamentalism on society as we know it.  The whole book is more than worth it for this one chapter alone.  Every thinking person should read it. In short, the book is an outstanding addition to anyone's library.  I recommend it very highly.
