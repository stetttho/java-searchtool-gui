 Chess being a mental game itself, it necessarily follows that its devotees enjoy mind games when facing opponents.  This is an excellent book for such folks.   I recommend it highly. The book covers one offense, the Dutch Stonewall Reversed, and two defenses, The Black Dragon variation of the Sicilian Defense (for playing against a King Pawn opening), and the Queen's Indian, for playing against a queen pawn opening.   It explores only these three openings, no more.  It is the author's theory, and my own, that it is better to be able to play a few variations very well than a great many variations badly.  Few people see the Dutch Stonewall Reversed.  It is a strong, fluid offense, and frequently takes even expert players by surprise.  Many times, the so-called superior player recovers too late.  AHA! The two defenses are somewhat more commonly seen, but each has the virtue of shifting momentum to Black in the event of the slightest error by White.  Again, that's what any player wants. The book is eminently readable and fun.  It iexplains the nuances of the three openings and shows you how to play them without drowing you in notation or sterile analysis.  This book has given me a lot of pleasure, and has allowed me to beat players who were easily superior to me under normal circumstances.   You will enjoy it a lot.  It's not for the real beginner, but you don't have to be Nimzovitch or Fischer, either.   Enjoy.
