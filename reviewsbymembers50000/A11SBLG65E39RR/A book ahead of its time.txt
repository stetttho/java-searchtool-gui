 The slang is dated, and today's technology isn't foreseen, but the human nature is exactly the same.  You can envision Jimmy Swaggert, James Bakker, Paula White or any of the other innumerable other TV evangelist charlatans in a hot second, when you read about Elmer's true nature as a womanizing, conniving, deceptive hypocrite.   Of course, Elmer would have been unfrocked a bit sooner by today's prying media, or would he?   Look at Swaggert, whose sins are like Elmer's, and whose "repentance" absolutely mirrors Elmer's at the end of the book.  He still fills up the churches like Elmer did. What "Elmer Gantry" really proves is that the American mind is still fertile ground for would-be messiahs, no matter how base and hypocritical they are in real life.   Indeed, the book makes you wonder if all religion hasn't always been thus.  Today's Catholic child abuse scandals, the Taliban destruction of art, and Pat Robertson's political ambitions surely argue that "Elmer Gantry" is not some simple, anti-religious tract. In that respect, the book is ultimately useful.  Indeed, this book may be one of the most valuable books of the 20th Century in that it helped thwart the American recurring tendency toward theocracy.  Where is the book's kind today?
