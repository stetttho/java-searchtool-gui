 Name the subject; lawyers, Boston, poetry, Joan Crawford, clothes, rhubarb, etc., it will be criticized in a quote by someone.  From "absolute" to "zoo", some wit's remark castigating it will be found in this book.  But the remarks aren't just a compendium of negativity.  Most are genuinely witty and comical.  Every page turned is an invitation to laughter.  No sacred cow is spared; none.  You will be amazed how many of these remarks enter your memory, to be used or parphrased by your own sharp pen or tongue.  This book is a true treasury of satire.   Very, very highly recommended, except for the stupid and humorless.
