 I was recommended to this book by a highly respected scientist friend who was, himself, recently "reborn" as they say.  I signed the book out of our local library and read it closely. I regret to say that, in my opinion, it proves little more than that dogma, once acquired, become the enemy of independent thought.  Professor Johnson's book is a very glib, well thought-out attempt to explain available evidence in a manner consistent with magical thinking rather than reasoned analysis, taking into account ALL of the facts.  As with other books by evangelicals on the subject, it glosses over demonstrated scientific principles in favor of mystical explanations.  Simply put, the essence of good science is to explain the natural world through observation and theories drawn after the observations and measurements have taken place.  Johnson and his cohorts, on the other hand, proceed from a preconceived position and attempt to bend observed facts into conformity with that position if possible, and ignore the remaining evidence.  This is no way for a lawyer to conduct a case, and no way for a law professor to present an argument, however sincerely conceived.  Indeed, I suspect Johnson would fail any student who presented a paper so constructed.  In short, you can't have it both ways.  It is regrettable that Johnson fails, in his new-found zeal, to realize this.  The book that could have been so valuable in discussing holes in the evolutionary theory, had it stopped there, becomes a welter of religion/science/personal but unsupported ad hominum declarations.  In the end analysis, it is but another religious tract, and not an exercise in disciplined thinking.  I cannot recommend this book to any serious student of the sciences or, indeed, to anyone else
