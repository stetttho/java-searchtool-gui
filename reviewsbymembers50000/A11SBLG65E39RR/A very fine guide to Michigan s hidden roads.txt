 This book is a wonderful addition to any Michigan traveler's atlas collection.  The book's large format leaves its maps of each county free to set out backroads down to the smallest trail, which is done in most cases without error.  A few typos and mislabelings of smaller features exist, but they are rare enough that the overall quality of the work is not diminished.  I particularly like the "hydrology" feature, listing all county lakes, and the fact that each county's map shows, AND labels, border roads as they go into an adjacent county.  The book is not for one seeking to explore cities, but is magnificent for anyone who wants to go leaf-peeping, hunting, or make other use of Michigan's wonderful, colorful, more remote areas.  It is a four-wheeler's delight.  If you fit any of these categories, you will love this book and use it frequently.  It is a real bargain.
