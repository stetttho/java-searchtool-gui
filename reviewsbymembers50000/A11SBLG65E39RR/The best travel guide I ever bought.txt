 I was fortunate enough to purchase this book on the first day of two-week vacation in the Sierra.  Since part of the vacation was a planned visit to Mono Lake, the title attracted me.  A brief perusal demonstrated the exquisite color photography throughout the book. After reading sections of the book, plans were changed to include much more time in the Owens Valley and kindred points.  We saw and experienced many things that I had never imagined, such as the Long Valley hot springs, the Owens River Canyon, rockhounding areas galore, Fossil Falls, the Coso Domes, Convict Lake, etc., etc. The book is well writtten, and very well organized, taking the reader from south(Mojave Desert) to North(Bridgeport area, about 100 miles south of Reno) in successive chapters.  Although written for any person with a high school background, the book is particularly well suited for students of earth processes, including physical geology, weather, and field biology.   Attractions such as the Ancient Bristlecone pine forest, home of the worlds oldest trees, and the Mono Lake volcanic domes, one of America's most recent sites of volcanic activity, are especiall.y well discussed.  One of the most impressive features of this work is the careful road directions included at the conclusion of each subsection discussing a particular attraction.  Without these guideline, finding some of the areas would have been much more difficult. Mixed in with the recitation of attractions, and things to see and do, is a history of the area, where you will find discussion of the various mining ventures in area mountains and dry lakebeds, as well as a narrative of the Owens Valley Earthquake of 1872.  America has not experienced a quake of this magnitude since that date. The book was a treat to possess, both during my vacation and now.  Its photography and text rekindle memories of this wonderful region of our country, and I recommend it as highly as possible.
