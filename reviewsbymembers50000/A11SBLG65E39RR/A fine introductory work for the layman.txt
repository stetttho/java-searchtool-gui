 This book is one of the acclaimed Time-Life ,"Planet Earth" , series, and excellently holds up its end of things.  The book addresses both alpine glaciers and ice sheets and does an excellent, brief history on the origination and refinement of Ice Age science.  The photography, both color and black-white, is exceptional and closely follows an easily read and understood text that is not elementary.  The sections on icebergs and on the Antarctic dry valleys are one of a kind.   I could have done without yet another review of Captain Robert Scott's folly in the Antarctic, and can't give the book five stars for that reason, but I suppose that any author of a work on glaciers feels somehow obliged to put in a section on early polar exploration, especially on the unduly stubborn Captain Scott. As noted, the rest of the volume is very well done, and I recommend it highly to anyone not familiar with the nuances of glaciology and Ice Ages.
