 There are at leat two definite impact structures on the Colorado Plateau:  The Meteor Crater (Barringer Crater) in Arizona, and Upheaval Dome in Utah's Canyonlands National Park.  I expected a somewhat detailed treatment of these features, and didn't get it.  I also expected some discusssion of impact features in arid areas in general.  I didn't get that, either. What I did get, and didn't want, was a thin, generalized history of  the Colorado Plateau in terms of stratigraphic horizons, something any general textbook on the region would have provided.   I feel the title of the work was highly deceptive, and I am sorry I bought what amounted to a duplicative text.  There are far better, more specific text on the Colorado plateau.  Buy one of those, and leave this one on the shelf, or in Amazon's stocks.   Not recommended.
