 This is one of the first superman novels, and still, by all that is holy, simply the best.  John Wainwright, born in England of mixed ancestry parentage has super abilities, a very slow maturation rate, extreme longevity, and amazing mental powers, among other things.  He is to Homo sapiens as Homo sapiens is to Australopithecus.  How does John cope in a world of what, to him, are hardly more than savage apes?    I can't tell of course; that would be unsporting.  Prepare to say that your sense of what is moral may receive a long-overdue examination upon completion of this absolutely fascinating book about how a superior being would cope with early 20th century mores, technology, politics, and social convention.  You will never forget the book, or John's answer to his plight.
