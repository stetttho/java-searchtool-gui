 Photojournalist Robert Wenkam is noted for his fine work on environmental and conservation problems facing the Hawaiian island chain.  This book is more broad, covering not only Hawaii but the West Coast of North America.  Included are reviews of the San Andreas Fault, the Cascade Range, Yellowstone, and Mexican and Alaskan volcanoes.  Although I admire Wenkam's enthusiasm, this text is not particularly well organized, leaping from topic to topic, and back again, particularly with respect to the San Andreas Fault.  Also, Wenkam offers his own theories as to particular phenomena, sometimes without scientific support.  An apt example includes his contention that the pre-Aztec civilization in the Valley of Mexico was destroyed by volcanic action.  Wenkam's photography, of course, is peerless, and the four-color reproduction is outstanding.  It is these numerous excellent photographs that caused me to give the book a four-star rating instead of a three.  I recommend this book to those who seek excellent pictures of tectonically active areas of the West.  The book is slightly less than coffee table sized
