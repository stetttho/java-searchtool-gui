 White Wolf did a beautiful job with the rules systems governing novas (mutants) in Aberrant, but unfortunately the story side is lax.  While they try to draw a picture of the world now that novas walk the streets, everything comes off as being ultra vague.  If I end up running it I expect to borrow from Marvel for details. The rules though, are beautiful.  It's the best system for running a "superhero" that i've seen yet.  I've never had so much fun building a character before...  the possiblities truely are endless. If you're looking for a RPG that will give you a definite powertrip and place you in a world gone mad, this is for you.  DM's beware though, Aberrant will require more thinking on your feet than most other RPG's because of the myriad possibilities with Quantum Powers.
