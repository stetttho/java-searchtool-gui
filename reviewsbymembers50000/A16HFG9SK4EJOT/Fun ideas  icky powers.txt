 I really like Aberrant.  Of the super-hero game systems I have seen and played this one pulls it off best.  The core book was pretty good, and the powers let you make any character imaginable straight out of comicdom. Like the rest of White Wolf's "Players Guides" this book takes that game system one step further...  perhaps further than it should have gone.  It talks briefly about the world the game is set in, but what you would probably end up buying it for is the skills.  Many new uses for powers and skills from the Aberrant core book are presented here, and past powers are extened up to rank 10.  Some new powers are introduced that require Quantum higher than 5 to use...  and some are just silly.  For instance, having a quantum of 10 and being able to create your own universe...  how is that going to be useful in an Aberrant campign?  It's not, ever. In short, it's a fun read.  It has a lot of good ideas.  However, if you're already brimming with ideas you might want to pass this one over.  Most of the new powers would never even be considered for a campaign.  Probably best to skip it unless you're really into Aberrant.
