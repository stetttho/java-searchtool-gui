 The Ender Quartet was great stuff.  Ender's Shadow was awesome.  But something happened between the last Shadow and this one...  whatever it was, Card failed to come through with his normal grandeur. The story itself is somewhat hard to buy, granted we suspend disbelief for fantastical works, but it was still a little much.  Kidnapping the kids to force them to command your armies?  Even a mediocre commander is going to give you better results than an enemy held at gunpoint.  I simply couldn't buy it. The endless amount of Bean being compared to a Christian ideal is exceptionally irritating.  Card can only bring it up so many times until you want to scream "Ok, I get the point, not get on with the story!" The whole thing left me with a feeling of dissatisfaction.  My advice to you is just to quit with Ender's Shadow and guess as to what else happens...  certainly much more fun than wading through this.
