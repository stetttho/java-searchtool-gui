 With the decline in quality we've seen from TSR's products since WotC acquired them it's refreshing to get an infusion of new ideas into the DnD medium.  Sword and Sorcery does an excellent job, giving us a good layout (ala the 2nd edition mons. manual) and a huge plethora of critters.  This is especially useful if you're putting AD@D veterans through the 3rd edition ropes and want to whip out monsters that they haven't faced in a myriad number of forms before.  Highly recommended, I look forward to see what else Sword and Sorcery releases.
