 Antony Flew does an excellent job writing these lectures in how he clearly explains the principles behind atheistic humanism.  A. Humanism is the belief that: There are no divine beings or entities (God), that man is the  measure of all things.  Instead of obeying the ethical and moral codes  presented in religions a. humanism suggests we should instead follow a  moral and ethical system based on human society and interaction.  A good  read if you appreciate philosophy or theology
