 Perhaps I should begin this review by saying i'm an Atheist, not a Christian.  With that out of the way, let me tell you a bit about LeVay's book. Here you have the primer for those interested in pursuing Religious Satanism.  Religious Satanism is not Gothic Satanism - that is to say it's not the pretend Satanism you hear the media talking about.  Nor is it Biblical Satanism...  LeVay named it Satanism because of the sharp contrasts between it and the teachings of Christianity.  LeVay feels that the only things that are really important are pursuing pleasure in the here and now.  He talks about how restrictive Christianity is, and spends some time speaking of pursuit of the "Seven Deadly Sins" with other consenting adults.  Not a bad idea. I loved it when I read it in highschool, but shortly after I was exposed to another author...  one who published a bit before LeVay.  Ayn Rand.  And after reading Ayn Rand's works I went back and reread some parts of LeVays works.  He speaks of his respect for Ayn Rand and her ideas within the Satanic Bible - and well he should, for many of "his" ideas are rewritten Objectivism (Ayn Rand's Philosophy). Those ideas, combined with some - unnecessary - Christian hate comprise about two thirds of the book.  The last portion is mostly "black magic".  I found this especially strange as most Satanists are atheists or agnostics themselves (worshiping Satan as a concept, not as an actual creature) and I would think this portion fo the book to be totally unnecessary.  Perhaps LeVay included it to make his book appealing to an even wider audience - I don't know.  It doesn't add anything to the philosophy and you can skip over it without missing a thing. In summation, the book isn't half bad.  There are a lot of good ideas presented within, and the "questing" the book has many people do is excellent.  However, the unnecessary elements and borrowed ideas force me to rate the book lower than it could have been.
