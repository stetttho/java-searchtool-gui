 I loved this adventure.  It's well written, original, and manages to capture that Star Wars feel we all know and love.  The side bars dealing with potential outcomes for the characters actions, and suggestions on how to motivate them during the game were extremely well done. While the NPC stats were created for the first d20 Star Wars product, I had no difficulty performing quick conversions.  It's still d20, and so most of the skills and abilities presented need no conversion at all.  Those that do can quickly be converted by a knowledgable GM.  If you're looking for an interesting published adventure to weave into your campaign, then this is definetly for you.
