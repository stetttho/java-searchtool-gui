 The civil war draws to a close and the battle continues between the Weaver and the Wyrm.  An ideal setting to play Werewolves...  all the fun of kicking the crap out of bad-guys while not having to worry about cities full of bystanders.  The West lends a more magical feel to the game than Apocalypse had.  The lawlessness of the land contributes to a more straightforward kick-in-the-door style, while the lack of real exploration allows for a feeling of "who knows what could be out there?"  One of White Wolf's best.
