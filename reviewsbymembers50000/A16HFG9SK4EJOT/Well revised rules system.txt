 Upon first hearing that WOTC was redoing the Psionics system for 3rd edition - before near anything else - I was extremely disappointed.  Many players fooled around with Psionics in 2nd edition and it was just a headache. Not this time.  The book is very straightforward and easy to read.  Psionic powers use "PSPs" - psionic points - to work and a character gets x many points per day.  Powers, of course, have a point cost and are organized by level (just like spells).  The addition of psionics is painless to any campaign, and doesn't cause a power shift as it oft did in 2nd. The books not too big, but all the information is useful.  It's not like "The Complete X Handbook" where a player only really cares about a quarter of the information.  Everything here is a useful addition.  It includes the psionics rules, prestiege classes, a magical item section, and a "monstrous manual" section as well.  A good purchase if you want to add yet another type of magic to your campaign.
