 I played beta, and it was buggy as betas are supposed to be.  Unfortunately, it was far more playable than this piece of crap that found it's way onto store shelves.  After one week of playing i've already canceled my subscription...  it's awful. The lag is terrible, but if it were just the lag I might be ok.  The bugs (and exploits) are far far too numerous to list, but let me give you an example.  Saturday night my character got stuck in some sort of server glitch that had me playing - online - but bugged so that I couldn't interact with people/see people/do missions/bank/zone.  The only solution to remedy this, as support has said, is to have your character committ suicide.  Any game where you have to, regularly, committ character suicide to escape bugs is most certainly not ready for release. FunCom claims the game is "110% done and in order".  I can only hope they fired the PR guy that made that claim.  Maybe, maybe in a few months it will be playable but it's not yet.  And by playable, I don't mean "the lag is rough and there's a few bugs" I mean "you cannot have fun playing this game". FunCom should have waited longer on this release.  I'm out [price] for a game that isn't even finished.
