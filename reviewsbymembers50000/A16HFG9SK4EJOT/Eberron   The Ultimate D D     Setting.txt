 The book is beautiful.  Its full color with lavish production quality.  The paper stock, art, full page art spreads, and maps make this a wonderful book.  Eberron is a fantasy campaign setting built specifically to house everything found in the Dungeons and Dragons game.  This sounds a little silly at first, but what is actually under the cover is an incredibly well detailed world full of adventure and story hooks.  It is difficult to turn the page without seeing a dozen ways to involve characters in the setting.  I could easily imagine roleplaying in the setting for a lifetime and still leaving content untouched.  What makes Eberron really great is that it embraces the idea that the player characters are the heros.  In addition it has a pulp/noir feel to it that encourages action and adventure.  From the steamy jungles of Xen'drix to the temperate Talenta plains where dinosaurs still roam, you'll find plenty of opportunities for pulp style roleplaying here.  The shadowy alleyways of Sharn, prviate detectives, and lonely investigators waiting in the rain at a train stop for their lovers provide the noir.  For the money the book can't be beat on production quality alone.  Combine that with a fantastically interesting setting written with the roleplayer in mind and you've got one high quality product.
