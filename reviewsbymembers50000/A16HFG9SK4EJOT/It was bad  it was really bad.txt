 I've been a long time fan of Dungeons and Dragons, i've got shelves of books and have played in a ridiculous number of campaigns.  I thought third edition was ok and have been picking up the new class books as they come out.  Sword and Fist was fairly good, lots of neat feats and prestige classes.  Defenders is bad.  It's really bad. The new feats are far from spectacular, there's only one or two that a player would ever consider using - regardless of character concept.  The specialty classes are unimaginative.  The new spheres are eh.  Most importantly of all, the ideas presented within are easily reached by anyone vaguely creative or who has any gaming experience. I strongly urge you to borrow a copy of the book before purchasing it.  WotC doesn't care about providing you with a quality product, they're merely skirting the edge of decency to get everyone to buy it.  It's not the good ole' days of TSR where they actually cared about putting out an interesting, usuable product.
