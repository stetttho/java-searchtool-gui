 If you're looking for a highly detailed city book for an Eberron campaign you can't go wrong here.  Sharn provides endless outlets for adventure, from thieves guilds to corrupt officials to exotic and interesting locales in the city itself.  This setting book is focused almost exclusively on the city of Sharn itself, with only a brief discussion of the rest of Eberron and how it relates to Sharn politically and economically.  Those who are looking for additional crunch - rules and Prestige Class - will be disappointed, though what is here is very well integrated with the city.  The bulk of the book breaks the city down into Districts and presents extensive information on these smaller sections of the city.  Prominent businesses, guilds, NPCs, and other such information is presented.  Politics, law and order, and life in Sharn each receive their own detailed chapter.  Eberron fans can't pass this one up.  While the information is only focused on the city of Sharn, the feel of the book is entirely Eberron.
