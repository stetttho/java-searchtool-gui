 EverQuest consists of wonderful graphics, an easy to use interface, and an addiction factor somewhat steeper than crack.  At first I had a wonderful time playing, but then after time the only true goal of the game seemed to  be to move your little "Experience Bar" up to get to the next  Level, then repeat.  It's major sufferings as a massively multiplayer  online game (no roleplaying to it) are in part how incredibly impersonal it  is compared to other online games, and the inability to adventure with  friends whom have somewhat more advanced characters.  There are just too  many other online games out there, similar but superior than EQ.  If you  pick it up, be sure to watch it...  games like these are VERY addictive.
