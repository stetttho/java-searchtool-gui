 Zelazny really outdid himself with this series.  Fast paced, exciting all the way through, it's a great read.  All worlds are but a shadow of Amber, where the Nine Princes strive through a mixture of politics, assasination,  and swordplay to determine just who shall rule.  Easily one of fantasy's  best!
