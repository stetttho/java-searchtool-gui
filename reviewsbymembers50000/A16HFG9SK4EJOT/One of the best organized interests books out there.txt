 from the back "the first title in the New Diretions in Political Behavior series, provides readers with a comprehensive understanding of interest group politics in the United States.  The book examines how organized interests are born, how they survive, how they operate, and how they influence public policy." As former student of the author, I can say that Dr. Nownes knows his stuff.  His classes were always fun, but I left knowing a lot more than I went in with.  His book, "Pressure and Power" is an excellent source for info on organized interests.  Nownes has written extensive amounts on this subject in the past, and continues to be an expert in the field.
