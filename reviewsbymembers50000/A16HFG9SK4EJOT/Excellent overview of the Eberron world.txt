 This book is divided into two chapters.  The first deals with character concepts appropriate to the Eberron setting.  These are fairly generic, but useful for players trying to come up with ideas.  The second chapter is where the book really shines.  PGTE lists a large variety of topics in an encyclopedia style format, making them easy to find.  Each topic is explored in moderate detail, and includes topic related game mechanics (on sidebars), suggestions on how to incorporate other Wizards of the Coast books (such as where other races live, where Warlocks get their power), and interesting tidbits such as what a DC 10 Knowledge (Nature) check tells you about the Gatekeepers.  All in all this is a fantastic book.  With full color art, a well done index, and good solid writing throughout you'll be hard pressed to find a better produced gaming book out there.  While the price may seem a little steep for the book's relatively small size, the text density and high quality writing more than make up for it.  Know that this is a setting-heavy book.  Those interested primarily in game mechanics will not find a lot here, though what is provided is interesting and strongly tied to the entry it is found in.
