 I've been an avid gamer/roleplayer for over five years, being especially familiar with White Wolf and TSR productions.  This is an excellent product for the WoD line, having more game balance than most the rest.  The  storyline's great, and the idea assortment for character's is strong.  All  in all a very well done WOD product. In Hunter: The Reckoning the player  takes on the role of an "imbued" human - one who can see the  creatures of the night who have been stalking and killing us for millenia.   "Inherit the Earth" is the popular theme of this Roleplaying  Game, where the characters will have to decide how exactly they will cope  with the sudden changes in their lives.
