 I must admit I was rather disappointed with the first 200 pages.  Lots of boring court details with Elayne, a brief part with Perrin, and a lack of "moving on with it" in general.  WoT has been a truely awesome series but i'm wishing  a conclusion would be nearer on the horizon. However, after the first 200 the book really picks up.  We finally find out what happened with Mat Cauthon and Rand participates in several GOOD combat scenes.  The finale here was arguably the best in the series, even topping the Horn of Valere ending the second book had. Winter's Heart has a rocky start but continues the series in Jordan's winning style.  Definetly worth reading, the last hundred pages or so will have you dancing with excitement (difficult while sitting).
