 This supplement for the Werewolf: The Forsaken game introduces additional information on Auspices, Tribal initiation rituals, Gifts, Spirits, Fetishes, and Rites.  It's a grab bag of goodies and most certainly has something for everyone.  The production values are high quality, and mirror those of the Werewolf: The Forsaken core book.  The very evocative art is excellent, and the paper stock is high quality.  The new abilities, largely Gifts, introduced in the book are very interesting and seem to be more generally useful than those presented in the core book.  The 50 Fetishes included in the book are very helpful, both because they provide a better idea of what a Fetish is supposed to look like mechanically but also because they're ready to go.  The best part of the book by far is its handling of Auspices and Tribal initiation.  Auspices discusses what it really means to be a given Auspice, provides some excellent Gifts that work to create some niche protection, and throws out a variety of interesting ideas for future stories.  The Tribal initiation sections are very well crafted.  Storytellers interested in beginning a Mortals or Ghost Wolf game and advancing it into a Forsaken game will find this section indespensible.  If you're looking for an excellent general expansion of the material found in the core book then this is the product for you.
