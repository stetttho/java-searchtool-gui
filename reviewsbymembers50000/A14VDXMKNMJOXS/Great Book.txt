 I wish I had this book when I was growing up, I would have been a much better swimer-faster and less stress on the hips and back muscles. This book has it all.The concepts are easy to understand and well written. for all fitness levels,improve yours and your kids swimming methods.Also recommend The Backsmart Fitness Plan By Dr. Adam Weiss, a great book that helped with strengthening and stretching the muscles I used in the pool.Seen great changes using these books.
