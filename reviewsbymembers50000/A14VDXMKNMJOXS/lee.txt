 I think when doctors tell me it's all in my mind suffering from chroinic back pain-I felt hopless then picking up this book made me think there was a connection to the mind and pain- I felt the author spent most of thier time trying to tell me it's all in my head and there was no phyical problems? My MRI showed otherwise!
