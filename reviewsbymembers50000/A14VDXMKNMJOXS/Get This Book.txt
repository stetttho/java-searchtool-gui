 All I can say is that this book changed my life. Dr. Weiss understands what it takes to get the job done.Realistic and very cool exercises, the wall execersies for stretching and using the Dumbells was great! i could feel  all my muscles working and no  strain to my back  the whole time I was doing them, a first for me usually I am sore for days after trying to workout but not with this program I felt great afterwards and I could move the next day a big plus to any one who  suffers from back pain knows. A very innovative approach to back pain and fitness this book takes you from the begining asking you how do you workout to the every day things you do that may cause your problems-  a very good eye opener for me. i found the doctor's own personal experience with back pain at an early age and how he over came his own pain-very moving to me and inspirational.There are many  detail photographs that show you how to do the execersies which I found very helpful. I am trying to lose weight now and following the weight lose program offered in the latter chapters, so far the advice the book gives on diet and exercise is the best I have read  in many years. A very strong recommendation to anyone suffering from back pain or anyone wanting to do new workouts!
