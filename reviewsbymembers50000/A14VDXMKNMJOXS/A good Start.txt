 I liked the Core Performance, it takes you to a different level of training when your workouts become stale.If you have been training for a while you will enjoy using some of the exercises in this book like the spider pushup or the bending over at the waist and holding your hands under your toes stretch.These exercises are a step up from other froms of body weight exercises. The other exercises in the book are basic and easy to follow. The author really focus on advance exercisers who have been training for a while.
