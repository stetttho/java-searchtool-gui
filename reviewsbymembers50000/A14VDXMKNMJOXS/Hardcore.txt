 This book is for the people who have been workingout for some time, like a few years and races under thier belts. The advice is layed out nicly with some interesting outlook on food intake and placement in the reader's workout routine. Chris doesn't hold back on his advice, but at times you wish there was more on the subject and left you hanging. Overall recommend this book to enhance your performance in long distance events and training.
