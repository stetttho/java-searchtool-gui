 New Health Solutions gives the reader lots of data and examples on how a family could afford health insurance. What the author left out was yeah all of us could get some type of health insurance plan with a very large deductibles, you might as well have no insurance because you will be paying out of pocket thousands of dollars before this affordable insurance plan kicks in! Now the author suggests you remove your spouse and childern off your plan at work and you will get a cheaper monthly price for doing so. All great if  your kids don't get sick or if they do not need school physcials every year and vaccitaions so they can go to school with the rest of the childern in middle income America. Last I checked most kids get sick and need the shots to go to school and some how you will save money by paying yourself? When was the last time you went to your childerns doctor's office and asked to pay less and please do not skip any steps you would normaly do  if you were charging full price. Come on, Health saving plans for the those who could afford them would have been a better title. If you have $5000 laying around to put into saving then you wouldn't need a lower insurance package to  begin with. We can not seperate ourselves from the risk pool as the author suggests so easly by leaving our company insurance plans. Why? because your age works against you! each year you add on your insurance goes up! It's that simple- as we age , we are more likly to become ill and cost  someone more money to take care of us, it's just the facts of life. If you are single you may be able to use some of the author's suggestions without too much self injury, but a family think again and talk it over with a number of agents. It is  like buying car insurance or house insurance you get what you pay for.
