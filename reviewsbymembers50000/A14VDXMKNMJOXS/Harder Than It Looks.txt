 If you were like me and bought this online based on the cover- you may have found the exercies pretty hard to do. I am in good shape but I found I couldn't do alot of the exercises without falling over- A good laugh at first but not fun when your back is sore.- Try only if you have been working out for a while and it will take time to get the hang of it.Own the book two months now and only doing some of the exercises.Hope this helps.
