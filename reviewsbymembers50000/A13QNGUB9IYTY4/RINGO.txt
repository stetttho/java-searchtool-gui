 By all accounts, Ringo is a really, really great guy, and, in this record, that shines through.  With some people it's the person, as well as what they do. Looks? He kind of looks like a twin brother to Barbara Streisand, if she had one. Drumming chops? He's a competent drummer, but there are many who are better. Singing? He can't sing. But I really like to hear him sing, and I enjoy his drumming style. And I think he's "cool." The musicianship on this collection is phenomenal. Only when you get a good, clear recording of this, do you hear the orchestrations in "Photograph" in all their resplendent glory. And, "It Don"t Come Easy." It's got that "something" that a lot of music lacks. The playfulness of "No No Song" and "You're Sixteen" come through with such clarity, you would have to have never heard any of this to fail to see just how GOOD it really is. By the way, did I mention that this is good?
