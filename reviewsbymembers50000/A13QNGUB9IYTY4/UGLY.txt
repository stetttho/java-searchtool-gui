 Yes, there are a lot of copycat elements in this film, a true original is rare. The most jarring sequence is in the beginning montage, those photographs of the product of second and third generation inbreeding, probably more. Although the characters are really actors, I heard somewhere that those photos were real; the close-ups of the faces, that is. The mountain men didn't have the comic relief of the Sawyer family from TCM, but that makes it all the more hard-hitting. These guys have no socialization, they are feral, ugly, and imposing. The victims are just regular people, with regular lives, and as with any movie of this type, it's hard to watch them meet such a grisly end. And it's all for the survival of these mountain men. Such people probably are out there, somewhere.
