 It's an embarassment to read a review when someone who can't spell to save their life, tries to write a review, especially when such a first - rate piece of music such as this is the topic. I had to get that off my chest.  It's called "pretentious" , "nothing but filler," and "not true rock," in comparison with later bands. Those bands wouldn't be here without Zeppelin, Sabbath, and the like. Here is a band that achieved PHENOMENAL success in the 1970's, and this is their chance to breathe, to experiment. A monotonous rhythm, like the one in "Kashmir" is the groundwork for incredibly beautiful string arrangements, via the mellotron. Nobody uses the mellotron anymore, too bad, but keyboard players say it's not a reliable instrument.  For some reason, "Down By The Seaside" has lived inside my head from the first time I heard it, all those years ago. Just take each selection for what it is, don't make any unreasonable demands,let the boys in the band show you what they're made of. I gave this a 4 out of 5, because there are no half-stars, and I don't care much for "Black Country Woman." Enjoy.
