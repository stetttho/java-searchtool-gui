 I've read some less-than-favorable reviews about this Magnum Opus, and I wonder what planet they're from. Of course, I have the the three-disc vinyl LP. It came in a big box, lyric sheet, poster, all the perks most CD's don't have. I can't say this about "All Things..." as a CD, I don't have it, so I don't know. I'll just tell you about the music, instead.  The first thing that jumps out at you upon hearing this, is that SOUND. I use capitals here, because the sound is HUGE. It completely envelopes you. Although different players are on different selections, it has a unified sound, from what were the most in-demand players of the day. And it sounds SO SOLID.   Harrison's songs about spirituality are done with such conviction, that if TV evangelists had that same mixture of granduer and humility, the scandals probably would have never happened. On these, he really is singing to God, i.e. "Hear Me Lord."  The other songs are a good showcase of how eclectic his tastes and influences were. He hadn't divorced himself completely from The Beatles yet, listen to the lyrics to "Wah-Wah." And the words to "Apple Scruffs" are about the girls who used to camp outside the studio when they were recording. Things like this.  Sure, he didn't write Pop Ditties like Paul McCartney, and he didn't purge his demons in the extreme fashion that John Lennon did, you can see he was closest to Ringo Starr, professionally, and Ringo's early work has Harrison all over it.  The "Jam Session" selections were just that, all the same key, and two of them sound suspiciously like each other, but they show great musicianship, by some guys who were having a great time in the studio, and I'm glad he included them.  This is vintage contemporary music, and I hope the Compact Disc version holds up the way the vinyl LP set did.
