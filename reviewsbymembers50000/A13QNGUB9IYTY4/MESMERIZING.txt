 This is the perfect soundtrack to the events of the Apocalypse. If you have an ounce of imagination lurking around in your head, this will trigger it. I will buy the CD one day, have the vinyl LP, and every note, word, and sound, is committed to memory. The recital on "Agaen Sea," with that ominous voice, I can't think of a better vehicle for that passage. You can almost see a blood-red full moon, and falling stars while listening to this piece. The imagery of Revelation, so colorful, so frightening, is delivered to the listener in a way, someone not familiar with scripture is given a taste of the most widely interpreted, and debated book of the New Testament. The controversy over the title, comes from people reading and seeing only what they want to see. What they have to keep in mind,  the inscription on the front cover, is taken verbatum from Revelation. The huge number 666, in white letters, against a black background, over a red cover, seems to inspire fear of "Devil Music;" gimme a break, remember the PMRC Senate hearings in the '80's? This is a very artistic interpretation of ancient text, told through the medium of Avant-Garde music, circa 1970. And like the text that inspired it, it's timeless. Go ahead, treat yourself. you'll be glad you did.
