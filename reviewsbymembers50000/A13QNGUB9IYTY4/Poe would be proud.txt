 I have the original release, and love it. I bought it on cassette, and loved it. I bought the CD and loved it. This is one of my all-time favorites, not one weak spot; I've read where people have said they didn't like the "aimless, rambling" parts of it , particularly "The Fall Of The House Of Usher." But remember, it is part one of a story, and it is appropriate for that part. When you get to the "Arrival," it picks up considerably, and this is as heavy as anything I've ever heard. Adding narrations by Orson Welles puts this masterpiece through the top, and the addition of some keyboard arrangements, a couple guitar solos,  remixing the sound, and reverbing the drums, are like a football player dancing in the end-zone; it's not necessary, but it doesn't hurt, either. The whole atmosphere of this work reflects the macabre mood of Edgar Allen Poe's stories, but the sound itself is so beautiful,it's something to speak of, being that the stories are , well, gruesome. I have read that Arthur Brown had no business singing on this record, but that's wrong; at least I think. "The Tell-Tale Heart" is a story of someone's guilt over doing something terrible to someone else, and being driven insane over it. Why not Arthur Brown? That voice is as wild as any I've ever heard(The Crazy World Of Arthur Brown). Choirs, orchestras, sound effects, it's got it all. And it will familiarize you with Poe's work, if you're not already.
