 Simply put, the scariest movie ever filmed. People talk about the "dated" effects, and the "impossible" story, but it's the unexplained that really can grab you. Personally, I prefer the "on location" effects, live in front of the camera. Digital effects can be nice, but they are missing something. Those effects happened in front of the camera as you see them. (spoiler) Probably the most frightening scene in the whole movie, involved very little in the way of special effects; I'm talking about the scene where the two doctors came to the house, and the girl is having a seizure in her bedroom. That just freaks me out, it's the most horrifying thing to see - someone with no control of their body, the thrashing and flailing, and the screams for help. That is 100% believable; someone in my family went into diabetic shock in front of me once, and it scared me to death. The similarities were uncanny. This film blends the credible with the incredible, and , this many years later, it is STILL the most terrifying film ever made, along with the original "Texas Chainsaw Massacre."  Watch it. Experience it.
