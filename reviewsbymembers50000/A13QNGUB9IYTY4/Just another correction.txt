 Zappa was pushed off the stage at the Rainbow Theater, London, in 1971, not 1972.  This performance shines. The muddy sound is moot, because the band plays like few others can. I'll step out of character, and make this a very short review.   If you can listen to a recording that sounds like it was made on a portable tape recorder, and you like the jazz line-ups in Zappa's  career, you simply have to hear this. Highly recommended.
