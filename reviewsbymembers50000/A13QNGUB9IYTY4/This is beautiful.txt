  I used to have this little gem on 8track, and haven't heard it in quite some time. I played the samples on this site, and it all came back to me. Although, I do own Archive,vol.I, which includes "Stagnation," and "Dusk"(my personal "Trespass" favorite), the whole thing in context is a very under-rated piece of work. To me, it has sentimental value, and I would recommend this  to any serious person who isn't sure whether or not to acquire it.
