 The Mothers,and the original band in particular, seemed to have a character that the later bands seemed to lack. All his ensembles were phenomenal, but when an audience went to see The Mothers, they went to see The Mothers, the band that FZ was a part of. This included Roy Estrada's weird, high wailing, Jim Black's vulgarity,Ian Underwood's classical training, basically the whole band's legendary raspberry at all the conventions that are imposed on all up-and-coming talent.  This is a top-notch band, with impressive material, and even though Zappa has later said that it was lack of ability, among other things that broke this group up, the talent is on par with anyone out there. Don't let the less-than-ideal sound quality put you off, this is par excellence.
