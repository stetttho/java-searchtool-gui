 I bought this back in the 1970's when I stood alone as the only person I knew who understood what the forerunners of punk were about. The Ramones and the Pistols were it, that's the whole package, two sides of one nasty, yet, great idea. Don't try to compare this to anyone,you just can't. The Ramones played by their own rules, but no-one elses rules applied here. They'll be missed.
