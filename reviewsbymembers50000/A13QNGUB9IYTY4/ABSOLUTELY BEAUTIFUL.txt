 Ten good selections by one of my all-time favorite bands.  I don't know why, but for some reason, I think of Summer when I hear this; bright sunny days, warm nights, all the good things.The opener, the title track, has a sound that seems to fly through the stratosphere, parting the clouds. You almost feel airborne while listening. And it keeps up the high quality throughout, with melodic ballads  ("Burning Bridges", "Wot's The Deal," "Stay"), harder edged rock (The Gold, is in the...", "Childhood's End"), the emotional instrumental "Mudmen," and a lot of folks don't agree, but "Absolutely Curtains" is absolutely beautiful. The second half is a little strange, the tribal voices just go on, but diametrically opposed parts make interesting listening. Two examples of this working elsewhere, would be Fleetwood Mac's "Oh, Well," and "Mother People," by The Mothers Of Invention. Parts that don't seem to belong together, sometimes do work well together, as is the case here. You hear droning keyboard chords, somber melodies, cymbal rolls, light guitar notes, the sudden release of melodic tension, and a seemingly eternal fade-out, and then these hideous voices start to sing this apparent gibberish, a little unsettling, but somehow complimentary.  And I really do like it.
