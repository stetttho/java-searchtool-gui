 Just listen to it, it's "mood music". It ebbs, flows, occaisionally bends your ear, comes to you from another place. It has that reverb-drenched sound on a lot of it, beautiful arrangements.    It may have been recorded in a haze of pot smoke, I don't know, but that ethereal sound puts the listener into that frame of mind, and you can just drift away with it...  As long as you keep in mind that it's a movie soundtrack, and not necessarily meant to be a mainstream recording, it becomes easier to appreciate this. Further, remember that it's  an obscure film, and this material becomes even easier to appreciate. Ignore any "kid's reviews" about this.  OK, it's not "The Dark Side Of The Moon." It's still pretty good, though.
