 It's comedy,albeit very dark comedy.some slapstick,but what makes it what it is, is with every scene, the viewer thinks, "this can't possibly get any nastier"," and then, it does. It's just unbelievably gross,from the beginning, which features a complete dismemberment(which is ALWAYS DISTURBING), and just goes further and further. It's so over the top,that it just goes well into surrealism, and I don't think anything will EVER out-do it.
