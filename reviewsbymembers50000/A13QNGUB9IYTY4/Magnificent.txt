 I tend to only write reviews of things that I really like, and this is no exception. "The Grand Illusion" came out when I was 15 or 16 years old, when I had a whole life of possibilities in front of me. I never thought I'd be sitting here, almost thirty years later, writing a review about it. What can I say that hasn't been said already? The production is good, the band is tight, the material is strong. I first heard this at a friend's house, in the Summer of '77 or '78, not sure, side 2 was playing, "Miss America," was the first track I heard, and I liked it. Then, "Man In The Wilderness" came on, and I was floored. How can you follow that? And then, "Castle Walls" came on, well, that's how you follow it.  As a kid with no money, I taped it, and didn't get the record 'till years later,and only regretted not getting it sooner. There's not one "clunker" in this whole set, from the opening track to the closing number. God, I miss bands sounding like this!
