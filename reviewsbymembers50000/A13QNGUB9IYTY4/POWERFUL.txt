 I'll keep this short and sweet. Although the era of Genesis fronted by Phil Collins is good, you can tell that Genesis needed Peter Gabriel , and Gabriel needed Genesis. This is a document of the first eight years of a really great band, a lot of live material, and some rare studio work.  Just put this on your CD player, and treat yourself to some of the best stuff you'll hear all year.   The first two discs convey the live performance of "The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway," with a little repair work, the costumes and props used by Peter Gabriel affected the quality of the vocals, so some reworking was necessary.  The third disc is mostly from their performance in 1973 at London's Rainbow Theater, and some rarities that you're not likely to find anywhere else, and the fourth is just rare, unreleased tapes of the original band.  The sound is quality is debatable in spots, and the material is a lot simpler sounding than later work, but it is worth listening to.  On the whole, it is money well-spent.
