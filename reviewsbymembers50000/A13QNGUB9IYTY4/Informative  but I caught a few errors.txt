 Overall, this is a good book. It tells a lot about the man and his music, his views, and how others in his circle viewed him.  But, there are some glaring boo-boos in this book.  Trivial, maybe, but a little irritating. Any fan of The Mothers Of Invention knows the original singer's name is Ray Collins, and the original bass player's name is Roy Estrada, but Miles has this tendency to call the bassist Ray Estrada. Denny Walley (slide guitarist with the 70's line-ups) is called Danny a few times, and even though Keith Moon has a part in Frank Zappa's life, there is a segment about FZ's family, and at first I didn't know what Keith Moon had to do with babysitting Frank and Gail's kids. I had to re-read it until I realized the passage was about Zappa's daughter, Moon Unit. Miles calls her "Keith Moon" here; it's the part about dancing in the kitchen. In 1970, two members of The Turtles, known to audiences as "Flo and Eddie," joined the regrouped Mothers, and Mark Volman's stage name was "Flo." Howard Kaylan's stage name was "Eddie," but the book has their names reversed. The notes on the rear cover tell of Frank's  marriage to Gail Sloatman  lasting over thirty years, but they were married in 1967. He died in 1993, twenty-six years after the wedding, so here you have yet another goof. These things abound, but it is still a fairly good book, because I learned a few things reading it that I didn't already known, such as how percussionist Ruth Komanoff (later Ruth Underwood, after her marriage to Ian Underwood) was referred to Zappa outside the Garrick Theater in New York by her brother, to her acute embarrassment. He (Ruth's brother) just accosted Zappa on the sidewalk, and told him how talented she is. He said to come backstage and audition, and she then found herself in the band. These things.  But, as long as you read this book with a grain of salt, knowing that it isn't 100% factually accurate, it is still pretty good reading.  I read it in two evenings.
