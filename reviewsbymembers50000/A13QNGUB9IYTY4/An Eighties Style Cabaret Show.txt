 This release came out in 1984, when not many people were putting out really good material. Here, you have FZ with a full compliment of talent, covering the whole spectrum of what he was doing at the time. A nice touch is the variety of voices used for lead vocals, and they all get showcased in ways that show off their individual styles.  Contrary to what others have said, I think the "weak point" is "Sharleena," listen to the "Lost Episodes" version to see what I mean. In all it's a tight, powerful treat for any Zappa fan, casual or rabid.
