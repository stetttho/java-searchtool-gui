 I can not emphasize enough, my appreciation for this man's, and this group's work. Frank Zappa has said that the original band was good, but lacked the ability to perform his more difficult material. Combine this with the cost of touring this band, and it just did a nose-dive into the ground. It's kind of difficult to figure what the whole story was, because Don Preston has said that Zappa complained about the the band being too big and expensive to tour, but kept adding personnel nonetheless. ( [...] ) "Freak Out" was recorded when The Mothers existed as a five-piece, and there are at least ten musicians on this, but the end result doesn't suffer; even though it's left-over material, it's top-notch left-over material. I just don't think any of it fit into any existing format of the band's work up to that point. The same with "Weasels Ripped My Flesh."  There's no way to classify this set; it's too variegated, but somehow, it all sounds like one unified piece of work. The calibre of musicianship here is, phenomenal; such a tight-sounding outfit, this material is delivered with an almost military discipline. As another reviewer said, it is "sandwiched" with two doo-wop songs, the title probably derives from that.  So once you are introduced to this piece of musical theater, and the opening fanfare is out of the way, you are taken on a musical journey that spans so many styles and textures, it almost boggles the mind, and by the time you hear the applause at the end of "Little House I Used To Live In," and Frank's "Thank you, goodnight," it's almost like you have just attended a rare, unbelievable live show. Even though it's not all recorded live. The runoff track, "Valarie," is sort of an epilogue, the music you exit this imaginary theater to, and your ear for music will have benefitted from it.
