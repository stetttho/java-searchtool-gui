 This  isn't the line-up that the band made it with the first time, but that's OK. I can't get over certain reviewers pinning their distaste with this line-up on Buckingham and Nicks. Didn't Mr. and Mrs. McVie and Mick Fleetwood hire them? This band, no matter who is in it's ranks, has a certain image that's unique to THEM. A bizarre fact, Dave Walker, who was Mac's vocalist for a short time, also had a brief stint with Black Sabbath. Odd, huh? Back to "Rumours." I don't know how a bunch of people, who at the time, couldn't stand the sight of each other, could make such a fine piece of music as this. Another reviewer, one I've personally taken pot-shots at in the past, gave this a five-star review, and I had to try to figure where I was mistaken. But no, It's that good. The tight vocal harmonies, the solid rhythm section, the layered keyboard and guitar parts, all blend into a "pop" record that just about everybody liked, bad reviews notwithstanding. Listen to the lyrics, and you can hear the pain in these people's lives, but it's a good listen, anyway. And, as an addendum, I simply adore Christine McVie. Such a great songwriter; imagine a Fleetwood Mac with her AND Peter Green, at the same time? So different, but so good; that would've been something.
