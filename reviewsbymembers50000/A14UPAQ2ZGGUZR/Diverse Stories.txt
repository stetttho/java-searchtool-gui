 This is another illuminating book on the topic of voluntary child"less"ness.  It was interesting to read the thoughts, life stories, and poetry of the women profiled in this book.  Every childfree woman should read this book - because it reveals that many childfree women  - regardless of background or lifestyle - have similar motivations - and  sometimes completely different ones....but we all have in common the  stereotypes and judgements that others try to assign to us.  I know  what I  believe in  - but it gave me personally more insight into my  contemporaries.  Sometimes it's challenging to find other childfree women  in your area to discuss these issues with - so this book was a nice  "virtual" visit with many of them.  This book can be read in just  a few hours - but the impact will last forever. Thank You.
