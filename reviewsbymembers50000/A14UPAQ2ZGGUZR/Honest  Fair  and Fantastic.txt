 This book takes the reader up for a bird's eye view of the big picture in America -something that can be easily missed in daily life.  The very articulate author exposes how not only people without children, but the  poor, and other minorities suffer as a result of middle class parental  entitlements.  A must-read for people without kids and political science  majors! Consistent exposure, like this book provides, will help (hopefully)  lessen the daily prejudices that childfree people have to encounter.  The  author also reminds us that tomorrow's childless and childfree people are  someone's children right now...  Thank You.
