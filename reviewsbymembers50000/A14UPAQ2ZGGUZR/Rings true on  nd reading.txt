 After reading this book for a second time - it was interesting to compare the similar problems created by certain entitlements (for people with absolutely no money worries!) in the UK.  Other UK reviewers may want to  look home before being so harsh on a country that they may have never lived  in!  Great book - I do recommend it to readers in other countries!
