 This is another great book that supports women who choose to not have children.  The author theorizes that women can fall into one of three catagories (or a combination thereof): Traditional, Transitional, and Transformative.   Pyschological theories abound and there are personal  stories about real women.  There's a little too much Freud for my taste -  but it does help the reader get the full picture not only from the author's  view, but from ordinary women and the world of psychology as well.   This  book is a little more in-depth than some other books on the subject -it's  not a quick read- but is well worth the time invested.  I think psychology  and women's studies students - even if they don't agree witht the content -  should read this book. I really hope the author is right when she talks  about a future day when people will shudder in disbelief at the cruel  stereotypes that were directed at childfree women   - just as we do now at  past thinking that a woman not married by the age of 25 was an old  spinster!
