 I appreciate that the author is proud of her book and her story.  However, I do feel that this book is geared solely to people that had to settle for their second choice in life - rather than people who chose (and achieved)  their pathways, without regret, from the start.  People that are struggling  with the loss of their "chosen" life - marriage and/or children -  for whatever reason - should read this book.  Even then - those people  should use this book as a starting point - but then move on to more  affirming books.  I would suspect that if someone was really hurting from a  loss of their desired lifestyle - that this book might teach the person to  keep tending their "wounds" instead of healing them. The  misleading title of this book, in my opinion, attracted many childfree  women to buy it.  If you are CF by choice  - it's best you don't purchase  this book - we should not consider ourselves the intended audience -  despite the title and no matter how many children the book is dedicated to!   Laurie Lisle, Mardy Ireland, and Elinor Burkett are more appropriate  authors for CF people to read!
