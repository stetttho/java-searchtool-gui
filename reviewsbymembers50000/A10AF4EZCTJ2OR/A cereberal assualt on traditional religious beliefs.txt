 This particular book is very well written and easily read.  This is a powerful book.  I read it in three hours. I simply couldnt put it down (not even to use the bathroom).  If you read this book then you are going to need a highlighter so you can mark certain spots and research this info for yourself.  While I do not doubt that this author is correct in his writings, I will study it for myself.  I urge that every reader  do the same. Especially before you write a review.    If you are a Christian (especially a catholic) this book will shock you.   I highly recommend this book to anyone who would like to expand their understanding of the book of Revelations.     BUY THIS BOOK, READ IT, GIVE IT TO YOUR PASTOR TO READ, AND BUY COPIES FOR YOUR FAMILY. BUT MOST OF ALL, DO THE RESEARCH FOR YOURSELF.
