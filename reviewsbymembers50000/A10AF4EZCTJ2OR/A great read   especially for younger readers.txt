 I will forever remember fondly Jack London's "White Fank" as being the first work of fiction that I had the privelage of reading as a young child.   This is a great book to purchase for any young person just begining to read.       Jack London's use of imagery tells a tale of the early 1900's gold rush territory, that no history book could explain. This book is an excellent example of the human struggle told from the point of view of a dog. All in all it is a great book for the whole family.
