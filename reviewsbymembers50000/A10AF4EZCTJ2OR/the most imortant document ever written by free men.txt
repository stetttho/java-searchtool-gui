 This is the most important work ever devised by free men. NUFF SAID.   I have several copies of the the constitution both in book form and on the internet. The best part about this copy is that its cheap and it can fit in your pocket.   I carry this particular copy in my truck to show police officers when they forget that they took an oath to uphold it. You should see  there befuddled faces when I ask them to recite the first, second, and fourth amendments. Its truly pathetic.  Any body who takes an oath to uphold the constitution should be required to commit it to memory
