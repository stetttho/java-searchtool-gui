 I have to admit that this Is not the easiest book to read. This is due to two reasons.  One or two of the chapters (in my opinion) was hard to read through. If I had written the chapters I would have done them differently. However this is only a minor flaw in the book.    The other problem I had was that every time I turned a page I Got madder and madder and madder at what I was learning.  It took me forever to read because I would have to put the book down after every chapter.  I was simply amazed at what I was reading.  Its shocking that this book didnt start a revolution    I recomend this book to everybody.  For gods sake buy it, read it, and then give it to somebody else to read.
