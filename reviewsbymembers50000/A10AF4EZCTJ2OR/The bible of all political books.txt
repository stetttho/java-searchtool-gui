 This is one of those books that when youre done reading you think "I wish I was smart enough to write a masterpiece like that".  THE LAW is the most well thought out piece on the rights of man and the place of government.  I personally credit this book with turning me from the Republican party to the Libertarian party.    I promise if you read this book you will never look at your elected representative the same way again.  It is a short , very reader friendly book.  Why it is not presented to every kid in every economics, legal, and political systems class along with a copy of the constitution I dont know. BUY THIS BOOK READ IT AND PASS IT ON TO SOMEONE ELSE TO READ.
