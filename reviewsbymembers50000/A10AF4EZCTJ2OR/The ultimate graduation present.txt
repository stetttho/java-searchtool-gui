 Without a doubt this is the best consumer information book on the bookshelf today.   Clark Howard presents a no nonsense, straight to the point look at what everybody should already know before you go out into the marketplace.  I sincerely wish that I had this book before I left my parents house to start out on my own.   If universities were really interested in informing the average student, this book would be a required class at schools across America.  PLEASE GIVE THIS BOOK TO ANY RELATIVE WHO IS GRADUATING HIGH SCHOOL.   IT WOULD BE THE BEST PRESENT THEY COULD GET
