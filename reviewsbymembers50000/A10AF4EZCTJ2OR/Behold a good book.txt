 If I were to compose a list of the top 100 books that affected me the most, this book would be in the top three (behind the bible of course). The information in this book is absolutely astounding. This book just makes too much sense not to be true.   I will say rather bluntly that this book is not a paragon of english literature. The reader will have to overlook the fact that the entire book was just put together in a sort of jumbled fashion. A professional author could have wrote it to be more reader friendly, but it doesnt change the fact that it is an invaluable source of information.  I have read many conspiracy books. This book seems to piece together parts of the conspiracy puzzle that other books of similar kind fail to connect. The great part about this book is that he lists a number of easily oftainable sources with which the reader can explore. Mr Cooper even urges the reader to check his sources out and to not believe a word of his book until they do.  Behold a Pale Horse changed the way I view politics and world affairs. Simply put, this book will draw a polarizing reaction from whoever reads it. I truely wish William Cooper would write a follow up book. BUY THIS BOOK, READ IT THOROUGHLY, AND GIVE IT TO ALL YOUR RELATIVES AND FRIENDS
