 This is one of the single greatest books that I have ever had the privelage of reading.  The writer describes in clear and concise terms the price of liberty, how we won it, and how we are losing it.  You wont find this information in any government school or college.     Delightfully this book is an easy read. The author wrote this book with the common man in mind. Splendidly I tore through this book in no time at all without having to read a single sentence twice.    Patriots, students, and anybody dedicated to preseving liberty and economic freedom should definately read this masterpiece.  Its amazing that the information in this book is surpressed from our schools.  Everybody should read this book twice and buy copies for all your family and friends.
