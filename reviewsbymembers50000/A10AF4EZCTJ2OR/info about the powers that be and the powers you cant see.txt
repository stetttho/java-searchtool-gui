 This book is an essential piece of any conspiracy theorist's library.  It is packed with tons of important information. The sources and references he lists are easily researchable. He even has the gall to put a list of people in the back of the book who are part of the conspiracy.      The preponderance of evidence that the author presents proves that conspiracies in this modern age are not theories, but are indeed facts. As a reader you can only conclude this opinion if you actually do your homework and research his sources.     A.H. Krieg states that there are controlling powers in the world ,(the mandarins), who are actually being controlled by a higher, super secretive  body of powerfull individuals ,(the satori), bent on controlling the world .  In effect it is a conspiracy within a conspiracy.      I give this book the highest recommnendation posible.  If this book were given to everybody in the USA, there would be an epic and bloody civil war of which this country has never seen or ever imagined.    I cannot express enough my admiration for this presentation.  A.H. Krieg had a lot of guts to write and print this book.  As far as I am concerned he is dead on.       PLEASE BUY THIS BOOK AND PASS ITS INFORMATION ON TO EVERYBODY YOU KNOW, FOR THE SAKE OF OUR COUNTRY AND ITS SOVEREIGNTY
