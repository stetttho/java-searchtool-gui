 I've been listening to this album over and over again and I can't help but love it. Maria Mena has created something truly great here, and anyone who enjoys music should give this a chance. I found her first single "You're The Only One" rather odd like many people did, but it has grown on me. I now realize that Maria's gift for music is something which one can only fully appreciate after really listening to the songs and absorbing them. I find her style unique but in a good way. Her somewhat raspy, smooth voice adds a nice touch to the songs. I agree with the reviewer who compares her voice to Alanis Morissette, although Maria has a lot more restraint and never yells. Some might call Maria's voice an acquired taste, and perhaps it is, but I find it soothing. She doesn't have a large range but then again good music doesn't have to involve high notes.    I would say that every song on White Turns Blue is great, from the catchy "Just A Little Bit" to the heartbreaking ballad "My Lullaby." Maria knows how to convey some great emotion through these songs. Her overall style could be described as a mixture of folk, pop and rock, although she has a style all her own.    One thing worth noting about White Turns Blue is that Maria sings "regularly" on the other songs, and she only speaks the lyrics on "You're The Only One." So for those of you who have only heard that song (and don't like it because she speaks), know that it doesn't represent the vocal style of the entire album.    And finally, I would urge anyone who likes this album to buy the single of "You're The Only One" for the non-album track "Patience." It's a song that will melt in your ears. Absolutely beautiful.
