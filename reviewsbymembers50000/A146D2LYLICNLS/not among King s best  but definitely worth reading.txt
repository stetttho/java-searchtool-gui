 I'll admit that "The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon" isn't as gripping as Stephen King's other novels, but I found it to be an enjoyable, quick read. Enough has already been said about the plot, so I won't rehash it. Instead I'll comment on why I found this novel to be worthwhile. For one, King does a commendable job with making the story flow, considering the fact that the vast majority of the novel has no dialogue and centers around Trisha's character, alone by herself in the woods. Instead of the typical dialogue, King must rely on imagery and narrative alone to carry the story. Accomplishing this isn't an easy task.  Anyone who sees this novel as simply "a girl lost in the woods" isn't looking deep enough. This novel has many themes including the feeling of isolation, survival, facing our most primitive fears, and in my view, coming-of-age to a certain point. And maybe the scariest thing about it is that any one of us could be faced with a similar situation. I give this novel a strong recommendation even if it may not be as "loaded" as King's other novels. Here he strips down the story to the most basic form and the result is one that works. And to other fans of this novel: there's supposedly a movie adaptation in the works that will star the real-life Tom Gordon.
