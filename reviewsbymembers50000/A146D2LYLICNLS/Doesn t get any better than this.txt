 I'll make this short & sweet: this single is a MUST-HAVE for any fan of Melissa Auf Der Maur. IMO it's even better than the single of "Followed The Waves."  There are several gems here...you get the b-side "Afraid" (a great song), an acoustic version of "Taste You" (my personal favorite) and of course the video of "Real A Lie." This single is loaded with goodies. Don't think twice about buying it. Just get it! It's a limited edition, so chances are it won't be around for much longer. I had the great pleasure of meeting Melissa this past weekend when she did an acoustic set and autograph signing. What a nice person she is. A true genuine talent and a great human being. Keep up the good work Melissa!
