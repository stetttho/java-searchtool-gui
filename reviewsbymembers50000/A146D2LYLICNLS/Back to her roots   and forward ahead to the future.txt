 It never ceases to amaze me how Madonna can literally reinvent herself from album to album. I just got Confessions on a Dance Floor today, have listened to it a few times, and this CD is going to stay in my changer for a VERY long time. While some tracks are slightly better than others, all of them offer something unique to the listener. And more importantly, this album is FUN. Madonna's previous effort American Life, a fairly good album in its own right, was just too political and "serious" for my taste. I'm so glad that Madonna has turned in her military outfits and machine guns for a disco hall, leotards and some dance music. It suits her so much better.  Now a redhead (yum yum), Madonna delivers with Confessions on a Dance Floor. And you gotta love the inside booklet photos of her in various sexual positions disguised as Yoga poses. This is why we love you, Madonna. Good to have you back.  And make sure to get the "Hung Up" single while you're at it.
