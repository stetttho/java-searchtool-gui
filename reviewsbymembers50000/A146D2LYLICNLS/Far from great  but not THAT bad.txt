 "Godzilla" is one of those movies where you're better off just watching it for the special effects rather than for the script, story or plot. And the special effects ARE good although nothing groundbreaking. Matthew Broderick seems miscast for this role but he does a fairly credible job with the lousy script. After all, an actor can only carry a movie so far if the script and plot fall flat on their face. But I have to admit that I sort of liked this movie, SORT OF. No, I'm not claiming that it's great or a must-see. But for those of you who appreciate good special effects and cheap thrills it might be worth at least a rental. Just remember to put your brain on neutral and don't expect that much.
