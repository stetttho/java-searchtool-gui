 I would probably give "She's the Man" 3 stars if it weren't for Amanda Bynes, who completely carries this movie and makes it worth watching. As a result, it rises above the typical slapstick comedy. The fact that Amanda Bynes is able to fool everyone in the movie into thinking that she's a guy does take a suspension of disbelief, but then again that's all part of the fun. It isn't meant to be taken seriously anyway, so just go along with it.  All in all, an enjoyable movie thanks to Amanda Bynes. Looking forward to the DVD.
