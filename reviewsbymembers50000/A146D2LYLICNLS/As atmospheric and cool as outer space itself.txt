 The Final Countdown by Europe is a perfect example of a milestone 80's glam-rock album that's just as enjoyable to listen to today as it was back when it was first released. This is atmospheric, melodic hair band rock at its best. And unlike other hair bands from the 80's, The Final Countdown isn't pure cheese. Ok, perhaps there's *some* cheese here and there. But then again that's what made the 80's so fun. I for one won't ever condemn that.  One thing I've always loved about The Final Countdown is the keyboard arrangements and solos, giving the songs a spacial quality. The song that hands-down uses keyboards most effectively is the title track. Who can ever forget that opening keyboard riff. That's quality stuff, folks. And of course there's the power-ballad "Carrie," which has remained one of my favorite ballads from the 80's. I first heard this song when I had my first crush, and whenever I play it these days I remember her and ponder over it's lyrics, "Maybe we'll meet, again, somewhere, again." The perfect song for anyone remembering a lost love and wondering if they're still out there somewhere.   As with other fans who purchased The Final Countdown, I first bought it on cassette and eventually wore it out. It got pushed back in my dusty pile of other cassettes and stayed there for many years. I was one happy person when this great album was re-released on CD, remastered. The sound quality is stunning, and is an immediately noticeable improvement from the first pressing. Even if you still have the cassette and it hasn't been worn out, you would be crazy not to buy this remastered CD version. And if for some reason better sound quality isn't worth a purchase to you, this version offers 3 bonus tracks, live cuts of "The Final Countdown," "Danger on the Track" and "Carrie." Can't beat that. All in all, a superb album.
