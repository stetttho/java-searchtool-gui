 I happened to come across this movie completely by accident one night while channel-surfing. I have to say that I tend to avoid the Lifetime channel as a rule, but this particular night I came across the beginning of this movie and it looked interesting. So I gave it a chance. Wow, what a surprise! This turned out to be quite an enjoyable movie with tons more depth and intrigue than a typical Lifetime made-for-television movie will offer. In fact I would even rate it among the top movies I've seen recently.  Alison Pill plays a young Amish girl who is arrested on suspicion of killing her newborn child. Normally, the "girl gets arrested for killing her baby" wouldn't make for a very worthwhile movie plot since this topic is nothing new, but having an Amish girl be in the center of it all adds an unusual twist to the movie, one of the things it has going for it. And Alison Pill nails this role; I'm shocked that she has not been in more well-known movies. Her acting talent is obvious from the beginning, not to mention being quite attractive. Equally as good is Mariska Hargitay as the lawyer who represents her in court. And she isn't too hard on the eyes either. I don't mean to harp on about the attractiveness of the 2 women in the lead roles, but hey, it certainly doesn't hurt to have that as a bonus.  But getting back to the merits of the movie, don't let the word "Lifetime" discourage you. Believe me, I've done my fair share of cringing from the painfully-bad movies that Lifetime tends to show. But I can assure you that "Plain Truth" is a welcome change, with some great plot twists (you won't see the final one coming a mile away). Highly recommended!
