 There seems to be several versions of this "Followed The Waves" single, and as a rule import singles offer the most bang for the buck. However, this is one of the rare exceptions when the less expensive domestic version offers the most. I'm mainly referring to the enhanced section of the "Followed The Waves" video, which is great. As far as I know this is not on the import singles. The b-side "Good News" is a very good song although it might take a few listens to fully appreciate. It's very mellow and low-key, but haunting and serene. It was a good move to not include this song on the album, as it would probably be a little out of place. So don't bother with the import versions of this single. This is the one to get. And check out the single of "Real A Lie," another gem.
