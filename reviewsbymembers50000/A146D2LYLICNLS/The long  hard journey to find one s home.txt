 I only came across Richard Adams' "Watership Down" recently. As a rule I don't buy books without knowing at least a fair amount of information about the plot. However, I found the use of rabbits as the main characters to be an intriguing concept. So I bought it and have just finished. This turned out to be one of the better books I've read.   The plot centers around a group of rabbits who leave their warren in search of a safer home, encountering all kinds of danger and adventure in the process. Adams' style of writing is accessible and enjoyable, and he writes in such a way that lets the reader get attached to the characters and care about them, especially Bigwig, Fiver and Hazel. Whereas animals used as the main characters in a book is commonly thought of as a children's story, "Watership Down" is anything but. This reads like any other adult novel. The tone is serious for the most part but Adams injects some good-natured humor here and there. From time to time he "stops" the action and explains to the reader why the rabbits are doing certain things, for the purpose of learning about rabbit culture I suppose.  One could probably interpret this novel in many ways, depending on how one views it. It has a simple premise but revolves around many complex issues such as survival, courage, facing one's fears and the search for a better home, things which all of us have experienced. I would surely recommend this book. You'll never see rabbits the same way again. I would also recommend the animated film adaptation. Although darker in nature, it's a great adaptation and stays true to the book.  P.S. Death to anyone who has ever ordered rabbit at a restaurant.
