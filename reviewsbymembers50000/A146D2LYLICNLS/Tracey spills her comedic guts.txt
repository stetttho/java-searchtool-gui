 This is a must-have DVD if you're even a casual fan of Tracey Ullman. Just the fact that she's able to pull off a stand-up act of this type proves her comedic talent. Her act is divided into 10 segments: Show In Mommy's Bedroom, Girl With the Star, The Dancing Years, A Little Variety, The Music Thing, Dinner in New York, Married To Hollywood, The Tracey Show, Talking Heads, and The Big Realization. All of these segments represent a period in her life which she feels helped define her both as a person and also as a comedian. Tracey pretty much covers all the major events and turning points of her life, from childhood to the present.   Half stand-up act and half autobiographical monologue, "Tracey Ullman Live and Exposed" is simply hilarious to watch from start to finish. Die-hard fans will probably already know most of what she says here (as I'm sure they've thoroughly researched her biography), but the main reason to watch it is self-explanatory: for Tracey's performance. Finding out about her life is secondary here. Not that watching her telling about her life story isn't entertaining; it definitely is. She goes through several costume changes between segments, and we all know that one of Tracey's best traits as a comedian is transforming into other characters.  If you like Tracey Ullman, you'd be crazy not to get this. And keep an eye out for season one of "Tracey Takes On," soon to be released on DVD!
