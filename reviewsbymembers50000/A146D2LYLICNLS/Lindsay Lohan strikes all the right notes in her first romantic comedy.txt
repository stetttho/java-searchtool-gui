 Contrary to what many people think, I find Lindsay Lohan to be an above-average talent in the entertainment industry, and more intelligent than people give her credit for. Admittedly though, I prefer her acting to her singing. I've enjoyed her work in films such as "Freaky Friday," "Mean Girls" and "Herbie: Fully Loaded," all aimed at a younger demographic. With "Just My Luck," Lohan graduates into the young adult romantic comedy genre, complete with a business suit and all (which, I'll add, she looks MIGHTY GOOD in).   So does she pull it off? I would say without hesitation that she most certainly does. While this type of role isn't necessarily difficult to play, Lohan adds all the required charm and likeability to her character. There are some genuinely funny moments in the movie, thanks to a great supporting cast. And Chris Pine is also good as the lucky guy who wins Lohan's heart.  Romantic comedies are like action movies...we all know how they're going to end. But what matters is what happens in between point A and point B. And "Just My Luck" has all the right ingredients for a successful film, with a positive message thrown in for good measure. Recommended.
