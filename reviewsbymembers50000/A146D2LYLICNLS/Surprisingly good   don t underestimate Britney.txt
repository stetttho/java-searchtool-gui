 I have to begin this review with a disclaimer of some sort, in that the genre of "bubblegum pop" is NOT among what I listen to regularly, nor will my CD collection ever contain many albums of this genre. Having said that, I have come to enjoy some of the music of Christina Aguilera and Britney Spears. These 2 are considered the "Queens" of this genre, and for good reason.   I bought this album sort of on a whim, having heard "I'm a Slave 4 U" and "I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman" and liking them both. After hearing the entire album several times, I have to say that it's quite catchy and enjoyable, almost more adult-oriented to some extent. What I mean is that the songs sound more mature, not just for young teen girls anymore. "I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman" is a testament to growing up and gaining more experience in the world while going through the transition from child to adult. I think Britney pulls off this song quite well. "Overprotected" is another good song with more of a Rock edge to it. But my favorite song has to be "Anticipating," a tribute to the Disco scene. This song is just hands-down great. The only throwaway song on this album is the cover of "I Love Rock 'N' Roll." Sorry, but we got to be honest: this one is just BAD. I have no problem with cover songs, but there's nothing to like about this one. It's unlistenable. This one sticks out like a sore thumb and brings down an otherwise solid album. But at least there's the "skip" button.  Despite that one horrid song, Britney's self-titled album is a recommended buy. Underneath all the fluff, makeup and bubblegum pop, this album is quite good, with songs that are fun to listen to. And sometimes that's all that one wants.
