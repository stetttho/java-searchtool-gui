 I had such high hopes for "Flightplan." IMO Jodie Foster can do no wrong. And I still feel the same way after seeing "Flightplan." But the script is the one who does the wrong in this movie. The premise is excellent: a claustrophobic thriller in an airplane. With Jodie Foster. Can't get any better. And it starts off great. But then the plot twist occurs, and that's when the trouble begins. I was expecting a plot twist, and I love plot twists. But not since M. Night Shyamalan's "The Village" has there been a more absurd and unbelievable plot twist than that of "Flightplan." Without giving it away, it makes absolutely NO sense that the villain in this movie turned out to be who it was. And to make matters worse, the movie turns into a by-the-numbers one-on-one struggle towards the end, and ends in the most cliched way possible. As good as the potential was, the movie decides to resort to formulatic storytelling instead of offering a thriller with real substance.  I really wish I could write a good review of "Flightplan." Jodie Foster is my favorite actress of all time and will always be. And despite the hackeyed second half of the movie, I still recommend "Flightplan." Not because of the movie itself, but because of Foster's performance along with the rest of the great cast. But that's about it. I have no other positive remarks to make.  Talk about a wasted opportunity.
