 Come on, let's get real here: "The Da Vinci Code" is really nothing more than a slightly above-average (maybe even just average) mystery/adventure/thriller disposable novel that got where it is today mainly due to tons of hype and the so-called "controversial" subject matter. Add to that being at the right place at the right time, and you got yourself a best-seller. Even Dan Brown has admitted this himself, and doesn't seem to offer any apologies for it. And why $hould he; he'$ made million$ off it! And it's probably a great way to get chicks, too!  And yes, it reads like a movie script. Ok, maybe it IS a movie script, with a film adaptation in mind all along. Still, I found it entertaining if nothing else. Looking forward to the movie.  And to all the fanatics crying blasphemy and urging nationwide boycotts of the film: keep up the great work! The more you rant, the more money it will make at the box office, and the more copies of the book will fly off store shelves (#2 right now here at amazon).
