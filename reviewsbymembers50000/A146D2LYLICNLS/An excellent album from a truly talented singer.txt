 Christina Aguilera's latest album "Stripped" shows that she is a LOT more than just bubble-gum pop. Comparisons to other singers of this genre are abundant, especially to Britney Spears. Both are able to put on lively shows, but in terms of raw singing talent, Christina is Queen. Anyone with an ear for music can hear this. She has great range and excellent articulation. She knows how to use her voice to produce sweet-sounding music rather than simply "get the notes out" like other singers do. And oh yeah, she's also beautiful. That certainly doesn't hurt. "Stripped" shows just how far Christina has evolved since her debut album. Her debut was good but focused a lot on marketing towards the teen crowd, which I'm sure automatically put it in the "bubble gum" genre for many people. Her singing talent was certainly present, but got sort of buried underneath the whole "teeny-bopper" image of the album. However, "Stripped" breaks away from that mold and lets Christina show what she's capable of. The songs are more mature and diverse, and so is Christina's singing. Her voice on this album is soulful, jazzy, sweet and sexy all combined. The only reason I don't give "Stripped" 5 stars is because I think her best work is still yet to come. I anticipate that this talented young woman will be offering us tons of more great music down the road.
