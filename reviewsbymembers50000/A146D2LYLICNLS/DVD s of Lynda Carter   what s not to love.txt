 Season 1 on DVD was great, and now we are given Season 2. What more could a Wonder Woman fan ask for? I was still in diapers when this show had its initial run on television, but I got hooked by the reruns. I'm still hooked today. And of course there's Lynda Carter who's just perfect as Wonder Woman. She was perfect for the role in Season 1, Season 2, Season 3, and forever and ever. She was born for this role. Nobody could have ever done a better job in it.  The only minor complaint I have with this DVD set is the same minor complaint I have with Season 1's DVD set: dual-sided discs. I don't like these. They are very easy to get fingerprints and scratches on if one doesn't pay extra careful attention when handling them. Also, it would have been great if there were scene selections in each episode. Instead, one has to scan through an episode if they want to see a certain scene. But that's all the complaints I have. The DVD presentation (packaging, sound & picture quality) are all excellent.  If you're a Wonder Woman fan, go out and buy this NOW. If you aren't a Wonder Woman fan, become one.
