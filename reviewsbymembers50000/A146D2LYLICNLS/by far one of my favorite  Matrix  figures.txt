 I really like this new Niobe figure. She has a cool pose and the figure actually looks like her, unlike some of the other new "Matrix" figures that don't really look like the actors in the movie. Niobe's accessories are great; included are 2 guns, sunglasses, a platform where she can be mounted on, and a large brick background piece that for some reason comes in 2 parts. Putting the guns in her hands can be a little tricky but I think I figured it out: don't try to slide them vertically through her hands. Instead, gently place them in her palms at an angle so that they fit naturally, and then turn them so that they're in the proper position. You'll notice that her index fingers will automatically be in perfect position to have themselves on the triggers. Putting on her sunglasses is straightforward although make sure that they go above her ears so that they'll stay in place. These small accessories are very easy to lose, so I strongly suggest putting them on right away.  It should be noted that these new "Matrix" figures aren't really made for playing with, rather, they're display pieces. These figures have some bodily articulation but it is very limited. I wouldn't recommend playing with them as if they were "regular" action figures, as the strains put on them might break them. That's why my "durability" rating is 4/5. I'm also a little skeptical of her sunglasses; they're made of very flexible rubber which doesn't seem to be very durable. But these are only minor things.
