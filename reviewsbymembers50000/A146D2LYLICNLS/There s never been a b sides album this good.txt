 I have to agree with the majority of reviewers here: Lost Dogs is indeed an amazing double album that easily rivals any other Pearl Jam album. How many bands out there have b-sides that are just as good as (and oftentimes, even better than) their a-sides? Not many. Say what you will about Pearl Jam, but the mark they have made in the music world is tremendous. Many PJ fans will already know many of these b-sides such as "Yellow Ledbetter," "Black Red Yellow," "Other Side" and "You," which have previously been available on PJ's singles. But it's great to see so many new b-sides which I'm sure even the most die hard PJ song collector doesn't have all of. I agree that there are some b-sides missing like "Leatherman" and "Angel" but should we really expect it to be perfect? Lost Dogs offers more than enough rarities, and that should be the main focus here. So pick this album up even if you're a casual PJ fan. The majority seem to be in agreement about its worth. And so far the only bad reviews here are the typical immature rants that put down the band itself rather than focusing on their music, written by people who have to say something but have nothing to say, if you get my drift. And no, I'm not just saying this because those people gave it one star. I've read many one star reviews for other albums, movies, etc. that reflect well-written, thought-out honest opinions. I can respect those even if I may strongly disagree with them. But people who only give these types of bashing one star reviews just can't seem to realize that the joke is really on them. Ok, off my soapbox!
