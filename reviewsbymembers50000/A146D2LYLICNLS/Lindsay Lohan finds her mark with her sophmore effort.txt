 I'm impressed with this album. Lindsay Lohan has now established herself as one of the best female pop artists out there. On "A Little More Personal (Raw)," she has reached the greatness that her debut album "Speak" only hinted at. This is a collection of some very catchy songs, with depth and originality not often found in this genre of music. The two cover songs are fun to listen to although I found "Edge Of Seventeen" to be a lot better than "I Want You To Want Me."  If there's one flaw to this album, it's with Lindsay's vocals, and this is why I don't give it the full 5 stars. She definitely has the potential to be a great singer, but it's clear that she still needs some more work on her delivery. She may get the notes right, but to me her voice lacks the emotional depth needed to turn good songs into great ones. Hopefully she will improve this for her next album.  But as a whole, this album is definitely worth getting and paves the way for a very successful career for Lindsay. And as a nice little bonus, there are some VERY sexy photos of her in the CD booklet, showing off her sexy freckles. Very nice indeed.
