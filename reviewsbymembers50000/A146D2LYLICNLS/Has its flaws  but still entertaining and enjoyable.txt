 "An American Warewolf In Paris," while not nearly as good as its predecessor "An American Warewolf In London," offers plenty of genuine entertainment to stand on its own. Andy (Tom Everett Scott) and two of his friends travel to Paris. One night while attempting a stunt off the top of the Eiffel Tower, he sees a woman (Julie Delpy) who is about to jump off and fall to her death. He saves her life and is instantly mesmerized by her. But there's something about her that he doesn't know: a full moon will bring out the beast in her, literally. Of course, he eventually gets bitten and the fun begins.  I suppose I should mention the film's shortcomings first and get that out of the way. For one, it relies on CGI for the warewolf scenes. It's rather unconvincing most of the time. And second, the blend of horror and comedy simply does not work as it did in "An American Warewolf In London." Not to overly compare the two, but "An American Warewolf In Paris *is* technically its sequel and therefore must be compared at least somewhat. But that's really all there is in terms of flaws. Everything else about it works. Tom Everett Scott is great in his role and Julie Delpy is excellent as the mysterious and beautiful woman who steals his heart. And her nude scene, while brief, is certainly a nice bonus! I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoyed "An American Warewolf In London" or anyone who just likes a brainless scary flick. It may not be the greatest horror film of all time but it's definitely a lot of fun.
