 I think it goes without saying that every Cyndi Lauper fan must own this video. While not perfect, it's as close as one can get. And for the price it's offered for, you can't get a better deal. What you get here is a great collection of Cyndi's music videos, in chronological order. I found this to be an excellent idea, as it lets you follow Cyndi through the years and see how she's changed (and in some ways not changed!) over time. It features Cyndi and a friend hanging out at Coney Island (which incidentally is where the photo shoot was done for her She's So Unusual album), going on the rides and having a good time. Cyndi makes a brief statement before each video, giving the viewer a general sense of her thoughts and feelings.  Cyndi's videos compliment her songs very well, from the playful and carefree "Girls Just Want To Have Fun" to the somber and pensive "Sally's Pigeons." But my favorite video has to be "I Drove All Night." Here we see Cyndi's sexy side. I especially like the mixture of black & white and color in this video, as well as the great cinematography. Other standout videos are "Time After Time" and the live version of "Money Changes Everything." I highly recommend this video. After all, where else can you get a collection of Cyndi's videos without having to scramble for low-quality bootlegs? Sure, this collection is missing gems such as "The Goonies 'R' Good Enough" and "Hole In My Heart (All The Way To China)" but for what you DO get here, it's money well invested.
