 I only found out about Skye Sweetnam recently, and I'm sure glad I did! Noise From the Basement, her debut album, is nothing short of great. I admit, I was a little hesitant at first to buy this. It's easy to dismiss Skye as just another teeny-bop act. But I can tell you that Skye is *not* just another face in the crowd. This album is impressive, and goes way above what one would initially expect from this genre of music.   Yes, comparisons to Avril Lavigne are going to fly left and right. After all, both Avril and Skye are "punk-rock chicks." Both are about the same age. Both are Canadian. But that's really where the comparisons stop. While Avril's music has its merits, her albums tend to follow one single theme and stick with it, causing all the songs to sound alike. But Noise From the Basement is a refreshing change from that. Each song seems to have its own personality. There's also a quirky variety to this album, most notably an unexpected (but great) cover of Blondie's "Heart Of Glass."  Lyrically, Skye sings about stuff that, well, girls her age think about. It's sure better than if she tried to sing about more adult-oriented themes and end up coming across as pretentious or just having no clue. The lyrics on Noise From the Basement may not be deep or profound, but they're genuine. I mean, didn't we all think about these things when we were her age?  If you like music with energy to it, that's fun to listen to while not taking itself too seriously, Noise From the Basement is a great buy. Skye Sweetnam is going places.
