 I bought this album completely going by word-of-mouth. I hadn't heard any of the songs but I didn't have to: just the excellent reviews and recommendations from friends was reason enough to get it. The other reviews here have done a great job with praising it so there's no need for me to go into the details of how good this album is. But I'll just say that anyone with an appreciation for quality music and lyrics would be a fool not to buy it. It's hard to believe that Anna Nalick is only 20 years old.  If there's any downside to this album, it's the expectations that will inevitably be high when Anna releases her sophmore album. After all, this debut is so great that she will need to deliver an equally good second album. But it's obvious that she has the talent to pull it off, and I think she will.  And to anyone in the Boston area: Anna will be doing an acoustic performance and autograph signing at Border's bookstore at 10 School St, Boston, on May 2 at 12:30. What a treat that will be.
