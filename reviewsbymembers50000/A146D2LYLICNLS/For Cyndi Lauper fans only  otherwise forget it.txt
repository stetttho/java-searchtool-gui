 The title of my review pretty much sums it up. This is not a good movie in itself; there is no denying that. But what saves it is Cyndi Lauper. As usual, her performance is good and enjoyable to watch. You also get to see her "sing" underwater while wearing a mermaid costume. Cool stuff. Bottom line: this flick is worth getting if you like Cyndi Lauper (although if you intend to only buy one movie with her get "Vibes" instead - way better in every aspect).
