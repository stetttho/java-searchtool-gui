 Although Bjork has been distancing herself further and further from those who can't appreciate her non-commercial sound (mainly Selmasongs and Vespertine), it only proves that she's an artist who's not afraid to take risks and explore completely new territory. While Medulla won't win any new fans of her non-commercial sound, it's a special treat for her long-time fans and those fans who have liked her more recent albums. As with other fans of hers I'm sure, I didn't quite know what to make of Medulla upon first listen. There's really no word to describe it. The closest label I can put on it is "experimental," and even that is probably way off target. It's so out of the ordinary that it will mean different things to different people.   Having heard it several times now, I've come to appreciate Bjork's vision on this album. There's a certain feel of cohesiveness which one wouldn't think existed at first. It will definitely take many listens for most people to like it, but be patient and it will pay off. A challenging musical experience for those who seek it. Bjork truly is one of the most innovative artists out there.
