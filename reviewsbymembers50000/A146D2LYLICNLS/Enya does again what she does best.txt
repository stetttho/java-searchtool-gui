 While Enya's albums tend to stick with one formula only, that doesn't have to be a bad thing. There's even a sense of consistency with that, something I have no problem with. All in all, I enjoyed Amarantine and don't regret buying it. It's not perfect, but it does live up to the standards that we've come to expect from an Enya release.   My only complaint is the same complaint I had with A Day Without Rain...too short. Although Amarantine is slightly longer than ADWR, I still can't help feeling a little cheated. Why not make the songs longer or add more songs? One would think that in 5 years Enya would have plenty of new material to make an album that reaches the 60 minute mark. But I'll deal with it.  While Amarantine won't convert any new Enya fans, it will satisfy long-time fans. Watermark is and will always be Enya's crowning achievement, but with Amarantine she proves that she's still got it.
