 I would consider myself a casual fan of Courtney Love and Hole. I personally do not care about what she's done and not done in the past; I consider all that stuff just politics. What matters to me is the music. After all, if we were to judge an artist or a band by something they did that wasn't completely right in our eyes and not buy their stuff, our CD shelves would be practically empty. But enough about that. I bought "America's Sweetheart" today on impulse, as I hadn't heard any of the songs before. I was expecting something good but not necessarily great. I've listened to this album 3 times so far and I am quite impressed to say the least. I had no idea that it would be this good. From the in-your-face rockers such as "All The Drugs" to the softer ballad rock songs like "Sunset Strip," this album delivers. My favorite song is without a doubt "Almost Golden." I haven't heard a rock song that good in a very long time. The rest of the songs are pretty much run of the mill, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. All are very catchy. This could easily have been a new Hole album instead of a Courtney solo effort. Again, that's not a bad thing. The CD comes with a limited edition poster, one side being the cover art and the other side a real photo of Courtney. She looks great. My only complaint is that you have to remove the staples to get the poster out, since it's part of the booklet. So no matter how careful you are you'll end up with 4 small holes in it.
