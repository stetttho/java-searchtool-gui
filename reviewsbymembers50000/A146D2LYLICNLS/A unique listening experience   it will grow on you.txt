 I only recently heard that Melissa Auf Der Maur was releasing a solo album, so I instantly became eager to hear what she would sound like both vocally and musically. It's always a risk when a lesser-known band member (in Melissa's case, Hole and Smashing Pumpkins) goes solo; will they be able to escape from the shadow and make an impact alone? Well in Melissa's case, it has worked. I've listened to this album several times now and I can safely say that I'm impressed. But just a word of caution: you might not like it that much at first. This is definitely one of those albums that in most cases will require repeated listenings for the songs to grow on you. Be rest assured though: once they do, they REALLY do. Songs that I didn't like at first are now stuck in my head, especially "Real A Lie." There's something spooky about that song, and in a good way. Actually, "spooky" might pretty much describe this album as a whole, and again, in a good way. There's just something uniquely moody and dark about it, both in terms of the songs themselves but also with the production. At first I didn't care much for the production; but after several listens I've noticed that the album's raw sound really compliments the atmosphere of the songs. I definitely recommend this album. It probably won't work for those who only like mainstream Top40-ish Rock, but for those of you who can appreciate a unique and ecclectic album, give it a listen. And on a side note, there's a hidden bonus track of the song "Taste You" where Melissa sings in French. Good stuff.
