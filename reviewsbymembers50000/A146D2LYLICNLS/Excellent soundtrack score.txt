 I'm usually not one to buy a movie soundtrack/score but "Matrix Revolutions" is definitely an exception. I think Don Davis has done a superb job with capturing all the excitement and tension of "Revolutions." As other reviewers have already said, this CD is a SCORE and not the typical soundtrack that features various songs by many different bands/artists. To me, one major difference between a score and a soundtrack is that a score lets the listener "feel" the movie with the same passion they felt it while watching it. A soundtrack, on the other hand, often contains songs that weren't even in the movie and the result is often an impersonal listen. This is why the soundtrack to "Matrix Reloaded" didn't appeal to me. While I liked some of the songs on it, it didn't speak to me like the score of "Revolutions" does. This CD really pulls you in. The only minor complaint I have is track 4. This song is not only forgetable but disrupts the flow of the score. Other than that, it's a near perfect score to the movie. This CD also offers an "enhanced" section. Among the features is a preview for some kind of "Matrix" comic book which I don't know anything about but looks pretty cool. There's also a game that's basically a rip off of Pac-Man where you fly your ship through a maze and must collect various items while avoiding the sentinels. It's actually pretty fun. There might be other enhanced features too but I haven't gotten around to those yet.
