 I, along with many other Green Day fans, was not expecting American Idiot to be what it turned out to be. After all, the title track first single could have easily been on their Insomniac album; typical Green Day, no more no less. And nothing wrong with that. But after listening to the full album even once, it's apparent that American Idiot is *far from* the typical Green Day we would have expected. I'm even a little perplexed as to why "American Idiot" was chosen as the first single. It's a good song, don't get me wrong. But it just doesn't represent the feel of the album itself. Oh well.  American Idiot, to me, is Green Day's crowning achievement. Instead of recycling the same 3-chord predictable formula, they did what many bands are afraid of doing: they took a risk. And that is what growth as a band is all about. It was a courageous move on their part, as I'm sure there are going to be fans out there who can't handle it. For those, I say listen again, but this time try to see their vision. You might just find yourself liking it, while listening with fresh ears.  Somewhat of a concept album, American Idiot delivers. It may not be groundbreaking but it's a brave step for Green Day, who until now were backed into the corner as being "just another punk rock band." American Idiot proves that they're capable of much more. Green Day have matured quite a bit over the years; just think back to when you first heard "Longview" played on MTV. Their old-school days were great too, but now it's time to enter a new era. I hope that this isn't Green Day's last album, but if it is, they have certainly gone out with a bang.
