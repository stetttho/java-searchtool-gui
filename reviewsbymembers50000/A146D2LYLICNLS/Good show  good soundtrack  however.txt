 Love the show, and this soundtrack looks great. But buyer beware...the version of "All Things Just Keep Getting Better" is NOT the version you hear during the opening credits of the show. The version on this CD is the newer remixed version which has been featured on the video to the song. IMO the original version (during the opening credits) was far superior and far more catchy. This new remixed version sounds like, well, a remixed version. So be aware of this before buying the CD. But that's all the bad things I can say about it. The rest of the album is great. P.S. If anyone knows where one can find the original version of "All Things Just Keep Getting Better" (if it even exists on CD) please let me know. Thanks.
