 Leann Rimes has always been able to impress me with her voice. At such a young age she has already achieved what a lot of singers twice her age can only hint at. She is a unique talent. This Greatest Hits album is definitely a worthy addition to one's collection if they're a fan of Leann. What I like most about it is that it gives a nice blend of her "old-school" Country songs as well as her newer songs in the Pop genre, which IMO are just as good. I do have one complaint though: where is "Damn" from her Twisted Angel album?! That's easily one of her best songs, and it's inexcusable that it's not included here. I don't care that it was never considered an official "hit" of hers: include it anyway! After all, many Greatest Hits albums out there have songs that weren't necessarily hits. But aside from that complaint, this collection is great. Highly recommended. And if you can still find it, get the limited edition version with a bonus DVD of some of Leann's music videos. It's worth the extra money.
