 I'm glad that this sorry excuse for a movie has 2 stars as the average rating here (although it should be only 1). To think that millions of dollars was spent on making this stink-fest is depressing. Why was Joel Schumacher allowed to vomit on the Batman franchise like this? Did he really think that this is entertainment? Was his target audience 3rd graders? There must be a reason why things like this happen. I would rather watch "Howard the Duck" while simultaneously getting a root canal than see this movie again.  Yeah, so it may have good visuals. So do countless other movies, movies that offer at least SOME substance to go along with special effects.   I remember seeing this movie at my college theater for $1. I was ripped off. But there's still hope for you. Do not see this. Do not rent this. Do not buy this. Go see "Batman Begins" instead, a REAL Batman flick that does justice to the franchise. Hear that, Joel Schumacher?
