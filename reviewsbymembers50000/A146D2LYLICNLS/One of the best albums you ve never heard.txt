 I came across this album completely by chance while browsing around at a used record store. I had never heard of Lustre before but the cover art and back art looked cool, so I bought it on a whim and took my chances. I've had this album for about a year now and it has become one of my favorites. And it didn't even need time to grow on me; I loved it from the instant I first played it. I would describe these guys as a mixture of Gin Blossoms (very melodic) and Third Eye Blind (pure raw energy) but with a harder edge. I'm sure comparisons to other bands can be made as well. But there's something that makes this album stand out and hold its own weight. The songs are extremely well-written and melodic, with great lyrics. Standouts are "Musta Been Cool," "Shining," "Wasting Time" and "Watermelon," although there really isn't a filler song to be found. I can't believe this album never got the publicity it needed to become mainstream, especially since it's on a major label (A&M Records). But unfortunately that's the fate of many bands out there, and Lustre had the bad luck of falling into that category. But you have the opportunity to discover this great album (plenty of used copies right here at Amazon). I would strongly recommend picking yourself up a copy. If you like great music with a hard edge to it, this album delivers.
