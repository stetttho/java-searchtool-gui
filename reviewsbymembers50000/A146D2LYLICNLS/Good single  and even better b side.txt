 I admit, the first time I heard Maria Mena's "You're The Only One" I didn't know quite what to make of it. The song is so unconventional in how she literally speaks the words (although she does sing during the chorus). And yet there was something special about this song which caused me to give it a few more listens. After all, many things cannot be judged right away and require time to fully understand. Well now this song has become stuck in my head and I love it. I still find it unique, but in a great way. It's refreshing to see an artist like Maria who has her own style and doesn't just put out manufactured, stale music for the masses. She is a true talent, in her own quirky way. And I find her voice to have a certain smoothness to it that gives "You're The Only One" a distinct characteristic.    But the real gem of this single is the non-album track "Patience." WOW, what a great song. Beautiful, just beautiful. Maria's singing is more "conventional" on this song, and everything about it works perfectly. I can't believe this song didn't make it on her album.
