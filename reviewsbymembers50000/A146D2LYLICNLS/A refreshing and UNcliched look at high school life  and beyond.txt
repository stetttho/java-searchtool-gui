 I had heard good things about this movie but never realized just how good it was until I saw it for myself. "Mean Girls" explores familiar territory and doesn't break any new ground, but the excellent and intelligent script make it stand out and exceed other similar movies such as "Jawbreaker." Most importantly, this movie touches on the subject of our need for acceptance and oftentimes, the temptation of belonging, even if what we want to belong to isn't necessarily good for us. This applies to everyone, at any age, in any setting. "Mean Girls" uses high school as the backdrop, but its message applies anywhere.  And this movie will also give you a newfound respect for Lindsay Lohan's acting ability, as she is very believable in her role. I wasn't expecting much from her but was pleasantly surprised as to how well she pulled off her role. This is by far her best film.  All in all, a great movie worth owning. Great DVD too...lots of bonus material and a great transfer.
