 "Fire On The Amazon" is just like the 1987 film "Hangmen" in that only die-hard Sandra Bullock fans who absolutely must own every movie she's been in would be interested in purchasing. And that's pretty much all there is to it. "Fire On The Amazon" offers nothing of interest to the everyday movie watcher. In fact it's pretty abysmal, with a plot that will leave you scratching your head and rolling your eyes. But it does have Sandra Bullock in it, and that is a good thing.  Ok, now to Sandra's nude scene (which, let's face it, is why 99% of people would want to own this movie). It's actually pretty good, if you can overlook the cheesiness of it. No T&A, but it does show a full-body shot of Sandra and the photographer getting it on, soft porn style. The rest of the scene is basic movie lovemaking style. Please note that I'm going by the Unrated version, which only seems to be available on VHS. I haven't seen the R-rated version but I would guess that it shows less and probably cuts out the full body shot. Bottom line: get this movie only if you love Sandra Bullock and want to see her before she became a household name, or if you simply want to see her only nude scene. But as I said you're better off getting the VHS Unrated version if your only purpose is to see Sandra in the buff.
