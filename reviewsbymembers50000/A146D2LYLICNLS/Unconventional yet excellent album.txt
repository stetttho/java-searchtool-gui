 I've only recently gotten into Ken Andrew's music so I'm fairly new to his stuff. But "Year of the Rabbit" is an album which immediately grabbed my attention after a friend played it for me. I instantly liked it's dark yet melodic feel. Just when you think a song will head in a certain direction, it totally diverges and almost becomes a different song, so to speak. You won't find songs like these on many albums. But that's what makes it so good. Highly recommended to anyone who's familiar with Ken Andrew's music or just anyone who can appreciate loud, sonic, dreamy and melodic rock. Album contains an enhanced section with live clips, interviews and other odds and ends. And on a side note, this album actually has a single, although it's very tough to find. The actual CD is called "Year of the Rabbit 3 Song Sampler" even though it's technically a single of "Rabbit Hole" and "Strange Eyes" and contains a b-side called "I Wanna Be Adored" (a Stone Roses cover) which is excellent. Definitely worth tracking down.
