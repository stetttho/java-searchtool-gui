 Jewel is one of those rare artists whom I don't hesitate to buy new albums from even if I haven't heard it yet, because I know I'm not going to be disappointed (yes, I even liked 0304 after many listens). I'm not ashamed to admit that I jumped on the bandwagon back when "Who Will Save Your Soul" first became a hit, and the rest is history as they say. I'm not saying that Jewel is perfect, nor do I like every single one of her songs. But when all is said and done, I firmly believe that she has contributed to the music world with nearly-consistent good songs and lyrics that rise way above what's passed for music these days.  I've heard Goodbye Alice In Wonderland 3 times today and I can say for certain that this is yet another great album in Jewel's catalogue. As odd as this may sound, I see this album as a mix of all her previous albums rolled into one (of course, with the exception of 0304 - although "Fragile Heart" makes a second appearance here), with just enough uniqueness to make it stand on its own.   I won't say that this is Jewel's best album but it's pretty close. Recommended purchase for any Jewel fan.
