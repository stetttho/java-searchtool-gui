 I bought this soundtrack score a few days ago and have become totally immersed in it. Edward Shearmur has done a fantastic job with capturing the excitement of "Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow." I feel that many people overlook the importance of the music when watching a movie. Just think about it, would "Star Wars" be what it is without that grand epic musical introduction at the very beginning? No, it wouldn't. Same thing applies to "Sky Captain." This movie needed this type of music to make it what it is. This score is just phenominal. I would even say it's better than the actual movie (I think the movie could have been better in some aspects, but since this review is for the music, I'll stick to that).  I do have one minor complaint though. The first track, supposedly the main "theme" to the movie, is way too short, clocking in at only 1:07. I wish Shearmur had elaborated more on it. It's such a cool piece of music, but ends before one can fully get into it. It's true that this "theme" re-appears at several points during the rest of the score, but it isn't quite the same thing. The final track, Jane Monheit's "Over The Rainbow," isn't vital to the soundtrack but is a nice addition and serves as a closing farewell.  All in all, I rate this score a 4.5, but I'll round up to 5 just because the music is so cool. Recommended to any fan of the movie, or any fan of the action/adventure musical score genre.
