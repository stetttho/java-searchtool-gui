 Bad movie. Lame, over-the-top, cliched, dull, one-dimensional characters, formulatic Hollywood ending. I have nothing against Richard Gere nor Kim Basinger. The acting is fine. What makes this movie so bad is the script, direction and story. And oh yeah, the DVD stinks too; horrid transfer, bare-bones with zero bonus material. A bootlegged video would offer better picture and sound quality than this.   But as much as I've bashed this movie, I recommend getting it, for the sole reason of a very young (and oh my lawd, ever so sexy and gorgeous) Uma Thurman. She will make your saliva glands work a double shift. Uma is THE reason for owning this movie. Fast-forward to every scene with her and you're all set. Forget the rest.  My final analysis of Final Analysis: no stars for actual movie, 2 stars for Uma Thurman (one star for Uma and another star for Thurman). Enough said.
