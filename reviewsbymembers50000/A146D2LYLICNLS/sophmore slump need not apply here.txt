 I've just finished listening to "The Diary Of Alicia Keys" and WOW, this young lady has talent. If anyone ever doubted it before, this will make a believer out of them. While I really liked "Songs In A Minor," this new album surpasses it in just about every way. I totally agree with other reviewers in that Alicia's voice has gotten so much better (not that it wasn't good before). This album shows that she can sing better than many singers twice, three times her age. It seems to come so naturally for her, never sounding forced. The music is simply great, well written and wonderfully performed. The production is just right and not overproduced. The bonus DVD is also great. By far one of the best albums to come out this year. A must-have for any fan of quality music. Even if you're not into R&B you'll probably like this, since Alicia is able to blend so many different styles of music into these songs. A fantastic listen.
