 "Scarecrows" is one gem of a movie. This flick gives a whole new meaning to the phrase "cult classic." I only discovered it recently, and wish that I had long ago. Trust me, after watching it you'll NEVER think of scarecrows the same way again. A group of bank robbers are riding in a geteway plane when one of them decides to take the money and parachute into a large deserted cornfield at night, unaware that blood-thirsty scarecrows await him. So the fun begins. This is the first horror movie that has made me turn the lights *back on*, and I do not scare easily. It is genuinely CREEPY, mainly due to the scarecrows themselves. This low-budget campy movie is scarier than anything Hollywood has come up with on a multi million dollar budget.  If you're a fan of horror films then you owe it to yourself to watch "Scarecrows." Although it's out-of-print it's worth tracking down and buying. Perhaps someday it will be released on DVD but for now VHS will have to do. Regardless, it's a great movie and offers real chills. Get it now!
