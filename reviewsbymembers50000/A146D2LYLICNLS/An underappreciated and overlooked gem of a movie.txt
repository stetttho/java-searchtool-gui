 I consider "Meet Joe Black" along with Spielberg's "Artificial Intelligence" to be among the most misunderstood films of recent times. But "Meet Joe Black" suffered an even worse fate when it was released, because it never enjoyed the box office success that "A.I." did. In any event, "Meet Joe Black" is one gem of a movie, half fantasy and half drama, that has an important message about the lives we have, what we do with our time here on earth, and how we cope with loss and death. Although the movie is quite long (I think it could have been at least half an hour shorter and still have been just as effective), it never drags. Those who have written here that it is "boring" either can't allow themselves to feel some emotion, are too uncomfortable with the issue of death, or prefer to be spoon-fed the plot when watching a movie. Judge this movie for yourself. You might just end up looking at life (and perhaps, death) in a much different way.  With this movie Brad Pitt proved that he's more than just a "Hollywood hunk." This type of role must have been difficult to play, and he pulls it off convincingly. Anthony Hopkins is superb as usual, enough said. The rest of the cast is great as well.  If you haven't seen this movie, I would urge you to give it a chance. Have patience and it will pay off in the end. I was happy to see that a Special Edition was released recently, although for some strange reason it disappeared off store shelves as quickly as it was put on them (one can't even buy it new here at Amazon-what's with THAT?!) But the first edition is readily available, and that's all that matters.
