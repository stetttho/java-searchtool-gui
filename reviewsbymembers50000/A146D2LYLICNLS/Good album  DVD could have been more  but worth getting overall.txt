 "Particles & Waves" is by far Cranes' most mellow and "chilled out" album. This is definitely NOT driving music. It will probably take even the most devoted Cranes fan at least a few listens to appreciate it. After all, this is Cranes we're talking about here...with the exception of "Population Four," they're as non-commercial as one can get. And "Particles & Waves" basically follows the same format. Alison Shaw's girlish  and innocent voice is still the trademark sound of the band, and it goes very nicely with this collection of songs. There really isn't a way to describe the album other than lush, quiet, melodic and relaxed. If you've followed Cranes up until now, you will probably like this one.   And now to the bonus "Live In London" DVD with the tracks "Fragile," "Future Song," "Flute Song" and "Far Away." Of course, any Cranes fan will be pysched that a professionally-shot official live DVD has finally been released. As expected, visual and audio quality are both excellent. I do have one minor issue though, and it's a technical one. The camera keeps on switching to slow motion. I find this irritating and IMO it somewhat takes away from the whole live feel. I would rather just see the band filmed rather than have to sit through these camera tricks. My other gripe is that I don't see why this DVD couldn't have been of a full-lenght concert. But even if we can accept that it's only 4 songs, why couldn't more features have been included such as interviews or other band footage? I really don't mean to sound like a complainer; these 4 songs are great. It's just that the DVD seems too short.  Prior to this U.S. and Canadian release, a much more pricy U.K. import was available, but without the bonus DVD. If you bought that one, the decision as to whether to also buy this version will solely depend on how much of a Cranes fan you are.
