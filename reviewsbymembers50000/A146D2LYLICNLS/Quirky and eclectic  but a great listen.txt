 I remember buying The Divine Comedy when it first came out and not really knowing what to expect. Being a fan of Milla Jovovich as an actress and model I was curious to hear what she would sound like as a musician. As is the case with many people, I bought it going by the single "Gentleman Who Fell" although I first became acquainted with it by watching the video as opposed to hearing it on the radio. I was pleasantly surprised as to how good this album really is. Yes, inevitable comparisons to other artists like Kate Bush, Enya and Tori Amos will be made, but I think Milla accomplished the difficult task of distinguishing herself from them and creating her own style and sound. And even if the songs might touch upon influences from other artists, is that such a bad thing? There are many singers and bands who sound alike and share common genres; some are even practically clones of each other (especially true with the whole rap-metal and nu-metal fad these days).  So don't judge this album on the basis that Milla might sound like other artists. Listen to the songs for yourself with an unbiased ear and you'll appreciate her talent.
