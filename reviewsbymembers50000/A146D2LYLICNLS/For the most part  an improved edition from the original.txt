 This review will mainly focus on this new Deluxe Edition of the DVD rather than the merits of the movie itself.   All in all, I would say that it's better than the previous Special Edition. Bonus material includes an alternate ending with an introduction from director Paul Anderson, cast & filmmakers' commentary, visual effects commentary, 11 featurettes, filmographies and trailer. The previous version was a little skimpy on bonus material, so having all these goodies is nice.  This version comes with a "free" ticket voucher to see "Resident Evil: Apocalypse." As others have stated, the voucher is good for $7.50. This is a double-edged sword, since a lot of theaters charge more than that for non-matinee showings. I assume that in those cases one can simply pay the difference with cash. So find out exactly how much your ticket will cost before thinking that it's completely free. Most theaters accept it although I've noticed that some do not, such as AMC Theaters. Read the listing on the back to make sure your theater will honor it. Finally, it expires on 10/1/04, so use it ASAP.  I must comment on how this new DVD cover art STINKS. The previous cover art was much better and eye-pleasing, with the full-body photo of Milla Jovovich. But oh well.  In spite of some minor quibbles, I would definitely recommend this Deluxe Edition for any "Resident Evil" fan. The movie itself is cool, not Oscar material but a lot of fun, with good special effects. And of course Milla Jovovich! Can't go wrong with her.
