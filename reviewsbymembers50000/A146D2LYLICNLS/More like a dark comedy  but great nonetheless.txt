 "Risky Business" is without a doubt one of the classics from the 80's which I've continued to enjoy many times. This is simply a great movie with convincing acting, superb music, good script and believable characters. While the plot isn't anything too original, the above mentioned qualities make this movie fun to watch. Tom Cruise, having the house to himself while his parents are away, carries out the fantasy of just about every adolescent male by basically turning his home into a party haven with the inevitable consequences that follow. Rebecca De Mornay (it should be illegal to look that good in a pair of tight jeans!) plays a prostitute that becomes Cruise's "partner" in the scheme of things and Joe Pantoliano plays her sleazy pimp and does a great job in his role. One thing that stands out about "Risky Business" is that while technically a comedy, the tone is often dark in terms of sequence of events and the eerie (yet great) instrumental music that pretty much makes up the soundtrack. While others might not really like this, I think it makes the movie stand out and avoid the over-the-top silliness that have caused many 80's comedies to become dated by today's standards. Don't get me wrong, I love those 80's movies, but "Risky Business" has a certain quality to it that takes on a more serious tone while also maintaining the fun element.  And finally, I have to say that the DVD transfer is absolutely horrific. Extras are virtually non-existent and image/sound quality is abysmal. 2003 has come and almost gone, so by now it's pointless to hope for a 20th Anniversary Special Edition DVD. So if you intend to buy this get it on VHS. I can't see why anyone would want the DVD other than for longevity's sake.
