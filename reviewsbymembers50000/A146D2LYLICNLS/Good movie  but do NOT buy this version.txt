 I realize that this isn't really a review of the movie per se, but I just had to warn potential buyers to wait until October 12 when a 2-disc Special Edition will be released. Do NOT buy this single disc edition! It has crappy bonus features, whereas the upcoming 2-disc version will surely have tons of great bonus material that will put this version to shame. I almost made the mistake of ordering this version. And to add the icing on the cake, the 2-disc edition will cost *LESS* than this edition.  And oh yeah, the movie itself is very cool. Dark, atmospheric and well acted, especially by Halle Berry (she's always great anyhow).
