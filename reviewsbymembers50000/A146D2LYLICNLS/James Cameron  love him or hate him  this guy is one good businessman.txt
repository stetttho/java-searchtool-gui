 "Titanic" is a marvel to behold on the grandest spectacle. No, really, it is. It's not a marvel because it's necessarily a terrific movie. I think it's a good movie, but not a masterpiece. Rather, it's a marvel because James Cameron knew how to successfully draw in virtually every single demographic group in existence to the theater and rake in the cash. You got Leonardo DiCaprio for the ladies, Kate Winslet for the guys, an epic film of great lenght for the rest of the movie-lovers out there, a 100+ year old actress for the older generation to reflect back on their own past loves, and the list goes on and on. A business move of pure genuis for James Cameron. "Titanic" was at the right place at the right time and Cameron knew it and capitalized. Sure, he alienated many former fans of his, the macho crowd who dug "Terminator" and the sort. But "Titanic" made him more money than I along with every other reviewer here will ever make in ther lifetime combined, so why not? I don't hold that against Cameron one bit. It's all business.  As for the merits of "Titanic" itself, it's a good movie if one doesn't mind overlooking the cliches and for-the-masses style of moviemaking. DiCaprio and Winslet are adequate although one can tell that they *know* they're all a part of Cameron's busine$$ scheme. Not that there's anything wrong with that. Heck, if I had the opportunity to star in this movie I would have done it too. You're all right, Leonardo.  I feel that I have no choice but to give "Titanic" 5 stars. Not for the movie, but for the marketing genuis that it represents. I'm buying this new 3-disc edition tomorrow because I simply can't resist. I didn't direct it, but oh my heavens, how I sure wish I had. So I'll just settle for the next best thing and admire it from the comfort of my average, everyday home. You hit the jackpot, James Cameron, and I hate/admire you for it.
