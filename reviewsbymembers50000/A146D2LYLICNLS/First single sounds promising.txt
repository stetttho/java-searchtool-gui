 "American Idiot," the first single off Green Day's upcoming new album, is a hint that they've gone back to their roots. This song could have easily been on their Insomniac album. It's pure punk-rock. And that's cool, because it's what Green Day does best. There's also some great drumming from Tre Cool. A really good song. Don't expect to hear anything too new, just good ol' Green Day.  This single has a b-side called "Too Much Too Soon" which is also a rocker, but has more of a fun feel to it. Very catchy. I would even say it's better than "American Idiot." CD also has an enhanced section with a link to a special website although I can't figure out exactly what's being offered there.  A recommended purchase, and for dirt cheap. Can't beat that with a stick. Good stuff.
