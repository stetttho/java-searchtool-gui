 While I generally tend to avoid book adaptations of movies (especially if I've already seen the movie) I thought I'd give "Catwoman" a shot. It seemed like a quick read and since I liked the movie, I figured why not. I ended up liking this book a lot. I had fun with it and I was entertained, and that is its purpose. No, it won't go down in history as a classic, nor will it win the Pulitzer Prize for Literature. But it's a fun read and serves as a nice companion to the movie. Elizabeth Hand has done a commendable job in transferring the feel of "Catwoman" into a novel. Recommended to any fan of the movie, or anyone who just wants some entertainment.
