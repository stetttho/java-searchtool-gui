 What can I say about this super-cool excellent movie that hasn't already been said? Not much, other than it's one of the classic "fun" movies from the 80's that's just as enjoyable today as it was when it was first released. You got everything here: action, adventure, romance, thrills, chills and most of all, a lot of FUN. Is it somewhat silly? Perhaps. Does one need to suspend their disbelief? Absolutely. But that's all part of the fun, and what makes it so great to watch. They just don't make movies like this anymore. I'm really glad to see that this great movie has gotten the DVD treatment it deserves, full of extras. My favorite has to be the Cyndi Lauper video of "The Goonies 'R' Good Enough." I just love the 80's "cheese" factor of it; what a guilty pleasure. A must-have movie for anyone who likes to just sit back and enjoy the ride. What a fun time those 80's were.
