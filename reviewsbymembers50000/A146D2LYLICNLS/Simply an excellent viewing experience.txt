 "Clash of the Titans" is a movie which I'll never get tired of, no matter how many times I've seen it. It just has it all: a great story, adventure, romance, excitement, mythology, and countless other qualities which make it such an enjoyable film to watch over and over again. One thing that especially stands out about "Clash of the Titans" is the special effects. I don't care what anyone says, no multi-million dollar CGI special effect can ever be as cool as the stop-motion special effects used in this movie. Some might say that it's dated. Well perhaps it is, but they did such a great job in creating the monsters (especially Medusa) that one can only marvel at them. And the fact that this movie is over 20 years old makes it even more impressive.  The DVD presentation isn't superb but it's definitely more than substantial. Image and sound quality have been improved quite a lot from the old video format. Bonus features are good but one can't help feeling that more could have been included, perhaps some deleted scenes. Still, this excellent movie finally being available on DVD is reason enough to be thrilled.
