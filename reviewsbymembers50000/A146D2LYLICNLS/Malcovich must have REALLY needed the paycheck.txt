 Although it's very difficult for me to give a bad review for any movie starring John Malcovich, I must make an exception for "Con Air." This is hands-down one of the most absurd, implausible "action" movies to ever exist. I can't see why an actor of Malcovich's caliber would lower himself to star in this movie. Even he can't save it despite his always-reliable performance.  "Con Air" is one of those movies that appeal to viewers who either have very low expectations in an action movie or are only interested in seeing things blowing up. But for those of you who want more, look elsewhere. What makes "Con Air" so bad? Here you go: -The premise of the movie is a plot hole. Nicholas Cage's character would have never been found guilty of killing that thug; he was clearly acting in self defense, outnumbered and protecting himself and his wife. When a plot hole is the foundation of a movie you know it's going nowhere. -One-dimensional, stereotypical bottom-of-the-barrel characters so vile that you end up not caring who lives or dies. -Cage's unconvincing, forced Southern accent. -A script so bad that it actually makes certain scenes funny, when I doubt that was the intention. -The final scene where Malcovich is killed is so over-the-top and ridiculous that you wonder if you're watching an action movie or a circus performance. I have no problem with suspending my disbelief, but come on. Don't waste your time, folks. If you want to see an action flick with Nicholas Cage watch "The Rock." While also formulatic, at least it has an intriguing plot, good acting, descent script and action sequences that don't insult your intelligence.
