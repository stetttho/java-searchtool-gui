 I'll admit that I own "Love and a .45" mainly because I'm a HUGE fan of Renee Zellweger and worship the ground she walks on. Not only is she beautiful but she has talent, and she proves that yet again in this "running-from-the-law" flick. She also proves that she can take on any type of role and be great in it, and her role in this movie almost takes a 180-degree turn from her typical roles in other movies.  But Renee isn't the only reason to own this movie. I was equally impressed with the performances of all the other actors. Some scenes, especially the violent ones, are somewhat over-the-top, but then again that's what makes this movie so fun to watch. And contrary to what many say I found the level of violence high but not excessive. This isn't only a "shoot 'em up" pointless movie; there's more than just stage blood. As for the DVD itself, bonus features are adequate but not overwhelming. I'm not too crazy about the letterbox format but at least the image and sound quality are good. All in all, a great movie for the fan of the "Pulp Fiction" style, or anyone who wants to see Renee Zellweger as a "bad girl." And get the soundtrack too!
