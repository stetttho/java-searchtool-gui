 Stellan Skarsgard and Diane Lane, two otherwise talented actors, completely embarass themselves in this absurd, trite and predictable "thriller" that turns out to be more of a comedy than anything else when all is said and done. Skarsgard and Lane play a wealthy couple who become the legal guardians of 2 teenagers when their parents are killed in a car crash. For some reason that is conveniently overlooked by the script, the fact that Skarsgard and Lane are 2 psychos is never realized by these parents, who have presumably known them for a long time. But of course, what place does logic have in this movie after all?  While the performances are all good, the actors can only do so much with the terrible script they're given to work with. Every plot "twist" can be seen coming a mile away. Some scenes even exceed the point of absurdity, case in point: when Skarsgard is able to take out an experienced police officer and then steal his gun. Go insult our intelligence somewhere else.  And what's with all the product placement? This probably earned the movie more revenue than box office sales. Shameless.   If there's any saving grace to this movie, it is Leelee Sobieski, although it's a shame that her breakout role was in this turkey. She deserves a script that equals her talent. But she is certainly nice to watch, especially the scene where she strips down to her 2-piece bathing suit revealing her bodicious, delicious, nutritious, I-want-some-of-that-icious body. But hey, when a movie has nothing else to offer it may as well cash in on sex appeal, right?  Rent this one first if you absolutely must see it.
