 What I've always liked about Sarah McLaghlan is that she's among the very few artists who are able to convey every aspect of music in a deep, heartfelt way, without relying on the superficial junk that so many other "artists" these days are prone to do. After many years she has finally released "Afterglow." I've just finished listening to it for the first time and all I can say is that Sarah has done it again. The overall atmosphere is mellow and warm. The lyrics are very poetic, although every album by Sarah has great lyrics. There isn't one track that I don't like. I would urge any fan of Sarah to buy "Afterglow." We need to continue supporting artists who make music that actually matters.
