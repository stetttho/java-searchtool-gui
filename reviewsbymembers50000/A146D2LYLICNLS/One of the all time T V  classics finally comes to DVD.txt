 I can't really say much more than what has already been said here about this excellent series other than it's one of the greatest super-hero television shows to ever grace the airwaves. Yes, it was campy and perhaps cheesy at times, but it was a lot of FUN to watch. Not to mention the fact that Lynda Carter was perfect for the role; it fit her like a glove. I remember watching the re-runs and enjoying every episode (I didn't watch its original run because I was still in diapers at that time)! And having this 3-disc DVD edition is every "Wonder Woman" fan's dream come true. Picture and sound quality are both superb, especially considering the show's age. The high point of the bonus material has to be Lynda Carter's commentary. She gives the viewer a great idea of what it was like to make the episodes. And she also has a lot of fun with it, making the viewer feel like they are watching it with her, unlike so many other commentaries out there where the viewer feels distanced because the person giving the commentary simply goes through the motions. Lynda's commentary is a welcome experience for anyone tired of stale, impersonal audio commentaries. My only complaint (and a very minor one at that) is the double-sided discs. I'm not too crazy about this idea, as it makes scratching them easier. But then again this was necessary to fit everything on to 3 discs (which in turn makes the price more affordable) so I can overlook it. Aside from that, this DVD package is outstanding. Wonder Woman rocks!
