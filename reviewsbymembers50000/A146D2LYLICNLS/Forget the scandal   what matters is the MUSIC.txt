 It has almost become a stigma to own this album and actually admit that one likes it. But I for one have no shame in saying that I think it's great. Yeah, yeah, we all know about the infamous scandal with Milli Vanilli. But should that be a valid reason for judging this album? Hardly. Listen to the new Britney Spears album: on some songs her voice is so digitally altered that she almost sounds like a robot. One could argue that she isn't really singing on her album either. And there are plenty more artists out there who fall into the same category.  For the most part, Girl You Know It's True is a fantastic listen. The songs are well composed and have a great vibe. From a lyrical standpoint it's nothing profound, but then again this music is to make one feel good, not to convey life-changing deep messages. Take it for what it is. The most memorable songs are of course the hits like the title cut and "Blame It On The Rain." But there are many other gems as well, such as the nice ballad "I'm Gonna Miss You" and the funky "All Or Nothing." I didn't give it 5 stars because a few songs just aren't as memorable as the other stronger ones. But taken as a whole, Girl You Know It's True is a great listen. An album that will go down in history for all the wrong reasons. But that doesn't take away from what matters most: the music.
