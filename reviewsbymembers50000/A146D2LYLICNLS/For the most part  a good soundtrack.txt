 All in all, I think this soundtrack captures the feel of the movie well. "Pure Shores" by All Saints is definitely the most "poppy" song but it works nicely with the whole tropical atmosphere of the movie. I found myself liking songs which I didn't think I would, for example, Sugar Ray's take on "Spinning Away." Only a few songs didn't grab my attention, or maybe they just work better when listened to while watching the movie, and don't make the same impact when heard by themselves. One song that would have been *perfect* for this movie (although admittedly out of place) is Toad The Wet Sprocket's "Walk On The Ocean." In any event, this is a fun soundtrack to play while driving or simply sitting alone. And you don't even have to like the movie to enjoy it.
