 I love Gwen Stefani and I love No Doubt, but I was let down by this solo effort. No, I wasn't expecting a carbon-copy of a No Doubt album. And no, I don't have a problem with Gwen making an eclectic album. But as a whole, this didn't do much for me. "What You Waiting For?" is a great song, no question about it. "Cool" is also good, with that 80's synth section. And "Danger Zone" is worth a listen. But unfortunately I found myself pressing the Skip button during the other songs. Believe me, I get no pleasure from giving this album only 3 stars. But then again, I'm not the type of fan who goes around blindly throwing out 5-star reviews left and right.  Bottom line: this album is mainly for No Doubt/Gwen Stefani die-hard fans. For the casual fan, I advise you to save your money and spend it on the next No Doubt album instead. For now, just get the single of "What You Waiting For?" It has some great remixes and the video. That's really all you need.  Gwen Stefani certainly has the talent to make an outstanding solo album, but she missed the target with this one.
