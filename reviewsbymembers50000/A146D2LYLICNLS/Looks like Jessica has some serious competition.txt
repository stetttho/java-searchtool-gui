 Ashlee Simpson's first single "Pieces Of Me" is definitely something one would have never expected from the sister of Jessica Simpson, and that's a GOOD thing. I'm not bashing Jessica's music, but it's just too "fluffy" for me, typical teeny-bopper stuff. But Ashlee has a much more refined and mature sound, both lyrically and musically. I also get this impression going by the few interviews I've seen with her. She just seems very level-headed and mature. I'm sure it's difficult for her (at least for now) to live in Jessica's shadow, but if Ashlee's full-lenght album is as good as "Pieces Of Me," Jessica might have some major competition.  I would describe Ashlee's style as somewhat resembling Michelle Branch. It may not be groundbreaking but it's certainly catchy and fun to listen to. Can't go wrong with that. I really look forward to her first album. She's definitely a welcome addition to the music scene.
