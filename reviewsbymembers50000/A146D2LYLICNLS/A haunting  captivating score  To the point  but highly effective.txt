I would describe the music as haunting, gripping, subtle and chilling. Basically, what one would expect from a score of this genre. Although there are no real surprises, the music gets the job done of creating the perfect atmosphere for the film. Many songs start off softly and slowly build up. I don't give it 5 stars for the simple fact that it's somewhat predictable. But I'll reiterate that as a whole, it's worth getting if you're into this type of score.   Long live Jennifer Connelly.
