 Diana DeGarmo's first single release shows promise. She is still very young and therefore hasn't yet established her own style and identity as a singer. Nothing wrong with that...it's the same way for most singers her age. That's why many people are saying that this single sounds "generic." I would agree somewhat, and I would also agree that she needs to work on her lower registers. But I can definitely see Diana's talent and know that she will improve greatly in the near future and will then show what she's capable of. Give her time. And I really do like these 3 songs, especially "Dreams." Looking forward to her full-lenght album.
