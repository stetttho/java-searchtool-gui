One thing that has always been true about Cyndi Lauper is that she will go out of her way to give her fans a great live show, regardless of whether she's performing at a small record store for free or at a sold-out major event concert. The location and number of people attending doesn't matter...Cyndi gives everything she's got when she performs live. And this new DVD "Live At Last," recorded at her March 11, 2004 gig at The Town Hall in New York, is certainly no exception. This DVD will surely satisfy both long-time fans as well as those who have only recently discovered Cyndi's music with her most recent album "At Last," as the track listing (see above) contains songs from both her old-school catalog as well as her renditions of the classics. I certainly appreciate her newer stuff but to me, the best part of this concert is hearing and seeing her perform her trademark songs such as the beautiful "Time After Time" and my personal favorite, "I Drove All Night." These songs may have been written a long time ago, but Cyndi proves with this concert that time certainly has not taken away any of the magic that made them so great.  There are also some great bonus features, a lot more substantial than what most concert DVD's offer: Stay Music Video  Forest Park  Driving With Cyndi  Sunday Dinner  Broad Channel  Shoot It Yourself! with Cyndi and Kevin  Alternate Angles  Discography All in all, a must-have for any Cyndi Lauper fan, even the casual one. And for the price that it's offered here you would be crazy not to buy it.
