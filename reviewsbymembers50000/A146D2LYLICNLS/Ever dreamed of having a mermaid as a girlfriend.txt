 "Splash" is without a doubt among the top romantic comedies of the 80's that has truly stood the test of time and is still as enjoyable today as it was back then. I actually saw this movie when it was first released, which is rare for me since I was only a kid back in the 80's and hardly saw any movies in the theater in those days. I first bought it on VHS, eventually upgraded to the bare-bones DVD, and now have upgraded yet again to this 20th Anniversary Edition DVD. I just can't get enough of this movie.  Both Tom Hanks and Daryl Hannah have excellent chemistry together and make a great screen couple. What's also believable in this movie is Daryl Hannah's mermaid costume, which looks so authentic that one almost believes she's really a mermaid. And let's not forget the movie's ending, which is absolutely perfect. There's one thing about this movie that I've never understood though: how did it ever manage to escape a PG-13 rating? In the scene where Daryl Hannah arrives at the Statue of Liberty buck naked we get to see quite a substantial (and may I add, very nice) shot of her buns. Definitely not material for a PG rated movie. In any event, I guess that will always be a mystery.  All in all, "Splash" is a true classic film that never gets old no matter how many times one sees it. Everyone is great to watch, including hilarious supporting roles by the late John Candy (R.I.P.) and Eugene Levy. Now if only they would release a special edition DVD of "Big," another Tom Hanks classic.
