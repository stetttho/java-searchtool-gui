 I was in my Junior year at college when Gina G.'s "Fresh" album was released and the single "Ooh aah...Just A Little Bit" began getting radio airplay and became a hit. I remember instantly liking it for its catchy groove and great melody. There are many songs that bring back good memories of my college days, and "Ooh Aah...Just A Little Bit" is definitely on that list. As for the "Fresh" album itself, I would rate it a solid 4 out of 5. Several of the songs including "Rhythm Of My Life" and "I Belong To You" are just as catchy as "Ooh aah...Just A Little Bit" and have that same energy to get you going. There are also slower-tempo ballads like "Ti Amo" which are also effective. But I found the last song, a different version of "Ooh Aah...Just A Little Bit" to be completely pointless and even tedious to listen to. It repeats itself with the same monotonous structure over and over again, practically throughout the whole song. And being the longest song at almost 7 minutes doesn't help matters. It's a far cry from the original version. Swapping it for a couple of other songs would have been a much wiser move. The other minor complaint I have with "Fresh" is with the production. It doesn't have that spacial, dynamic, crystal-clear sound that other dance albums have (to get an idea of what I mean listen to La Bouche's "Sweet Dreams" and hear how the vocals and music jump out at you and pull you in). Unfortunately "Fresh" suffers from less-than-ideal production, making the songs sound a little "muddy" and thin. This isn't to say that the production is horrible. But for a dance album to achieve its full effect the production must be polished. But flaws put aside, "Fresh" is a great album to make you feel good and put you in a good mood. So the lyrics might be a little cliched...dance music isn't exactly known for deep, profound lyrics anyway. So put "Fresh" in the CD player and get the vibe!
