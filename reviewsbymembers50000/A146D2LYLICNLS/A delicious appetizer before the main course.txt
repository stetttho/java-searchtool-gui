 While it's impossible to please every fan when releasing a greatest hits or "best of" album, this one is truly an outstanding collection of Sophie B. Hawkins's songs from her first 2 albums, including the rare "The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down." My only complaint is the last track, a god-awful remix of "As I Lay Me Down." It says that Joe "The Butcher" Nicolo was responsible for this one. Well his nickname is certainly appropriate, because he has in fact butchered it. If I were the one in charge of this album I would have tossed that turkey and included "Savior Child" or "Carry Me" from Sophie's Tongues and Tails album instead.   If you're brand new to Sophie B. Hawkins, this is by far the best place to start with. BUT DON'T STOP HERE. Let this album be your appetizer, but make sure you also get the main course: ALL of her albums, as many singles as you can find, her The Cream Will Rise DVD, and whatever else you can get your hands on that reads the name Sophie B. Hawkins. Whatever this woman touches turns to gold. One question I would like to ask her if I ever had the chance to meet her (other than if she would be the mother of my children) is, how does she do it time and time again?   Simply great stuff.
