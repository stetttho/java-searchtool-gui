 It's hard to believe that I was in my early teens when "The Golden Girls" began airing. And what may be even harder to believe for some of you is that it was my favorite show. As a teenage male, I was at the complete opposite end of the demographic spectrum as the target audience for this show. And yet I loved it. There you have it.  Being a 29 year old man now, I'm probably still at the end of the target audience demographic spectrum, but I still love it and enjoy watching the reruns on T.V. And now that Season 1 is on DVD, what could be better?   5 stars all the way.
