 After seeing both the movie adaptation starring Leonardo DiCaprio as well as reading this novel, I've become a fan of "The Beach." While the movie has its few good points, it changes the plot too much to live up to this novel. So anyone looking to experience this story should first read this book and then see the film only as a supplement.  That out of the way, I found this novel by Alex Garland to be a worthwhile read. This is one of those books that have the best effect when read in one sitting. I can just picture someone reading it on a long flight and wishing they were going to Thailand instead of wherever else they were headed to. Ok, maybe that's pushing it a little, but this is one fun read. I can agree with other people's opinions that this book is a commentary on Western culture and Generation-X for the most part, but IMO one shouldn't take it *that* seriously. Just let yourself get into the story and enjoy the ride.  This novel isn't without some flaws though. I found Garland's writing style to be rather choppy for the most part. I can't quite put my finger on it, but there seems to be just too many chapter breaks. It would have worked if Garland had made each mini-chapter flow into the following one. But unfortunately it doesn't always happen this way, and as a result the book sometimes feels like reading someone's diary rather than a novel. My only other gripe is the skimpy character development. I just couldn't bring myself to completely get absorbed in any of the characters, and maybe this is the primary reason why this novel didn't "change my life" as it seems to have done for others here. But that's fine. I still enjoyed it and look forward to reading it multiple times. As I said, you should also check out the movie adaptation (Tilda Swinton turns in a GREAT performance as Sal). But overall, the cliche that "the book was better" holds true for "The Beach." Recommended reading.
