 I've always been a fan of both Tim Burton and Danny Elfman and have really enjoyed their work. Elfman's music is always so perfect for Burton's films: eerie, highly original, quirky yet beautiful in its own way. Not everyone's cup of tea, but those who appreciate it will definitely see its value. And this soundtrack to "Big Fish" is no exception. Yet again, Elfman has composed music that perfectly complements the visual surrealism that Burton is known for.  But unfortunately there is one flaw with this soundtrack, and that is a lack of continuity, making it rather disjointed. Specifically, I'm referring to tracks 1-7. The first track, Pearl Jam's "Man of the Hour" is a great song and I have no trouble with it being on the soundtrack. But until track 8 (where Elfman's music actually begins) we have a total mixed bag of music. I'm not saying that these songs are bad. But while they may have been effective in the movie, they really don't fit in with Elfman's music. It's as if the soundtrack doesn't know what it wants to be during this time, and only settles down and becomes consistent at track 8. And since Danny Elfman's music is the strong point of a Tim Burton film soundtrack, this somewhat takes away from the overall effect of his music. But that is my only gripe. I absolutely love the music from track 8 to the very end (and as I said, the new Pearl Jam song is great). I don't think that this soundtrack rivals some of Elfman's earlier work (ie: "Edward Scissorhands" and "The Nightmare Before Christmas") but it's definitely almost as good.
