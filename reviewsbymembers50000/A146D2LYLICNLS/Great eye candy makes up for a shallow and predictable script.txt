 "Into the Blue" met my expectations, but only because I walked into the theater with realistic ones. One can tell by the trailer that this isn't really a great movie. But it is adequate. And can you really give a bad review to a movie that has Jessica Alba either in a bikini or tight shorts and a tight tanktop for 80% of the time? I certainly could not.  And that's where the eye candy comes in, which is this movie's best asset. Eye candy in terms of the sex appeal of the leading characters, but also the excellent shots of the island, especially the underwater scenes. The underwater action sequences and footage is nothing short of impressive. One warning though: the shark attack scenes are quite graphic and explicit, on the same level of goriness as the shark attack scene in "The Beach." Those who are overly squeamish are advised to look the other way during these scenes. But don't let that stop you from seeing the movie...there are only a couple of them.  I would recommend "Into the Blue" to: -any Jessica Alba fan -any moviegoer who doesn't mind putting their brain on neutral and enjoying the ride -fans of underwater action flicks  Not a must-see, but entertaining for what it is.
