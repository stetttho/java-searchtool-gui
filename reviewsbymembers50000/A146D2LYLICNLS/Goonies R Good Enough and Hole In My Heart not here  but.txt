 Well this compilation album is certainly a must-have for any Cyndi Lauper fan, and it's definitely a great place to start if you're a novice fan who wants to get a flavor of her music. While only one song from her highly overlooked A Night To Remember album is here, I suppose that can be forgiven. After all, this IS a collection of her most well-known songs.  It would have been great if "The Goonies 'R' Good Enough" had been included on this album, but you can find that song on the other greatest hits collections here at Amazon. Easy enough. And then there's "Hole In My Heart (All The Way To China)." Another classic song not included here. But it can be found as a bonus track on the Japanese version of A Night To Remember, as well as a 3" CD single (very rare but not impossible to obtain). You might also want to check out the VHS or DVD of "12 Deadly Cyns."
