 Just thought I'd tack on another 5-star review for this awesome show. I've been hooked on "House" from the very beginning. I can't get enough of this show. What makes it so good? Probably a combination of what others have already mentioned...the writing, the acting, the medical conditions House must diagnose and treat, etc. I can't think of one single dull episode.   Of course, the best thing about this show is the performance of Hugh Laurie. He blends a perfect balance of sarcasm and compassion to his character. In every episode we see his genuine concern for the well-being of his patients, despite his often caustic and bitter attitude. He's a character facing many inner conflicts, and that's what makes him real. Although many of us don't understand a lot of the medical terminology used, we understand his motivations for doing what he does, even if it means going against the grain of the other doctors' opinions.  All in all a terrific show. I hope it's around for many, many seasons. I'll be the first in line to get this DVD set. Let's hope there's some good bonus material.
