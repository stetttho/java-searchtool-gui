 Finally, a romantic comedy without all the excessive fluff and sap. I think "Just Like Heaven" will be remembered in the future as one of the better romantic comedies to have come out of Hollywood in quite some time. While the plot and concept aren't anything new, this movie strikes almost all the right notes. After all, it's not about the ending but the destination to get there.   We all know how it's going to end...how about focusing more on what makes the movie what it is rather than saying "it was too predictable." And I also don't understand some of the complaints here about the plot inconsistencies regarding Reese Witherspoon's character passing through certain solid objects and not others. So what? Ever heard of "just going along with it?" And these same people are comparing this movie to "Ghost." Well guess what folks? In that movie Patrick Swayze can pass through doors and other people and yet doesn't fall through stairs or floors either. Why don't YOU try to make a film with a ghost character whose ability to pass through and not pass through certain objects remains consistent throughout the entire film? Ok, I'm down from my soapbox. Sorry, but some criticisms are just too trivial to be ignored.  But getting back to "Just Like Heaven," what holds this movie together is definitely the performances of Witherspoon and Ruffalo, as well as their excellent chemistry. I've always considered Reese Witherspoon to be a talented actress, and unlike films such as "Legally Blonde" that didn't give her talent a chance to shine through, "Just Like Heaven" does. It may not be the most challenging role she'll ever have, but she pulls it off nicely. Recommended!
