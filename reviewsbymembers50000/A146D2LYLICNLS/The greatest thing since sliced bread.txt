 I echo the statements of all the other reviews here. "Wonderfalls" has to be the most original, fun and exciting show to grace the airwaves in a LONG time. It's nothing short of a tragedy that this excellent show got pulled off the air while mind-numbing garbage (basically 90% of what's on T.V. these days) continues to be popular and overstays its welcome season after season.   But hey, us fans of "Wonderfalls" will now be treated to all the episodes (aired as well as unaired) on this DVD box set. Can't get any better than that. I'll be first in line to get my copy. I hope there will be some bonus material too. If anyone has the inside scoop on that please post!  Long live "Wonderfalls."
