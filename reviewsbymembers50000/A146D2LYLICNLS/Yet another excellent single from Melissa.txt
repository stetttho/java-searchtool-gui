 "Taste You," Melissa Auf der Maur's third single from her self-titled album, is easily just as good as the previous 2 singles. Although this one does not contain an enhanced section with videos, it offers 2 b-sides instead of only 1. The first, "Sargeant Politeness," is a Failure cover recorded live at The Troubadour in Los Angeles. This is the gem of this single. GREAT song with superb sound quality. Melissa & Co. do a fantastic job covering it. The second b-side, "You Could Ice Skate To This," takes a 180-degree turn and mellows things down using only acoustic guitars (the song title hints at this anyway so it's no surprise). A great song as well, nice to chill out to.  If you own the "Followed The Waves" and "Real A Lie" singles, you will not be disappointed with this one. If you don't own those 2, buy them NOW in addition to this one. Melissa Auf der Maur is one of those rare artists whose singles are just as good as the full-lenght album.
