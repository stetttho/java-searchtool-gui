 When I was in High School I would watch each new episode of "The Wonder Years" and always be moved in the show's honest, down-to-earth portrayal of the pains and joys of growing up and becoming an adult in this world. This has to be hands-down the greatest coming-of-age T.V. show in history. To me, what made it so excellent were the characters whom we could relate to, unlike so many other shows where the characters are one-dimensional cardboard cutouts. Not "The Wonder Years." This show had heart, with characters we could connect to and say "yeah, I've been there and feel your pain" or "those were good times, weren't they?" And having Kevin as an adult do the narrating added to the whole nostalgic feeling of the show. I remember watching the final episode and being completely moved, in a way that I've never been moved after watching a television show. I could write forever about how good this show was. As with the other reviewers here, I would be one happy person if this show was released on DVD. Even if it didn't contain one single bonus feature I would still be thrilled, as just having these episodes to own forever would be good enough for me (although I do of course hope that at least some bonus material is included). Please, studio execs, GET THIS SUPERB SHOW ON DVD!
