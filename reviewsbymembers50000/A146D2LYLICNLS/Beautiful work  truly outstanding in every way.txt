 Up until now I would have considered myself a mere casual fan of John Frusciante. Up until now I would have said that his most interesting work was with The Red Hot Chili Peppers. I own Niandra Lades & Usually Just a T-Shirt and To Record Only Water For Ten Days and like both, although I admit to only having given them a passing listen. But after listening to Shadows Collide With People, I have discovered this man's musical genius. I'm now inspired to listen to his other albums again and discover even more greatness, things which I probably missed before or simply went over my head. But getting back to Shadows Collide With People, there isn't one song that doesn't totally captivate you. I've never heard music like this before. How does this guy do it? It's almost impossible to choose a favorite song but I would have to go with "Regret." While short, it's one of the most beautifully haunting songs I've ever heard, not to mention some excellent vocal effects. There are no filler songs on this album. John has poured his heart into this work, and each song reflects that. In a world where by-the-numbers, stale, uninspiring factory processed music has inundated our ears, it's so refreshing to see that there are still musicians like John out there who can offer us something challenging and original. Is he unorthodox in his songwriting? Perhaps. Will any of these songs become a Top-40 hit? Doubtful. But that means nothing. Let the music speak for itself. Buy this album and let yourself be immersed.
