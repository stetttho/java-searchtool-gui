 Some soundtracks hold their own weight both in a movie as well as when listened to by themselves. Unfortunately, "Aeon Flux" isn't one of them. I've enjoyed the music of Graeme Revell in other soundtracks, but this one was a chore to get through, even if it was perfect for the movie.   You have to be a VERY big fan of this genre of music to sit through the entire album, and even then I can't see too many people giving it multiple listens. It's not bad music; don't misunderstand me. It's just, well, rather bizarre. Again, it worked fine in the movie with all the visuals. But alone, it loses a lot of its momentum and comes across as flat.  But on the plus side, the inside booklet has some very sexy photos of Charlize Theron. I'm tempted to say that this is worth the price of admission.
