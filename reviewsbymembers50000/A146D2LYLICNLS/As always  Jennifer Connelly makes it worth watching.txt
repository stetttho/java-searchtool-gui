 Roger Ebert recently said that Jennifer Connelly needs to "lighten up" in terms of what roles she's been choosing, as she has played one unstable and depressed character after another lately (ie: "House of Sand and Fog"). But I think Ebert's comment is unfounded, because this type of role is what Jennifer Connelly excels at. She's one of the VERY rare actresses in Hollywood who has pure talent in addition to being beautiful. I admire the fact that she has been choosing roles that showcase her abilities rather than going the easy way and starring in movies that will gross millions of dollars but limit her acting to "looking pretty for the camera" and not much else.  "Dark Water" is the latest example of Jennifer Connelly's superb acting and ability to fully become the character she is playing, in this case a troubled mother still dealing with her own abusive childhood. This movie is much more of a psychological thriller than a "slasher" thriller, although that's pretty obvious going by the trailer. The isolated, ugly and dreary apartment complex adds nicely to the overall gloomy feel of the film. And of course there's the dark water which appears virtually everywhere: on the ceiling, in the toilet, even in the washing machine. I admit that it was slightly overdone, but it doesn't take away from the movie either. Another thing worth mentioning is the music, which perfectly captures the tone of the movie. I recommend getting the soundtrack score.  I don't give "Dark Water" 5 stars because it borrows a little too much from other films such as "The Ring" which other reviewers have mentioned. I also found the ending to be too "cookie-cutter" and safe. There were no real surprises. A nice unexpected plot twist would have turned this into a truly great film. But I've said it before and I'll say it again: Jennifer Connelly makes it worth seeing. Can't wait for the DVD.
