 One thing I've always loved about movies from the 80's is the carefree fun element they had, making them so great to watch over and over again. Not that current movies aren't fun to watch. But most people who look back on the 80's will probably know what I mean in how they have a certain distinctive quality to them. Well enough nostalgia. "Vibes," while made in the late 80's, certainly has all the great qualities that define movies from that decade. Cyndi Lauper and Jeff Goldblum star in the main roles as psychics who are conned by a stranger (Peter Falk) to travel to Ecuador in order to use their special abilities to help locate his missing son, only to find out once they arrive that they're really there to help locate a mysterious lost treasure with amazing powers. From there on it's a race against the bad guys to find this treasure, with many adventures along the way.  This movie never drags or gets boring. Cyndi and Jeff have great chemistry together and do a nice job of playing their roles. I could have done without having to hear Cyndi use profanity (I'm a huge fan of hers but I believe that swearing is NOT a requirement for a movie, regardless of who's the one saying it). But fortunately it only happens once or twice so I suppose it can be overlooked.  All in all, I think "Vibes" would make a great addition to anyone's movie collection. While not necessarily among the greatest films of the 80's IMO, it definitely holds its own weight and entertains. It's a shame that it's out-of-print but maybe it will be re-released someday, perhaps also on DVD.
