 "Monkeybone" is one of those movies that come and go without much attention and pretty much slip into obscurity shortly after they're released, even if they contain a well-known cast. The subject matter is what kills any chance of making big bucks at the box office or becoming a movie that everyone will have heard of afterwards. Still, "Monkeybone" is a hidden treat for any fan of the twisted, brainless and silly comedy.  This movie reminds me a lot of Adam Sandler's "Little Nicky," and I think others who have seen both films would agree. But "Monkeybone" is much less crude and vulgar, and instead of CGI uses stop-motion special effects, which are quite good. The animation for the character of Monkeybone is definitely one of the high points of this movie, and give it a unique flavor.   I consider myself only a casual fan of Brendan Fraser, so IMO this movie would have worked just as well with any other actor capable of taking on this type of role. Not to knock Fraser though...his performance is certainly good. And a great supporting cast adds to the fun, including Whoopi Goldberg (proving yet again that she really is a jack-of-all-trades actress) and Rose McGowan, who looks mighty fine in her skimpy cat outfit.  As for the DVD itself, there's nothing to complain about. Great sound and image as well as bonus features that surpass anyone's expectations for this type of movie, including 11 extended scenes, an alternate ending and 7 features on the animation process. I haven't given a sypnosis of the plot only because the Amazon review already does a great job of that, but I'll just say that "Monkeybone" is a nice treat to spend a lazy Saturday afternoon with, if one doesn't mind putting their brain on neutral.
