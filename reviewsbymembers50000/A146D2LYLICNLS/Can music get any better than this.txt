 Simply put, Siamese Dream may very well be the greatest alternative/rock album ever released. And if it's not, it's pretty darn close. I knew that the Smashing Pumpkins would become huge the first time I heard "Cherub Rock," the song that launched them into stardom and the mainstream. It was fresh, innovative and original, yet highly accessible. The Pumpkins would go on to make lots of more great music, but in my opinion this album is and always will be their greatest achievement. It's one of those albums that is deservedly hyped up for all the right reasons.  Where does one even begin when talking about the songs? Let's just say that every song on Siamese Dream takes the listener on a great journey, a place where they will want to return to time and time again. These songs cover just about every human emotion possible, done in such an artistic way. My personal favorites are "Quiet," "Disarm" and "Mayonaise." There really are no filler songs. The ones that didn't become singles such as "Luna" and "Soma" may not be as memorable as the others, but they are far from filler status. There's just something magical about Siamese Dream, from Billy Corgan's emotional singing to D'Arcy's powerful bass to Jimmy Chamberlain's superb drumming to James Iha's wacky guitar solos (and I mean "wacky" in a good way). All 4 band members work together in a way that makes the final product so beautiful and awesome. This album will surely go down in history as being one of the greatest.
