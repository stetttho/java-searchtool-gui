 I really don't know what to make of this movie. It's kind of like a combination of an ultra-cool eye candy spectacle mixed with the world's worst acid trip. Not that I've ever done acid, but I think this is what it must be like.   Comparisons to "Aeon Flux" are inevitable, and the two movies do share a lot in common. Both rely on the sex appeal of the female leads. Both are set in a futuristic metropolis-like world where the heroine must battle all sorts of baddies. Both contain strange looking devices, gadgets and other items only found in this type of film. But I found "Aeon Flux" to be a little more cohesive in its script; "Ultraviolet" goes all over the place with little flow in the plot. And the mind-numbingly bad dialog doesn't help it.  But it does have its good points. This has to be one of the coolest-looking movies I've ever seen. Very short on substance, yes, but visually awesome. And what's not to like about Milla Jovovich? Cameron Bright turns in a fairly standard performance as a kid whose only name is Six. Come to think of it, his performance in this movie is pretty much a carbon-copy of his role in "Birth," with that I-know-something-about-you blank stare of his that seems to be becoming his trademark acting style.  All in all, "Ultraviolet" isn't a bad movie, nor is it a particularly good one either. But its eye candy makes up for what it lacks in a plot and characters one can care about. Worth seeing on the big screen, but at a matinee price.
