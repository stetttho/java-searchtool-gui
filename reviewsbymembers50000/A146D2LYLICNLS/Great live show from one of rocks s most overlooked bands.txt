 Finally, a live CD from Toad the Wet Sprocket. It's about time! And it surely doesn't disappoint. This band never got half the credit or recognition they deserved. But this CD is one treat for those of us who were fortunate enough to follow them throughout the years. My only complaint is that "Good Intentions" is not here. But that's all right. The outstanding quality of the album as a whole speaks for itself, and is reason enough to get this. If you're new to Toad the Wet Sprocket, I would recommend getting their studio albums first and then picking up this one. And for the long-time fan, get this NOW. Toad may be no more, but they sure left behind some great music.
