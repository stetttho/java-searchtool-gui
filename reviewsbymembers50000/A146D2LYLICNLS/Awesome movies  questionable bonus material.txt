 I wasn't going to review this DVD trilogy but what the heck, you only live once.  There's no point in talking about the merits of these 3 movies. I along with the majority of planet Earth love them, let's leave it at that. Nor will I go into the 4 billionth discussion about these "Special Editions" vs. the originals. I personally do not care all that much about what Lucas has changed or added. Sorry purists, but I just don't see this as significant as the Second Coming of Christ like you do. Having said that, I do agree with the one-star reviews about this only being the first in a probable series of "Star Wars" box sets, making us buy them over and over again. One can easily see this by the bonus materials. We all know that there is plenty of other stuff that *could have been* included here, such as deleted scenes (which anyone who even casually searches the Web for knows exist). This just reeks of an "Extra Super Duper Mega Deluxe Edition" in the future that will contain all this. So in a way this trilogy is a rip-off to some extent. I have never bought "Star Wars" on video nor laserdisc, whether it be the originals or Special Editions. So this DVD trilogy is my first official purchase. I guess people in my shoes won't get *as much* ripped off as others in that sense. Honestly, I find it better than going to eBay to hunt down the originals on video and probably end up spending more than I would on this DVD trilogy. And I would have to buy the videos again eventually anyway, as that format deteriorates over time. It all evens out in the wash.
