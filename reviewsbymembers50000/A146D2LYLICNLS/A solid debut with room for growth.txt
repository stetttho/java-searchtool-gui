 After a lot of hype and anticipation Ashlee Simpson is out with her debut album Autobiography. Anyone who has been following Ashlee knows that her musical style differs from her sister Jessica's in that she is more Rock/Pop and even a little bit of Punk thrown in. So does Autobiography deliver? I would say that for the most part it does.    The majority of the album follows in the footsteps of "Pieces Of Me," with songs such as "Love Makes The World Go Round" and "Better Off" having the same high-energy power pop feel to them. IMO this is where Ashlee is strongest, both musically and lyrically. "Giving It All Away" is an excellent song and has become my favorite on the album. I don't care much for "LaLa," where Ashlee tries her hand at punk-rock. I just don't think this songs works, and ends up out of place on the album. It's as if Ashlee is exploring territory which she's not too comfortable (yet) with. But that's just me...others might like it. I also don't care for "Unreachable" as it sounds rather bland. But those are my only complaints. The rest of the album is solid. Not groundbreaking but definitely catchy and fun to listen to.    One criticism of Ashlee has been that she isn't among the strongest singers out there. I would agree somewhat with that, although I would much rather listen to Ashlee sing with the imperfections and vulnerabilities in her voice than listen to people like Britney Spears who digitally alter their voice so much that they end up sounding like a robot on many of their songs. Ashlee's voice may not be among the best out there but it's *genuine*, and that makes her songs real. And she isn't a bad singer by any means.    All in all, I would recommend Autobiography for anyone who likes "Pieces Of Me" and wants to hear more of what Ashlee has to offer. It's not a perfect album and she has room for growth and improvement, but considering that it's her debut effort it's pretty good.
