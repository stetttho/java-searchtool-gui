 If you're new to the music of Skye Sweetnam, I strongly advise you to not buy this single. "Tangled Up In Me" is a good song but it's far from being the best cut on her full-lenght album Noise From the Basement. Also, the 2 non-released tracks here, "Too Late" and "Tidal Wave," are substandard, dull and do NOT represent Skye's talent. Only get this single if you already have Noise From the Basement and must own every song that Skye has put out.  Don't judge Skye by this single. She's capable of a LOT more.
