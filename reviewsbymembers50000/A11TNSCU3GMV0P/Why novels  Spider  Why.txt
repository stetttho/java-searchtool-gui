 The Callahan's short stories have always been among my favorites -- they're funny, uplifting, clever and sometimes deeply moving. Spider Robinson has written a wide variety of other short stories that are also intelligent and witty.  Unfortunately, none of the Callahan's novels are particularly good; it wasn't fun when Heinlein went off for a hundred-odd consecutive pages about how cool his characters were, and at this point that's what the Callahan's novels have degraded into.  The plot here is that Jake's new bar in Key West has been targeted by Tony Donuts, Jr., the son of an unmemorable villain from one of the Lady Sally books. They come up with this silly, over-elaborate plan to get Tony's mobster boss to whack him, focused on the time travel powers of Jake's irritating precocious daughter. The subplot also revolves around said daughter, as a Child Protection agent shows up, a bizarre cariacture of conformity who's identical to (and turns out to be related to) the bizarre cariactures of conformity that got Jake's previous bar shut down.  After a long sequence of Robinson trying and failing to write a sci-fi Carl Hiaasen novel, there's a wholly manufactured crisis that has nothing to do with the previous story -- because every Callahan's novel has to end with a repeat of the super-empath sequence from "The Mick of Time."  Save yourself some tsuris and go re-read the original stories -- or pick up one of Robinson's compilations of short stories, such as By Any Other Name. That's where he really shows his strength.
