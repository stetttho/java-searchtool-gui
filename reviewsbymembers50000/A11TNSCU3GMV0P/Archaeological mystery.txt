 I usually can't read fantasy, because I can't suspend my disbelief enough to accept what I'm being told.  Elves, magic, dragons, all that's fine; what I can't believe are the ridiculous societies and implausible politics that too many fantasy authors fall back on. I loved City of Bones because it presented me with a society that worked coherently, drew sensible conclusions from the information presented to the reader, and provided an archaeological mystery which the reader can try to solve right along with the characters (which is a HUGE plus in ANY novel, as Ellery Queen readers can attest). Perhaps I overintellectualize, but the point remains that I'm definitely going to look for Wells' other books now.  That's the only recommendation that really matters in the end.
