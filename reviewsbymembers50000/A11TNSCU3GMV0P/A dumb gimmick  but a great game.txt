 Generally, seeing Mario's picture on a game is an indicator that you'll get a technically excellent game that won't show a lot of creativity ... Mario games are among the best in any genre, but they don't add much to the genre.  Paper Mario is an exception. It's a very innovative RPG, expanding on the "action combat RPG" concept from the SNES Super Mario RPG. Fighting is conducted on a typical RPG combat screen, but Mario can both power up his moves and deflect his opponents' through skillful timing. This lets them run an amazingly tight difficulty curve -- this is the only RPG I've ever played where gaining a single hit point can make a noticeable difference in your power level.  The game's writing is typical for Nintendo -- kid-appropriate but not boring for adults, with some sly humor at the expense of its characters. While for the most part it's a cute cartoon, there are moments of real fear and wonder.  The "paper" bit is the only downside, and it's not much of one. Really, it's just a silly gimmick that Mario and his friends are animated as cardboard cutouts, and adds little to the gameplay aside from the occasional visual joke. It acts as a separator, making it harder for the player to relate to the character ... not that that would have been terribly likely anyway.
