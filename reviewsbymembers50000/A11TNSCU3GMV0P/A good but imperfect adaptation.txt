 The first thing to keep in mind is that the book was aimed at "ages 7 to 77," as the old slogan went, but the movie is aimed at ages 7 to 10, maybe, with only a few nods towards anyone older than that.  This is still a terrific film for its intended age group. It's not perfect; a few too many times thoughtful solutions to problems from the book were replaced with slapstick, the film stops dead every time it hits a song, and the ending was radically changed -- and that last was a huge, gasping mistake, because it removes the original story's catharsis. On the other hand, some of the visualizations are wonderful; the Lethargians and Digitopolis are drawn with wonderful insight.  I'd advise, though, presenting this movie to children as a companion to the book after they've already read it, not as a replacement and not by itself.  Additional note: freed from the yoke of established characters, Chuck Jones absolutely let his imagination run free here, the result sometimes approaching Tim Burton levels of surreality. Animation aficionados of any age should seek this film out for that alone.
