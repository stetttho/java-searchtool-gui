 I don't know WHAT the Amazon official review is about, because it's not this book.  At first it sounds like a bad joke. A college student getting stoned in his dorm room gets yanked through a dimensional portal by a senile wizard, and doesn't notice. He ends up on a world populated by talking animals and sword-and-sorcery stereotypes, and gets sent unwillingly on a quest.  What Foster does, however, is concentrate on giving us a street-level view of epic fantasy. The talking animals are not cute -- they're brutal and savage, as befits a medieval world. Magic is dangerous and unpredictable, and wizards are seen as lunatics. The threat from Ultimate Evil elicits more laughter  from the populace than sympathy for the heroes' cause.  It's the very nastiness of the world that makes the book work. While I'd still call it comedic fantasy, the humor, even the fish-out-of-water bits, has a dangerous edge to it.  There are two problem areas I should note, however. The first is that the title, "Spellsinger," is very misleading; while musical magic is a theme in the book, it's rarely used. We won't learn much about actual spellsinging until the third book in the series.  The second is that the series begins to degrade quickly after the second book. Once the first major story arc is wrapped up, the remaining novels become increasingly light and frivolous in tone and the world-building becomes careless.
