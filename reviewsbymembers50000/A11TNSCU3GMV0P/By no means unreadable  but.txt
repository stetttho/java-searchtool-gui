 The basic plot outline has Sano sent to investigate a murder at the highest levels of society (the Emperor is a suspect) to clear his name of slander. His spunky wife accompanies him, and while initially he worries about her safety he eventually comes to accept her as a partner in his investigation.  There's an odd sort of quality to this novel; it really wants to please, and it offers up a series of interesting set-pieces, characters who sound like they should be fascinating, and a complex mystery to be solved.  Unfortunately, the solution to the mystery is obvious before we've even finished meeting all the suspects, all of the characters are cardboard cutouts, and most of the different lines of the plot just stop abruptly. The chamberlain is so much more interesting a character than Sano Ichiro that, slimy as he is, I kept having to stop myself from rooting for him.  Worst of all, there's enough magic used to qualify the book as a fantasy novel instead of a historical mystery. A little bit of that is okay as the expression of the general mysticism of the era, but the solution to the mystery hinges on it. That's just not playing fair.  While I kind of enjoyed The Samurai's Wife, it's definitely "beach reading" ... moreso even than the Legend of the Five Rings series.
