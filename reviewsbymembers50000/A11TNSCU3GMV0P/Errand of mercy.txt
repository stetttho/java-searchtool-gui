 As will be the pattern for the rest of the series, Jon-Tom is sent off on an errand by his mentor, the wizard Clothahump, and must travel through the world accompanied by his friend Mudge, the otter woodsman. This time, Clothahump has fallen sick, and his medicine can only be obtained from a single shop of unearthly goods located across the Glittergeist Sea. Jon-Tom must travel through many weird perils along the way, solving them through creative use of his power of spellsinging -- when Jon-Tom sings, the lyrics come true.  There's a lot to recommend this novel; the characters who join Jon-Tom's "adventuring party" are a varied lot, and it makes sense that they would choose to travel with him. The story is highly episodic, and we get to see intrigue, mystery, brutality, and even a tiny touch of the sense of wonder in the previous novel, Hour of the Gate.  Unfortunately, starting with this book jokes (not humor, JOKES) begin taking precedence over story. A lot of the events seem to happen more because they might be funny than because they're interesting or advance the plot. Tellingly, the two best sections of the book -- the other ship they run across and what happens when they land in the city -- are both deadly serious in tone.
