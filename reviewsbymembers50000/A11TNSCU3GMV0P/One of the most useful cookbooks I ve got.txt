 I was really surprised; single-ingredient cookbooks are generally really hit-or-miss, and include a lot of recipes you'll just never use.  365 Ways to Cook Chicken is an exception, with lots of useful, versatile ideas for working with poultry.

I'm definitely going to be seeing if I can track down the rest of this series.
