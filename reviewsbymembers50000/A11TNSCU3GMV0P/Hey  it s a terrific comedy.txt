 Robin Hood often gets slammed by people who don't understand what it's supposed to be. No, Prince John isn't particularly menacing; yes, he's outwitted by Robin at every turn. This isn't meant to be a dramatic confrontation between good and evil ... it's a comedy. A ninety-minute collection of cartoon set-pieces, most of which are extremely well-done and hysterically funny (with the intentional exception of "But Not in Nottingham," which shows the human impact of the villain's machinations in a way I wish more Disney films would).  Enjoy it for what it is -- this was Disney's funniest feature until Aladdin. It won't thrill you, but it'll have you rolling in the aisles.
