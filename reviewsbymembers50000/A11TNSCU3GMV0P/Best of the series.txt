 This isn't so much the second Spellsinger book as the second half of the first one -- it starts minutes after the first book ends, and presents the second half of the quest.  While Spellsinger was about the experience of ordinary life in the Wizards' World, Hour of the Gate shows us the extraordinary -- having crossed the Warmlands on their quest to prevent the Plated Folk from conquering the world, the heroes now set off through legendary lands in search of allies in the coming war. What they find is by turns awe-inspiring and terrifying, and Foster shows a great talent for minimal descriptions that evoke strong images.  As before, we're primarily seeing Clothahump's mighty deeds through Jon-Tom's eyes, and as such there isn't much actual spellsinging. Nevertheless, this book strongly captures the power and majesty that fantasy worlds can have.  As I noted in my review of Spellsinger, though, this is the last time that Foster takes his world seriously. As the series progresses, it shifts from being dark fantasy with a light touch to, by the end, the level of a knock-knock joke. If you're a completist who must read every book in a series, you may not want to get started on this one -- it's too depressing seeing where it goes.
