 There's really not that much that needs to be said. The other most famous adaptation of this book, Disney's Mr. Toad's Wild Ride, is poorly animated, makes tons of pointless changes, and just doesn't tell a very good story.  Rankin-Bass's Wind in the Willows, on the other hand, has good songs, more visual appeal, and better voice acting, and it's much more faithful to the book. The characters really feel like themselves; they capture Mole's innocence, Badger's intransigence, Ratty's affability and Toad's mania beautifully, and all of the characters come across as people you'd like to spend time with.  It's a real shame this film hasn't been restored and released on DVD, as it's one of my favorite book-to-film adaptations.
