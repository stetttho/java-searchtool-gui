 Piers Anthony's problem is that he's very good at coming up with ideas but isn't actually a very good writer. Nowhere is it more obvious than in the Incarnations series, of which this is the first volume.  In On a Pale Horse, a down-and-out loser named Zane attempts to commit suicide, but upon seeing the spectre of Death approaching kills him instead. He who kills the Incarnation of Death becomes his successor, and Zane is cast adrift into a metaphysical storm as he struggles to both learn his new responsibilities and prevent a takeover of his job by Satan, the Incarnation of Evil.  This is a terrific, fascinating premise, totally let down by juvenile characterization, overreliance on sexual innuendo and lousy jokes, and Anthony's unfortunate tendency to shoehorn whatever he's currently reading into whatever he's currently working on (in this case, a theory of patterns of thought that's completely out of place).  This would be survivable (just like the Adept books rose above the writing style) except for one thing. Anthony just does not understand what makes two people fall in love, and considering that this book centers around a love story it qualifies as a fatal flaw. There is no earthly reason these two characters should fall in love; they go directly from being near-strangers to being willing to die for one another.  The ideas in the book are much better than their realization, and in any case it's still quite entertaining and worth the read. I'd stop here, though ... the next two books are mostly dreary with a few good parts, and the sixth book is excellent, but the rest of them are just intolerable.
