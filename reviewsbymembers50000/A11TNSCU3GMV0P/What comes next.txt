 Since the theme of Final Fantasy X was "death," it's only logical that the theme of Final Fantasy X-2 should be "moving on." It's the classic problem so often papered over in fantasy novels: once the world has been saved and the Big Bad has been taken care of, what happens now?  A lot of people dismissed this game offhandedly without giving it a fair shake, either because of "that's not exactly what I was expecting so it's bad" boneheadedness or because they saw three female characters and 70's-esque music and decided it had to be lightweight. While this is the most upbeat Final Fantasy title since the original, that's not necessarily a flaw.  More to the point, you've got much more option for roleplaying in this game than in most FF titles. While there are specific places you have to go to advance the storyline, there's still a whole world to explore with lots of things happening everywhere you go. You decide what to get involved in, and your choices influence the story.  The unfortunately-named "Dressphere" system allows you to change character class in the middle of battle. You arrange character class icons on a chart (many charts are available), and then move between adjacent icons as you need to, swapping abilities in and out. Some charts even have special icons on them, so you gain abilities merely by moving around. This gives you a lot of freedom in battle and some cool tactical options -- what classes will I need for this fight, and how do I arrange them so I have access to what I need when I need it?  I will say this. If you only like Final Fantasy games because of their magic robots and evaluate characters based solely on how "bad***" they are, you may not like this game. This is a game about saving the world in which you kill things with swords, not a game about killing things with swords where you incidentally save the world. There's politics and religion and philosophy, and not a lot of continents blowing up.
