 You used to be able to pick up any Doctor Who novel and start right in; at worst, you'd need to adjust to the new companions and that'd be it.  Near the end of the New Adventures series, that changed -- the series became almost completely divorced from the original Who, and the books referred more to each other than to the television series.  That didn't change when the license went back to the BBC and they started making the Eighth Doctor books -- if anything, it got worse. "Trading Futures" is a welcome respite from that.  It's a fun, fast-moving action adventure, something like the Third Doctor might have gotten up to.  It's not so much a spy adventure as it is a Tom Clancy book played for laughs. More than that, though, it's new Who that *isn't depressing* and *doesn't require you have read the previous eight books in the series to understand it*.  For me, that's enough!
