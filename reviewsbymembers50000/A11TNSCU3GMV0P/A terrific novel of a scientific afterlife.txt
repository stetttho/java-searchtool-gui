 The Riverworld series is Farmer's speculation about the fate of humanity, and it's one seriously epic story involving many of history's most colorful characters. Every human being who ever died is brought back to life, naked and screaming, along the banks of an unutterably long river under an unfamiliar sky. While many devolve into savagery or abandon themselves to messianic cults, some of them ask -- Why? Who has done this? What do they want?  To Your Scattered Bodies Go tells the story of Sir Richard Francis Burton, the famous British explorer who discovered the headwaters of the Nile and plans to repeat his feat on the Riverworld. While at first his quest seems harmless, even pointless, it soon becomes clear that someone absolutely does not want him to complete it, and the mysteries of the series start to unfold in earnest.  While TYSBG is technically a stand-alone novel with an open ending, it doesn't resolve many of its mysteries. The next three books in the series tell more stories of the Riverworld from various viewpoints, finally bringing together selected heroes from all four books at the climax. This is a series that really demands to be read consecutively.
