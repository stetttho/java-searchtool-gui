 Callahan's Place is the ideal of the neighborhood bar: a place people go not so much to drink as to be together and share their lives. The Place's motto is that shared pain is lessened, while shared joy is increased; its regulars are a bunch of working-class joes who have developed an amazing degree of compassion and empathy ... not to mention a matter-of-fact outlook towards the occasional time-traveler or space alien who drops in.  It should be emphatically noted that the Callahan's books are not science fiction, although they're still speculative fiction -- Robinson is exploring the psychological universe, not the physical one. Nevertheless, this book alternates between laugh-out-loud hilarious and deeply moving, almost to the point of spiritual experience.  Unfortunately, as the series went on the stories got longer, incorporated more sci-fi elements and less humanity, and finally turned into just interminable rhapsodizing by Robinson about what would constitute the Ideal Party. All of the good stories (and the first couple of bad ones) are fortunately collected in this convenient volume, thus sparing you the horror that is Callahan's Key.
