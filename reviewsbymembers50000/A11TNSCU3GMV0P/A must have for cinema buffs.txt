 It's not a glossary so much as a joke book ... a compilation of both Mr. Ebert's own list of cinematic cliches and those submitted by his readership.  It's a great browser's book, something you can just open up to any page and start reading.  I've taken to leaving my copy by the couch, so I can flip through it during commercials and see how many points the film's racked up since the last commercial. The only real problem with the book is the inherent flaw in having a book that features submissions ... quality is uneven, and a few cliches appear multiple times submitted by different people.  This is balanced out by some very clever observations, patterns that I hadn't noticed before and which informed by later movie watching. It's not quite as good as "I Hated, Hated, Hated, HATED This Movie," but it's still a seriously funny book for anyone who's fed up with seeing the same movie made over and over again with different titles.
