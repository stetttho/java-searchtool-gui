 Allen Iverson will probably never get the respect he fully deserves. What do I mean by this? This talented young man has lead the NBA in scoring despite being just under 6 feet. He lead a mediocre team to the Finals in 2001. And he handles the ball as if it were "on a string". Yet, other players get more respect from the media. Here's a list of whom A.I. deserves more respect over: 1- Kobe Bryant=The man is a ball hog. All he wants is the glory and it's plain to see it. Great players don't try. They just do it. 2- Tim Duncan=This guy is way over-rated. He can not even play well in the clutch. 3- Grant Hill=What has he really done? And yet, he STILL gets more respect. 4- The rest of the NBA. Iverson is hands down the NBA's top player. Imagine if he were a few inches taller. Definitely the heir to Jordan's throne. He even shook off 'ol Jordan and made him slip as he scored a basket. Let's see how much longer the media dogs this man. As far as the DVD goes, if you want to see what a true player is like, get this. This man is not going to cry and make excuses unlike OTHER players when he doesn't play well. Allen has been holding it down ever since Georgetown! You didn't know? You better ask somebody!
