 Every artist who puts out a DVD, should follow this project's lead. This has everything you could ever ask for. Virtually ALL of the artist videos. Classic live performances. A "real-life" look into the artist life. A short movie that depicts the ultimate presentation of how DMX's soul is at battle between the forces of good and evil to control one man's life. What else could you ask for? DMX - Angel is the perfect package. From the short 24-minute movie, Angel, where DMX tells us from a narrator point of view on his life and how he struggles to stay righteous, to his classic performance at the famous Apollo Theatre. Wouldn't it be great if they put out a DVD exactly like this on Eminem, Jay-Z, even Snoop Dogg? Unquestionably a definate satisfaction for ANY DMX fan. If you're a fan of his music....What are you waiting for? Get up and go cop this!
