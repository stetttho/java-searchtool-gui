 The Sopranos broke it's own record! 9 million people saw the Season 2 finale, which was the largest audience for a single show (none sporting event) in cable history... until now. 11.3 million people tuned in to see the Season 3 premier. This is a great accomplishment, since HBO has 33 million subscribers. (I am sure that they did not count all those people with illegal cable)  Episode 27 - MR.
