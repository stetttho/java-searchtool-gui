 This is 5 star music.  Friends in Low Places alone is worth the whole thing.  I usually review math and science books (Schaum's Outlines, Scientific American, etc.), but Garth comes close to the best ever Country  Music (Willy Nelson, Tammy Wynette and a few others are at the top in my  opinion).  What I especially like about Garth is the humor of his songs  combined with some of the painful truth underneath, and Alan Jackson has  that too.  This is where the conscience of America went, and I don't think  it's drinking humor so much as Out of Place in Your Own Country humor and  sadness.  Maybe next there'll be a tribute to the American people.  We sure  need it.
