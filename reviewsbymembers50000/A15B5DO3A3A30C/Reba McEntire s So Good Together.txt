 The song I'll Be in this album is one of the best songs of this year or any year.  It's a song for all seasons, but especially for the depressed and lonely times which young and old alike often experience.  The U.S.  Veterans Administration tells its depressed old veterans to monitor  themselves and keep track of when and where their negative thoughts come in  a diary or log and then immediately counteract them with some positive or  distracting thoughts.  Reba has captured this idea like nobody else and  gives it to the young and old alike.
