 In reviewing Weinberg (1974), I listed his book as the best book on general relativity.  This book is the second best.  Weinberg's approach is algebraic, analytic, and topological, while Misner et al (MTW for short,  which I write as a typo toward the end of this review) adopt a mostly  geometrical approach.  It has turned out that geometry and topology are  very important for modern quantum gravity, but it so are all the other  fields plus logic and set theory and even probability or at least (finite)  measure theory.  In Carlip's recent book on 2+1 dimensional quantum  gravity, some of these approaches are contrasted but many things remain  confused as to which fields could theoretically be eliminated.  It will  probably turn out that several different approaches lead in similar  directions, especially four approache: geometry (the ADM or  Arnowitt-Deser-Misner formalism), topology (string theory),  measure-analytic-logic-probability-entropy (which leads to a direction  which is a combination of the first two), and algebra (Clifford, octonion,  division algebras which can describe geometry from a sort of neo-Cartesian  algebraic approach - see my pending review of Bayliss and also my review of  Dietrich et al and Chisholm).  Since string theory appears to be only an  approximation to quantum gravity, probably only the other 3 are fundamental  in a deeper sense.  Of these three, geometry by itself is the least well  translated into ordinary language.  MDT (Misner et al.) try, but they fail  very much to get through to non-specialists in geometry, and they are not  really addressing the public - their book is directed on a 2-tiered level  to physics students and to physics general relativity geometry would-be  specialists.  I recommend buying and keeping this book as a reference and  having a consultant or tutor help you compare it with other approaches if  you are not a general relativity geometry specialist.
