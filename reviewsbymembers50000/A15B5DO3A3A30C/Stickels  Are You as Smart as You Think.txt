 Stickels and Gardner are among the top popularizers of mathematics and science (see my and other readers' book reviews of Gardner's books, including his early 1980 books).  This takes the highest type of Creative  Genius, because translating from quantitative to qualitative or verbal  language requires mastery of both and of the underlying concepts, and  developing puzzles and problems for the public requires inventiveness and  creativity beyond translating.  Here I want to emphasize that Stickels' and  Gardner's methods can lead to enormous improvement in student learning of  mathematics and science and even in research in these fields, especially in  topics that have not yet been analyzed.  For example, my work in  Logic-Based Probability (LBP) asks the simple question: what happens if you  replace division by subtraction and add 1 in all equations of probability  and statistics?  The answer is that you get LBP, which is very important  for analyzing very rare events and the influences of events.  If it gets  this simple, we could have a whole nation of inventors trying out different  operations and different changes in assumptions.  Einstein's general  relativity came about largely because some mathematicians asked: what  happens if things that look parallel (like tracks running in the same  direction) eventually come together?  This created Non-Euclidean Geometry.
