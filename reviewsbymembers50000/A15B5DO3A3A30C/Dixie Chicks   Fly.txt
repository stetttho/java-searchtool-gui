 The Dixie Chicks have a top winning album here, just with Cowboy Take Me Away and Goodbye Earl. The whole album is as inventive and creative as I've ever seen Country or Popular Music, and I can see why they've gotten so  many awards.  There are many great singers who stick to one type of theme  or one style, and if they've got enough creative genius it works, but we're  talking Leonardo Da Vinci creative genius in this album.  A really great  person can conquer many, many different styles and fields unless they have  some hangup that makes them stick to one style or one field.  If I may put  in a plug for my usual haunts, reviewing math and physics books, the Nobel  Prize winner Steven Weinberg in physics had this unusual ability to excel  in many different styles and fields (see my review of his books), and  Agatha Christie had this in mystery (see my reviews) and Issac Asimov in  science fiction and science nonfiction writing (see my reviews).
