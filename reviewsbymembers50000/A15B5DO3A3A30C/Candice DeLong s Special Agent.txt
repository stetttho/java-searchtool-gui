 This is the best book that I have ever read on the FBI or law enforcement, written by a woman who not only went beyond the call of duty but did it against both *friends* (a tradition of not hiring women agents) and foes.  Aside from her courage, what most impresses me is her background as head Psychiatric Nurse in a major hospital before joining the FBI, which was subsequently put to good use in profiling rapists and similar violent criminals. This "profiling" technique uses statistics and interviews with offenders to obtain patterns of attacks and attackers - personality and lifestyle sketches of the typical psychopath (less effective with new criminals who simply *panic*)which are directed toward answering why particular victims are selected while others are not, why violence escalates over time for the psychopath, what kinds of public appeals may flush out the criminal or encourage him to communicate or confess, where the criminal is likely to surface, etc.  The profiling technique was pioneered by psychiatrist James Brussel in the 1950s and introduced to the FBI by Howard Teten and Patrick Mullany in the early 1970s.   Candice DeLong, who retired in July 2000, is a credit to Irish American Catholics and women and people with courage beyond the call of duty as well as mental health practitioners everywhere.  I hope that women and mental health professionals and other scientists including statisticians will follow her example and consider a career in law enforcement, whether or not they believe in the sanity of politicians or in the sanity of bureaucrats.
