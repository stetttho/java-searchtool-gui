 The first thing a non-specialist should do is to hire a reputable consultant or tutor to translate this book into approximately ordinary English, but it would be a bad mistake to miss this book because it is full of remarkable ideas that apply to almost every field.  To show you how  translation would work, it turns out that doughtnuts (torus, plural tori in  math) are key to classical and quantum chaos.  You might ask: why  doughtnuts, instead of, say, balls (beachballs, tennis balls, microscopic  balls, etc.)?   Well, let's consider a person's head as a ball.  You can  comb a person's hair flat on his head, but not without a part or  irregularity (eddy) somewhere - see page 33 of the book, which says this is  slightly different words.  On a doughnut, however, you can comb hair flat  without any irregularities.  The hair with the directions in which they  point are called vectors in mathematics, and all together they form a  vector field.  Chaos occurs when these doughtnuts get disturbed, say by  raising the energy (perturbations).  Gutzwiller of IBM New York pioneered  the study of the relationship between classical and quantum chaos, but  anybody who has read IBM books or manuals know that they usually require  heavy translation.  If you absolutely can't find a math or physics  consultant or tutor, go through Gutzwiller's book page by page until you  find something like this which you can understand, and keep reading the  comprehensible paragraphs.
