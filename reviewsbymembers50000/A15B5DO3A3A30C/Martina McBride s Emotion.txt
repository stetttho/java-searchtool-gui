 Love's The Only House alone is worth the price of the album.  In fact, it's worth the price of most albums put together.  I don't think the Editor was referring to this song as a "hackneyed Nashville formula" or  words to that effect, because both the words and music are as good as  almost any in Shakespeare and Alan Jackson.  It's not just a love song with  the listener left to wonder what kind of love they're talking about.  It's  the story of the triumph of love over fear and hate.  It's the kind of  thing we all need, not just now but forever.  (See my review of Joan  Kennedy for more on related topics in music.)
