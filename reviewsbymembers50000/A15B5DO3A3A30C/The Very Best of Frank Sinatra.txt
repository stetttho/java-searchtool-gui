 Read Daniel Berger's review below and the Editor's review for excellent details.  You'll usually find me reviewing math and physics books, but Sinatra, Jolson, Nat King Cole, Rodgers and Hammerstein, George M. Cohan,  Bing Crosby, and a few others have a special place in Heaven.  Sinatra's  humanitarian work on behalf of the Italian American community was an  incomparable tribute to the people descended from Leonardo Da Vinci,  Michelangelo, Verdi, Rossini, Vivaldi, and countless other greats.  As for  claims that he associated with the wrong people, there is no such thing as  guilt by association, especially in a nation that has almost continually  cut the budget of its own Veterans Administration and where top political  leaders are frequently caught with their pants down and the IRS has already  lost its pants.  Music, like baseball, doesn't follow a political agenda,  and neither did Frank.
