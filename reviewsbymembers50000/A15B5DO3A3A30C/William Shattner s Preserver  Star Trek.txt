 I've never met a Star Trek episode or book that I didn't like, which is probably the best one can say about the modern time version of Will Rogers' "I never met a person I didn't like.*  One good thing about Shattner's TV role as Captain Kirk and his series of books including Preserver is that we have one of the original Gene Rodenberry cast (who lasted all the way through the series and into seveal more)who helped very much make it what it is and was, William Shattner, interpreting things and carrying on with the help of his admirable co-authors. Another good thing in Preserver is the *Wise Aliens* - it is so in contrast with the usual Bug Eyed Monster (BEM) Sci-Fi movies!  I think that it did wonders for Isaac Asimov's Foundation Series.  Wise People/Creatures behind the scenes, like mysterious benefactors in mystery stories (Agatha Christie had them all over the place - not just mysterious psychopaths), appeal to our good and Noble parts.  Long Live Star Trek!  I have to add that time and space and dimensional travel and related mysteries are really important in modern physics (quantum entanglement may involve all three).  As usual, science fiction keeps up with the latest research and sometimes goes ahead.
