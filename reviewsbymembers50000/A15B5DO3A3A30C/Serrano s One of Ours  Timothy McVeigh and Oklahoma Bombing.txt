 For once, I am speechless.  This book and the story behind it is more powerful than any answers that I can suggest.  I will say that both the Prosecution and the Defense in the trial had some correct points.  Even the  Right to Bear Arms is not a one-sided negative right.  One of the best  people that I have ever met was a U.S. Anti-Terrorist agent who belonged to  the NRA and always carried several weapons but would not harm a fly out of  anger or personal vendetta.  I think that the readers should read Robert  Goldston's The Life and Death of Nazi Germany (now out of print,  unfortunately).  It maybe isn't so much your environment, your religion, or  your general upbringing and even your military record that may count as  much as the people or things you blame for the frustrations in life.   Hitler was also a real military hero, although his upbringing was nowhere  nearly as good as McVeigh's.  But Hitler believed in blaming people in  general and anger and eventually this led him into blaming absolutely the  wrong people.  But the Germans of his era had a society built on blame and  anger, and this led them into blaming absolutely the wrong people.  I  believed that Germany should have been re-educated after the war, and I  think that the U.S.A. has a lot of that blame and anger whose other sides  are over-praise and over-love if you get the meaning.  Maybe we should all  be part of the final verdict on McVeigh, and before the Final Judge we  probably will be.
