 This and its predecessor of the late 1980s are the best compendiums of differential equation solution and approximation methods that I have ever seen in terms of (a) comparison of different methods, (b) number of methods  compared, (c) description of details of each method, (d) organization such  as alphabetizing under each category and categorization of methods, (e)  description of and comparison of where each method can be applied in the  physical and other sciences, both deterministic and  statistical/probabilistic ("stochastic").  This accomplishment  cannot be overemphasized from the point of view of Creative Genius - in my  opinion, comparing and contrasting and organizing and summarizing data and  information are fundamental requirements for creative genius.  The book may  be intended as a reference book, but it should really be used also as a  textbook provided that the teacher overviews the areas and gives some  supplementary background and latest results. Both the student and reference  user can easily be overwhelmed by the sheer number of methods, and I would  recommend putting short descriptions of each (1-2 lines on front and 1-2  lines on back) on flash cards to keep them and their relationships fresh in  your mind (shuffle the cards, learn them backwards and forwards, learn them  alphabetically, in separate categories, then non-alphabetically and in  mixed up categories, etc.).  I would recommend that future editions list  some of the unsolved equations and open research questions in the field.
