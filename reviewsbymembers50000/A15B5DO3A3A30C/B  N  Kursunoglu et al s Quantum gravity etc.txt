 My article appears in this book as well as articles by some of the top people in quantum gravity, genralized theory of gravitation, and super-string based unification (unified field) theory.  The Global Foundation, which sponsors the conferences on which the series of books is based, is composed mostly of Nobel Prize winners and comparable level people.  It is remarkably innovative and receptive to new ideas - what one would expect from Nobel Prize and comparable people.  My own article applies logic-based probability (LBP for short or LEUT) to the above fields.  It's a sort of Non-Euclidean geometry version or analogue of mainstream Bayesian conditional probability (BCP)and like Non-Euclidean geometry changes a few small assumptions/axioms/definitions to obtain a new type of mathematics.  LBP uses subtraction of probabilities (plus a constant) instead of BCP's division of probabilites, and is much more useful than BCP for rare events and highly influential/highly dependent events.  Professor Kursunoglu obtained his Ph.D. in physics under Nobel Laureate Professor Paul Dirac of Cambridge University, England and worked with Albert Einstein. Dirac (now deceased) and Steven Weinberg (also a Nobel Laureate) are the two most creative and influential theoretical physicists of the last 30-40 years, although Weinberg (now at University of Texas Austin) is not with the Global Foundation.  The series of books started in the 1950s.
