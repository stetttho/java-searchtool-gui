 The rapidly rising Brazilian, Mexican, and other Latin American schools in mathematics and physics are contributors to this remarkable volume published by Walter de Gruyter: Berlin.  I will concentrate here on the  article by J. Vaz, Jr., one of the world's greatest mathematicians and  physicists.  In the following, I assume that the reader who is not a  specialist in this area will hire a reputable consultant or tutor to  translate the book into approximately ordinary English or elementary  math/physics, since the book gives valuable lessons for almost every field  of interest.  Vaz's paper is "Clifford algebra's and Witten's Monopole  Equations."  See my reviews of Chisholm, Okubo, Benn, Baylis,  Kursunoglu, and others on monopoles and Clifford algebras for some simple  explanations.  E. Witten is with the Institute for Advanced Study at  Princeton.  It turns out that GUTs (Grand Unified Theories of the  Elementary Forces and Particles) predict the existence of monopoles, which  have the remarkable property of being either north or south poles but not  both, unlike all magnets that we are familiar with in daily life.  Dirac  and then t'Hooft have come up with basic monopole equations, and now Witten  has also, and Vaz analyzes these using Clifford algebras.   He reformulates  Witten's equations in Maxwell equation form using the idea of operator  spinors, and then obtains a representation without spinors and another  representation with an SU(2) connection related to the spinor connection  with values in the Lie algebra of SU(2).  An important theorem, the  inversion theorem, is a major tool used by Vaz.  The final reformulation  involves the spinor covariant derivative acting on spinors.  Lie algebras  are so remarkable that I will try to give some simple definitions for them  in subsequent reviews of books on Lie algebras.
