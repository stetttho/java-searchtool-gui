 The editorials above and the other reviewers (especially the first few) give an outstanding summary of the book.  Here I will emphasize the points that interest me about the book.  Susan Schmidt, one of the co-authors,  first broke the Lewinsky story in the Washington Post and is an outstanding  investigative reporter.  Ken Starr reminds me from this book of my old idea  that if Christ or the Old Testament Jewish Prophets ever returned to the  modern world, they would be almost immediately crucified.   Starr's ethics  and morality are the old-fashioned Old Testament kind, easily attacked in  the Clinton Non-Great Society by poison-rumor and poison-misinformation  tactics of Clinton's advisors (including his wife Hillary) which are  reminiscent of Senator Joseph McCarthy's witch-hunting tactics.   Fortunately, the Senate officially Censured Joe McCarthy, but things have  gone down-hill from those days.  I am also negatively impressed by the  "Arkansas Mafia" which consists of a few hundred poultry  magnates, bankers, judges, and lawyers (to paraphrase from this book) who  run the Democratic Party and pretty much everything else in Arkansas.  I've  had some direct experience with that Mafia, which has connections even at  the university physical sciences level (my specialties are mathematics and  physics, which I often review in Amazon.com).  Anger and blame play an  important role in it, just as they did in Nazi Germany and the Oklahoma  City bombing (see my review of the book One of Ours on the latter).
