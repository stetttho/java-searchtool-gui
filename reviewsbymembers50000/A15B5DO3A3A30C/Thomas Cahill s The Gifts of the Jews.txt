 ...This book is extremely readable and spellbinding because it is done in the narrative history style almost like a historical novel and because Cahill is always looking for  lessons and relationships and has an eye for the critical facts like a  great detective.  His discussion of the three meanings of God in the Old  Testament is rivetting: God as a verb (YHWH as an archaic form of the verb  TO BE) which carries the idea of existence and creation, God as an  "independent verb" which cannot be magically controlled by  uttering the name of God, and God as a "communicating/caring  verb" who is always there for us.  The first meaning was taken by  Saint Thomas Acquinas for the theology of God as the only being whose  essence is existence, with all other beings being contingent on God.  This  is a deep point not only in theology but in the Philosophy of Being.   I  found the emphasis on the Prophets of the Old Testament and their  relationship with God as a voice (of justice) which they heard to be  remarkably relevant to the present time when the main voices that are heard  are those of politicians having affairs with interns half their age and  skipping out on their wives.  For all the detailed Jewish customs in the  Bible that Cahill omits (for which some editorials criticize him), there is  one thing that stands out remarkably in modern times - the Prophets not  only did not condone irresponsible behavior, but they preached against it  and thereby contributed immeasurably to civilization.  When the Supreme  Court tells you not to pray in public school, remember that the Prophets  through God were our first teachers, and by the grace of God will be among  our last teachers
