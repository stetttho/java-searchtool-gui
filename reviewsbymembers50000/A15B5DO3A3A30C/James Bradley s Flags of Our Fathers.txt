 James Bradley goes nearly as far as his father (one of the six Marine flag-raisers) and tells us the story of all six lives almost simultaneously from the beginning.  There aren't many people who can do that.  Beethoven  and Chopin in classical or romantic music were able to simultaneously tell  many stories - it's usually called Creative Genius, Nearness to God, Esprit  De Corps.  It helps to be tremendously moved and motivated, as Bradley was  by his father and his father's friends.  It helps to walk among the Pima  Indians as Bradley did to learn about Ira Hayes (one of the six) and the  families and the coal mines and the Catholic and Adventist and Presbyterian  Churches (surprising how many Catholics were among the six) and the hills  of Daniel Boone and the coal mines of Pennsylvania and the textile mills of  New Hampshire where the six flag-raisers grew up (among other places).  If  you are lucky and have lived long and deeply no matter what your physical  age, you will come close to James Bradley's story of the men who raised the  flag at Iwo Jima.
