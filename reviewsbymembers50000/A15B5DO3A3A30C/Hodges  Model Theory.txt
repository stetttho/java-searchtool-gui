 This book and its 1993 expanded version are in the field of Mathematical Logic, and Hodges of London University shows that model theory in particular has had a remarkable variety of applications to other branches  of mathematics, including computers (Prolog, undecidability, etc. - see my  reviews of Penrose, Ablamowitz et al, etc.), geometry (see my reviews of  advanced geometry via Clifford algebras, including Chisholm and geometric  physics including Misner et al, and elementary geometry including Schaum's  Outlines), topology (see my review of Greene's Elegant Universe which uses  string theory and topology and also Carlip's book), algebra (see my Review  of Weinberg's Gravitation and Cosmology which uses algebraic, topological,  and analytic methods in general relativity, and Nachtmann's book which uses  algebra in quantum theory), analysis/advanced calculus (see my review of  Clarke, Yu, Nedyaev et al, Zwillinger's books, etc.), and so on.  This book  is in the Cambridge Encyclopedia of Mathematics and its Applications  series, volume 42.  Like most books of the Cambridge Encyclopedia series,  it is very thorough up to the date of its publication - probably the most  thorough book on model theory, which is roughly what is sounds like:  mathematical models (of the physical and mathematical worlds).  British  Universities are among the world's greatest Creative Genius universities in  math and physics, and this book is no exception.  Most people should hire a  reputable consultant or tutor to help them understand and  "translate" the book, which will be well worth the effort in  almost every field.
