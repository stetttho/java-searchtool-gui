 The editor and most other reviewers have done a great job in reviewing this book, and I can only add a few things from my viewpoint.  I thought that I was past tears, and I wasn't.  I thought that I could forget, and I  couldn't.  But the lessons of history should not be repeated over and over  again by generations that forget.  The first steps to Auschwitz are the  steps of blaming the innocent and glorifying the guilty.  Some even do it  in the name of God or Country or Policing the World or Rescuing the World.   Let us begin by rescuing ourselves and living our lives as examples, not  rescuing the past or the future or God or Country.  When we have proven our  own worthiness and freedom from evil beyond all doubt, then we may avoid  the Auschwitzs in our own country.  That is all we can do for history and  for ourselves.
