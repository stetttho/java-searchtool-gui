 Gregory Peck is one of the best actors of all time, in my opinion.  I have reviewed the "real life" story of the General (later Air Marshall) who most closely resembles the character played by Gregory Peck,  under the book "Despatch on War Operations: 23rd February, 1942, to  8th May, 1945," by Air Marshall Sir Arthur T. Harris.  See that review  in Amazon.com for more details.  Recently a number of major magazines have  selected Gregory Peck's leadership style, as portrayed in this movie, as  one of the most effective leadership/management styles: making rapid  decisions under fire that go to the heart of the matter.  Other styles also  can be combined with it or alternate with it: concern about employees and  the public, concern about the truth, calmness - for example, the leader  who, when provoked outrageously, never replies worse than: "That's  possible," or "I don't know about that."  Peck, by the way,  like Harrison Ford and Alec Guinness, has made it to the top with a  "class act," which for the benefit of the "cool"  generation means: only grade A level material.  His characters don't rely  on sensationalism or skipping out on their wives to attract attention,  unlike some political leaders and teenage idols.
