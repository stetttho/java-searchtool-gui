 This and its predecessors are books for all seasons about a man for all seasons.  We all owe our lives to him.  It is a book for the hard working and the pampered, for nations that cut funds for their Veterans  Administrations like the United States has almost continually done, and for  parents who wonder how much more to pamper their little darlings so that  they will be loved as fathers and mothers.  Montgomery beat the best that  Hitler could send against him and us, and he did the same wherever he was  sent.  His expertise was strategy, not politics, not taking advantage of  interns or skipping out on his wife.  We need a few more like him.
