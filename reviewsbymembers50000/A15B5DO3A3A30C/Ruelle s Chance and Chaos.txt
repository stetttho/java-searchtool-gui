 This is the best popular book on chaos, dynamic systems, and entropy that I have ever read, by one of the pioneers of this field.  I have remarked in my reviews of Gribbin, Kaku, and others that Creative Geniuses in science  (unlike Ingenious Followers who are so abundant) inspire others and  themselves often by popularizing science in ordinary English. It is a good  sign if they do this often, but sometimes they only do it seldom or never.   Ruelle, as far as I know, only did it once, in this book, and the reader  who loses the opportunity to obtain this book has lost a classic.  Ruelle  inspired me at an important place in my career (my fields are related to  the probability-logic-entropy-physics interface).  I am especially fond of  recalling his description of how extremely new creations or inventions are  typically received in science: journal reviewers will usually contradict  each other in their haste to oust the newcomer.  There are still journals  which do not touch chaos, entropy, dynamic systems, fractals, not to  mention my own field of logic-based probability.
