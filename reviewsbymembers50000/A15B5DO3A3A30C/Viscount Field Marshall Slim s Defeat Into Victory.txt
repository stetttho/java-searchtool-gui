 I can't make a better review than Newt Gingrich's review elsewhere in this section, and I agree with him that it starts out slow, but I consider it a 5 star book.  Like Field Marshall Montgomery (see my review of him), Slim exhibits a level of moral character and courage that we all need as a model  now and in the future.  The public needs to stop being hypnotized by  handsome or pretty faces and start looking for what we used to call  "guts".  It's the stuff that counts when you're under fire, real  or imagined.  It's the stuff that our ancestors had when they turned defeat  into victory.  Defeat either kills you or builds and brings out character.   Audie Murphy knew that, fighting when outnumbered "hopelessly"  until he became our most decorated soldier.  It's not Cool that trains us.   It's heat - painful, unpleasant, long term.  Slim knew that, coming from  the nation and the people that survived things like the bombing of London  and the Battle of Britain, just as its predecessors survived Napoleon and  Ancient Rome.
