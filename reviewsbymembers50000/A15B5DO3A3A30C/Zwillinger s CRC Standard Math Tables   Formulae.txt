 Zwillinger is an incomparable genius at organizing data, information, theory.  See my review of his Handbook of Differential Equations, which is the best thing in its field and which the reader should also purchase  regardless of whether currently into differential equations.  The other  reviewers have done a gone job noting details of this book.  Here I would  like to answer why tables and formulas are needed in a day when hand  computers are everywhere.  The answer is that we have to learn to think in  terms of tables and formulas to keep at the top of our fields (for example,  how many of you know that general relativity is based on sets of tables  called tensors?).  Computers today are stil mostly not for thinking but for  doing long calculations which involve repetition rather than innovative  thinking.  Make your hobby tables, formulas, equations, inequalities, and  you might pass Life 101.
