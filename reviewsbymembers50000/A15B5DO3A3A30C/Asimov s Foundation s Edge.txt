 This is as good as any of the original three books of the Foundation Trilogy, and is in my opinion a work of Creative Genius.  Some readers have commented on the seeming non-religious philosophy of the book, but although  the philosophy is somewhat strange (not to give away the ending), I think  that it is compatible with either a religious or non-religious viewpoint,  and furthermore Asimov intended further books to follow to develop his  themes further.  Others have indicated that his characters are  psychologically or emotionally lifeless, but the main characters Trevize  and Gendibal and Sura Novi and Mayor Branno and Pelorat are as alive as  most of Shakespeare's characters without the unnecessary violence.  In this  book, Asimov reveals himself to be a master of surprise, characterization,  conflict and its resolutions, and an openness to ethical and even  environmental questions. Most of all, perhaps, he is the ultimate opponent  of bureaucracies in this book, whether academic, political, or any others.   His conclusion is a bit confusing on this matter, but I do not think it was  intentional but rather was dictated largely by the element of surprise and  telling a good and entertaining story.
