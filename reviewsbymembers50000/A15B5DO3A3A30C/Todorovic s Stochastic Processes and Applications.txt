 This is one of the most thorough and detailed books that I have ever seen on stochastic (that is to say, probabilistic) processes with applications, even more thorough than most textbooks that I have seen in West Coast  universities.   He has a chapter on second-order processes, one on spectral  analysis of sationary processes, one on Gaussian processes, several  chapters on Markov processes including one chapter on semigroup  applications to Markov processes.  Concerning the latter, the reader should  look at some of my reviews of semigroup books, such as One-Parameter  Semigroups by Engel et al., Right-Ordered Groups by Medvedev and Kopytov,  etc.  Semigroups are a branch of algebra which tremendously simplifies and  unifies other fields such as stochastic processes, functional analysis,  mathematical logic, etc.  Readers who are not specialists in mathematics as  well as those who are should request that this book be reprinted and  purchase it and learn it with the help of a consultant or tutor (even if  the latter just translates it into closer to ordinary English) because the  ideas are so useful for many outside fields.  If enough people request it,  perhaps it will be reprinted.  It is published by Springer-Verlag, New York  and Berlin and Heidelberg, 1992, and is part of the Springe Series in  Statistics.  Springer-Verlag/Springer are especially outstanding for their  ability to translate things into ordinary English better than most  companies, their ingenious organizing ability and clarity of presentation  and printing, their selection of up to date issues and research topics, and  their general Creative Genius.
