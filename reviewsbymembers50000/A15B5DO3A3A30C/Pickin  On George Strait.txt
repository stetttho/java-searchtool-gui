 Love Without End Amen is one of the top 5 Country Songs of all time, in my opinion, and this album is worth it just for that.  All my Exs Live in Texas is funny.  Maybe some readers don't understand the sounds of words,  so I'll repeat some words from Love Without End Amen here: "Let me  tell you a secret about a father's love.  Daddies don't just love their  children every now and then.  It's a love without end, Amen."  If you  don't like those words, try Heavy Metal or Blabber (maybe it's more your  style).
