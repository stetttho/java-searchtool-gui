 The nice thing about freedom of speech is that it helps one to learn the truth.  I recommend this book for a well written viewpoint and a non-abusive style from the former Assistant Director of the FBI (with the help of Dwight Williams).  Presumably his "nemesis" under  Clinton, Director Freeh, has a book written by himself somewhere, and it  will only be fair to compare the versions of the two books.  In fact, I  think that an outstanding Management Course could be made by assigning  Revell's book, Freeh's book (or future book - I don't know if it exists),  and Bonanno's book giving one of the more enlightened Mafia viewpoints (see  my review of the latter).  Revell appears to have been an outstanding  manager from this book, and some readers may not understand why.  Revell  has a military type discipline viewpoint with an exceptional respect for  justice and fairness rather than firing senior employees arbitrarily or  because of political orders or downsizing attempts.  It's the type of  discipline that Field Marshall Montgomery had (see my review of his book),  and to some extent General Eisenhower.  Whether he violated law for  patriotic reasons I do not know, and whether he is right about Freeh's  motivations - that, only comparisons between sources of evidence can  reveal.  His strong opinion that J. Edgar Hoover was not a homosexual is  quite interesting, since Great Britain has found for example that freedom  of speech without respect for the public can lead to very erroneous  conclusions, innuendoes, etc.  As for Bonanno, his idea that the Mafia  should not sell dope is quite an honorable proposal (it seems to me).
