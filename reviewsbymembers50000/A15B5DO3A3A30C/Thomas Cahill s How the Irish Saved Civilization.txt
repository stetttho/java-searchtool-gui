 As a long time admirer of Irish history, I was astonished to discover that the Irish indeed saved literature (including the Greek and Roman classicals) and science/mathematics through their monasteries and even their Green Martyrdom, from Saint Patrick through the monk Columcille who spread the books throughout Europe and was imitating by legions of follower monks including Columbanus.  The White Maryrs founded Salzburg and Vienna among many other places.  They Irish valued learning like the Jews.  They valued open-mindedness to new ideas much more than other narrowly bureaucratic strict clergics, whether when importing ideas from ancient Egypt or from other ancient peoples and not censoring books.  Finally, they valued humor (like the Jews).  Note carefully, however, that we are talking about the more religious and ascetic Irish people who dedicated their lives to God rather than to materialism or partying.  We are not talking about the playboy and not-knowing-what-to-do-with-your-money millionnaires of some modern Irish politicians abroad for whom materialism and sexual escapades are a step backwards toward the collapse of Ancient Rome.
