 This is one of the outstanding books on theology of the twentieth century by Professor Gillis of Georgetown University.  It is not merely a description but a comparison and analysis of issues, such as Mission versus  Maintenance which is an in-depth study of paradoxes between the mission of  the church and the maintenance of the bureaucracy and structure.  Nobody is  expected to accept both sides or all sides of issues, but the reader of any  religion or even no religion will come away with an understanding of unique  features of Roman Catholicism such as the protection of the connection  between the human and the Divine which the institution of Priests and  Sisters provides.  Buddhism and Hinduism have a different way of protecting  this connection, and Judaism and Islam and the Protestant Faith have their  own ways.  Perhaps there is hope in this Amerian melting pot, that by  comparing good experiences the good lives on and the evil is buried.  This  is why I only review good books.
