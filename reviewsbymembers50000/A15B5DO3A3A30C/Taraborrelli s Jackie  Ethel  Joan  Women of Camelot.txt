 The Editor and other reviewers have done an excellent job of reviewing this book, and I will only comment here on a few things.  I agree with reviewers that Joan comes out as the hero of the book, but I think that the  Kennedy women including Rose tell us something fundamental about the world  in which we live.  As a man, I consider that almost all of the women of the  world deserve a Medal of Honor for the major role they play in civilization  - as much as Field Marshalls Montgomery and Slim, whose books I have  reviewed at Amazon.com.  Joan Kennedy Taylor exemplifies the courage about  which John F. Kennedy wrote in Profiles in Courage, although he restricted  his book to men.  Much of her character is excellently revealed in her 1992  book, the Joy of Classical Music, which the public should ask the  publishers to reprint since it is out of print today.  Like most women,  Joan was under "enemy fire" most days of her life, and she not  only survived but triumphed.  Her alleged battle with alcoholism is no  blemish on her character.  The U.S. Veterans Administration (itself under  fire with almost constant budget cuts) treats thousands of courageous men  and women veterans of Vietnam and earlier conflicts with alcoholism and  similar problems every day.  Women like Joan bring us the best of classical  music and indeed classical civilization.  I am indebted to them beyond  words.
