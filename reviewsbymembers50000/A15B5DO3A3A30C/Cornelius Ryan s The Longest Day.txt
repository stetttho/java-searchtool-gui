 The other reviewers, especially Barron, have done such an outstanding job that there is not much left to say.  I am very impressed by Ryan as a  reporter and an outstanding writer who is able to simultaneously tell the  stories of hundreds of people (and indirectly hundreds of thousands).   Faith of Our Fathers did this for six people, and that was hard enough.   Whether six or hundreds, I think that this is a mark of Creative Genius,  the kind of thing that a Beethoven or Haydn or Mozart wove together into a  masterpiece of many parts, many men, many women.  Ryan was one of the best.
