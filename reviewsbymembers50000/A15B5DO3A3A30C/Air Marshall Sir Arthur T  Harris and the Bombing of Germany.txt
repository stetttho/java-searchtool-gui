 Many of us remember Gregory Peck in 12 O'Clock High, a story of Command Bombing decisions over Germany.  Reviewers of 12 O'Clock High, both the book and the movie, and perhaps even the authors, often confuse the hero  with the American tactical leader(s).  It was "Bomber Harris",  later Air Marshall Sir Arthur T. Harris, who ordered the bombing of Germany  in retaliation for the inhuman bombing of England by Hitler's Luftwaffe and  rockets.  He had to fight for that bombing not only against Americans who  felt sorry for the Germans (not having experienced having their home towns  bombed themselves, and somewhat under the spell of German sympathizers in  our military), but against some important Nazi sympathizers in Great  Britain.  Like Montgomery (see my review of him), Harris has had his  portrait rewritten by "politically correct" historians and  novelists anxious to downplay the British contribution to victory over  Germany.  When I saw Gregory Peck in that movie for the first time, I was  looking at Bomber Harris, struggling alone to give back what he and his  people had received.  Yes, German cities and villages were almost  obliterated by that bombing.  I can only say that a nation stupid enough to  vote for Adolf Hitler because he had a nice voice and was handy at finding  scapegoats, and stupid enough to commit massive genocide, deserved to  receive back some of what they had done to others.  Montgomery, Slim,  Harris, Mountbatten.  We need a few good men like them.
