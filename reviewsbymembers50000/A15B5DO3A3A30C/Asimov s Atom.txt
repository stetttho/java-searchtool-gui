 This book reveals a part of Isaac Asimov that I have never realized before: the Detective.  His journey across the subatomic cosmos is that of a detective, whether he is analyzing electrons, light, neutrons, quasars,  antimatter, neutrinos, interactions, or the universe.  He presents a  mystery, a problem, that stumps the experts in physics or chemistry or  mathematics, and then begins eliminating the suspects one by one until the  only possible solution is revealed.  He has done the same thing in his  science fiction, for example in his Foundation Series and Robot Series (see  my Amazon.com reviews of various of his books) - in fact, the heroes of his  robot series were a human detective and a robot or android detective.  I  grew up reading the science fiction of Asimov and/or his colleagues, and my  wife Dr. Marleen Josie Doctorow used Asimov's book on psychological science  fiction in her university psychology courses.  Asimov, by a remarkable  coincidence, was married to a psychiatrist, Dr. Janet Jeppson, and she  continued his Foundation Series after his death via his Estate and the  great writers Brin, Bear, and Benford.  When I read the front page  headlines recently in newspapers attacking psychiatrists and psychologists  like Freud, I wonder whether the journalists realize that all of science  and medicine and journalism involve detective stories.  The greatest  detectives also have something called intuition, which also goes by the  name of ESP, and in theology is considered to be a quality of the Divine.   Asimov had it, Saint Thomas Acquinas had it, the Old Testament Prophets and  Mohammed had it, Buddha had it, Einstein had it, Field Marshall Montgomery  had it.  It leaves us humble and grateful for the miracles of our and their  existence.
