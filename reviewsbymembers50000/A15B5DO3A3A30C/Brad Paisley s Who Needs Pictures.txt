 There are a few top dancing songs around now, including Brad Paisley's super good We Danced in this album and of course I Hope You Dance, elsewhere (which I've reviewed).  Brad's CD also has He Didn't Have to Be which has a spiritual connection with both songs and talks to the heart and the Heartland.  Now that the Big Election is coming up, I'm reminded of another dancing song, Harry and Beth Truman's Tennessee Waltz, Missouri style.  Our family goes back to Missouri (among other places), and I've thought ever since Harry's days that his upset victory over Dewey had something to do with Country dance and the loneliness and exhaustion that it talks to.  Dewey was the odds on favorite, and Country Harry won.  It makes you think about the front runner today and the fact that the final decisions aren't made by speakers on Earth but by a Higher Authority upstairs who I think likes Country Dance.
