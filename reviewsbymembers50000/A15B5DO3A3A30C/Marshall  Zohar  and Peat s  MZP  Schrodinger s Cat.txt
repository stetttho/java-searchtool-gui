 Although this is a popular science book, it is, as the Editor has indicated, extremely well organized and categorized.  In fact, I have seldom seen a book organized to this degree.  It compares and distinguishes  ("discriminates") concepts which are easily confused with each  other and which are seldom compared.  This process of comparison in  psychology is called DISCRIMINATION, and I want to put in a few good words  in favor of it.  I have urged readers in some of my other reviews of make  flash cards based on books in order to better understand them, but nothing  works as well as flash cards based on discrimination between concepts that  are similar or in a similar category.  I will try to do more justice to the  contents in a later review, but this book is the place to start large-scale  discrimination.
