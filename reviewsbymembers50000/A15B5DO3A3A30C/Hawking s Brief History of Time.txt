 One of the greatest living physicists, Stephen Hawking is also an amazing popularizer of science, a characteristic of many of the truly Creative Geniuses as opposed to the Follower Geniuses who are so abundant in  science.  I recommend that the reader consult parallel texts of slightly  greater mathematical and physical difficulty to better understand what is  going on, if necessary with the help of consultants or tutors.  I have  already remarked in other reviews for Amazon.com on the difficulty of  understanding entropy, for example, which comes in many types not all of  which are similar, and its relationship to probability, chaos, and so on is  not quite settled at this time.  The interested reader could consult  Ruelle's book (I forget its date at the moment) for a readable and inspired  account of entropy by one of its pioneers.  There has also been some recent  work indicating that more information can come out of a black hole than  Hawking thought.  I recommend that readers also read Roger Penrose's two  books of the last 20 years, which are also popularized science which  compare idealism and materialsm (the latter as represented by computer  Ingenious Followers, in my terminology).  Penrose and Hawking discovered  many of their discoveries together.
