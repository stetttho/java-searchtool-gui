 The song Just Call Me Lonesome is worth the price of the album by itself.  I'm glad to see that it's making a well-deserved comeback now.  We're talking some of the best music of all time.  Just add some Willy Nelson,  Tammy Wynette, and Mary Chapin Carpenter, and who needs amybody or anything  else?
