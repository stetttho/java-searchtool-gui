 The Foundation series of the late Isaac Asimov and its continuation by Brin and Bear is a work of Creative Geniuses, the modern analogue of the classic Shakespeare.  Ethical and moral issues abound similar to the  current debates about clones and automation.  Psychological and social  issues abound including the relationship between the living and the  mechanical, between the material and the spiritual at a much more  fundamental level than emerges from most science fiction movies.  The great  physicist Roger Penrose (see my reviews of his books - he is one of the  world's greatest physicists) has written two volumes fairly recently on  these types of issues.  It is fascinating to ask, as this book does, what  happens if the supposed laws of robotics, the assumptions "built  in" to the computer, are violated.  This is perhaps the most profound  question of our times: what happens when you change a supposed axiom, as in  non-Euclidean geometry (you get General Relativity).  I still think that  Bear and his colleagues will need to do more Foundation writing before they  can match Asimov's level of genius, but so far they are doing very well  indeed!
