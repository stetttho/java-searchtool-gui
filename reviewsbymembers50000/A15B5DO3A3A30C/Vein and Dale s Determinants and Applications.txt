 This book, as usual by the excellent Springer publishers, continues the trend launched by the Clifford algebra people (Lounesto, Chisholm, Baylis, Pezzaglia, Okubo, Benn, etc. - see reviews of some of them), namely, to  SIMPLIFY the mathematics of physics by using appropriate ALGEBRAIC  techniques rather than geometry or calculus or other techniques.  Both this  book by Vein and Dale and the Clifford algebra books and papers use algebra  in physics largely to replace hard to manipulate geometry and unwieldly  matrices.  A matrix is an algebraic quantity, but it is very hard to  handle: it is essentially a table of numbers, for example a table of  people's heights, or people's heights by weights.  You add tables by adding  corresponding positions in each table, and likewise for subtracting, while  multiplication is much more complicated.  However, as Vein and Dale show,  you can replace many results in physics which involve matrices by  DETERMINANTS. A determinant is a single number, typically, which is gotten  by combining the numbers of the matrix table in a certain way given by a  formula.  Thus, replacing a matrix by a determinant means replacing a table  by a single number.  It turns out that the Einstein Equation(s) of general  relativity can be solved in this way (for the axially symmetric field), and  likewise for equations involving solitary waves (Kadomtsev-Petashvili  equation), waves in a rotating fluid (Benjamin-Ono equation), etc.  An  important tool in this process is Backlund transformations, which are  described in the appendix but are more thoroughly described in the 1989  book of Bluman and Kumei which (together with their journal publications)  initiated much of the simplification of differential equations of the  modern era.  That book, as you may guess, was also published by  Springer/Springer-Verlag.
