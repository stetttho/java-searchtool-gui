 The reader has enough information about the plot of the book from the Editor's review, but I would like to concentrate here on why I think that Shattner, through his books, has become (or expressed the characteristics  of) a Creative Genius (as opposed to an Ingenious Follower, as many may  have thought of him in the shadow of Gene Roddenberry who created Star  Trek).  Shattner has absorbed the excitement, the obsession, the desire to  obtain knowledge and learn which was the original theme of Star Trek: to  explore new frontiers, to go where no one has gone before, etc.  The  Creative Genius is deep down a learner, a student of the universe.  Whether  he or she is a sculptor, a musician, a writer, or an inventor/discoverer,  these actions inspire the acquisition and experiencing of new knowledge.   You will find this in Socrates, in the Old Testament Prophets, in Saint  Thomas Acquinas, in Plato and Aristotle, and now in Shattner.  I hope that  the young people especially who read Shattner will be similarly inspired to  learn and create instead of following their peers and their "easy way  out".  I hope that parents will read Shattner and be inspired to  literally "sit on their kids" to study and learn and create, even  if they have to hypnotize them or send them to learning therapists.  I also  like the emphasis on psychology in Shattner's books and indeed in the whole  Star Trek phenomenon.  I think that Creative Geniuses somewhere, deep down,  are psychologists, though for some of them making contact with themselves  may be a long voyage indeed.
