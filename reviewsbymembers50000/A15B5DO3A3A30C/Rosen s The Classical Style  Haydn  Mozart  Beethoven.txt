 I am not a Classical Music Expert but I am slowly learning it (most of my book reviews are in mathematics and physics).  One of the reviewers criticizes Rosen for some technical reasons that I cannot evaluate.   However, I do know that many universities recommend Rosen's book, so the  critic is not entirely without his own critics.  I find this book endlessly  engrossing, as some of the reviewers have.  You cannnot come away from this  book without understanding many of the main differences between and among  Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven, and between Classical, Baroque, and Romance  music.  I was especially interested to find that Beethoven, widely touted  as an immoral person in some of the popular media, was in fact a person of  great moral character (and the popular impression of Mozart seems to be  wrong too, although there is less information on this).  Those who believe  that creative genius is stimulated by severe suffering (Beethoven, Van Gogh  in art, Godel in mathematical logic, Galileo in physics and astronomy,  etc.) will find much material in this book that seems to indicate the  accuracy of this theory more or less.  This is also a book that tells you  what Haydn learned from Mozart and Mozart from Haydn, what Beethoven  thought of Mozart and Schubert, what classical music learned from Baroque  music and so on.
