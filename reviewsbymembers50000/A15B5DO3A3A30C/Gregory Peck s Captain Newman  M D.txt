 I've reviewed Gregory Peck's Twelve O'Clock High (see that in Amazon.com),  which I argue was really based on Viscount Air Marshall T. Harris  ("Bomber" Harris) - see my review of the latter.  Gregory Peck  has a habit of doing only Class Act movies, which for the benefit of the  "Cool Alpha-Wave" generation means Only the Best.  Not many  people recall now that Captain Newman, M.D. was based on a real story - the  story of Beaumont Military Hospital in Beaumont, Texas (near El Paso).   I've argued in many of my reviews for greater public funding for the U.S.  Veterans Administration, and Captain Newman, M.D. is better than all of my  arguments.  There really were and are devoted Army Psychiatrists like  Captain Newman - a true Man for All Seasons, and devoted and ingenious  assistants like his, and perhaps most important, Veterans in and out of the  hospitals who gave their lives and their health for us.
