 This is not only the best elementary geometry (and related subjects) outline, but also the best text in its field, in my opinion.  The student will find as many theorems and definitions as in very long and detailed  texts, presented much more concisely and in a much more organized fashion  here in categories that are easily understood.  As with my review of  Schaum's algebra, I recommend strongly that the student make flash cards  from Schaum's theorems and definitions before trying to work out or even  read the numerous solved problems by themselves.  Close to 95% of students,  in my opinion, make the mistake of doing massive amounts of geometry  problems and homework before learning what the theorems and definitions  say.  This is like trying to learn to play the violin by playing symphonies  before one knows how to move the bow and fingers, and is probably the main  cause of middle school, high school, and college elementary geometry  failure.
