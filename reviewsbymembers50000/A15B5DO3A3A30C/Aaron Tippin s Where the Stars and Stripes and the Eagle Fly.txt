 The other reviewers have mostly done an excellent job.  Aaron Tippin, like Alan Jackson (whom I also reviewed), replied to the September 11 terror with what he does best, Country Music.  This one has the beat and the words that bring back the best of traditional Country but also the best of modern times and our response to indiscriminate terror.  Some young people think that it's *cool* to praise New Yorkers for their courage but not to sing or dance or whistle or hum to people like Aaron and Alan whose souls express themselves in music in reacting to September 11.  They probably never heard Willie Nelson, Tammy Wynette, Mary Chapin Carpenter (in her Saturday Night at the Twist and Shout), or for that matter Beethoven who was blind and deaf but wrote the world's greatest music in the face of the dictator Napoleon (whom he told off and was spared because of his courage).   Country Music is the Modern version of the old Classical Music - the old Creative Geniuses Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, Haydn, Chopin, Vivaldi, Verdi, Strauss, etc.   Tippin tells it like it is.  He tells the good parts of America the way he experiences them.  Yes, loving your wife and your nation and your dreams and your flag can be very *cool*.  Try it, you'll like it!
