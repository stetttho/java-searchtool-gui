 This Pulitzer Prize winning book should be read by everyone, but with a few cautions.  Don't expect to be able to understand the book thoroughly unless you are an expert in mathematical logic, classical music, and art.   I recommend hiring a reputable consultant or tutor to translate the book  into more brief, concise, and easily understood English (at least,  approximately).  Hofstadter does not believe in short summaries, at least  in this book.  See my review of Marshall and Zohar, who have a much briefer  summary of Godel (2-3 pages, roughly), and once you read that book you can  tackle Hoftstadter's explanation of Godel's proof.  Most people also miss  the point that Mathematical Logic is of remarkable importance for all areas  of knowledge (that was Godel's field) - see my reviews of Hajek, Hodges,  and others in this respect.  Another point is that Bach, one of the  greatest classical composers, was a mathematical genius, and music and  mathematics often go together (see some of my classical music and  country/popular music reviews).
