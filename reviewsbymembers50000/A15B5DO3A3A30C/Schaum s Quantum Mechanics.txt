 The rapidly rising Israeli science represented by Peleg et al. produced here an unusually concise, clear, and well organized presentation of a complicated subject with the benefits of worked out problems.  They managed  to do this with little sacrifice of detail, providing a mathematical  background chapter and even a chapter on the foundations of quantum  mechanics with six postulates and a discussion of the Schrodinger versus  Heisenberg pictures.  Dirac's bra and ket notation is explained and used  frequently, and the difficult subject of spin receives its own chapter.   The book keeps up with latest trends in mathematical and physics research  by having three chapters on solution/approximation methods (one of the main  recent trends in mathematics and physics is obtaining solutions and  approximations for equations including those of Schrodinger, Einstein,  Navier-Stokes).  The complicated topic of scattering theory receives its  own chapter, as do angular momentum and radiation by semiclassical  treatment.  For more detailed works, see my reviews of Cao, Carlip,  Kursunoglu, etc., and also the book Quasi-classical Methods.
