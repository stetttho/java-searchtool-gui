 This out-of-print book deserves to be reprinted and bought by everyone.  It is a mathematical physics version of the popular books on elementary forces and elementary particles except gravitation: the electromagnetic,  strong, and weak forces, which occur in quantum electrodynamics (QED),  quantum chromdynamics (QCD), and quantum flavor dynamics (QFD) as well as  the standard and and grand unified models.  The reader without the  mathematical background should buy the book and hire a good consultant or  tutor to translate the book into almost ordinary English or even to teach  the mathematics involved.  The Editor and some other reviewers have  commented on the easy to read bold face print.  Most people do not realize  how rare the use of easy to read print is in physics.  It is more common in  mathematics, thanks largely to Springer/Springer-Verlag publishers in  Germany where Nachtmann is one of the outstanding physics algebraic  theorists.  Nachtmann emphasizes Lagrangian densities and the Hamiltonians  and Least Action Principle related to them, which is one of the highest  level and most effective concepts in all of science and mathematics and  should be understood by people in other fields as well.  I have argued  elsewhere that Lagrangians are a fundamental mathematical logic basis of  the universe (sort of a Kurt Godel type argument in physics - recall the  prize-winning book Godel, Bach, and Escher), but Nachtmann's approach is  algebraic and experimental.
