 This is the best book on Clifford algebra numeric and/or symbolic computations.  See my review of one of the editors, P. Lounesto, under his name.  The book illustrates the fact that algebras, unlike geometries, can be easily manipulated directly with computers (and Clifford algebras also  are used to handle geometric physics).  The editors make sure that each  contribution also advances the mathematical-physical theory of Clifford  algebras.  Packages MATHEMATICA and MAPLE (V) and REDUCE and LUCY are  prominent. Schmeikal of Vienna applies the theory to elementary particle  theory, with quarks as quantized states of orientation.  Gomez et al. of  Mexico have fascinating applications to crystallography including  "quasicrystals", metal lic alloys with non-crystallographic  symmetry but sharp spotted diffraction patterns.  The non-specialist should  buy the book and, if necessary, hire a consultant or tutor to explain it in  closer to ordinary English. Lounesto, by the way, is in Finland with the  rapidly rising Finnish schools of science and mathematics.
