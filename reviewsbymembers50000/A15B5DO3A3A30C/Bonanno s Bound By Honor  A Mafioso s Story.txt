 This is a fascinating book.  At the risk of arguing with Mr. Bonanno, I should point out that anger and honor do not go together very well, no matter how just the cause may seem.  According to him, the Mafia is  descended from the Sicilian underground which fought for Sicilian  independence when foreigners invaded, and he criticizes some of the  upstarts and street toughs (especially with holdings in Cuba and the East  Coast) who took over the American Mafia and moved it toward Dope and other  non-Sicilian interests.  However, without rage and anger, I doubt whether  such things would have occurred (if they did).  Bonanno also attacks the  FBI's CoIntelPro (Counterintelligence program) for helping to destroy the  Mafia's power, as well as the wrong decision of the upstarts to deal in  dope, and claims that the Florida Mafia assassinated President Kennedy for  botching the Bay of Pigs invasion.  I have no idea whether these were true  or not, though it is quite possible, but I again point out that anger,  whether on the good side or the bad side, is one of those things that  enables the overstepping of power.  We need some anger to start fighting  back, but we need Love and Calmness to triumph.
