 Arco and Barron publish the best SAT/PSAT study guides and outlines available, in my opinion.  I have generally found Arco to have harder problems than Barron's in mathematics, but Barron's has introduced  vocabulary flash cards into many of their books - an unbeatable way to  study, which should be extended to all mathematical theorems and  definitions.  See my review of Barron's study guides and sample tests for  more details, but remember to put theorems and definitions on flash cards  BEFORE working massive amounts of problems.  Most people do the reverse and  cannot possibly remember what the theorems say or where to use them from a  pile of homework as big as a garage!  It is OK to have one example flash  card for each theorem, but do not put more than 2 lines of ordinary  handwriting on front and 2 on back of a flash card for rapid shuffling both  alphabetized and non-alphabetized, and learn them backwards and forwards.   In mathematics, an equation is usually as important to read and know from  right to left as from left to right, and likewise with theorems (the  premise or "if" and the conclusion or "then"), and most  students do not know them backwards, which tests easily reveal.  Most  students also do poorly with theorems in shuffled order, especially when  they are trying to remember garage piles of homework.  Homework and massive  problem solving are to practice what you already know in different  contexts, not to learn what theorems and definitions say.
