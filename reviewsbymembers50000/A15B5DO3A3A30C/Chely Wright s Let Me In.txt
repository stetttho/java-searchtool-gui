 You'll find me more often giving science and math book reviews than music reviews, but Chely Wright's Let Me In is one exception.  The one song Shut Up and Drive in this CD is, in my opinion, the fourth best song in the  history of Country and Popular Music (the best is Down at the Twist and  Shout, and most of Willy Nelson's songs tie for second place with Tammy  Wynette's Stand by Your Man).  These are Wake Up Songs and Charge the  Barricades Songs.  With them, Davy Crockett would have beat Santa Ana at  the Alamo.  For anybody who thinks Country Music is second rate, these  songs are as good as Shakespeare's writings and the classical poets.  They  tell a story, make no mistake about it.  Their stories touch the heart, not  just the heartland.  They are part of the Souls and the Spirits of the USA.
