 The other reviewers have excellently analyzed this book, and I'd like to concentrate here on where the idea of breaking the rules fits into history.  In my fields of mathematics and physics teaching and research, history shows that the most creative geniuses broke the rules but also had the most knowledge of the rules.  This combination of knowledge and change characterized creative geniuses across the board, from Socrates to Leonardo Da Vinci and Michaelangelo and Cervantes and Pierre De Fermat, Beethoven and Mozart and Haydn and Schubert and Chopin, to Paul Dirac and Steven Weinberg and Stephen Hawking and Sir Roger Penrose in physics and beyond.  It might be an exaggeration to say that they broke all the rules, but they broke some that nobody had thought of breaking before, and they were prepared to break any that were necessary.  They were both rebels and guardians of civilization, a strange combination called the best of human life.  That's where breaking all the rules in management comes from, in my opinion.
