 This is one of the best SUMMARY books in advanced physics (especially cosmology and elementary particle theory) that I have ever read.  It is impossible to read Allday without finding unusually detailed summaries in  every chapter, each of which is enough to form the outline of several  lectures if not a course.  This ability to summarize information in detail  for non-specialists is generally a sign of what I call the Creative Genius  as opposed to the Ingenious Follower in physics and mathematics, although  there are some exceptions.  It is more common among European authors  (especially British, German, French, Belgian) and Canadian, Australian and  American authors from about Chicago or Texas eastward (don't ask me why, or  I will go into a long discussion that will last for years). Several  publishing companies specialize in it: Springer-Verlag/Springer, Cambridge  University Press, Oxford University Press/Clarendon to a lesser extent.   There is a disadvantage to it in that the author sometimes leaves out open  research questions of the last few years (as Allday unfortunately does).   Kluwer/Plenum and Wiley and Chapman-Hall/Longmans are better in this  respect, being oriented toward the latest open questions.  The American  Mathematical Society publishes in both of the above categories, and the  reader should purchase their books whenever they appear.  If the reader  lacks mathematical or physics specialization, a reputable consultant or  tutor should be hired to help translate into ordinary English (a rare  ability which is also associated with Creative Genius in my opinion).
