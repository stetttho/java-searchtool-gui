 This book by Army Security Agency veteran Owens of the Korean War is like Audie Murphy's To Hell and Back.  It's the story of people who'll live again, like General Lewis "Chesty" Puller, the most decorated Marine of World War II (also of the Korean War) who inspired his men by one of the most unusual philosophies in history - he fought alongside them.  You'll find Marine Captain Joseph J. (Joe) Foss from Sioux Falls South Dakota who won the Medal of Honor and was the first aviator in World War II to exceed the record of Captain Eddie Rickenbacker in WWI and kept surviving his planes being shot down.  You'll find Admiral Halsey here and the whole 1st Marine Division and the Second Marine Division and Army who relieved them later on and the Navy that lost so many men.  You'll find Sergeant "Manila" John Basilone of Buffalo, New York, who did an "Audie Murphy" and won the Medal of Honor.
