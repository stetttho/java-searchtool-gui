 Professor Monks has done an excellent job of summarizing and giving worked out problems for a very useful field of industry that is often neglected in pure and applied mathematics.  This neglect, especially at the pre-college level but also at higher levels, makes it harder for management and  operations research college instructors to convey the quantitative methods  to their students.  These methods are fascinating and include statistical  forecasting (with time series and exponential smoothing, correlation,  regression), statistical quality control, production scheduling and control  (linear programming, dynamic programming), manufacturing /service and  maintenance (queuing theory, reliability, simulation, calculus), budgeting,  inventory, etc.  I recommend this book for everybody in business for  themselves or for others and for students at all levels in order to tie in  their studies more practically with the real economic world.  In addition,  the more people are familiar with the methods, the less employment mistakes  will be made since so many of the methods interact with hiring, firing,  temporary layoffs, etc.  With more talent in the field, alternative methods  can be developed and tried (for example, present theory assumes that a lot  of things involve independent or non-influencing events, but a lot of  events are very interdependent and the theory needs far more development  there - see my review of Castillo).
