 This excellent book and the journal articles on which it was partly based launched the new era of simplifying solutions of differential equations used in physics.  See my review of Vein and Dale's book (1999) for more  details.  Differential equations as used here are equations which involve  speeds, accelerations, and in general rates of change at each time or  place.  To understand what Bluman and Kumei (BK for short) do in everyday  language, remember that an equation, such as E = m times c-squared,  involves variables like E (energy), m (mass).  BK had the idea of CHANGING  the variables to other variables (called SYMMETRY TRANSFORMATIONS)which are  easier to handle but which still work.  When the new variables ultimately  depend not only on the old variables but also on their rates of change or  speed, accelerations, etc., they are called LIE-BACKLUND SYMMETRIES, which  are often closely related to CONTACT SYMMETRIES (ones that only involve  speeds or single rates of change).  These play an important role in Vein  and Dale's book and in general in solutions of physics equations such as  the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) and sine-Gordon equations.  In a later review,  I hope to describe also Bluman and Kumei's use of Lie groups and other  matters.
