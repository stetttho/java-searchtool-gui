 I agree with reviewer Jordan and others.  This is a great album, and the song I Hope You Dance is definitely in the league with the best including Reba.   It reminds me of the Australian rock idol who played in Grease and  married a billionaire - let's see, what's her name now?  Well, I hope Lee  Ann Womack stays around Nashville Suburbs, which extends all the way to  Alaska and Hawaii but not quite Australia.
