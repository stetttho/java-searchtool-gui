 The Editor has done an excellent job of reviewing, as usual, and I just want to add a few details.  Levine has a Ph.D. in computer science from Yale, and Young also has a Degree from Yale.  You generally cannot go wrong  with a mathematics, physics, or computer science book from Harvard, Yale,  Princeton, MIT, etc.  The ability to translate difficult concepts into  ordinary English for all people requires Creative Genius of the highest  order.  See my reviews of some of the Schaum's Outlines and Scientific  American for more on this, and some of my other mathematics and physics  book reviews discuss it too.  Translating in these fields requires moving  from quantitative to qualitative or verbal language, and it often helps  inspire the expert as much as the reader with new ideas.  Levine et al are  experts at summarizing, alphabetizing, isolating the core concepts,  isolating errors and counterexamples, all of them key skills in translating  into ordinary English.
