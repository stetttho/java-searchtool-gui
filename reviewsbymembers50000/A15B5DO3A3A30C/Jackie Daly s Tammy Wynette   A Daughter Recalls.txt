 Jackie and Tom Carter have written a powerful book here.  I'm amazed by the anger expressed by many other reviewers and the personal charges which they make against Daly's character and work ethic.  Anger and blame are the  opposite of the spirit of Stand By Your Man, though they are more  reminiscent of the way Hilary treated Tammy.  The drug culture of music and  acting is an anger-blame culture, with its less obvious side of over-praise  and over-material love.  See my review of One of Ours (the Oklahoma City  bombing) for more on this.  Contrary to the angry reviewers, this book is  about much more than anger and blaming.  It is about how Tammy Wynette and  her co-composer wrote Stand By Your Man, how Tammy courageously survived  husbands who skipped out on her (nothing new in the Clinton Non-Great  Society and before), and about Tammy's courageous battles against alcohol  and drugs with the help of her children (which some readers seem to think  is an unmentionable revelation for Nashville).  Some anger does seep  through in the book, but the readers' attacks on Jackie Daly reveal much  more about the anger with which women are treated by our society (whether  daughters or mothers).  That disrespect for women is the real story of  Tammy Wynette, and I urge readers to buy the book just to see it in action.
