 Schaum's College Outlines are the best outline/summary/worked problems series that I have every found.  Readers, especially students, need to be cautioned, however, that outlines and summaries and worked problems only  work usually if you use them right.  For example, most students work  problems before putting definitions and theorems or equations or theory  onto flash cards and learning the latter four first, or they just work  problems and forget flash cards for theorems and definitions.  Try studying  a pile of homework problems as tall as a room before an exam!  Multiply  this by the number of exams, both in High School (which should be using  Schaum's Algebra, by the way) and college, and it spells FAILURE.   Problems, even those worked out for you, only are useful AFTER you know  exactly what the theorems and definitions say (with one example for each),  preferably backwards and forwards and shuffled (as you can only do on flash  cards).  A card should only have 2 lines or less of ordinary size writing  on front and 2 lines on back for rapid shuffling and reading. I'll have  more to say about this in other reviews.
