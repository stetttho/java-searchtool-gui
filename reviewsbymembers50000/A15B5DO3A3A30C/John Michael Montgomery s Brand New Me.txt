 This album is worth it just for The Little Girl.  Although the music of The Little Girl is not outstanding, and the lyrics might offend people of some religions because of the specific reference to Christianity, the spirit of the song is unsurpassed.  It is a spirit for all times and all seasons, and it teaches human courage and religious values and the horrors of child and spouse abuse.  It teaches us that from the ashes and from death and from horror arise life and love and understanding and faith.  I can think of no greater message, and I hope that other religions and other ethical people will contribute analogous songs according to their own beliefs.
