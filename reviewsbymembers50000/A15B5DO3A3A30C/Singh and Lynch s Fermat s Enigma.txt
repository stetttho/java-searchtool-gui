 Pierre De Fermat was in my opinion the greatest mathematician of all time  except possibly for Pythagoras.  We are still discovering astonishing  things about him.  He lived in the 1600s, mostly before Newton (with a  slight overlap), but he invented/discovered large parts of the calculus  before Newton.  He invented analytic geometric before Descartes (Descartes  was so furious at his secretiveness that he spent much of his life trying  to ruin Fermat's career as a government lawyer/official in France).  With  Pascal, he invented probability theory.  He invented modern number theory,  which is key to cryptography among other things.  The search for the proof  of Fermat's Last Theorem resulted in the founding of several major branches  of advanced algebra and number theory.  He discovered major results in  physics including optics before Newton and in fact in my opinion may have  anticipated parts of Einstein's special theory of relativity because of his  interest in optics (where he correctly found that light slows down in  water, contrary to Descartes' findings) and the similarity of the  quadratic(square) expression in Fermat's Last Theorem to the vital beta or  1/beta factor in the Lorentz contraction of special relativity.  Fermat was  roughly 300-350 years ahead of his time, and the only scientist who was  more ahead of him appears to have Leonardo Da Vinci of the Renaissance who  may have been 400 or so years ahead of his time.  Even Einstein was only a  few years ahead of his time because the mathematics apparatus was already  in place when Einstein reinterpreted it from a physics viewpoint.   McInerny's review is very good, but don't be surprised if somebody  discovers a much shorter proof than Wiles' based on the reinterpretation of  the word "margin" to mean difference in variables/numbers.
