 This book deserves a Nobel Prize for translating difficult mathematics into ordinary English and for enabling the public to literally use computer and mathematical techniques with almost no knowledge of mathematics.  It is useful for the small and large businessman, the manager and the employee,  the student, the teacher, service employees, young and old alike.  It  allows you to access some of the most advanced techniques of analyzing the  stock market (neural networks) with the touch of few buttons.  You learn  the basic computer techniques of statistics (multiple and linear  regression), database management, linear programming, and even how to use  calculus and logic, with practically no effort.  There is an excellent  section on fear of mathematics based on the latest research, which will be  valuable for everybody (see some of my reviews on mathematics study aids  like Schaum's Outlines).  May's orientation toward translating difficult  mathematics into ordinary English for the public is the type of thing that  I believe in in my book reviews at Amazon.com and in my other writings.  In  my opinion, it takes the most creative genius to be able to do that, and  the translator learns more about the subject himself or herself and is  often very inspired creatively by reformulating quantitative into verbal or  qualitative language.  The Virginia colleges and universities and the CIA  can be proud of May, who represents the best that America has achieved.
