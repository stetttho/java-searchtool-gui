 I have been a lifetime fan of Agatha Christie, and I was fortunate enough to spend two years in London where I obtained an M.A. Degree at the University of London.  I spent much of my time taking trains and  undergrounds or "tubes" (subways in "American"), and I  can testify that Agatha's book is faithful to trains and Great Britain in  almost every detail and also in spirit. In fact, we are talking about one  of the most educated nations in the world, whose university system is  (along with those of France, Germany, and Belgium) the best in the world,  in my opinion.  British people really do search for knowledge much of the  time where other people search for "ego trips" and bathing in the  sun.  The British subways in the 1950s and 1960s (when I was there) and  when I returned to visit later were an incredible contrast with New York  subways.  In New York, you are lucky not to get mugged on a subway, and  there is usually constant noise.  In England, it would be very rare to get  mugged on a subway and there is almost constant silence and respect for  other people.  This is what helped them get through World War 2, a spirit  of concern for others and for knowledge and learning and a respect for  others and for themselves.  Long live the books and the spirit of Agatha  Christie!
