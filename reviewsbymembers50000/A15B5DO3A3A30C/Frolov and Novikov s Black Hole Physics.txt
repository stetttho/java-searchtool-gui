 I referenced these authors and also Klapdor-Kleingrothaus and Zuber (see my review of their book) in my paper on Quantum Gravity delivered before Professor Kursunoglu's Orbis Scientiae Quantum Gravity conference in  December, 1999 (see my review of Kursunoglu).  The Editor has summarized  the book in his usual excellent way, and here I should just add that there  is much material in this book not covered in others, including  relationships with 2+1 dimensional quantum gravity (see my review of  Carlip, black holes inside monopoles, dilatons, quantum hair, etc.   Everyone should buy this book and, if necessary, hire a consultant or tutor  to translate it into more simple English.
