 Readers should start a campaign to reprint and/or get a new edition of this book. Professor Paul Lorrain is not only a recipient of the Legion of Honor of France and the equivalent of Montreal, Canada, but his book is a work of CREATIVE GENIUS.  His problems contain very interesting  applications of electromagnetism which both the public and specialists can  identify with, including magnetic monopoles (very strange theoretical  entities with only one pole instead of the usual north and south poles of  magnets - see my reviews of Kursunoglu, Frolov, Klapdor-Kleingothaus, etc.)  that are predicted by physics Grand Unified Theories, superconductors   which have turned out to have remarkably important uses today (and the  ferromagnetism which is closely related to them), the earth's magnetic  field which is related to modern geophysics, hysteresis which is related to  an important modern branch of nonlinear mathematics as well, artificial  satellites which are so important today, solar wind which is extremely  important today, and even the theory of continuous creation of electric  charge.  In addition, there are many chapters on electromagnetics in  relativity (see my reviews of Weinberg and Misner et al.), Maxwell's  equations, magnetic fields, electric fields, plane electromagnetic waves  (see my review of A. Bohm), guided waves, radiation.  Lorrain makes  electromagnetism interesting, open minded on new ideas, and  interdisciplinary, all characteristics of Creative Genius.  The general  public should also hire consultants or tutors to summarize this book or  even teach it to them - it is well worth the effort because its ideas apply  to fields far beyond physics.  It should be mentioned that Lorrain et al  give excellent summaries in the book, but the general reader might want  some of them translated into closer to elementary mathematics or even  approximately English.
