 I can't compete with the Editor and the other reviewers who've been doing this for a long time (I'm a mathematician and physicist sometimes doing reviews of scientific books), but I do want to say that Down at the Twist  and Shout ranks in my mind along with Tammy Wynette's Stand by Your Man and  Willy Nelson's songs as the best that Country Music or any popular music  has ever produced, although George Strait and the old timers and some of  the others around now including McBride also do a very good job.  I'm also  a fan of classical music, especially Mozart, Beethoven, Shubert, Hayden,  Chopin, but when I'm about to fall asleep in the car or outside nothing can  wake me up like Down at the Twist and Shout, and that's a real test.
