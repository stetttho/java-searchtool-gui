 I usually review math and science books, but this is an outstanding CD.  "Crazy" from Patsy Cline is one of the best songs of all time, and in my opinion modern singers who bring back some of the best of all  time should get a medal for singing beyond the call of duty.  Also, singing  the best vibes makes them part of you, and if you do enough of that you can  create your own new greats.  As one review says, the style here is between  Patsy Cline and Tammy Wynette, two of the greatest in the history of not  only Country but Popular Music.  There's also Hank and also very good  lesser songs.  My case rests content.
