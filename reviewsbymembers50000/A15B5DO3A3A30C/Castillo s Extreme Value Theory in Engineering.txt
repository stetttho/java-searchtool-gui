 This is one of the best books that I have every read in engineering.  Castillo and a few others like Galambos were some of the first people to realize the importance of extreme values.  A maximum is an example of an  extreme value, because it is the top or highest value.  Likewise for a  minimum.  These extremes behave quite differently from most ordinary things  and have a mathematics and engineering all of their own.  They have been  applied also to other fields where "extremes" in an intuitive  sense exist, such as extreme accidents in car insurance (long chain  collisions of cars in the fog, heights of waves in the ocean, etc.).  They  are also closely related to one of the most important new research areas in  mathematics: large deviations or rare events theory (see my reviews of  Dembo and others).  The Gumbel, Weibull, and Frechet probability  distributions are important in this area.  Those readers who are not  specialists should buy the book anyway and hire a consultant or tutor to  translate the mathematics into closer to ordinary English, because extreme  as well as rare events occur almost everywhere.
