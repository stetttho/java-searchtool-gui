 Johnson and Kotz in particular continue their series of ongoing descriptions and analyses of probability/statistics distributions which is an ingenious production.  They have the Creative Genius talents of  summarizing, organizing, emphasizing open questions, and open mindedness to  new ideas (although I have not quite tested them on some very ideas of my  own).  These qualities in various combinations can also be found in  Allday's 1998 book in physics (which I reviewed)and Weinberg's 1974 and  later books in physics (some of which I reviewed).  Johnson et al. have  some Creative Genius categories which are rarely found.  For one thing,  they cross-categorize distributions ("graphs" for the  non-specialist)by their applications to real world problems, which is  usually notoriously lacking in math and physics publications (beyond one or  two problems).  Secondly, they CHARACTERIZE distributions by various  properties such as heredity (the same distribution holds for a sum of  variables as for one variable, etc.), exponential derivation from other  distributions, conditional expectations (I would prefer logic-based  probability (LBP) expectations, but it's better than nothing), etc.  In  other words, their very categorization of distributions is by critical  research categories and fundamental logical-factual categories, at least as  far as they know them.  I recommend this book and the whole series from the  same authors (or at least most of them) without reservations except the  ones mentioned for LBP, and I urge specialists in these fields to recommend  that their students and even "laymen" (non-academic  people)purchase this volume and hire a consultant or tutor to translate  them or explain them in closer to ordinary English if their  probability/statistical background is lacking or deficient.
