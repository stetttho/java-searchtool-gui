 Every day, veterans of the Vietnam War commit suicide in deep depression.  With the United States almost continually cutting its Veterans Administration budget, you would think that the V.A. would give up, but  books like those of Beck help it treat and cure depression and anxiety.   The Cognitive Therapy uses Socratic questioning, training people to ask why  they feel sad or anxious, what their answers mean, to substitute more  effective coping thoughts for ineffective thoughts and wrong ideas  (illogical ideas, like "everybody is against me," "I'm born  to fail," etc.).  Patients record in diaries or logs what events  trigger these wrong thoughts and learn to instantly respond with other  thoughts and actions.  This is one of the greatest books in psychology and  psychiatry, and should be read by the young people of all ages (many of  whom are depressed) as well as the older ones.
