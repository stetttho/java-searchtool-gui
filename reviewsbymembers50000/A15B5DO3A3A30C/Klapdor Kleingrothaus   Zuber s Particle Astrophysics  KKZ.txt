 Although this is a graduate level astrophysics test, I recommend that everyone purchase it and hire a consultant or tutor to translate it into closer to ordinary English.  This book goes where popular science usually  stops: into the details of space, time, and elementary particles.  It is  written by a member of the Max-Planck Institute in Heidelberg, one of the  world's most famous institutes of physics, and is full of both experimental  and theoretical results on dark matter, quasars, galaxy formation,  monopoles, neutrinos, axioms, nucleosynthesis, etc.  Most topics have  entire chapters, whereas popular science books might just mention them.   For more on monopole theory and dark matter, see my reviews of Kursunoglu  and others.  KKZ have a whole section on Dirac monopoles, a whole section  on 't Hoof Polyakov monopoles.  My review of Cao does not emphasize this,  but Cao's book also is a good source for information on elementary  particles and physics-astrophysics relationships.
