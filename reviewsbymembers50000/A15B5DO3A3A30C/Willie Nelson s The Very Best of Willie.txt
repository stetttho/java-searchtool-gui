 Various of Willie's songs of this album have been reviewed in detail by the editors and customers elsewhere in amazon.com, and I'll just say that On the Road Again and Pancho are some of the reasons why Willie Nelson is  one of the three greatest people in the history of Country Music, in my  opinion.  They call these Outlaw Country.  I call them Spirit of the Law  Country.  Letter of the Law asks where, who, what, when, how.  Spirit of  the Law asks why.  Which one do you think gets the answer?
