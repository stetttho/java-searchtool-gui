 Professor David Ruelle of France has a whole chapter on irreversibility in his book Chance and Chaos (see my review).  Ievitably increasing entropy (disorder) is an example of an irreversible phenomenon, according to  thermodynamics.  The present book's editors are mostly from the University  of Texas and Mexico.  They have done an outstanding job in identifying the  errors in the old Hilbert space formulation of quantum mechanics, including  the facts that neither plane waves nor delta functions are finitely square  integrable (the reader can think of this roughly as a lack of finiteness  property) and neither are the eigenvectors of points of the continuous  spectrum of self-adjoint operators (self adjoint operators are mathematical  descriptions of things that can be observed in physics as opposed to only  "theoretical" or even non-observable objects, which descriptions  themselves are criticized by one of the authors in the book, Antoine of  Belgium, as involving nonmathematical operational content).  Also, Hilbert  spaces (HS for short) cannot support unsmeared field operators and in  general very singular operators (they end up with domain zero). Separable  HSs are isomorphic (this means roughly that they correspond algebraically  or mathematically to each other very exactly), but quantum systems  supposedly described by them turn out not to be.  There is only time here  to say that this book and the papers on which it was based essentially  remedied the problem by expanding Hilbert spaces to slightly more general  spaces, which was an ingenious achievement.  However, I believe that they  may have to be expanded more severely to Banach spaces (which I may discuss  in a later review of the book).  Readers unfamiliar with the mathematics  should hire reputable consultants or tutors to translate the book into a  closer approximation to English, in order to keep up with one of the most  important areas of quantum theory and to hopefully learn to use similar  techniques in their own fields when needed.
