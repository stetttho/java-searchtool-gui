 I would like to further clarify some points made in my previous review and add a few points.  The topology school of quantum gravity not only includes string theory but also for example the black hole 2+1 dimensional model in  Carlip (see my review) and enters into almost every 2+1 dimensional model  of quantum gravity.  As for the algebra school, some of the best work has  been done by William Pezzaglia, Jr. (whose papers will be found in Chisholm  and some of the other books that I have reviewed).  Pezzaglia shows that an  interesting generalization of the principle of equivalence is worth  considering: namely, that the laws of physics are invariant under  transformations between different types of algebraic entities such as  bivectors, vectors, trivectors, and even pseudo-bivectors, pseudo-vectors,  etc.  This means that the laws of physics are invariant across dimensions,  which would fit in nicely with Carlip's and others' work on 2+1 dimensional  quantum gravity instead of 3+1 (3 space dimensions and 1 time dimension)  dimensional quantum gravity.  There still remains the difficult problem  pointed out in Carlip that some of the different dimensional results do not  extend to the other dimension(s).
