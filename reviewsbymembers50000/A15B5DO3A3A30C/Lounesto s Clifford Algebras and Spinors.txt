 Clifford algebras make geometry and its applications to advanced physics incredibly simple, and this book is one of the best that I have read on this topic and on spinors.  Readers outside physics should also study this book, if necessary with the help of a consultant or tutor to translate into  more or less ordinary English, because most fields of science or industry  are in need of tremendous simplification.  Lounesto's approach is  algebraic, as is Okubo's (see my review of his book) and Chisholm's  (likewise), and Cambridge University Press as usual is at the head of the  field in publishing the deepest and yet most simple topics.  Spinors (the  word comes from spin plus the ending -ors) describe spin in quantum theory,  and Lounesto has the most detailed division of the types of spinors that I  have seen in a book together with their physical applications.  Weyl and  Majorana spinors describe the neutrino (of the weak force, although the  former only describe massless neutrinos), flagpole spinors appear to  describe the strong nuclear force/interaction and appear to be related to  quark confinement, Dirac spinors describe the electron (Weyl and Majorana  spinors, unlike Dirac spinors, are singular with a light-like  pole/current).  Penrose flags (see my reviews of Roger Penrose's books) are  related to Weyl and Majorana spinors.  Penrose has an interesting theory of  twistors which is well reviewed in some of the popular science books.
