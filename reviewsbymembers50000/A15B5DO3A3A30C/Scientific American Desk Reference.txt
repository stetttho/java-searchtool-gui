 The Editor as usual has given an outstanding review of the book, and I would like to add a few thoughts.  Scientific American, the journal, is probably the greatest source of scientific inspiration for the general public except popular science books.  What the public may not know is that  scientists also get considerable inspiration from Scientific American,  although they usually do not cite it in their scientific articles because  it is not monitored by their particular departmental bureaucracies and  appeals to the general public rather than only specialists.  An example of  an article that most scientists would not find except through the  Scientific American is the article "Quantum Teleportation" by  Anton Zeilinger of the University of Vienna in the April 2000 issue of  Scientific American.  The ability and interest of Scientific American in  communicating difficult and specialized science to the public and  translating it and summarizing it for the public is nothing less than  Creative Genius, and in my opinion Creative Genius (as opposed to Ingenious  Followers or Follower Genius) usually goes together with interest in  communicating with and translating to the public.
