 Professor of Astrophysics Gott of Princeton discusses one of the most creative ideas concerning the universe, time, time travel.  In following him and his Ph.D. student Li-Xin Li, we read in amazingly clear language about the latest research in astrophysics and the physics of the universe (cosmology), including string theory, inflation, chaotic inflation, budding universes with and without time loops, and the older origin of these theories with Wheeler and Feynman of Princeton and their split wave advanced-retarded theory which explained quantum strangeness and the strange results of double slit diffraction experiments which seem to indicate that light "knows" the open vs closed path that lies ahead of it.  In this, they carry atrophysicist Gribbin's (of Cambridge University) popular books much further.  Part of the combined universes in Gott's picture appear finite like an endless circle or sphere that one can go around continually with a backwards time loop, although later universes may lack such loops....
