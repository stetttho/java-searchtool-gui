 The one song "The Chain of Love" is worth buying the whole  album.  One reviewer describes it as amazing, and I agree.  It is the most  remarkable song about a man who is not selfish and helps people (whether  poor or wealthy) in need, a man named Joe.  It is very applicable to the  modern world of car breakdowns, and yet it has an eternal truth from  Biblical times whose parallel is amazing.  I'd vote for Joe in the coming  election, whether he's losing or winning in popularity, and I think that  the chain of love will win in the only judgement that really  counts. Osher Doctorow
