 This and the 1995 similar book by Fogel are full of a wealth of worked out problems and should be  a must for physics and engineering students.  Many of the problems resemble non-worked-out problems in textbooks, so students  can learn methods applicable to their own school texts.  Sometimes problems  of the same category are scattered in different chapters, so be sure to  consult the index under many variations of the same theme and different  words in the same topic.  The usual cautions about putting the essence of  the problems on flash cards need to be made (not more than 2 ordinary  handwritten lines on front and back of a 3x5 card, etc.), and the student  should not use this book before learning exactly what the theorems and  definitions say (also to be put on flash cards and learned before doing the  problems), since there is almost no way to remember or even recognize the  profusion of problems for an examination without some organization,  condensation, summarization, and learning of the basic ideas behind them.
