 While I am glad to see the current rush to purchase M. Greene's best seller (which I reviewed), there are good arguments for putting first priority on Watson's The Double Helix.  Not only did Watson and Crick win  the Nobel Prize for discovering the structure of DNA, but Watson reveals  much about what makes a Creative Genius tick (which Greene's book does  not).  One of these ingredients is non-conformity, even non-conformity with  the mainstream of one's own field of research.  Watson is non-conformist to  the point of embarrassment, revealing his arguments with colleagues whom I  would describe as Ingenious Followers in part at least (as well as those  colleagues' own weaknesses).  Secondly, Creative Geniuses have an unusually  strong motivation typically.  In the case of Watson and Crick, they had a  competitive spirit to win against their colleagues (who were also trying to  unravel DNA) in the race for the discovery, and their competitive spirit  was an absolute obsession "day and night".  Thirdly, they built  ingenious toy models of DNA with movable parts which enabled them to use  more sensory modalities to help them think.  Fourthly, they kept up  completely with what their rivals were doing, which is to say that they  sought and used information wisely and in a timely manner.  Fifth, they  used the computer technology of their era to the fullest (which Creative  Geniuses sometimes do not do - compare Roger Penrose, whose books I have  reviewed).  Sixth, they were incredibly mobile - they went to different  countries frequently to learn, to attend seminars, to talk with experts in  particular areas, especially countries in Europe (where Creative Geniuses  are more common, in my opinion, than in most parts of the world).  You will  find many other characteristics of Creative Geniuses by reading the  Watson-Crick story yourself.
