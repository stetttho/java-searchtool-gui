 I have reviewed an equally creative scientist, Michio Kaku (see under Kaku's books in Amazon.com), and Gribbin maintains his usual reputation for creativity in science.  His backward time traveling wave theory may or may  not be correct, but it still inspires me years after reading the book.   Creative geniuses in science seek to inspire both others and themselves by  translating difficult science into ordinary English or other language more  or less.  Since most scientists are Ingenious Followers, we should be  lenient if some technical mistakes are made in the process.  Gribbin is  absolutely correct in his description of the collapse of the Copenhagen  Complementarity Interpretation; for a more mathematical and physically  complicated description which still deserves to be read by everyone  (possibly with the help of consultants or tutors), see T. Y. Cao's 1997  book in Amazon.com (which I also reviewed).  Rather than criticize Gribbin  for not adhering to scientific materialism with 100% accuracy, we should  praise him for adhering to the spirit of scientific inquiry, creativity,  learning with as little human error as possible and with inspiration both  of oneself and others.  (Come to think of it, this would have been a better  speech for Marcus Aurelius than his "the good is buried...the evil  lingers on," speech, but then he was living in a relatively  unscientific era.)
