 The review by Kirkus Associates is excellent, and many of the other  reviews are very good.  The 13 thinking tools of the world's most creative  people, according to the authors, are abstracting, analogizing, body  thinking (body images), dimensional thinking, empathizing (feeling empathy  with objects, processes, others), forming patterns, imaging (thinking of  things by using mental images of them, whether realistic or  "distorted"), modeling, observing, playing, recognizing patterns,  synthesizing (combining, etc.), transforming.  The study of genius as an  "extreme" of knowledge discovery is long past its due in  education from elementary through university, and has many clues for  improving education.  Geniuses not only cross fields from science through  art, but tend to be interdisciplinary, appear to be well grounded both in  basics and intuition/thinking/mental processes, and use imagery (by the  way, using imagery is taught by a number of cognitive psychologists and  psychoanalysts for mental health as well).  Robert Bernstein's physiology  background helps him unlock some of the physiological processes of genius,  and Michele's historical background helps trace back the characteristics of  pre-modern geniuses.  There is probably much more to the story, but this  book is an excellent start.
