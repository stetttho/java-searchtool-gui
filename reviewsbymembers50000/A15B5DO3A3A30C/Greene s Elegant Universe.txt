 This is the best popularization of string theory that I have read, by a scientist who contributed very much to it.  It is a must for everybody's library.  If there are some concepts that are still not clear, hire a  consultant or tutor specializing in translating mostly non-mathematical  physics into ordinary English.  Greene joins the ranks of other scientists  who popularize science with this book (see my reviews of Kaku's book,  Gribbin's book, etc. in Amazon.com).  However, I need to make a special  note of caution with respect to Greene's book.  We need to adopt a slightly  wait-and-see attitude here, because string theorists have been among the  least interested in popularizing (in fact, they sometimes popularize  through other writers, which seems to be a strange thing to do if you are  really a creative genius).  String theory itself needs to be taken with a  slightly wait-and-see attitude.  Although the Nobel Laureate Steven  Weinberg, who has almost always been right, went over to string theory (see  my review of Weinberg's book) in disgust at field theory, I think that  string theory is at most an approximation to the real world, and as T. Y.  Cao points out (1997 - see my review of Cao's book), its  philosophical-logical structure is not well developed.  It also needs  experimental confirmation badly, and even if it gets it, it could still be  in the position of Newton vs. Einstein ("tomorrow there is  modification").  Greene does inspire (so did some strange politicians  in history), and in science but not politics this is a definite 5-star  quality.
