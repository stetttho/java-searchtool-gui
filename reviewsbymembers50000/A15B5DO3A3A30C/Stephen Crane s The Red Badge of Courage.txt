 Why is the Red Badge of Courage so hard to read until about the middle of the book?   I think it's because Crane throws us into the world of fear in the first half - fear, cowardice, panic, the confusion and disorganization  of war.  We're not used to being treated like this, either by books or the  real world.  I can identify with Crane because the first half of my life  was like that.  It's OK to be afraid.  You can even start reading from the  middle and eventually go backwards if it's frustrating.  As for life, at  some point in life, if you really keep trying, fear gets tiresome and  repetitive.  You begin to despise yourself as a coward, and you only see  images of cowardice around you.  The uselessness of following the crowd and  some of the fairy tales you learned hit you like a brick.  You see too much  destruction, whether in hot wars or cold wars, industry or the academic  world.  One day, when you have nothing left to lose, you try a new strategy  called courage.  You might feel a lot of anger when doing it, but you have  to eventually learn to act out of calmness and yes, even love.  You fight  back because of the things and people you've lost.  You become a Veteran,  whether in war or in peace with illness like Crane himself.  You learn that  there are things more important than your own life.  Then you're like Audie  Murphy, Mahatma Gandhi, Stephen Crane, Galileo Galilei, Saint Thomas More.   And the strangest thing of all is that they're right.  There are things  more important than your own life.  One of them is called Courage.
