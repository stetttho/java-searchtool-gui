 The Editor and most other customers have given great reviews of this book, and I'd like to add a few points.  This book gives the case for exploring space.  It shows the tremendous insight of President John F. Kennedy in  launching the space era and the political budget-cutting pressures for  trying to destroy the space era.  It includes some of the most ingenious  inventions for space travel, including the use of superconductors and  magnetic sails.  One reader has criticized the book's equations (there are  only a few of them), which actually are ordinary algebra.  The solution is  not to abandon the book but hire a reputable consultant or tutor to explain  the equations and translate them into close to ordinary English.  As for  the reader who thinks we are alone in space, it is hard to believe that  after the discovery of so many stars with planets in the universe.  I do  think that we need more job security for aerospace engineers, and one way  might be to not fire them when downsizing before we find other jobs for  them.  By the way, Zubrin's Mars Society is on the internet and there is a  local branch at Caltech.
