 ... I saw this production at the Public many years ago and the "great" Miss Worth (Irene-y, as she was pretentiously called) didn't seem to understand a single word of what she was saying.  Even the simplest lines were delivered in a bloated actorese. Broadway acting at its most self-important and awful. How could the dvd possibly be any good?
