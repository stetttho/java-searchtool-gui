 Sometimes an old record doesn't sound as good as you remembered.  The truth is, this classic original version pales in comparison with the many live versions Coltrane was to produce in the next few years.  Here, he still doesn't know his way around the soprano yet, and he struggles, sometimes painfully, to control the horn. Although his, much lauded, radical reconception of the song is still there, it's really not a bad song.  It's hardly comparable to Sonny Rollins' versions of "I'm an Old Cowhand" or "There's No Business Like Show Business," truly execrable ditties transformed into stellar jazz.  For the rest of the album, JC is back on the tenor, so this is an obvious must-buy, but if you want to hear him really tear up MFT, get any of the Impulse versions and hear the difference.
