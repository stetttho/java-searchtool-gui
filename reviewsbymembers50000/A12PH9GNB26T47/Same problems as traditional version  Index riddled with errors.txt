 The first entry I looked up in the index, 'xiang(1,4)', was listed as being on p 368 but in reality was on p 386.  Pretty bad for a reference book, where being able to look things up is kind of important. Looks like they learned nothing from publishing the original, traditional characters, version. That index was also error-ridden.  This could've been a very useful book if they had hired an editor or even a proofreader.  Shameful job.
