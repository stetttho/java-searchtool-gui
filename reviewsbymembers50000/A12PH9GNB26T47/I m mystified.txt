 I'm mystified how this book could possibly be of any help to anyone wanting to learn about the Renaissance or the artists of the period. There is a chronology and some very short bios but the whole purpose of the  "handbook" seems to be to support the author's bizarre  "graphics" which purport to illustrate the influence of one  painter or school on another.  These so-called graphics resemble the  graffiti that might have been found in the men's room of the Cedar Tavern  during the heyday of the Abstract Expressionists.  There are some nice but  small color repros that the skimpy text does nothing to serve, otherwise, I  can think of nothing good to say about this mistitled work at all.
