 ...but together we are strong!"  If these words give you goosebumps, then this movie is for you. How fortunate for our protagonist, that just when he's searching for a nice body to attach to his fiance's head, they're holding a Body Beautiful pageant in his town.  But just like a woman, his fiance actually gets angry at him for keeping her head alive in a tray. Sometimes you just can't win. While this film has everything you could expect from a so-bad-its-good movie, there are also flashes of intelligence, halfway-decent acting and nice camerawork. Not enough to keep it from being fun, though. A classic of its tiny genre.
