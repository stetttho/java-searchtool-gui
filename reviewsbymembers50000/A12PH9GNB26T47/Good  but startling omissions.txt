 Where are The Fly, Popeye the Hitchhiker, Loddy Lo, Bristol Twistin' Mama, and Hully Gully Baby, to name just a few off the top of my head?  These were big hits!!!  There are some excellent obscurities such as The Popeye Waddle and Bob Seger's East Side Story, which who would ever have guessed was released by CP and not some tiny defunct Detroit label? Obscurities are great, sure, but let's get all the hits down first.  Fans have been waiting forever for the original CP catalogue to come to CD, and in spite of most of the good stuff, there's a lot of crap here, too.  Heartbreaking.  I sure hope there's a comprehensive Dovells comp coming out.  Chub deserves better representation, too.  Has it been forgotten what a giant he was?  Between Elvis and the Beatles, no one was bigger. For Christ's sake, the twist changed the world!
