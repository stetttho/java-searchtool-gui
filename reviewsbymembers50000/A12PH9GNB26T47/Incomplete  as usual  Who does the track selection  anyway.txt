 The true fan always suffers. A previous 2-disc collection omitted the huge hit Together Again, this one leaves off I Don't Need No Doctor, his late-career, probably most-covered classic. (I've noticed this tendency with other artists' Greatest Hits albums, too.)  Back in the vinyl days, there was a reason: Atlantic had half his hits, RCA the other, but there's no excuse now.   Let us hope that now that one of the greatest musicians of the twentieth century has passed away, someone will finally put out a good, representative retrospective.  They might even find someone who's familiar with his work to pick the tracks!
