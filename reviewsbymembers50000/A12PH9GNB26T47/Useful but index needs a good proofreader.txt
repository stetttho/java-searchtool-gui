 This is a very helpful, easy-to-use book for beginners.  It has a lot of the characters you come across at first.  What I can't find here the What Character is It? is a good supplement for.  The one caveat is that for the Additional Characters section, a good part of the book, the index is riddled with mistakes.  I hope they come out with a new edition and correct this very frustrating flaw.  But still, this is the book I refer to first and mostly.
