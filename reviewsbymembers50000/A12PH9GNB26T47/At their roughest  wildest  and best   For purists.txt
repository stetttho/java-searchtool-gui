 Twist and Shout, Twistin' with Linda, You Better Come Home are some of the most delirous and funkiest songs ever recorded. Much preferable to their weaker Motown crossover efforts.  Unfortunately, there is the usual filler, covers, etc., and, not being recorded for Wand, Shout 1 & 2 aren't here either, but it's still worth 5 stars for evoking the early days of R&B, when records had real soul.
