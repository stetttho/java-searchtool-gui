 Like Invaders from Mars, IOTBS, and a few others, about people suddenly starting to act weird for some goddam reason.  Turns out to be pods or something else taking over their bodies.  Also, in this case, about how, metaphorically, your spouse becomes a stranger after the wedding.  WHY ISN'T THIS MOVIE ON DVD!?!?!?!?!?!?!
