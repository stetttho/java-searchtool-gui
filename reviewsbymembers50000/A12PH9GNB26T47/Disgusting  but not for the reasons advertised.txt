 What is truly disgusting is the way these smarmy, smug and self-satisfied comics, many who are otherwise quite talented, smirk and laugh about how funny they imagine themselves to be. (Except for Red Skelton, I always thought comedians weren't supposed to laugh at their own jokes!)  This incredibly amateurishly shot and edited film might be viewed with some interest as a distasteful inside look at the incestuous world of celebity sycophancy, but discriminating lovers and purveyors of filthy humor are sure to be disappointed.
