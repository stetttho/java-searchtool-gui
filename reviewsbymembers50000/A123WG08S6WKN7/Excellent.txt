 In my mind, the Fodor's Italy guide is an excellent resource to help you get around Italy.  From its hotel and restuarant suggestions to recommended sights both principal and off-beat, Fodor's identifies wonderful things to visit.  I have yet to find a disapointing restaurant suggestion.  In particular, their sections on Tuscany, Umbria, and Venice are so spot on that following them closely left me with an enriched aesthetic, culinary, and historical understanding of Italy. What I so appreciate about this guide is the respectful tone it uses to talk about religious or historical sites.  Irrespective of what people may think about Catholicism, Italy is the center of the Catholic Church and has numerous religious shrines.  Other guide books often have a sarcastic tone when describing some Catholic sites, almost forgetting that many people visit Italy for religious reasons.
