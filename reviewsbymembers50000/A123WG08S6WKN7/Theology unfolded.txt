 This is an excellent book for those Christians who wish to gain a deeper understanding of Jesus's teaching "unless you become like this child...".  This book also provides a helpfull resource to Catholics  who may be constantly challenged by fundamentalist Christians to be born  again.  Cardinal Von Balthazar very clearly explains what is involved in  being like a child unto the Lord and gives his readers many insights into  the mystery of life with God, the Father. It is a short book in terms of  pages, but each page is packed with reflections.  This book is best read as  part of a meditation regime or one's "lectio divina" (prayerful  study of religious texts). I think readers who are looking for a  substantive theological exposition will appreciate this book with its  balance between deep theology and careful reasoning.
