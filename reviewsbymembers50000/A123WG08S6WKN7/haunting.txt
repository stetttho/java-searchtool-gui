 Though this DVD has not been released at this time, I signed up for one.  In my mind, "Les Enfant du Paradis" is one of the ten best films ever made.  It would take almost thirty years for American films to match the bold and daring tone of this film. This film will appeal strongly to those who relish films about people who refuse to be subject to anything save the freedom of their choices and who are willing to face whatever consequences that come from clinging to this freedom. This film is hard to find in Rental Stores and has been difficult to purchase through regular means. This is one to keep for your own collection, especially if you love this film.
