 I too am disappointed by the poor design features of this phone. 1.  The phone unit is too small and is not comfortable to hold or to have resting on your shoulder.  If you have big ears and hands, this phone will be  intolerable. 2. On several occasions, I'd dial a number and as soon as  the other party picks up my phone would shut off.  I shouldn't be having  these problems. 3. I can't use the phone and answering machine at the  same time.  Sometimes when I get a message, I like to dial the number as it  comes off the machine.  At other times it's important for me to share  messages with others.  This phone does not allow for either use. 4.  One  good feature is that even if your electricity goes out, your messages are  saved and can be retrieved later on.  During a power failure, however, this  phone does not work. Unfortunately, I don't recommend the purchase of  this phone. I hope Lucent Tech/ATT product designers read these reviews  so that they could come up with better products.
