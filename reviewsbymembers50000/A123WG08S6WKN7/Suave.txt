 I have a friend who use to live in England and found it to be gloomy and depressing at times.  he told me that the only thing that could cheer him up and get him out of the glums was this sunny, bright, warm album.  He  told me that on chilly days, when the sun would not show its face, he'd put  on this album, and imagine himself in Rio, on the Copacabana, drinking a  tropical concoction, with the girl from Ipanema walking by.  Listening to  this album saved his life in a way.  As I live in cold and sometimes  gloomy New England, I too play this album to cheer me up and rekindle my  zest for life.  It works!  The simplicity of the rhythms just embrace you,  as if to say "relax, don't worry...". I highly recommend this  album to anyone who's got the winter blues and needs a lift.  Better yet  invite a friend over and put this music on.  I guarantee it will warm you  up like nothing else can.
