 I think most people who loved the CD, will find that this filmed rendition will take their experience one step further.  This fine film documents Ry Cooder's initiative to gather some of Cuba's finest musicians and create an  album.  "Buena Vista Social Club" allows us a glimpse into the  lives of the musicians, and a haunting tour of run down Havana, a city  longing to be rediscovered as the musicians were. Viewers get a taste of  the passion behind the music, as well as the environment out of which these  masters emerge. Documentaries have a tendency to turn their subjects into  to museum pieces, whereas this film draws us into its sultry rhythms and  quiet passions.   I would strongly recommend this film to those who  desire a good introduction to Caribbean/Latin music but don't want to get  overwhelmed in a sea of repetitive 'merengue' or 'salsa.'  This is the real  thing, played by human beings who know how to keep rhythm because rhythm is  at the very core of their beings.   Those who have access to the DVD format  will maximize their enjoyment of this presentation.  Having additional  material only available on DVD, such as concert footage and musician  information, is like being at a Cuban fiesta where one has a lot of choice  between fine food, excellent drink, and exquisite music.
