 This book does what it sets out to do, namely give you a GMAT Math work out.  This book attempts to teach people some of the techniques needed to answer GMAT Math questions.  It's really meant to be a supplement to their main GMAT Prep book.  I found the techniques taught in the book to be  helpful, particularly the section on answering word problems and problems  where the answer choices are left in a variable form. Yes, the problem  sets are easy, but I think the point of this book is to get the techniques  down.  After all, GMAT Math is difficult not because of the breadth of  Mathematics it covers, but because of the tricky answer choices and the  multiple ways of answering a question.  Better to master test-taking skills  on easy questions than to stare blankly at a difficult question. In spite  of a few typographical errors and cheap quality paper, I do recommend this  book for those looking to supplement their test taking skills, as this won't  help you learn the Math, just the skills to take the test...
