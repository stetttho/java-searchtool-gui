 This book is indispensable for anyone desiring to take the GMAT.  The questions have all appeared on previous exams; the AWA questions listed are those likely to appear on an actual exam; and the Math review subtly lists the topics that the exam is likely to cover. Unfortunately, the answers  given to questions tend to be abstract and test-taking short cuts skills  are not mentioned.  Moreover, the book does not include any practice tests.   But this is the closest one can get to real questions, other than having  access to ETS's databanks.  One great way to use this book is to look at  the wrong answers.  Generating a question is easy, but ETS's art, if you  will, is devising wrong answers, answers that look correct.  So often a  question is designed with multiple steps that the many test-takers forget  to take; sure enough, the wrong answer generated by this failure is usually  waiting to be chosen.  Eliminating wrong answers is half the battle on the  GMAT.     I do hope the GMAC and ETS come out with a new edition soon as  the current one has been around for more than 3 years.  It would be nice to  get some fresh questions from their vast pool. This book works well when  combined with a good test-prep program like Kaplan and Princeton Review.    I'm giving it three stars on account of its necessity.   Apart from that, it's not particularly interesting.
