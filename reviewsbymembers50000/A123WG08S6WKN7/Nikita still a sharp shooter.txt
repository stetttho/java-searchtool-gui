 I recently showed this film to a friend who was too young to see it when it was first released.  We were thoroughly engaged!  After 10 years this film still packs a punch.  It has aged very well.  DON'T watch the English  or Spanish Dubs.  It's a French film that is best experienced in its  original language.  I noticed that the subtitles missed some of the French;  the dub does even less justice; example:  "merde" is translated  as "for chrissake" (not quite the same thing). Can you imagine  the gaffs in a dubbed version where some idioms are just not translatable?   For anyone who enjoys first rate acting, this film is a must.  Anne  Parillaud's performance is flawless, especially in her assassin scenes; one  moment she's shooting with deadly aim, the next moment she's in tears,  overwhelmed by the tension of the circumstance. If you have an  audio-visual library, this is one film to include in your collection; it  just might not be available at your local video-rental store when you fancy  watching it.
