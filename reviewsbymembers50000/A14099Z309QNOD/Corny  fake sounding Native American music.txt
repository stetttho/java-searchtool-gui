 I am a soundtrack fan, love a good soundtrack, and found this to be incoherent...the music sounded stereotypical and unoriginal. I love Lisa Gerard's contributions to the Gladiator soundtrack but here, her voice is lost in the music. I find this cd to be kind of irritating to listen to, rather than beautiful. I'm trading it in at the local used cd store asap.
