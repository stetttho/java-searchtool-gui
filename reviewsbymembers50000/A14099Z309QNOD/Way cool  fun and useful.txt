 This book has lots of cutting-edge ways to alter one's thinking, perception, and performance. It is absolutely interesting. I am not a computer geek, so the sections scattered throughout the book that involve programming are not useful to me (but maybe someday, with some help). I can't see how anyone wouldn't find this book fascinating and useful.
