 It seems as though Mike Oldfield has several distinct musical personas that come through him: my favorite pieces are the weird, otherworldly things like TB, Amarok, Ommadawn,...these seem to express something musically, without seeming as though they were written FOR a certain market. I've found that anything Mike has written with a disco beat, (including much of this cd) feels as though he is trying to get club play time rather than expressing some of his fascinating musical ideas.  This cd, were it by any other artist, would be considered to be quite good, but if you're looking for that vintage oldfield weird stuff, you'll be disappointed. That said, there are several peices that are pretty good, a few that I hate, but I have not yet played it enough to "let it grow" on me. But hey, its mike, and I'll give it a chance.
