 Yuck. Winston totally misses the mark. The Guaraldi originals are mellow, fluid, jazzily relaxing. You can feel George Winston's effortful interpretations which sound like he's tried too hard to polish them and "interpret" them, but fails. The piano he chose is too bright, and the recording sounds wrong to me. It has a monotonous tone. It feels like he took the relaxed deeply-felt Guaraldi originals and fed them into some sort of George Winston conversion software, and a computer played these tunes instead of a person, let alone a musician. I suppose I could give it two stars, but a few people gushed about this cd in a way I don't understand, so I just took it back to the library, where I checked it out. I'm glad I didn't actually buy this one.
