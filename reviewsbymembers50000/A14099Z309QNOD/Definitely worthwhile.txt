 Yes, it's true, there's a lot of extra stuff here, and the techniques could have been condensed to a smaller number of pages, but the book does have some amazing and useful things in it. Especially the mirror technique.  I knew intuitively that it was true and powerful when I read it, and it has   proven to be so. You can probably skim through the book in a few hours and  highlight some really useful stuff, (or read it and get a feeling of a  self-development book from 1948 is like. It's actually a kinda sweet and  positive book). At the low mass-market paperback price it's worth it...
