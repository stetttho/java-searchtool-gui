 Initially, I thought that this book was very appealing. It's expensive and beautiful, with a simple, elegant layout. As I paged through it, however, something began to bother me. Then I figured it out: ALL of the pictures were of beautiful houses, tastefully and  very expensively appointed to illustrate the "simple" life of zen. There was not one picture of a truly simple room with real objects, or an ordinary person's house (someone with a modest income). It was all beautiful, high end stuff that is only had  by the wealthy.  Therefore, I think Ou Balyhodhin missed the point. Real Zen living is not about buying lots of pricey stuff for your  trophy house, it's about inner simplicity. I had the feeling this is the kind of book some wealthy person would buy so they could construct a "Zen lifestyle" to show off to others how 'simple' and 'spiritual' they are. .. I think there is a clue in the author's biography when it lists Conrans as one of the places he's consulted for and worked. For a much better take on Japanese/Zen aesthetic, get a little book called "Wabi Sabi for  Artists, Designers, Poets and Philosophers", by  Leonard Koren.  It's fantastic.
