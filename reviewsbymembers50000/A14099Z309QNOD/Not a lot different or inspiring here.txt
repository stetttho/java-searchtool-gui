 Not having read the author's other 2  books, I came across only this one and purchased it with high  expectation (based upon the general reviews for the other books). Well, I;m disappointed. This is in a semi-poetic form, and it reads just like many other similar books I have come across, usually from some unknown author in the spiritual section in a used bookstore. Nothing really inspiring here. The author has a section on some 'sacred geometry'  that was revealed to him during his 'fifth awakening in New York City' in 1990; I found it simplistic and rather dull. Actually, that's how I would describe this whole book. However this particular book was written, I don't doubt the author's sincerity and wish to communicate his spiritual experience. I haven't given up on him entirely, though, I will still look for his first two books and see if they have anything to offer and give them a chance if they do. I just can't recommend this particular book.
