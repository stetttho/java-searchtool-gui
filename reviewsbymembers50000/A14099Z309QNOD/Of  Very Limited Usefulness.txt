 Let me start off by saying that the original Power of Now is the most important spiritual book I have read, (and I have read quite a few)... I am now reading it for the fifth time, annotating and underlining passages in pencil. I also often listen to the audio version of the book, which, being read by Eckhart, contains the Presence he speaks so eloquently of. As for this book, I find it to be an overly edited, choppy version of the Power of Now, with little or no new material. Despite trying very hard to get into it, it just does not flow for me. All the power of the original book seems lost, and I find it  very hard to read. Too many powerful ideas and words all crowded together, with none of the easy flow of the original. Eckhart, writing in the introduction, suggests that this book may be easier for some new readers to follow, but I disagree. The book starts abruptly, seemingly in the middle of a discussion on Being, and it is very hard to follow after that. Each chapter seems to start in the middle of an idea. When I pick up the original it is a pleasure to read almost anywhere, when I pick up this book, I feel a tension in myself as read it. I feel it's almost a disservice to the teachings of Eckhart Tolle. Someone unfamiliar with Eckharts teaching I think would not get it. This book fails in its attempt to present Eckhart's ideas in a more usable format.  That being said, it's possible that some people might like it, if they are just looking for an outline form of the material, (without eckhart's flow, clarity, warmth and humor). As for me, I'm going to stick with re-reading and annotating the original, which seems to bring even more energy into my copy of that incredible book.
