 Reiterating what other reviewers have stated, "Pet Sematary" is one of the most disturbing and suspenseful books that I have ever come across.  And as opposed to most Stephen King flics, which are usually half or one-star disasters, the movie, Pet Sematary is actually just as good, if not better than the novel and follows the novel very accurately. The actors used in the movie are just the way that I imagined them being in the book: down-to-earth family people, but interesting and solid.  As far as I could tell, there were no inaccuracies between the novel and the movie and the few parts of the book that the movie may have omitted were unimportant, non-suspenseful sections.  In a nutshell, the acting was great, the suspense was even better than in the book, and this is probably the best King film that I have ever seen.
