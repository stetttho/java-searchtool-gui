 Information Society's "Don't Be Afraid" is lyrically and musically one of the strangest, most unique, but coolest albums -of any genre- that has ever been developed.  Like the cover art, it is extremely gothic and eldritch. The album is entirely unlike any of InSoc's previous releases, and was apparently made by the last remaining band member, Kurt Harland, interestingly.  Being a computer freak, Harland employs a wide variety of computerized and metallic synthesizer tones and combines them homogenously with electric guitar leads and solos.  The scary thing is that Harland deftly uses these sounds to produce some of the most gothic, eldritch, and unique melodies I have ever heard.  In a synopsis, if Stephen King's mind was transferred into music instead of literature, "Don't Be Afraid" would be the end result.  It's extremely freaky, scary, and weird, but cool sounding at the same time.  Don't Be Afraid can be categorized as "Industrial Gothic Techno Pop/Rock" if such a genre even exists.  Well, now it does. As far as Kurt Harland's gothic mind is concerned, at least he has demonstrated with this CD that he has talent -albeit demented- at producing music without the aid of other band members.  Although this may not be an every day-listening CD, it's at least worth purchasing for it's "coolness" and "weirdness" attributes.
