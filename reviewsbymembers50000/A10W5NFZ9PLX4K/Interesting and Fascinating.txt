 This book is by far, the most fascinating book -of secular material- that I've ever come across. It is replete with biased fallacies, half-truths, and truths. Although, the author is clearly biased towards her theories, and makes every argument look like that only HER views can possibly be correct, the book also contains many authentic and accurate data regarding the origins and affiliations of the Na-Deneids that aren't found in any other books.        Many scholars, linguists and other experts have decried Stewart's methodologies and opinions but much of her data is actually quite compelling and may end up being proven beyond all reasonable doubt.  In any event, this is one of the most interesting pieces of literature I have ever come across.
