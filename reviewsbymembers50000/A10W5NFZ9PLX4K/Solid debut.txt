 Vincent Clarke is one of my favorite popular music musicians of all time and I've followed his music from his roots, Depeche Mode-SPEAK & SPELL, to Erasure's last decent album, COWBOY.  Of the two albums that Yaz came out with, Upstairs At Eric's is clearly the superior one.  Not only does Upstairs At Eric's have my two favorite Yaz songs ever ("Situation" and "Don't Go," which even TODAY -20 years later- are still big radio hits, and for good reason) but most the other songs -whether penned by Clarke OR Moyet- are nearly just as talented and memorable.  Two of my other favorites are: "Only You" which is extremely romantic and endearing and "Winter Kills" which is a very slow, melancholic, and haunting piano ballad, very reminiscent of Beethoven's "Moonlight Sonata." There are two fillers: "I Before E Except After C" is a an annoying schizophrenic-like hodge podge of layered voices that repeat themselves over and over, which is every bit as much drivel as some of Pink Floyd's most horrific material.  Listening to this track too often will either evoke traumatic, subconscious memories of the movie, "Sybil," and/or flat-out inoculate an incurable, malignant, psychological dementia of some type.  "In My Room" also doesn't really cut it as a song and likewise comes across more as weird and unintelligible than anything else. In 'Upstairs At Eric's', Clarke makes the most out of his extremely heavy and metallic sounding midi-moog-like synth tones, which I thoroughly enjoy and don't find them obsolete-sounding or cheesy, whatsoever.  In fact, I wish that Clarke's Erasure had employed synth tones similar to Yaz and -like Yaz- wrote more melancholic and darker, but catchy songs similar to "Don't Go." All things considered, 'Upstairs At Eric's' is a very good album, especially if you enjoy simple, but poignant synthesizer-heavy synth-pop very similar in style to bands such as Eurythmics and Human League.
