 Like most Bruce Lee movies, RETURN OF THE DRAGON is a laughable one-star flic that in the near future should end up in Mystery Science Theater's Hall of Shame where it will be jeered and sneered at by a human and two robots.  Don't get me wrong; the fight scenes in this movie are probably my favorite from any of his flics, especially the last one where Lee takes on Chuck Norris in the Roman Colliseum in one of the best martial arts displays of all time.   But the story and plot and the acting are shamefully hideous!  This movie belongs in the genre of "comedy" rather than "martial arts," in fact.  You know a movie is pathetic when it is funny where it's not intented to be and vice versa, and this flic fits into that category.   A much better alternative to buying this lame title is purchasing BRUCE LEE FIGHTS which is a compilation of Lee's greatest fight scenes from all his movies, (including nearly all from RETURN OF THE DRAGON) which means it's ALL action and no "cringing" at stupid plots and dumb actors.
