 Although, it's nearly 20 years old now, I only recently watched The Karate Kid for the first time just a month ago.  Although, for obvious reasons it's probably a flic meant more for teenagers than anyone else, it's still pretty decent and has a great story. The scoop is an Italian-America (Macchio) who moves to California and has typical teenage problems finding acceptance -especially with certain groups- in his new school.  Being bullied around all the time, he finally resorts to being trained by a simple Japanese man who knows karate, to defend himself.  The approach in which he was trained in karate was more interesting than anything else.  Movements with the wrists, hands, and arms which are employed in painting and cleaning were the exact karate movements of self defense. From an authentic standpoint, I don't know how much of the movie uses real karate forms that are existent and are taught or if some of it is either improvised or made up, but the story is still pretty unique and interesting, nonetheless.  And while I, myself, (I have no martial art OR fighting skills for that matter, whatsoever) could probably take on Ralph Macchio and beat the living snot out of him easily -just by improvising- the movie, still, has a decent message and was enjoyable.
