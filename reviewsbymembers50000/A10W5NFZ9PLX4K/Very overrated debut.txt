 Like most OTHER VH albums, their 1978 self-titled debut album is vastly overrated.  Most Van Halen songs in the Roth era are too simple -some to the extent that they lack the complexity that most "jingles" do.  There are a few 'average' songs from their debut, such as "Runnin' With The Devil," "You Really Got Me," Aint' Talkin' 'Bout Love," and "Jamie's Cryin'."  But of those, none really stand out though at least they're solid. That's not to say that I completely diss Van Halen or am not a fan of them.  I have my own CD-R best hits compilation of VH, in fact.  It does, however, only consist of 11 songs from about 8 albums, which is an average of only 1 song per album.  At least I can say that most of them are some of my favorite rocks songs ever of any artist. My Van Halen elite 11 are: 1.  Runnin' With The Devil 2.  Dance The Night Away 3.  And The Cradle Will Rock 4.  Unchained 5.  Jump 6.  Why Can't This Be Love 7.  Dreams 8.  Love Walks In 9.  When It's Love 10. Feels So Good 11. Right Now  Clearly, in my opinion, VH's best album is "5150" (my fav. Halen song is Dreams) and I I think that in the "Van Hagar" era, Van Halen had matured and made more complex and better music in general than the David Lee Roth era.  But with the exception of 5150 most VH albums have 1 or 2 songs at most that are really good -the rest pretty much suck and their debut is no exception.
