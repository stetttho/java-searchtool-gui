 Speak & Spell, the work of keyboardist, Vincent Clarke (who I've followed throughout his 20 year career with Depeche Mode, Yaz, and Erasure) is oddly cheesy, yet cool at the same time.  It's obvious when listening to the music that the Depeche Mode band members were just beginning their careers -the lyrics are pretty cheesy and the songs are kind of weird and silly- but notwithstanding, the melodies, though generally simple, are funky and cool as are the synthesizer tones that Clarke employs.  In fact, for a number of reasons, this is one of my favorite Depeche Mode albums.  Although, Clarke has come a LONG ways since Speak & Spell (in the right direction), I still consider this album one of the cooler 80's synthesizer pop albums to have ever been developed.
