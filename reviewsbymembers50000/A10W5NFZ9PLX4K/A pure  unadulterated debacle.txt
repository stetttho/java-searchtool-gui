 THE GIRL WHO LOVED TOM GORDON not only isn't on par with King's other novels, but, in my opinion, is one of the [worst] books ever written... The story is about a small girl who -when accidentally separated from her mother and brother on a nature hike- becomes lost in a Maine forest wilderness for several days, and the perils (or imagined) that she encounters during this time.  99% of the book covers her adventures in the forest while she is lost, and believe me, the story is even FAR, FAR more boring and uninteresting than you may think, considering how simple the plot is.  Basically, all this book does is describe this girl's day to day experiences in the forest such as: eating poisoned berries and vomiting them up, listening to Tom Gordon pitch for the Red Sox via her walkman-radio, flee from an imaginary creature, vomit some more, etc. etc.  The story drags on and on and on and on and it never becomes either interesting or suspenseful during any stage of it. Other than sparse profanity here and there (uttered by the little girl -who talks to herself and apparently learned to swear from a classmate) this is totally a rated G little kid's book, and it's the most insipid kid's book you will ever read in your entire life, by far. Reading this book, one will be hard-pressed to believe that it is Stephen King material; it's untalented, extremely boring, and nearly completely devoid of suspense...Don't make the same mistake I did.  Reading THIS...will be the biggest 4 or 5 hour waste of time in your entire life.
