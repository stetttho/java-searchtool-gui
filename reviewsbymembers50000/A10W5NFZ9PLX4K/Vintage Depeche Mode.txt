 "101" is truly a compilation of their greatest songs from 1980-1988 and it does not disappoint. Only one or two songs seem to be "fillers" ("Pimpf" and "The Things You Said"); the remaining songs are great are among Depeche Mode's best.  If one wants to buy only one Depeche Mode album and/or purchase only one to find out what they are like, (at least '80s Depeche Mode) this is definitely the one to purchase. The only downside is that Dave Gahan screaming and yelling -chants of "yeah!" and "go!"- dozens of times throughout every song (to pump up the audience and "get them into the songs") rapidly becomes annoying.
