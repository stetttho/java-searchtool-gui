 Probably the best -if not the only- band to come out of San Diego, CA, Red Flag's Naive Art has a very distinct machinery-techno like sound and it worked extremely well. The songs, both lyrically and musically, are quasi-reminiscent of Depeche Mode in that it is slightly melancholic and most songs are in the minor key.  The techno-pop music is very upbeat and dancy, notwithstanding it's semi-"dark" nature and the hooks, though simple, are poignant and memorable. One of Naive Art's cons is that there isn't a whole lot of variation: Most of the tracks don't sound very distinct from each other, but still it's a cool album and brings a lot of late '80s nostalgia back to me.
