 It's a nice boon that the Links 2003 Championship Courses (containing 20 courses) was available the same day that Links 2003 shipped, making a total of 26 courses betwixt the two titles.  This add-on to Links 2003 is also a good value at only 20 dollars.   About half of the courses are various selections from the Links LS libraries -updated with Links 2003 graphics and textures- and the other half are completely new add-ons.  One should also take into account that you can convert ANY and ALL of your Links LS courses with the new Links 2003 course converter (on CD #3) which is an extreme bonus. I, personally don't like the new add-ons as much as the re-done Links LS courses.  Generally-speaking they don't stand out and aren't very memorable, though several, such as the Robert Trent-designed Judge Course, are simply awesome: Very creative, challenging, and fun.  Still, a decent selection of courses and an excellent value.
