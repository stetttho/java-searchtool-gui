 I recently ordered "Time Almanac 2003: With Information Please" and -being a stickler for information-replete, non-fiction tomes (e.g., dictionary, almanac, encyclopedia, etc.) this is as good as any Almanac I've ever come across.  The table of contents are very organized, everything is very easy to find and there are over 1 million facts and more than one thousand pages.  This is the first time I made a switch from World Almanac to Time Almanac.  In my opinion this Time is as good as any World Almanac I've ever come across. There is a major flaw, however.  In the middle of the book there is a section of pages that contains photos, world maps, and countries' flags.  These pages weren't binded to the book the way that the rest of the book was:  They're attached in the same "bend/fold/tear apart" manner that subscription renewal forms (found in magazines) and forms found in bills (which are meant to be separated from the main portion of the letter).  Simply put, after only using this almanac for several days, nearly all the map/photo sections' pages have been inadvertedly separated -torn, albeit cleanly, from the book.  The only remedy might be employing superglue to permanently re-attach them.  I've encountered this problem with other prior almanacs, but it's still unacceptable. Notwithstanding this flaw, the Times Almanac is a great intellengently-organized information source for all of 2002's events and nearly any statistic you may want to find.
