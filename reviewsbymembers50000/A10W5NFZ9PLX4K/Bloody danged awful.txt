 Although I have very high expectations of the Pet Shop Boys -being a fan of them- Bilingual isn't even a half-way good album on its OWN merits, much less when compared to OTHER PSB releases. After PSB released Bilingual, I thought that they should retire immediately.  There's only one solid song on the CD ("Metamorphosis") and the rest are not even mediocre -they simply suck beyond belief.  If it weren't for "Metamorphosis" I would have to give this album 0 stars.  Every song lacks any imagination whatsoever, and is completely talentless and substance-less.  To say that the Pet Shop Boys sound bored and uninterested on this CD would be a gargantuan understatement of collossal proportions.  How other reviewers (who I'm sure are ALSO avid PSB fans) can rate this album even two stars -much less five- is way beyond me; apparently they have no discernment between talent, originality, and a lack of both.  Or perhaps they're so biased in favor of the bands they worship that they think anything their bands produce is quality music.  I, on the other hand, am the first one to criticize and notice MY favorite bands' shortcomings but I'm never unfair or TOO critical in my analyses of their music, either.
