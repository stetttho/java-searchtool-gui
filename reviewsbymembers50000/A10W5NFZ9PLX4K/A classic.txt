 Although, not a gorefest or action packed, The Omen nonetheless stands the test of time and is truly one of the better, if not best, suspense movies to have ever come out.   The story entails a young boy who is discovered to be the Anti-Christ because of a variety of signs and hints that expose him.  Those who suspect this meet unexpected, surprising and dramatic fates to prevent anyone from discovering his identity.  The story and suspense increase dramatically as the movie progresses.  The acting (including, especially Gregory Peck) is superb and the plot is excellent. The ending is extremely dramatic.  Overall, a great movie which I thought was far better than "The Exorist" -a similar movie which preceded and probably influenced The Omen.
