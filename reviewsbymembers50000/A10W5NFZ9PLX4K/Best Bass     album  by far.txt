 Bass The Future is not only Bass 305's best album but is also probably the second best bass album, by any bass artist, that I've ever listened to.  ... the album leaves a lot to be desired, as half of the songs are pretty cool techno-like bass songs (instead of just electronic noises jumbled together having little or no melody -which is what most bass "music" is) and half are either "cheesy" (such as Pure Tone and Bass Epilogue where a scientist of some sort talks about the science of bass and it's effects on the ear) or just "fillers" that lack any substance.  My two favorite tracks by far are Automated Digital Bass and BASS mission 305.  They're probably my two favorite tracks from any of 305's albums. If you're a bass stickler, this album is a must-have: It thumps big-time, has very clean and un-distorted bass tones and has some truly cool techno-bass songs (which are ACTUALLY songs), rife with all types of alien-like outer space noises and other digital sounds.  Great job Mark and Dave Watson.
