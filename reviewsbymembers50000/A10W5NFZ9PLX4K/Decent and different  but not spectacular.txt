 Their self-titled album "Erasure" is definitely, in many ways, one of their most unique albums that ERASURE has ever developed.  In contrast to previous releases, it seems a lot darker, more profound and sincere, as opposed to their typical upbeat, campy-like music. The synthesizer tones Clarke employs are very similar to those found in "Chorus" and "I Say I Say I Say."  But the melodies are deeply emotional and less upbeat. Vincent Clarke intended to make this a "Pink Floyd-like" album in providing lengthy, ambient-like songs replete with eery, eldritch and atmospheric synthesizer tones and in THAT respect he probably succeeded overall.  After releasing this album, though he stated that it didnt' turn out as good as he wanted it to, and I agree.  It's not that I dislike the fact that it's different from other Erasure albums, but in my opinion, the melodies aren't as talented or memorable as melodies in other albums, -they're drawn out too long and are too repetitive as well.  But, notwithstanding, I still think it's a better than average album, and very interesting and unique.
