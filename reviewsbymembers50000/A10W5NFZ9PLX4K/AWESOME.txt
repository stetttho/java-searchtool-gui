 I Say I Say I Say is very likely my favorite Erasure album, -excluding "Pop 20!" which is a greatest hits compilation. Erasure is my favorite group, mainly, if not TOTALLY because of Erasure's synthesizer genius and primary song-writer, Vincent Clarke, and this album is a gem.  The melodies are very reflective of the foresty night-time like album cover artwork -they're extremely tranquil, serene, and mellow but still atypical Erasure-like upbeat and dancy. The computerized and synthesizer tones that Clarke deftly utilizes in the songs are very cool. Vincent Clarke is a master at coming up with catchy, cool pop tunes and employing cool sounds to develop them, and this is definitely one of the best synth-pop works I've ever come across.
