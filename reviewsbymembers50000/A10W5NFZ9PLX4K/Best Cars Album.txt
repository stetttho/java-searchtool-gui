 Simply put, this is my favorite Cars album.  The sound is more pop-rock than their prior productions as synthesizers are heavily employed.  Heartbeat City is nearly perfect and would qualify as my Cars: Greatest Hits compilation if only a few amendments were made: Substitute "Shake It Up" and "Just What I Needed" for "Why Can't I Have You" (very slow and forgettable) and "Stranger Eyes" (solid, but not great). Heartbeat City is probably The Cars best album and definitely my favorite.  Every song is a perfect synthesizer/guitar combo that rocks like only The Cars can.
