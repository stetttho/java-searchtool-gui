 Like the first Ghostbusters movie, I only recently saw Ghostbusters II for the first time only two weeks ago, and all I can say is that it was a monumental waste of my time, and all I had was time to waste in the first place. Part two includes the same cast of brainless actors and a much worse plot and packs a much less exciting movie. The special effects, if anything, seem less spectacular than it's prequel, which came out 5 years earlier, and the plot is unexciting, confusing and drags on.  The culmination of this stupidity reaches its climax when citizens of New York City sing together to diminish the malevolent energy responsible for the ominous protoplasmic formations which are enveloping the city! Judas Priest, how stupid is THAT?! It also seems that the only action in the movie is at the very end and it's cheesy, at best.  Is it coincidence that this movie came out the same year Back To The Future II (by FAR, the worst of the Back To The Future movies) did and that they BOTH merit submission for review to Mystery Science Theater? I guess '89 just wasn't a great year for Hollywood.
