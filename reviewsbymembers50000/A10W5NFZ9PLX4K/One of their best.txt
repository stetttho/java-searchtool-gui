 Chorus is Erasure in their prime from a  chronological standpoint and representative of their apex from a music standpoint. Chorus is unique in that it marks a return of Vince Clarke from the Oberheim Xpander synthesizer (used in Erasure's earlier material which has a more acoustic quality) to analog synths, which tones have a more computerized quality and use all types of metallic bleeps and blips.  Clarke employs analog synths in Chorus to create a more sincere and serious -somewhat darker- album than '80s Erasure material, virtually all of which is campy and happy-go-lucky.   Though the sound and direction is different, the end result is the same: Chorus is has all the poignancy and diversity from song to song as vintage '80s albums such as "The Circus" and "The Innocents" had.  Some songs are upbeat and dancy, and others are slow but in the end it still sounds like vintage Erasure and remains one of Andy Bell's and Vince Clarke's best efforts, ever.
