 Aquarium belongs in a genre of music called "bubblegum pop." Why it is called that, I have no frickin' clue but it sounds cool to me. It's very similar to techno-pop and other related genres, but in any event, I like it a lot.  The music is similar to the happy-go-lucky techno pop of Erasure's "I Say I Say I Say."  The songs are very well developed and the hooks in about every track are great. The album starts solid right off the bat with my favorite song, "Happy Boys and Girls," which is extremely optimistic, catchy and dancy.  Deservingly it's received a lot of radio time.  My 2nd favorite is "My Oh My."  The so-called best hit, "Barbie Girl," is only my 3rd or 4th favorite.  With the exception of one or two songs the entire album is great.  Aqua -a Danish group- is indicative of a trend of talented bands emerging from Scandinavia and gives some much needed competition to the U.S.A. and England who solely have dominated popular music since its origins.
