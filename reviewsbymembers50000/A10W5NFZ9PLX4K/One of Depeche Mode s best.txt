 Violator is not only Depeche Mode's last 80s album (it was actually released in 1990) but it's also their last GOOD album. Beginning with "Songs Of Faith And Devotion" -when Depeche jettisoned their keyboards in favor of the Alt. Rock scene- D.M. began a creativity decline from which they never recovered.  It's too bad that they didn't retire after Violoator, their last good album and maybe their best, also. Violator follows in the footsteps of the formulaic mid '80s Depeche Mode releases with very dark, gothic lyrics and music and a perfect combination of upbeat, dancy songs and slower ones.  Violator is probably, in fact, the darkest, most gothic D.M. album of all.  The synthesizer tones are extremely heavy and stark and sometimes eldritch as they mimic human growls and breathing.  Although the array of synth tones employed in songs is a little more spartan and minimalistic, the end result is that most the songs are among the best that Depeche Mode has ever developed.  Alan Wilder's keyboard arrangements are stellar.  My favorite songs are "World In My Eyes," and "Policy Of Truth." Violator would've been near perfect had it included the B-side: "Happiest Girl," which is one of the darkest and best D.M. songs I've ever heard.  As it stands, Violator is probably the second best album after "101."  It's too bad that 101 wasn't released directly after Violator was -so that it could have included the best hits from Violator as well as the best of D.M. from '81-'87.
