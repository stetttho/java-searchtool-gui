 Bass Waves-Liquid Bass is hands-down the best bass album that I've ever come across and I've sampled dozens of bass albums from different artists -from Techno Bass Crew to Eurobass Express to Bass 305, etc. The music -atypical of other bass songs that came out in the mid '90s- (by the way, what ever happened to mid '90s era of bass music? It faded away as simply as it appeared.) is purely instrumental and electronic -replete with deep, low frequency electronic bass tones that actually can damage speakers and subwoofers, especially if the volume is too high. The songs are very diverse from each other, both melody-wise and in terms of beats; -they're generally slower and more atmospheric than bass music from similar artists- but very creative.  If you're a stickler for bass music (though it's probably not considered "au courant" anymore these days, but rather quasi-antiquated) I highly recommend Liquid Bass over any other bass album.
