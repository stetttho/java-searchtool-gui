 Based on several reader reviews, I bought this album and ended up severely disappointed.  In a nutshell, there are only two or three really good songs (especially, NEVER LET ME DOWN AGAIN) and the remaining tracks seem to be experiments in synthesizer sampling without any actual melody. Other than "Contstruction Time Again" this is probably the only other '80s DM release that I loathe.  Much better alternatives to this album are "Black Celebration" and "Some Great Reward."
