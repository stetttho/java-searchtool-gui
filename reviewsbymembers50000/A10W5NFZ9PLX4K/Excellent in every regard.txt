 Pop! 20 is definitely the best of Erasure from 1985-1992 and every song would make an outstanding single.  There are no fillers.  This is definitely my favorite Erasure album. I only wish that they had waited until their last good album -"Cowboy"- (1997) had been released before releasing a greatest hits compilation, instead of releasing one right before their prime and two of their better albums were realeased ("I Say I Say I Say" [1994] and "Erasure" [1995]). Reiterating what another reviewer stated, it's a shame that teenagers these days have no music like this to grow up with these days. It seems that anymore these days there's only Alternative Rock groups (I HATE Alternative Rock with a passion; I don't like the sound, and most of it, by far, is insipid and talent-less) and many other groups who, by and large are extremely untalented and sound like garbage.  It appears that the golden age of pop music is over and has been for quite some time now, despicably and regrettably. If one wants to sample some "real" music that is talented and sounds great, then one can't go wrong with Erasure, and in particular, Erasure's best: "Pop! 20 Hits."
