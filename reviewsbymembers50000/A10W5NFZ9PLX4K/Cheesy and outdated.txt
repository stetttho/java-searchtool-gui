 Even though it came out in 1984, I only recently saw Ghostbusters for the first time just two weeks ago, and all I can say is that, although, it may have seemed pretty cool when it first came out, it isn't a classic, it doesn't stand the test of time and it really seems like an atypical, outdated '80s flic to me (like "The Breakfast Club," "Police Academy," "The A-Team" T.V. series, etc.).  The actors themselves aren't exactly Hollywood's greatest. Included is the overrated, non-versatile Bill Murray who seems to only play one type of role: A non-chalant "I don't care" type of actor which I thought didn't fit in well with Ghostbusters, it being a sci-fi drama-action flic.  The special effects were okay for its time but the movie doesn't provide an iota of suspense and it doesn't compensate for its lack of scariness except for the mediocre action scenes. I might have enjoyed it a LITTLE more had I seen it when it first came out when I was a teenager as I was more impressionable. But how other reviewers can rate this outdated flic more than 3 stars is beyond me. It's just not very good. While I don't regret seeing this movie for the first time ever two weeks ago, it's certainly not a movie that I desire to see in the near or far future.
