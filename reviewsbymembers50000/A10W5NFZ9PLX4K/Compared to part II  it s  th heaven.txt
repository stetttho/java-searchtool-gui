 Although, not as original and flawless as part 1, Back to the Future 3 is a worthy sequel to part II, if only because it was impossible to make a sequel as atrocious as part II.   The story is similar to part I in that Michael J. Fox goes back in time and that most of part 3 ALSO takes place in the past, but THIS time it's a much older era that he travels back to (the 1800's) and the setting is in the old West.   The story and plot aren't as original or as fresh as the first Back To The Future, but part 3, nonetheless does provide a fairly entertaining combination of action and comedy that throughout, and the movie only becomes more interesting, suspenseful, and exciting as it progresses.  All in all, a better than average movie, but not spectacular or excellent.
