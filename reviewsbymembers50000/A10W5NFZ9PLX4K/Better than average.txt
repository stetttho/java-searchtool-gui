 Many people argue that "The Innocents" is Erasure's best album, ever.  I think that it's at least their best-selling, but not their best. I love the synthesizer tones that Vince Clarke employs in The Innocents to create the simple, but upbeat and memorable hooks.  The synth tones are acoustic sounding (much of them resembling "electronic" harpsichords) and layered for a very full, rich sound.  For some reason "A Little Respect" and "Ship Of Fools" scored a lot higher in the charts upon this album's release than the other songs but my favorite tracks, by far, are "Yahoo" (a gospel-themed song which is very upbeat and dancy) and "Imagination." I don't quite give this a 5-star rating: The songs are a little too simple and there's one or two fillers that are kind of lame (such as "Sixty-Five Thousand.")  Otherwise, it's definitely one of their best, probably their most accessible, and every Erasure aficionado should own it.
