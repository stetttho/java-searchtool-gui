 Hysteria is by a significant margin Def Leppard's best album (Pyromania is the 2nd best.  No other Def Leppard albums come close to either of them.).  Most bands are are lucky enough to come up with an album which has 2 or 3 great songs.  In my opinion, 8 of the 12 tracks from Hysteria are awesome and some of the best hard rock songs ever concocted by any artist.  (The only tracks that I don't care for are "Don't Shoot Shotgun," "Run Riot," "Exciteable," and "Love And Affection.")   The music of Hysteria is rife with very memorable and melodic hooks that sometimes straddle the category of 'power ballad' but they all absolutely rock.  "Hysteria" and "Pour Some Sugar On Me" are the best Def Leppard songs ever.  Two of my favorite songs that weren't included in Vault: 15 Greatest Hits are "Women" (great tune, great lyrics) and "Gods Of War" which is one of DL's most complex and emotionally powerful songs.  It's an anti-terrorist song and Ronald Reagan's audio excerpts and the jet sounds at the end are terrific.  Simply because Vault omitted these two tracks, I made my own Def Leppard hits compilation on CD-R.        Aside from Hysteria and Pyromania, Def Leppard's other albums are very subpar, mediocre at best.  Hysteria is awesome and may be the best hard rock album of all time.  It's certainly my favorite of all time.
