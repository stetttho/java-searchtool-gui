 Erasure's break-through album, The Circus, is a considerable improvement over their debut, Wonderland, and up to this day remains one of their best releases of all.   Every song could make an excellent single and represents Vince Clarke's creativity at his highest apex.  And although Clarke progressed over the years, adding complexity to his melodies and different arrays of synth tones to his repertoire, The Circus remains one of Erasure's most endearing, poignant, and emotional albums.
