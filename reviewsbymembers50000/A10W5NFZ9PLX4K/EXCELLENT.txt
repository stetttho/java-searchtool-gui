 UT is probably the most refined and complete First Person Shooter to have ever come out.  It is a complete single player AND multiplayer game.  In my opinion, the game pace/action is just right: not too fast and not too slow, whereas Quake III Arena's pace is blitzkreig-lightning-like-fast; too fast for my tastes.  Graphics and lighting effects are superb as is sound and sound effects.  There are a plethora of weapons and most of them have ALTERNATE methods of firing, which is an added bonus.  The weapons themselves are great looking, very detailed and some of them have digital counters which indicate the amount of ammunition in them.  There are far more maps than in Quake 3 and far more modes of play, making this a much more complete game than Quake 3.  The only flaw of Unreal Tournament that I can think of is that there are a limited amount of skins, and unfortunately, all of them are humanoid/military-like whereas Quake 3 Arena has all types of skins. If you're a fan of Doom-like games and fast paced blow'em away style First Person Shooters, purchase this title and you'll soon discover that in your repertoire of action games, Unreal Tournament is your "piece de resistance."
