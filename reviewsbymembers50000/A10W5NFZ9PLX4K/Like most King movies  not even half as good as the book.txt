 Stephen King's THE SHINING, is one of the less suspenseful and less action-packed novels compared to most of his others.  Unfortunately, -as with most of King's flics, which are, generally-speaking, one-star debacles- the movie, "The Shining" isn't even half as good as the mediocre novel was. The Shining is flawed in about every conceivable way: With the exception of Jack Nicholson, the remaining actors are far more insipid and less interesting and solid as the book would have you imagine them being.  The movie omits some of the novel's best moments, and when the movie DOESN'T omit suspenseful moments from the book, it either shows it in a very cheesy, unsuspenseful manner and/or doesn't follow the book accurately.  (E.g., Jack Nicholson was supposed to be using a mallet to injure people, not an axe; the black man arrived at the hotel by way of a snowplow with a roof, but in the book it was a snowmobile, etc.)  All in all, The Shining ends up being the most boring, suspenseless, and one of the cheesiest Stephen King flics I've ever seen.   The movie may be worth purchasing if you are an extremely die-hard King connoisseur, but if not then don't even consider this disastrous film.
