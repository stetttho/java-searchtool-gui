 I recently purchased this CD-ROM and having owned it's prequel -Need For Speed 3: Hot Pursuit- I expected Need For Speed: High Stakes to be considerably better.  Unfortunately, all in all it's no better. Need For Speed 3 is a great game, VISUALLY more than in any other way, and it also has a plethora of setup options and HOT PURSUIT modes of play, which is why it was such a fun game.  However, it had some major flaws as well; it's biggest flaw, arguably was the driving physics: there's a slight delay in the steering response and the cars feel like their floating from side to side instead of firmly grasping the road, which made driving the cars very tedious, aggravating and nearly impossible to avoid hitting sides of the road and other cars, making the game a LOT less fun than it should have been. In like manner, Need For Speed: High Stakes is visually, eyecandy; it also has a lot of setup options, a new CAREER mode of play, and vehicle damage (not to mention the famed HOT PURSUIT modes of play).  However, I was EXTREMELY disappointed in two major flaws which SEVERELY detract from fun and entertaining gameplay: The driving -which was already severely flawed in Need For Speed 3- is even WORSE in this game, astonishingly.  Why Electronic Arts didn't correct this flaw, I have no idea, but that's totally incompetent of them and unacceptable.  Also, the cars' exteriors are very botched; -they look like kindergarten artwork, whereas in Need For Speed 3 they look very accurate and great.   Although, the game is still very good overall, certain flaws nonetheless severely detract from gameplay, unfortunately.  The game should have been and could have been FAR better...
