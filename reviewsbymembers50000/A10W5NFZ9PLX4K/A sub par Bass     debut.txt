 Bass 305's debut album, Digital Bass, isn't a bad debut album, per se, but it's marred by way too much hip-hop/rap influence unlike Bass 305's succeeding albums -which showcase more electronic bass and other sounds to create techno-bass music. Granted, the CD thumps and one can show of one's subwoofer with this album, but 305's later material such as "Bass The Future" and "Departure" are much more complex and refined. Only Only recommended to a die-hard bass completist.
