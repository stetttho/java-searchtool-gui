 Although not as good as part I, Karate Kid II is still a worthy sequel which is almost as good as the original. The movie starts off where part I ended right after the tournament.  Miyagi has some issues he needs to resolve in Japan -the homeland of Karate- and allows Daniel-sahn to go with him.  The entire movie, in fact, transpires in Japan, where both Miyagi and Daniel-sahn encounter personal problems of their own, namely from bullies, and are forced to resort to karate to solve them.  While the movie has interesting Japanese cultural elements throughout, the final fight scene wasn't exactly spectacularly-choreographed and turned cheesy when Daniel-sahn uses clasped open palms to slap the crap out of his enemy, his inspiration being a chorus of wooden paddles being sounded simultaneously.  Still, not a bad flic.
