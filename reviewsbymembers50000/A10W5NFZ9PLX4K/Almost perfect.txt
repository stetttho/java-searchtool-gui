 Vault: 15 Greatest Hits is an excellent, near perfect compilation of Def Leppard's best songs.  It should come as no surprise, and I at least am certainly satisfied, that most of the material used in Vault comes from their hands-down two best albums: Hysteria and Pyromania.  Still, at least in my opinion, it's almost perfect but not quite. Although I'm definitely not anything resembling a Def Leppard "completist" (I only like Hysteria and Pyromania), due to the fact that I love Def Leppard's 'best' songs so much I ended up making my OWN Def Leppard Greatest Hits compilation on CD-R (which is what I also normally end up doing with most other artists' best hits.  My Greatest Hits ended up also having 15 tracks.  It's nearly the exact same as Vault except that the following songs were omitted: 1. When Love And Hate Collide (sounds way too much like "Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad," which is significantly better).  2. Two Steps Behind (very mediocre).  3. Bringin' On The Heartbreak (one of the worst and most annoying Def Leppard songs I've ever heard; very "filler" material).   In their places I substituted the three following songs:  1. Women (awesome lyrics and awesome music.  If not one of the best from Hysteria, most certainly one of the better ones).  2. Gods Of War (one of Def Leppard's most complex and awesome songs ever made.  Very melodic but rocks.  Great pro U.S.A./anti-terrorist song and the ending is great).  3. Too Late For Love (I don't know how this was omitted from Vault considering all the radio play this has received.  Not one of my fav. Leppard songs but very solid, nonetheless). Even though I found a few minor faults with Vault and, like I do with most other bands best hits -make my OWN compilation- Vault should nonetheless satisfy most Def Leppard or hard rock fans.
