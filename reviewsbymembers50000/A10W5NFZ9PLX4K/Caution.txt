 I bought this game, as I had downloaded a demo of it back in 1999 and was very impressed with the demo.  I have a new Dell computer with 1.7 Ghz processor and Windows XP.  I have been discovering the hard way that many, if not most games that came out before Windows XP (my current operating system) are totally incompatible with Windows XP.  Superbike 2000 is no exception.  I even visited the EA Sports website and contacted technical support and they provided no answers.  In fact, the tech support personnel, themselves, attempted to run the game on XP and they told me that they were unable to.   I wanted to purchase Superbike 2001 as well, so I asked EA tech support if that, too, didn't run under Windows XP and they told me that it didn't, also.
