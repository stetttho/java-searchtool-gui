 Back To The Future Part II is simply put, one of the most confusing, unenjoyable and retarded movies I've ever seen.  It's, by far, the worst of the three and should have never been released. In it, Michael J. Fox travels back and forth over and over again through time, to the future and back to the past.  The whole story is confusing, there's little action and the whole movie is just one chaotic plot of mumble jumble.  Although it came out over a decade ago, I only recently saw this movie and sorely wish I hadn't.  It was that bad.
