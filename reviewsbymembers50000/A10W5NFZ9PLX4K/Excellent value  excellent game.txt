 A candidate for GAME OF THE YEAR OF 1999, Descent 3 is, by far, the best of the trilogy and three years later, still remains one of the best-looking and best-playing computer games that I've ever come across. Like the previous two prequels, in Descent 3 one flies a quasi-diminutive robotic ship through neon-lit tunnels, destroying enemy robots, collecting powerups and advancing from level to level in order to complete ones' mission.  One major advantage that this latest installment of the trilogy has over the previous two is that -as opposed to being COMPLETELY limited to the inside of tunnels- in Descent 3 one can access tunnel exits and fly OUTSIDE.   Like other stellar Interplay titles, Descent 3's menu, alone, belongs in the hall of fame: Setup is extremely user-friendly and there are so many options that it's not even funny.  D3's graphics are excellent, the sounds are superb, the weapons are evenly balanced, as is the gameplay -not too fast and not too slow- and the missions are very challenging, but not impossible.   Although Descent 3 may not be for everyone (I, personally loathe Role-Playing-Games and related genres) if you might be or are interested in first-person combat flight simulators replete with technologically-advanced science fiction elements, then you can't go wrong with purchasing Interplay's 9 dollar Descent 3/Mercenary expansion title.  At a mere nine dollars, it's practically too good to be true; it's like winning the lottery or a sweepstakes.
