 Having experienced the UT demo in 1999, I decided to purchase Totally Unreal, knowing very well that it would install and run superbly on my new Dell 1.7 Ghz computer system.  It installed well enough, but like most games that have come out before Windows XP, this one, TOO, did not run on my state-of-the-art system.   I even wrote Infograme's incompetent tech support (they had absolutely no idea how to help me and provided me with only several suggestions) and looked for patches and files on several different websites, including Unreal Tournament's own website.   It's an inexcusable shame that a title this popular doesn't have a patch or update of some type to be compatible with XP, but when you consider that Infogrames produced it, it should come as no suprise.  They're infamous for ruining long-running series (e.g., Test Drive) and most of their demos that I download rank right down there with other inept software companies such as EIDOS and PSYGNOSIS for having no value or playability...
