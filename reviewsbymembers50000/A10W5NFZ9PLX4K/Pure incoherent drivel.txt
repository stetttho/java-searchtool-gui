 I recently purchased this CD because I am somewhat of a stickler for Bass music even though it faded out as quickly as it appeared -sometime in the mid '90s.  Unfortunately, though I'm a fan of this type of music, most bass groups, by far, are talentless and succeed only at incorporating the actual electronic computerized tones and deep, electronic bass beats together. As far as actually combining the sounds into any type of music, most bass groups fail miserably and Techno Bass Crew is no exception. When the CD arrived, I was at awe with the cover album art and thought incorrectly that it would be a good indicator of the overall quality of the music and type of music of this album. Unfortunately, the album cover art comprises half of the one star that I rated this album. The other half is comprised of a few seconds of coherent and talented bass music scattered throughout only several songs on the entire album. Best of Techno Bass Crew provided the deep electronic bass tones and cool computerized sounds that I was looking for. But they were combined so hetergeneously, talentlessly, and incoherently, that the end result was anything BUT music. Simply put, it is nothing but pure, unadulterated drivel and it should, thus, come as no surprise that the only place on earth that I could ever hope to find such a worthless group like Techno Bass Crew is at amazon.com.  Needless to say, I discarded the CD after listening to MOST of the songs (I couldn't bear to listen to the remaining) and didn't even bother asking for a refund. It only cost me several dollars, anyways, though I shouldn't have even paid a nickel for it.
