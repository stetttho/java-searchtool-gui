 Although I'm a fan of "bass" music, most bass albums that I've ever sampled, by far, succeed in providing deep electronic bass tones and beats and combining them with all types of computerized and electronic notes and other tones, but fail miserably in making any type of music with all of their sound effects and beats.  Bass 305, by and large, is one of the few exceptions that I've ever come across in that they actual have talent at forming cool upbeat, sometimes Techno-like, music with their bass beats and computerized sounds.   Even so, most Bass 305 albums still leave a lot to be desired and Virtual Bass is a very typical and mediocre Bass 305 production.  Digital Dreams and Rebel Science are two of Bass 305's best tracks ever.  They're both very upbeat cool songs which excel at the aforesaid formula in namely combining the beats and tones into cool, techno-like melodic songs.  However, basically the remaining tracks are either very mediocre or flat out "fillers," in my opinion.  Bach 305 is a cheesy, lame remake of one of Bach's simpler and more well-known songs.  Does Life Exist On This Planet seems to have potential but ends up being repetitive, kind of lame, and goes nowhere, etc. Purchase this CD if all you care about is showing off your car or home stereo's subwoofer capabilities and want to shatter some windows, but otherwise there's not much substance on this CD.
