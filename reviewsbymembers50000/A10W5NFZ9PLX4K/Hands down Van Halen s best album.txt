 5150 is easily Van Halen's best album.  "Dreams," "Love Walks In," and "Why Can't This Be Love" are three of the best songs that VH has ever come up with.  Like most of other VH's best songs, they are synth-rock combos with very poignant, memorable hooks.  "Summer Nights" and "5150" are decent but not great; the remaining songs are very forgettable and talentless.   5150, the debut of Sammy Hagar, is Van Halen at its apex of its creativity.   In the David Lee Roth era Van Halen's rock was harder but most the material is very simple.  In the Hagar era, VH became more pop-rock oriented, creative, and complex but the vast majority of their songs -as with the Roth era- really don't cut it.  Most Van Halen albums are vastly overrated and  have only 1 or 2 songs at the most that are good. If you want a compilation of Van Halen's best, "The Best of Van Halen, Vol. 1" is a very good compilation.
