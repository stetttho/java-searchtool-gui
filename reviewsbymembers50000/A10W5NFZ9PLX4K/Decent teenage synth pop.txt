 When this album came out in 1990, Anything Box was several teenagers who broke into the music scene with this album, and it actually turned out pretty well, especially considering this was their first attempt at releasing anything. With the exception of two or three songs, the music of "Peace" is high-tempo, upbeat techno pop music consisting solely of keyboards. The music is fairly similar to Erasure's mid '80s material, but even more similar to Camouflage's music. Other than the fact that there are several "fillers" on this CD, my only other dislike about it is that the lyrics are teenage-like (which probably should be expected, anyways) and they're REALLY cheesy. Otherwise, a decent album.
