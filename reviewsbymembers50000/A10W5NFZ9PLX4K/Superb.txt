 The Cure is one of the very few bands of the Alternative Rock genre that I like. As other reviewers have stated, this is The Cure's best album, hands down. Disintegraion has some of the most gothic, romantic and enchanting songs The Cure has ever written.  "Pictures Of You" is deeply emotional and melancholic.  Two other favorite tracks of mine are "Fascination Street," which is has a dark and witchy-ominous quality, and "Lullaby" which is seductive and haunting.   Disintegration can be considered a greatest hits album as it truly has about all of The Cure's best songs.
