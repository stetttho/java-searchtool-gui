 I've been familiar with Yaz's debut -"Upstairs At Eric's"- for quite some time now. I only recently purchased "You And Me Both" and in my understanding it wasn't nearly as successful or popular as Yaz's debut, which is too bad because it's very good in every regard. As with Upstairs At Eric's, Clarke and Moyet each wrote about half of the songs.  Once again the song-writing of both is very good.  The mood of You And Me Both somewhat contrasts Upstairs At Eric's.  While the latter is more upbeat and optimistic, the melodies and direction of the former are more melancholic and tranquil.  The album cover art of You And Me Both represents the general mood very well: Wintery gray and blue.  Notwithstanding it's contrast to Yaz's debut, You And Me Both doesn't have more ballads; it's every bit as danceable as Upstairs At Eric's.  The synth tones that Clarke employs also seems a little different -though they're very similar to the first album- but I like them better in this album and think they're awesome.  I love the synth tones so much that if I had my own band I would probably use the same synthesizer(s) that Clarke did even though they're over 20 years old.  To me they don't sound even quasi-obsolete and probably never will.   My favorite tracks are "Nobody's Diary," "Sweet Thing," "Unmarked," and "Walk Away From Love."  "Ode To Boy" and "Mister Blue" are very good slow songs that are reminiscent of "Winter Kills" (from Upstairs At Eric's).  Like the debut, there are a few fillers but most of the album is great. If you are familiar with Upstairs At Eric's and liked it, you shouldn't hesitate to purchase You And Me Both which is every bit as good.  All fans of '80s new wave/synth pop should have both albums in their collection as Yaz is one of the first and, in my opinion, the best of the genre.  They're my favorite group, in fact.
