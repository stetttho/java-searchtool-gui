 Some think that Erasure was at its best early in their career, others think that they blossomed in the '90s. As far as I'm concerned, it's more a matter of tastes than anything else; their '80s material has a very distinct sound from their '90s, synthesizer-wise and also in the approach that Erasure wrote hooks: Clarke heavily employed more acoustic-sounding synthesizer tones in the '80s (in particular, with the Oberheim Xpander synthesizer) and Clarke's focus was in making songs which were fairly simple and short but poignant and very memorable, nonetheless.  Sometime in the late '80s or early '90s Clarke reverted back to analog synths (which have a more computerized and metallic sounding quality) and made darker and more complex songs, though the hooks and songwriting were as creative as ever. That being said, "The Two Ring Circus" is my favorite '80s Erasure album, and in my opinion also their best '80s album.  It is a compilation of remixes of Erasure's best cuts from "Hideaway" and "The Circus."  The remixes are generally well-done though a few seem to drag on for too long.  My favorite remix, by far, is "Hideaway-Little Louie Vega Mix" which I like FAR better than the original Hideaway. The song combines a full sequence of layered synth tones, for a full, rich sound, and a very melancholic and emotional melody which is powerful and unforgettable.  In fact, this remix is probably my favorite Erasure song of all time.  All the other tracks are great as well; even the three orchestral songs are good. The album also contains six live tracks from a German concert including "Gimme Gimme Gimme" which is an ABBA remake, done superbly.      Whatever your tastes are in Erasure, there's no denying that this is one of their best and a must-have, in particular, for anybody with a passing interest in this British duo or an Erasure cognoscenti who has a craving for '80s Erasure-esque nostalgia.
