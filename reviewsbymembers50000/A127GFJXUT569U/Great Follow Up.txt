 This book was a great follow up to Break Every Rule.  I was intrigued by Luke Grayson and Catherine Stewart.  I was somewhat surprised by the amount of dramatic issues in this book but it only added some suspense.  I truly enjoyed how the entire Falcon clan and Taggert clan was included in the conclusion.  Ms. Ray's writing style is very descriptive without being overbearing and you can actually visualize the place and time.  Excellent writing.  While this book was truly about Catherine and Luke, adding Dominique and Trent to the mix with their issues was great.  Oh, Mama Grayson is one of kind!.. Good job!
