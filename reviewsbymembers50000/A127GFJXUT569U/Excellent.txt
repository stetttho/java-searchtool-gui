 During the month of May 2001 I began to read the romance novels of Donna Hill.  This is the fifth novel of Donna Hill that I have read this month.  This third installment, which started with A Private Affair, was simply wonderful and on point.  Throughout the three novels involving Quinn, Nikkita, Maxine and then Rae.  I prayed that Quinn would find peace within himself and come into his own.  I was not disappointed. Though the Fire explored Quinn's deeply hidden emotional issues and his ability to either deal with them or not.  I truly enjoyed his love affair with Rae, a very strong and committed woman with her own baggage. This is story of two people who lost loved ones and their guilt behind it all.  The secondary characters were truly wonderful in that they assisted in seeing Quinn and Rae through their baggage.  This was a perfect ending to some very complexed characters and it was a treat to see it all come to fuition.  I will definitely read more by Donna Hill! A Fan for Life!
