 Life was never kind to John King or Connie Rogers.  John, a drifter by circumstance, claims his home is his car and the road is his paradise.  Marvin Gaye's "Lets Get It On" is his mantra.  Connie is a child of the streets.  Forced to live on the streets of Denver, Colorado as child, Connie had and continues to have a hard road to toll.   One Day I Saw A Black King by J. D. Mason is her second novel of individuals down on their luck and living with the hand they are dealt.  Mason opens the door to John's car and out steps a black king.  The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language defines a king as a male sovereign; one that is supreme or preeminent in a particular group, category, or sphere. Is this the same king that Connie comes into contact with?  Both characters are running from their pasts.  John's past is rooted in Texas and haunts him daily.  With a little mysticism, Mason has captured John's spirit and desires.  Hauntingly, Connie's past is right there in Denver, never allowing her to forget or to move on.  When these two lost souls come together is it out of need, lust or is it pure romance?  Is Connie the woman that finally grabs a hold of John never to let go? Mason has incorporated excellent secondary characters with exciting dialogue that add depth to the story line for a better understanding of how and why John and Connie came to be.  The novel opens with an atrocious event and ends with a satisfying conclusion.  The story is heart wrenching, touching and the characters are fully developed.  This is an excellent novel of individuals attempting to overcome their past and live for today and for the future.  Reviewed by Dawn R. Reeves APOOO BookClub
