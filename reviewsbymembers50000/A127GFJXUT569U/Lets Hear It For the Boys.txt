 This was a great book, a quick read and the message was very clear, although I never had my doubts.  Parry Brown exposed the ruthlessness of women with this one-Ms. Catherine Hawkins, unbelievable!  The word family and love describe this book to the T.  The friendships and love between Terry, Roland, Jackie and Cedes was enjoyable.  The children helped shaped their parents and the parents did an excellent job of raising them.  Momma C and Teresa were excellent mothers and their childrens' rock.  Love of self and of others is the one emotion that can sustain us in times of trouble.  Good job Parry Brown!
