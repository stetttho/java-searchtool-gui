 Most of the residents of the Ida B. are family and a somewhat strange bunch.  Karen Quinones Miller?s Ida B., is the story of those that inhabit the Ida B. Barrett Wells Tower in Harlem.  The residents featured wrestle with wanting to leave and needing to leave and when it appears their hands are forced, the old fear of possibly succeeding, rears its ugly head.  Three main characters are featured - Brenda Carver is a single mom of four by four different men.  With a father in prison and his impending release, Brenda often wonders if his unavailability was the root of her deeds.   Rosa Rivera is an aspiring actress and best friend to Brenda.  The mixture of Brenda?s family and friends and Rosa?s is hilarious as we watch Rosa try to make it on stage.  Sharif Goldsby is the tower?s activist and scented oil man.  When the residents need assistance with bureaucracies and red tape, Sharif is their man. In addition to their stories, we have a murder at the tower that everyone gets involved in solving.  This murder hits home, breaks your heart and pulls you into the investigation.    I truly enjoyed these eclectic characters, their antics and the dialogue.  Karen?s descriptive prose and vivid imagery has a way of landing you there with the familial and nostalgic feelings.  Finally, knowing what is best for you and yours is not always enough for you to succeed in moving forward; something keeps you grounded in the familiar and that is the Ida B.    Reviewed by Dawn R.
