 When we met Zoe in Jackson Sloan's debut novel, Saturday's Child, we knew she was a force to be reckoned with.  What we did not see was the full force of that reckoning.  Wednesday's Woes by Gayle Jackson Sloan, is the story of Zoe, one of four sisters within a blended family.    Zoe feels she has more woes than the average person.  What she does not realize is how her own behavior plays into the negativity.  After her divorce, she takes up with a much younger man by the name of Antonio, and moves him into her household along with her three teenage children. Her oldest child is dating a girl you would not take home to your momma; her daughter is too smart for her own good and her youngest son is in the middle, not really causing any problems but living amongst the chaos within the household and beyond.  Added to this mix are Zoe's sisters and their secret ways and drama and her ex-husband Vaughn and his meddlesome ways.  Everything is brought to a climax when a death occurs in the family, which has Zoe reflecting on her life and her past.  Just when things appear to settle down and she makes a decision that will affect all, she discovers a secret of Antonio's and later, the secret of her best friend Tamika.  All bets are off as to whether or not both relationships will survive.  Understand, Zoe has issues with trust; once it is broken there is no turning back as all can attest to.  I looked forward to Jackson-Sloan's sophomore novel because Zoe piqued my interest in her debut.  This one provided another racy storyline with strong and believable dialogue, realistic characters, storytelling with uniqueness and strong visualization of people, places and things.  Entertaining and captivating without an ending you would come to expect.  Reviewed by Dawn R. Reeves APOOO BookClub
