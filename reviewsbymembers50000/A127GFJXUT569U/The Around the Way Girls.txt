 A story of one side of track meeting and falling in love with other side of the track.  Regina led a hard knock life and pulled herself up and moved on up.  However, she did not forget where she came from as she continued to live in both worlds.  When the two worlds collide, fireworks begin.   Charles, her nemesis turned lover, turned husband was as assuming as they come along with his mother.  I absolutely lover Reverend Whitfield and Momma Tee.  Regina's homegirls were more like her sisters in that they were there for each other and like real life the green-eyed monster did rear his ugly head.   The characters were portrayed realistically!  There are others worlds out there other than our own, so the possibility does exist.  The surprise for me was that the ending was not predictable.  We can read other genres for predictable endings.  This was not disappointing.  I cheered Regina as she stood by her decision. I will read the hard cover version, as it will have 50 additional pages.  Hmmmm, I wonder what could be in those 50 additional pages. Karen, great book and this will go down as one of my favorite and funniest reads.  Yes, the escapades of the women, especially Regina, were hilarious and Puddin's mouth, welllllllll.  There was a message in all this madness!   KUDOS
