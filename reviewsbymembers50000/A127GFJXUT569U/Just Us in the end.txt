 Upon opening this book you get the feeling that one of the four friends is murdered and no one knows who did it; no one can believe it.  As you continue to read you realize that each friend has a story to be told. The Justus Girls is the story of four friends coming of age in the 60s.  Four friends involved in a drill team as children; four friends with their own distinct childhood.  I liked that each alternating chapter told pieces of each girl's/woman's story from childhood through adulthood.  Four friends with secrets and shame.  Four friends with their own personalities and when one dies the remaining realize that they have not been there for each other.  As they set out to discover who killed their friend they rediscover each other. There are characters that you absolutely love and characters that you hate.  There are mini stories told here but they are all necessary to understand who the Justus Girls really are. This story is wonderful and when the killer is revealed the reader will be surprised.  Slim, my hats off to you.  The descriptions of Philly and the neighborhoods were on point.  This is a well-written story of true friendship and ties that bind.
