 This is the second book that I have read by Francis Ray, the other was Heart of the Falcon.  It has been a long time since I read Francis Ray and it was suggested that I start again with this one.  I loved it!  Dominique was tough and resilient and downright stubborn; Trent was caring with his own baggage.  The Falcon clan, they are too much!  There to the rescue at the drop of a hat. I do enjoy Ms. Ray's writing style.  Her words flow without providing too much complication or muddled thoughts on the part of her characters.  I will continue to read more and hopefully I will not stop for a few years and begin again.  Now I know what I have missed!
