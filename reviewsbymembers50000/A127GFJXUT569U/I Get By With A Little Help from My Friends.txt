 After the Storm by Cassandra Darden Bell is truly a story about finding oneself and coming into your own.  On the surface, thirty-three year old Jessi Andrews has captured the American Dream: the husband, twin boys, the house, a satisfying career and special girlfriends.  One day, just as a storm is brewing in Florida, Jessi arrives at her husband's used car lot and discovers his infidelity.  This act catapults her to take stock in her life and begin a search of self-discovery.  With help of her best friends Karen and Regina, coupled with her love of shoes, Jessi begins her journey by taking care of her marriage, going on an Alaskan vacation and becoming an entrepreneur.  In addition to her issues, her mother is a thorn in her side and she soon discovers that she must contend with her problems on her own and stop seeking her mother's approval.  This discovery brings with it information from her mother that is heaven sent.   One problem I have is the lack of storyline as it pertains to the children and their emotions from their parents divorce; it is non-existent.  However, the author paints a vivid portrait of Florida and its inhabitants during the stormy season.  She utilizes witty dialogue between the characters that make for some laugh out loud moments and some shocking discoveries.  Finally, in the form of secondary storylines, she highlights issues that two friends must contend with which demonstrate her ability to intermingle tales but never overshadow the main story being told.  After the Storm is an inspiring and uplifting chronicle of life during and after the storm.  Reviewed by Dawn R. Reeves APOOO BookClub
