 Tupac Shakur has always been interesting to me. A fellow book club member read, reviewed and praised this book, so immediately I was intrigued. Throughout the years I have read snippets of Tupac's life that also piqued my curiosity.  Much of what was written and portrayed prior to his death was the life of a thug rapper and little was written about his intelligence, his mind and his childhood.  Darrin Bastfield's book, Back In the Day: My Life and Times With Tupac Shakur is the book to read if you want a fresh perspective on Tupac, the child and the man he became. Bastfield does an excellent job of portraying his life with Tupac and other friends during their days at the Baltimore School for the Performing Arts.  Through his portrayal we see a child raised in poverty literally; a child raised by a mother both weak and strong and a child forced to become a man much too soon.  Bastfield is mesmerized by Tupac's intelligence and his excellent skill at acting and so was I. He is surprised at Tupac's love of Shakespeare and so was I. There is one additional book written about Tupac Shakur by a writer that I highly respect but Back In the Day is the beginning and is necessary because it sets the stage for all others to come.  Who better to write about Tupac's childhood than a childhood friend?  One more note: this brother can write! Reviewed by Dawn R. Reeves ...
