 I found this book to very good.  However, I am of the opinion that you must be a member of sorority or fraternity to understand the pledge process, the ball, etc. I found the book very difficult to put down because the storyline kept me intrigued.  I really enjoyed Ms. Mattie. There were numerous characters and yes you needed a scorecard to keep up with who was related to whom and who fathered whom. All in all I throughly enjoyed this book.
