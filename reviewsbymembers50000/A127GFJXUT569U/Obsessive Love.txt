 The narrator is left at the altar and discovers that his would be bride has another partner.  Surprise-the partner is a woman. This book is not a typical romance or contemporary fiction where you have a lover's triangle. This triangle involves a man and two women; One of the main character's wants both lovers.  One of those lovers wants to complete the triangle thus making a circle.  Another surprise, it is not who you would assume.  What is so intriguing about this novel is that it is a deep, psychological look into sexuality and how some may question their own identity. With this novel you have betrayal, jealousy, deceit and self-discovery.  Also, material wealth comes into play in the form of self-promotion. You want to dislike one of the main characters, Nicole, because at first glance she is spoiled, hypocritical and selfish.  But for some reason you cannot dislike her.  I found myself cheering on the narrator wishing that he would come out the winner.  In the end he was a winner.  The feelings are also explored of the secondary characters such as the parents and friends of the main characters.  Those secondary characters provide some insight into the behavior of your major players. I've only read Sister, Sister, Cheaters and Friends and Lovers and was surprised at the level this book took on.  It was not what I expected. This reader is in awe!  KUDOS!!!!!!!!!!!!!
