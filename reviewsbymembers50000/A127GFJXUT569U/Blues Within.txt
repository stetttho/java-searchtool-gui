 In the heart of Mississippi are five siblings partaking in sibling rivalry at its best.  Cassandra Darden Bell's Mississippi Blues is the story of five sisters and brothers who are as different as night is to day and showcases how each forged their way into adulthood, some with success and others, if you are judging, not so successful.  All of them stayed in Mississippi with the exception of Beverly Lemark, a best selling writer penning under an assumed name.    Looking from the outside in, one would assume that Beverly has it all, her writing career, a husband, two children and a beautiful home.  But as Beverly is left alone to write, her drinking increases and the writing decreases.  When Beverly receives word that she must return to Mississippi to attend to family business, her lonely yet seemingly idyllic life comes crashing down.  Mississippi Blues pits sibling against sibling through lack of communication and lack of understanding.  Beverly comes to realize through a tragic event that she must stop running away from her problems and we cannot choose our family but in the end it is family first and forever.    Cassandra Darden Bell showcases a story with a clear imagery of the Vicksburg, Mississippi area, developed characters who are likeable and not so likeable and dialogue that is heartfelt and realistic.  A truly touching story.  Reviewed by Dawn R. Reeves APOOO BookClub
