 I rated this book by E. Lynn Harris as average.  I did enjoy it but compared to the previous four, this one was okay.  I love the way E. Lynn Harris inter-connects his characters with sequal like theme.  I was glad when Basil's problem was exposed.  His behavior made a lot of sense.  I guess he will be on the prowl again hurting and destroying another life.  He met his match with Miss Yancey. Miss Yancey is another story entirely.  Her mother was the master manipulator. Basil's one desire, conquering Raymond Tyler, adds an unsettled edge to Basil.
