 Serpent In My Corner by JDaniels highlights Hennessy Cooper working as an undercover FBI agent. Hennessy's assignment is to infiltrate the robbery ring of Tristan (T. J.) James.  Hennessy has followed in the footsteps of her father, a retired police officer.  She is smart, witty and cunning to the point that T. J. falls for her and all bets are off.  With one more robbery to add to his elusive trophy case, T. J. swears this heist will set his partners and himself financially free for life.  What T. J. does not know is that someone other than the FBI is out to foil his plan for reasons of revenge.  But the question remains-who is the real serpent-Hennessy or these unknown assailants. JDaniels captivates the reader regarding T. J.'s life as she portrays his life growing up as child in South Central Los Angeles and his relationship with his mother and his former neighborhood.  We relive his stint in the penitentiary and an important friendship that he cultivates until the very end. Furthermore, T. J. has a demon that haunts him daily that adds intrigue to this story filled with crime, suspense and romance.  The reader is taken on a whirlwind and energetic ride from Los Angeles to Washington, D. C., to picturesque New Mexico and back again.  JDaniels' descriptions of these locales provide a necessary backdrop to the story at hand.    This is an excellent and fast paced story involving matters of the heart with multicultural characters that put stereotypes to rest. No one is whom he or she appears to be. Reviewed by Dawn R.
