 Rivers of the Souls is a soul stirring love story. Antoinette "Toni" and Jerome were high school sweethearts who went their separate ways after high school and through fate, crossed each other's paths twenty years later. But was that love really lost or were Toni and Jerome just going through the motions? Twenty years seems like a lifetime and things have changed tremendously with their families, friends and themselves.  While this story explores Toni and Jerome's emotions at the changes and needs in their lives, it also examines that of their friends and families.  Buddy and Snoop are Jerome's friends from back in the day and Val and Trace, while married respectively to the aforementioned, are friends of Toni.  Toni's father is remarried to meddlesome May and Toni's sister Adrienne is a free spirit living in Los Angeles.  The relationship between Toni, Adrienne and May is touched upon but you feel that there has to be more.  And of equal importance is Aunt Pearline who spouts her own brand of wisdom. The secondary characters are very important to this story as it gives the novel its completeness. Leslie Esdaile has crafted a touching story utilizing metaphors, foreshadowing, detail, debates and loose ends to leave you hanging to await the sequel.  This is not a neatly packaged romance novel where everything is happily ever after because when completed, you have no idea what the future holds for the characters.  Excellent story!
