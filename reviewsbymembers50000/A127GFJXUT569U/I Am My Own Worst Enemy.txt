 Reggie Bynum has a long and hard road to toll; he is a single father raising two teenage daughters in Harlem.  On top of this, his sister Charlene (Charlie) visits often to cook and offer her own brand of discipline and advice.  The novel is prefaced with a brief story of Reggie and Charlie as teenagers and the responsibilities put upon them. We get a glimpse of Reggie and his interactions with women, which sets the stage for his adulthood relationships. Reggie promises himself that he will never leave his family, like his father did, and will always provide what he can for them.  Because of this affirmation, Reggie, a former professional gambler, takes a job as a garbage collector; it is honest and steady work.  Reggie's wife Sharon and the girls' mother, abandons the family because of this decision. Nineteen-year-old Tiara Bynum is a beautiful and smart college student and she knows it.  She uses her looks to get what she wants; it is all about Tiara and she damns anyone who gets in her way.  Sister Josephine (Jo-Jo) is a basketball phenomenon suffering through the growing pains of adolescence.  She is typically Tiara's punching bag. Tiara is caught in a dangerous game because she has her eyes set on two young men; one who is interested in her and one who could not care less.  Rashad presents a challenge to Tiara because no man has ever resisted her charm.  Rashad is a cab driver and film school student.  Lionel presents a different challenge to Tiara; he is rich and able to provide her with any tangible item her little heart desires.  Lionel has a dark side and the entire family is caught up in his web of deceit. Using What You Got offers some life lessons that can be enjoyed by both teenagers and adults.  Miller has offered a very realistic and engaging look into the trials and tribulations that many families can go through based on poor decision making; the meaning of family first and forgiveness.
