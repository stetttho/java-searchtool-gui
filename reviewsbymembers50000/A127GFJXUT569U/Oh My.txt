 This book was recommended to me by a friend.  I was very leary at first but I thought I'd take a chance.  I enjoyed the book, although I found it to be very graphic.  I like the fact that it was somewhat open-ended.  It left reader wanting more.  I have continued to read all of Mr. Harris' novels and I enjoyed all of them.  Some are better than others. But one thing that is a sure bet-Basil Henderson is the central figure with many issues that leave this reader, at least, wanting to know more.  My hats off to Mr. Harris because I was truly reluctant.
