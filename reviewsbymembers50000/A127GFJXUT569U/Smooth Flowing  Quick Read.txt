 This is the first book that I have read by Tim McCann and I can say that I will read another one.  I found this book to be an easy read that made you stop and think about life and the love within your life.  I thought that each character was developed enough for the reader to understand their issues, even the secondary characters.  You understood Betty's hesitation when it came to relationships with the opposite sex; you understood Jacqui's harsh attitude towards men and you felt for Drew and his lose.  Not too much suspense but why does there have to be?  Some of the old school quotes from the parents were classic-"You get what you got".  Some of Jacqui's reasonings were very funny! Great!
