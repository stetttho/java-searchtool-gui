 This fourth novel of KLR introduces us to Sydney, Gina and Rick; sibling that are close but oh so different and their mother Delores.  The story reveals issues of domestic violence, sexual molestation, parent care and fear of commitment.  It's almost sad that one family had to endure so much pain and heartache.   KLR writes this story with so much ease to the reader that you can only cheer them on as they battle their latest drama.  The story was so realistic that you could feel their pain and triumphs.  This book made this reader stop and think "what if", "what would I do".  I believe that books should be read  for entertainment, learning and last but not least, must be thought provoking.  This had all of the above. I enjoyed this story and many blessing to Kimberla as she continues to entertain her readers with such real stories from the heart.
