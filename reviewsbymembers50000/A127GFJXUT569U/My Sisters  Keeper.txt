 Simply put The Savvy Sistahs by Brenda Jackson is a girlfriend-to-girlfriend novel with a twist.  These girlfriends, Amber, Brandy and Carla, are not lifelong friends that met during childhood and remained friends, they met at a support group for business women in Orlando, Florida and from that forged their own triple bond of friendship.  Each came into the group with their own set of baggage but one thing remains constant, they each have no time or patience for relationships with the opposite sex.  Amber is a survivor of an abusive marriage and the owner of Amber's Books and Gifts.  Through a divorce settlement, Brandy becomes the owner of the St. Laurent Hotel.  Brandy was highlighted in Jackson's novel Family Reunion and someone is back stalking her with ties to that novel.  Carla, a single mother, is named CEO of Osborne Computer Network after her father dies and finds her company the object of a hostile takeover.   The men highlighted in this story are endearing as well and also carry some of the same baggage when it comes to relationships with the opposite sex.  Cord Jeffries is an accountant and a very bitter man who must learn to let go of the past and judge people as individuals.  Grey Masters is a private investigator and ex-FBI agent who has kept a haunting secret from his family about his failed marriage and Jesse Devereau is a west coast corporate raider with no shame to his manipulations and takeovers of successful companies.  What role do these men play in the lives of the savvy sistahs? In true Brenda Jackson fashion, The Savvy Sistahs is a novel about family and the ties that bind, finding love in the most unexpected places and last but certainly not least, new friendships that span the test of time.
