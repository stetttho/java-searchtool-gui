 While structurally different and small in stature, A Piece of Sky by Nicole Bailey-Williams is a poignant novel of a young girl's pain, guilt and survival.  Song Byrd is the youngest, illegitimate daughter of a prostitute.  Included in this family are three older siblings with their own demons.  In addition to her family, A Little Piece of Sky reveals the relationships that Song has with others such as her neighbor, Mrs. Olga and her biological father.  It is through them and their offerings that Song comes into her own. Told in Song's voice, the chapters are titled after her thoughts while giving the reader a look into her life.  Two chapters that really stood out were "I Wish."  Song wished that she were not poor; that she lived in a better neighborhood with less noise, but for some reason unbeknownst to Song, her mother needed the noise.  Song's ultimate wish was that she would be enough for her mother.  The other captivating chapter was "A Little Piece of Sky."  Representing Song's hope for a better future, this chapter captured the essence of Song's pain in which she vowed never to look up at the sky again.  Each chapter is lyrically written and tells a hopeful story of Song while exposing some character revelations.  Add to the fact the social and economic commentary throughout and you have a wonderfully written story of a young girl's life in a low-income section of Philadelphia followed by her life as a middle income resident and the transition that followed.
