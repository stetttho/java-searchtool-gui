 The Bondswoman's Narrative is a history lesson in its own right but more than that, it is a somewhat detailed exploration into the process of authenticating a rare auction piece.   The story of Hannah Craft takes you from Virginia, Washington, D.C., North Carolina and New Jersey during mid-1850 through 1860.  This too is cause for a great discussion to authenticate when this piece was written.  Hannah references many prominent politicians throughout her manuscript and she delves into the heart and soul of the slaves; whether they are house slaves or field slaves.  Her exploits are interesting to say the least.  While her story is captivating, what is more engrossing is Gates' ability to demonstrate the originality of Hannah's story.  Utilizing professionals, Mr. Gates offers a detailed piece into the paper and ink used to write the manuscript to further drive home the point of when The Bondswoman's Narrative could have possibly been written. The reference to other literary pieces that Hannah cites throughout her work provides some needed proof that Hannah was somewhat educated, if not self-taught.  What I found most helpful while reading The Bondswoman's Narrative were the notes on text found in the appendixes.  To read and then reference proved insightful.  I am of the opinion that this is historical reading at its best.   Reviewed by Dawn APOOO Bookclub
