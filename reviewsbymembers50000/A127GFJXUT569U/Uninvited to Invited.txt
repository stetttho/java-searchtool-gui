 Antwone Quenton Fisher, you have done a wonderful job of telling your life story!  The story of Fish was both sad and joyful.  The story of a boy abandoned to the child welfare system upon birth not knowing whom he was nor where he came from.   This story was sad in that Antwone faced so many hardships at a young age by so many adults that it was repulsive.  A child welfare system with so much staff turn over, no one knew Fish or his story.  A system that is charged with protecting children that they didn't follow up on their suspicions.  A system that is so reactive as opposed to proactive. Fish would finally come into his own to find joy if not so much forgiveness.  Along the way there were a few good hearted adults-his teacher (I clapped for her), his final child welfare worker (good advice given), the military personnel and Todd Black.  These adults believed in Fish and he took their advice and made a good life for himself and his family. My favorite was the reunion with his family.  I was so pleased that they accepted him as their nephew without reservations.  What was sad to me was that Fish was so near to them but yet so far, unbelievable!  Finally, Fish coming to terms (if only limited) with the realization of his mother's life and her life as a young teenage mother.   The novel was written simplistically and gripping enough that you could feel Fish's pain and his joy. Kudos to Fish as you continue to showcase your talents. I recommend this novel to everyone, young, old, black, white, red and brown
