 I wish they had a 4.5 rating because in my opinion this book was exactly that.  It took me all of one day to read; this page turner!  During the first chapter my thoughts were that this book was simplistic and for young adults.  As I continued to read I realized that many questions about life choices were revealed.    Charis, a senior in college, has many decisions to make-do I pledge the sorority that my great-grandmother founded; do I go to law school as expected; do I move to New York or Washington as my friends wish; do I forgive and see this triflin' man that broke my heart again, do I squeal on my sosority sisters.  It was almost too much for one person to bear.  Life choices, how do we choose?  Am I making the correct decision? Ms. Hughes was able to draw the reader into Charis' world and make this reader reflect back to my college days, my pledge process and the after affects.  I found myself asking "why did I pledge?"  "What were my motivations, expectations?"  This book also touched on some of the class issues within the AA community. Also, the portrayal of the secondary characters, parents, relatives, friends and other students, was great. I recommend this book to current college students, college-bound students and us ole' school folks who have been there.  Good work Ms. Hughes!
