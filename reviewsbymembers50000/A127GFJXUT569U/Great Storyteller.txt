 Dawn Turner Trice is a great storyteller.  She was able to make this reader visualize the surroundings and the characters' emotions.  I loved the relationship between Temmy and Jonetta.  Jonetta was able to guide and protect Temmy with her recollections of the past and her dreams for the future.  The other characters, Alfred Mayes, Judd, Fat Daddy, Chittlin', Hump, Reatha Mae, Felicia, Thomas, Aunt Jennie and Ms. Lily were definitely characters and left nothing to the imagination. However, I must say that I expected more drama from reading the jacket cover.  Certain portions were not explored and left this reader asking questions.  For example, Temmy's friend Gerald saying he had a secret about her father but it was never revealed and Temmy's father ignoring her while he was talking with one of his students.  These two incidents were never explained and it left the reader wondering.  Some of the happenings in the book were predictable-City Hall's actions and Valeries' secret.  The newspaper article grabbed my attention but then the story slowly played itself out.  All-in-all I did enjoy this book.  Dawn Turner Trice is great at telling a story!
