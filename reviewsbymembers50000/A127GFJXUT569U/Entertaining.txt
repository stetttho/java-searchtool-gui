 Very entertaining.  I felt for Greg and found him refreshing; loathe his mother but she was the only one who peeped what was going on; pitied his father but cheered him at the same time for being a strong man; cheered for Adrian until her lies and plots were discovered; found her parents strange until I knew what they knew; found Greg's friends true to life and hilarious!  This book was funny but half-way through I knew what the deal was.  However, with that said, the ending was great!  This is a fast-paced and funny read.
