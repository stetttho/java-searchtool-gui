 For me, Still Waters Run Deep was a much-anticipated sequel to Rivers of the Soul and I was not disappointed.  While reading this novel, I was often reminded of and hummed that oldie tune of the same title. In Rivers of the Soul, Toni and Jerome reintroduced themselves to each other with the excitement and freshness of new lovers.  Still Waters Run Deep picks up where Rivers of the Soul left off, with Toni and Jerome taking their relationship public and going through the trials and tribulations of meshing careers, finances and blending families.  After finding each other, knowing that they are each other's soul mate, will they be able to navigate the obstacles placed before them? Still Waters Run Deep goes several steps further by examining Toni and Jerome's responses to their responsibilities; their ability to handle crisis; their speculations of the uncertainty of their relationship and revealing some truths that neither knew about the other. Leslie Esdaile's characters are feisty and strong willed; the situations are descriptive, vivid and realistic.  This sequel, while long on pages, is quick and thought-provoking. What I took from this novel is to dream, instill your faith in that dream and never let go. .....Reviewed by Dawn R. Reeves, APOOO BookClub.
