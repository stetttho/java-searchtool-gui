 The light skinned/dark skinned saga was always fascinating to me and this book was no different.  This book about classism is a good read featuring Mrs. Eulelie Giles.  Mrs. Giles was ruthless in her treatment of her children and the people around her but she had a lot of gull.  My one disappointment was not exposing Eulelie to others.  However I was amazed that her secret was known to more folks than she knew.  This was an excellent twist and it explained Gil's questions and comments throughout the book.  Patricia Jones' writing style is one that is picturesque; I could see and feel the landmarks of Baltimore. Some portions were rather drawn out and I was shouting "get to it". The children were spoiled, obnoxious and so unreal.  Camilla Hightower was a bright light that I found myself cheering on! I was glad that Sandra found true happiness. I hope that people like them do not exist today but I know that's not the  case.  Good Subject matter and good job Ms. Jones.
