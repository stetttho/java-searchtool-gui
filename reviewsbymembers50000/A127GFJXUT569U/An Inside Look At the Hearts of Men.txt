 We can only assume what the heart a man may hold. Never do we really know because they are not as forthcoming. The Hearts of Men made me smile, laugh out loud, gasp and cry. This was truly a touching story. The characters were portrayed so realistically that you could see glimpses of folks in your life. The novel centered on the lives of three generations of men, none related by blood but related by manhood. Poppa Doc, with his wisdom of life and responsibilities, was my favorite. He touched all their lives in a very profound way. Bernard, a son, husband and father who thought he was doing the right things but unable to see his ways were helping to destroy his marriage. I felt his pain and was overjoyed that he was able to fight through his pain. And finally we have Prodigy (a unique name). Prodigy, who has been there, done that, was able to open his heart to a child and his child. Prodigy came full circle to finally find peace and happiness.  Travis Hunte!r writes with so much enthusiasm and realism that this was a quick read with many messages that you cannot help but heed. Good job!
