 I've always enjoyed reading about male friendships and this book was very funny and at times thought provoking. We have Dexter-trying to do the right thing but not exactly enjoying it; Ibn-the classic fine brotha with his demented views of women; Mike-the good guy until......; Colin-the doormat (I found myself praying that he would see the light); and finally Bunches-who taught the guys a few things about the opposite sex. This book will make you laugh at some of their shenanigans. I had a hard time putting it down to do the necessary things in life.  I had to know how it ended.  However, I did find myself wondering about Mrs. Truitt because there was no  mention of her after her departure. Although I found it to be a funny and appealing book, it did enlightened me to some of the thoughts, hopes and dreams that men have.  Get this for a quick and lighthearted read! Oh-Tiffany, way to go, LOL!
