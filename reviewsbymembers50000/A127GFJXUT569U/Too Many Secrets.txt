 The title, Momma's Baby, Daddy's Maybe, is a catchy title that could lead a reader to believe that the unknown paternity of a child is the issue.  However, Momma's Baby, Daddy's Maybe, Jamise L. Dames' debut novel, offers much more of an intricate storyline than the title indicates.  The Jacobs siblings, Simone, Derrick and Kennedy, have always been there for each other since the [end of life] of their parents as children, but when it comes to their relationships, they keep to themselves.  Why all of the secrets, why can't they be forthright with each other? Simone is at the top of her game in the corporate world but her lover, Nigel, has a deep dark secret; Kennedy is a single mother and graduate student that can hold her own with the best of them and her child's father, Jared, is a force to be reckoned with when it comes to absentee fathers.  Are Kennedy and Jared over each other?  Brother Derrick is a man that will not commit until love comes surprisingly knocking at his door and thrown into this mix is best friend Miranda and the issues that plague her relationship.  Together, these siblings fight their way through a myriad of life issues. Momma's Baby, Daddy's Maybe is a fast paced novel filled with secrets, facades, lust, sadness, shame and love.  Readers' curiosity will be piqued because of the entanglements formed and the resolutions of the intertwined story.  Filled with passion and emotion, the plot is intriguing and will beg you to continue reading until the last page.  Kudos to Jamise L. Dames for a very good, plot driven and engaging read.
