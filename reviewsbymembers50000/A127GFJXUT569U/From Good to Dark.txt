 The story of Thai Williams takes the reader from Washington DC to Charlotte, NC. The story of young, employed black male recently graduated from high school with ambitions of attending college.  We watch as Thai commits a murder in the heat of passion at the persuasion of his friends and his male ego.  We watch as Thai tries to come to terms with his crime.  Thai tries to make sense of his past, present and finally his future.  Kenji Jasper takes us into the mind of Thai as he attempts to justify his actions and that of others.  Throughout the book you realize that Thai could never answer the important questions, he always had someone else answer them for him.   Jasper's writing style was simplistic in that the book flowed for the reader.  We also come to understand the other characters in the book, such as his closest friends, parents and even the absentee mothers and the profund affect they had on Thai. At nineteen, this was young man that rarely traveled beyond his DC neighborhood with the exception of the occasional trip to a party in another DC neighborhood or a suburb of Maryland.  Traveling to Charlotte opened up an entirely new world for him.  A world that he was uncomfortable in because he was not exposed to other possibilities. Trouble did however find Thai in Charlotte and as one saying goes-if you keep doing the same thing in the same way, you get what you always got. I truly enjoyed how the book opened because it was an invitation to read on.  With the ending this reader was left wondering what became of Thai but I did not find the lack of closure a disappointment.   Great reading material for young and old; highly recommended for the young.
