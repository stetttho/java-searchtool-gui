 Sheila Williams' second offering of a down on her luck woman packs the same punch as her first offering, Dancing On the Edge of the Roof.  The Shade of My Own Tree introduces Opal Sullivan, a mentally and physically battered divorcee trying to decide what to do with her life.  Williams expertly takes us back in time to relive Opal's life as a young mother and wife forced to sever ties with her extended family.   After purchasing a dilapidated house in Appalachia, Opal puts in motion the necessary renovations to take in female boarders temporarily.  While the core of the novel highlights Opal's strengths coupled with the reservations of putting her dreams in motion, Williams showcases some very zany characters that add much-needed humor to Opal's situation.  These characters allow Opal to offer a helping hand in their lives while Opal gets a glimpse of the person she once was.  What better person to help a battered woman than a former battered woman.   With witty dialogue, a helping hand from Opal and from the boarders and other new friends, Sheila Williams offers hope for everyday women with a renewed energy. Reviewed by Dawn R.
