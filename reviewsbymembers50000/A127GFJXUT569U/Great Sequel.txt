 Will there be a third part?  I truely enjoyed the story lines in both Ms. James' books.  "Beyond" explored the girls' as adults several years after college.  It answered the question of the rift between Barb, Debra, Catherine and Marilyn.  It also explored the backround of their male counterparts.  It was amazing to me that Debran and Della were Ms. Mattie's children.  Excellent writing! We still do not know who Lisa's father is and at this point it does not matter.  Maybe I missed who Lisa's mother was (Debra or Della). But I do have one question for Ms. James-who was Caleb Arvell?  In "Secrets" Ms. Mattie was on target.  In "Beyond" it was Debra. She was a BAD woman.  She made sure that all sinners paid their dues.  GREAT JOB!
