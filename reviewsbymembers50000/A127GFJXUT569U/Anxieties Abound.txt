 Four couples, eight people, venture into a world some only fantasize about.  Nikki Reynolds always had sexual fantasies that she had yet to act upon.  Her latest involved her friends and their husbands and significant others.  How this all plays out are the elements of The Key Party.  Nikki gathered her friends for an evening of eating and relaxing and laid down the rules of The Key Party.  Each individual had one week to mull over this sexual escapade and report back, yes or no, his or her participation in The Key Party. With the party in full swing and anxiety at its highest level, each male participant had to select a key from a group of keys belonging to each female participant.  What would happen after arriving at the home of the female participant is anyone's guess.  The Key Party exposed hidden secrets and desires along with inhibitions of each participant.  Would the relationships established prior to The Key Party be maintained?   Perryman and Hankerson did a very good job of exposing family backgrounds of some of the characters, thus providing the reader with an understanding as to their current behavior.  Each participant learned something of their selected mate that they did not know.  Some sections and behaviors were surprising, wild and over the top.  When the party was over were there still unanswered questions?  Did Nikki have a sense of fulfillment because her friends accepted her fantasy? Looking for a read that will take you away, this is a good book for the escapist in you. Reviewed by Dawn R. Reeves, APOOO BookClub
