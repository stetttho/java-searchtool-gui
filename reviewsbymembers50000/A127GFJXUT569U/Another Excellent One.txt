 Mya and Maxi forged their friendship in grade school.  Along the way came Christopher and Mya's love, Garrett.  Mya is a finance executive married to the professional athlete Garrett.  Maxi is the college professor who was Christopher's only friend during their school years. Because of a secret that Mya chose to keep right after high school graduation, her relationship with Maxi is strained. Feeling like the town pariah, Christopher leaves Savannah vowing never to return.  Ten years later, these four adults meet up at their class reunion cruise carrying their issues on board. Perfect Timing gives you everything that a novel should offer:  excellent and surprising storyline, believable and somewhat humorous characters, friendships gone astray, infidelity, misunderstandings.........followed by thoughts of forgiveness coupled with the inability to forgive, redemption, trust and love. Brenda Jackson is one my favorite romance authors and this is another excellent credit to her ever growing portrayal of the human psyche.   Reviewed by Dawn R. Reeves APOOO Bookclub
