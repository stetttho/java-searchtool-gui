 Eric Pete's newest edition to the contemporary fiction scene, Gets No Love, is a classic example of reaping what you sow.  In my opinion, his best work to date, this book packs substance in the form of redemption.  Lance, a former bad boy turned current computer technician, who was stood up at the altar by the love of his life, goes about his daily life trying his best to stay out of the game but methodically gets sucked back in, all in the name of friendship.  Lance's plan to win Val back is thwarted by several obstacles but is intriguing to read.  Akhet is an up and coming rap star and best friend to Lance.  He has a secret, or so he thought, that prevents him from being all that he could be.  As I was reading I often thought, "can these brothers get a break".  While appealing to the hip-hop generation, this latest installment by Pete can appeal to others because each character has a role to play and Pete demonstrates the ability to keep each role separate yet unique with their raw and gritty street vernacular to the proper grammar structure.  His descriptions of New Orleans are vivid and the characters style of dress is on point with their personality.  From the blue-collar worker to the street thugs to the record mogul to Mom and Dad to the sweet and invincible girl Lance wants to marry, Pete exhibits a flair for storytelling.  Reviewed by Dawn R.
