 Sugar will go down as one of my all-time favorite reads!  Bernice McFadden is excellent.  As she tells this story this reader felt like she was there seeing, tasting and smelling everything that was written.  McFadden has a way with words.  To read this you would never know that this was a first novel. It is both a sad and joyful story.  I can definetly see a sequel to this.  Closure is needed for the reader but also for Joe, Pearl, Seth, Shirley and yes, Sugar. Sugar lived her life the only way she knew how and she was truly a product of her environment. I was disappointed that Sugar left Bigelow because I could see her transforming herself into a loving, giving and caring person.   EXCELLENT piece.
