  I've read all of Mr. Harris' novels and I anxiously await his next release.  I never thought that I would enjoy reading about the gay underworld and how it relates to the heterosexual community.  Mr. Harris' novels have helped me to keep an open mind when dealing with and accepting differences.  I also enjoy how the character Basil slowly but surely creeps into Mr. Harris' novels.  With this book I was able to finally realize what issues Basil was dealing with.  I hope the character, Basil and his healing is explored in furture novels.  A great, great book.
