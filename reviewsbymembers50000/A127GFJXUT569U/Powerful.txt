 This debut novel from Jenoyne Adams is very powerful.  It exposed the emotions of bi-racial children as children and as adults.  My understanding of children of a bi-racial union was increased through the reading of this novel.  I never realized how truly hard it must be at times to be a product of that type of environment. Add divorce to the mix and you have a pot full of mixed emotions.   Each child was a best friend with one parent and disrespected the other for reasons all their own and understandably so. Mingus was gem in that she cared more for others and their feelings than her own; even her "evil, jealous and pitful" sister, Eva.  Each character had a voice and a reasoning behind their madness.   Ms. Adams words are written very eloquently and they flow through the pages to help you understand and picture the characters' fears and hurts.  This novel was very, very good.  I finished hoping that Mingus found true happiness with herself.  I felt sorry for Mingus because she truly had everyones best interest at heart with the exception of her own.  This novel demonstrated rediscovery of self.  POWERFUL!
