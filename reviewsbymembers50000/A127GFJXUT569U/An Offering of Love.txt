Jackson Sloan provides the reader with just enough family history that you come to understand the characters and their behavior. Who doesn't have family members like these people?  I know I could identify.  Every character possibly has a story to tell.  A nice touch is added when Jackson Sloan describes the homes of the inhabitants and the interior decorating schemes.  Shucks, you could learn a lot about decorating just from reading this book.  Also her use of the terminology Saturday's Child throughout the novel is symbolic in nature resulting in an ending that is very realistic.  This is a fast read that quickly draws you in at the beginning.  In addition to being a fast read it is also thought provoking, rich in dialogue and highly recommended.
