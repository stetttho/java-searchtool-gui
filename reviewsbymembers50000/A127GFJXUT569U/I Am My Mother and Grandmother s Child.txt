 Aisha Branch McCovney is the offshoot, snooty, designer wearing daughter of Camille and the granddaughter of Geneva. Unlike her mother, the afro-centric social worker and her deeply racist grandmother, Aisha has forged a lifestyle her behind cannot cash.  In Benilde Little's latest installment, Who Does She Think She Is, we meet these three generations of women and learn about their take on life and the opposite sex.  Aisha is involved in an interracial relationship and is in the midst of planning her wedding to Will.  Will is from old money, both on his maternal and paternal sides.  Their relationship seems on the up and up until Aisha meets Miles, a friend and business associate of Will's father, and all bets are off.  As Aisha grapples with her insecurities about life, love and not knowing her biological father, everyone else has an opinion.  What is different is no one verbalizes his or her thoughts with the exception of Aisha's girlfriend.  Set in New York City and Newark, New Jersey, in alternating chapters we listen to the history and current situation of each woman.  Camille was an unmarried teenage mother much to her mother's dismay but somehow redeemed herself by marrying a successful lawyer.  Geneva tells the story of attending Hampton Institute and primed to marry the right man, that is until she meets, falls in love and marries a jazz musician.  The secondary characters are ripe with their own stories and they each connect to Aisha, Camille and Geneva.  Some scenes may appear difficult to comprehend or unrealistic, but redeem themselves as the story picks up the pace for a satisfying conclusion. The story opens with thoughts of Miss Mabel, Geneva's housekeeper, and what her take may be on Aisha's impeding marriage.   As the book closes, we once again get a taste of Ms. Mabel; delicate words but so true to form for all of the women of the Branch family.   Reviewed by Dawn R. Reeves APOOO BookClub
