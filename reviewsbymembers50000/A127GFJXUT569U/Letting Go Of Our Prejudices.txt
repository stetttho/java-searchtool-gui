 After a night of partying and ruining her parent's house, Shayla's father, Dr. Eric Crawford, arranges for her to take a position in rural Mississippi to help a struggling and aging medical center.  Shayla feels that her father wants to punish her, but Eric wants his daughter to grow up and take responsibility for her actions. When Shayla arrives in Alberta, Mississippi she is greeted by Dr. Jake Parker and his staff of the medical center that she has been relegated to.  To her dismay, Alberta is rural and full of poor people. To Jake's dismay, Shayla is a rich snob who will not last in Alberta. Doctor, Doctor is a typical romance where boy meets girl and you wonder whether or not they can weather the storm.  But this one is hilarious as we watch Shayla navigate the rural community of Alberta with the determination of a tyrant.  Jake is equally enchanting as we watch him resist all offers of assistance to save his medical facility.  Included in this delightful tale are political shenanigans that Jake cannot control.  Equally appealing are Shayla's extended family members who too have the same determination as Shayla. Doctor, Doctor is a nice and easy follow up to Silken Love as we watch Shayla attempt to grow up.. .....Reviewed by Dawn R. Reeves, APOOO BookClub.
