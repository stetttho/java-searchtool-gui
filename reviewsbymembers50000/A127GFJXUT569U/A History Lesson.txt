 Though not a reader of historical accounts, Cane River was a wonderful read.  I was amazed at how the behavior of light versus dark was pass downed through the three generations of women, Suzette, Philomene and Emily.  What is more amazing is that this stereotype is perpetuated today.  Each woman learned many lessons of their behavior but insisted on their children repeating these behaviors at the expense of their mentality.  All three generation of women were calculating in their choices and needs and in their own way, were good mothers.  One theme that was evident was family.  The copies of documents and pictures of Tademys ancestors were very helpful in visualizing those times.   This was a learning tool in that it taught this reader about the French Creole life and was a history lesson.  An easy read that captivated the reader from the first page to the last.  I will definitely read more on this group of people.
