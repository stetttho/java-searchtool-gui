 Like The First Time by Francis Ray is the story of three unlikely friends, Claire Bennett, Brooke Dunlap and Lorraine Averhart.  When Middleton Corporation of Charleston, South Carolina is restructured, Claire and Brooke are among the many that must move on.  Faced with mounting bills and few job prospects, the two have no idea where to turn.  When Claire prepares gift baskets full of homemade bath and beauty products for her book club members, Lorraine sees a life long dream in the making, a way out for Claire and vehicle for Brooke to showcase her talent for marketing; a marketing plan that could be used as a blue print. But hold on, all is not as easy as one, two, three; with each woman there is a man that confronts their plan and fuels their emotions as Bliss is born.  In addition to getting Bliss off the ground, these three women must deal with the men in their lives and their baggage.  Claire seeks the business advise of Gray Livingston of Livingston Catalogue while harboring a childhood longing for the man.  Gray, unlucky in love, vows never to give his heart and soul to another woman. Brooke seeks the shoulder of her lover Randolph Peterson III, only to find he is not there physically or emotionally and Lorraine's husband Hamilton, a guru in restructuring companies, is angry about their business endeavor because of insecurities that began in his childhood.  Add to the facts, Gray's ex-wife, Brooke's nemesis John, the longing of a man in Lorraine's life and the savvy grass roots business sense of these women, Like the First Time becomes a blissful experience to read. Coupled with the strong themes of family, love and conviction and set in the picturesque town of Charleston, Francis Ray has given us characters we dislike, [the men in the story are a strange species] characters we like, admire, cheer for and find humorous and ties that bind like the first time!
