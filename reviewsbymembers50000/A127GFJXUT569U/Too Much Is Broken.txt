 Broken Beyond Repair begins where Written In Red Ink leaves off.  With Written In Red Ink we are introduced to the Bennett family and all whom encompass them.  With Broken Beyond Repair we witness an accidental encounter gone awry, lack of communication and plenty of drama. Lisa Bennett and Shawn Favor are married and both have promising careers, but Lisa has not been able to carry a child to term creating anxiety coupled with desire.  Throw in a sister's deceit, another sister's dream, an Uncle's marital drama, a cousin's parentage, another cousin's deafness and a host of other storylines and you have relationships, which are dysfunctional at best.  The main premise points to an excellent storyline, however this novel has too many stories, which are unable to be fully developed among the pages allowed. Characters are reintroduced from Written In Red Ink but their introduction does not flow and leaves the reader confused.  You are forced to go back to prior pages to see if you missed something only to discover that you did not.  It is not until you are three-quarters of the way completed that you realize who and what these characters are and how they fit into the current storyline. It appears that this is a set up for more stories to come, however the numerous stories took away from the focus of Lisa and Sean and appeared to be out of place because of the lack of development.
