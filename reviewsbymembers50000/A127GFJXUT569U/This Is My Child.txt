 A Twist of Fate can best be described as a chain of mistakes that lead to boy meets girl and they fall in love.  However, it is not as simple as that and it is not without many obstacles in the way.  Obstacles such as he is Caucasian and she is African-American; he is rich, she is middle-income; he is divorced, she is a widow; his mother disapproves and her brother disapproves and finally, they both can lay claim to the same child. Set in the outskirts of picturesque New Orleans, A Twist of Fate showcases Camille King as a music teacher and former circuit pianist and Nicholas Cardoneaux as CEO of Cardoneaux Construction and resident of Magnolia Grove.  A Twist of Fate highlights emotional baggage from the main characters' former marriages and baggage of the secondary characters, which adds realism to some of the social stigmas at play today.  Although, some of the social issues are a bit overdone, secondary characters provide a positive outlook for the main characters that are refreshing and add twists to the storyline. Ms. Clark has penned an emotionally charged story with sensuous lovemaking scenes, vibrant imagery and characters you can feel, see, touch and root for.  A Twist of Fate is a quick read, which begs you to ask, how could a mistake like this happen? Reviewed by Dawn R. Reeves APOOO BookClub
