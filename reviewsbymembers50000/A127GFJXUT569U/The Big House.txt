Set in the early 1960's, Friday Night At Honeybee's is a musical anthology of that time. This story revolves around two characters that arrive at Honeybee's brownstone after literally running away from home.  Told in alternating chapters, Forestine Bent and Viola Bembrey are running from the consequences of their actions in their homes.  As a child Forestine always relished the music around her.  She practiced with the best and dreamed about a life of singing and traveling.  Her Achilles heel is her narrow-mindedness. Viola has an angelic voice but was relegated to life as a deacon's wife.  One incident had her branded and forced from her southern hometown.  Viola, provided with the name and address of Honeybee McColor, arrives in Harlem under duress and fear. Together, these two woman deal with their demons and their guilt to form a friendship rich in loyalty. With the assistance of Honeybee, Willa and Vernon, the other inhabitants at Honeybee's brownstone, Forestine and Viola definitely come into their own as woman of that time.   This is an interesting novel told in a fluid, symphonic and dramatic tone.  Ms Smith provides the reader with Forestine and Viola's family history, which guides the reader in understanding their plights.  The reader is also provided with a wealth of musical knowledge as it pertains to the history of blues and finally jazz.  This is an excellent portrayal of 1960 Harlem, its music and the musical accomplishments of that time. Reviewed by Dawn R. Reeves, APOOO BookClub
