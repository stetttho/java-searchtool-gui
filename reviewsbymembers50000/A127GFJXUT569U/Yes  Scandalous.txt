 This is the first book that I have read by Donna Hill and after reading it I will definitely read more by her.  This story was one of intrigue and while some areas were predictable others were not and were down right Scandalous.   Vaughn and Justin's love affair was one of true love with trust and distrust knocking at the same time.  I could feel Vaughn's pain, anguish and confusion, but I could also feel her need for love from Justin.  Justin was her knight in shining armor and he truly loved Vaughn.  He helped release her pain of the past and taught her how to love again.  Reading about Elliot, Vaughn's father, helped this reader understand Vaughn.  Vaughn lived her father's dream at the expense of her own.  Poppa Elliot was as ruthless as they come and I was totally surprised by his actions. Her mother Sheila, was a typical politician's wife who assisted in keeping secrets at the expense of her daughter's love and devotion. Donna Hill writes very descriptively and you can see and feel the emotions with every turn of the page.  The storyline was great with enough drama to keep your interest until the end.  Now I'm ready to begin A Scandalous Affair.  I loved this book and it will go down as one of my favorite reads.
