 Michael Eric Dyson tells us why he loves black women by featuring several prominent and not so prominent African-American females in Why I Love Black Women.  He begins with tributes to an elementary teacher, his mother and aunts.  He continues with tributes to women he comes into contact with as his educational and religious careers expand. His descriptions of their physical attributes and intellectual brilliance are intense, vivid and classic Michael Dyson.  It may be too descriptive for some but it is vintage Michael Dyson.  His spoken word definitely shines through his written word. With each women highlighted, Mr. Dyson showcases their brilliance with reflections and quotes of his meetings.  Many social issues are explored and while we all may not agree with the politics, Mr. Dyson has portrayed women who can back up their claims and go toe-to-toe with the best of the male species. As an African-American female, this is a feel good testament to African-American women by a prominent African-American male; a read that is thought provoking; one that would illicit excellent discussions among book clubs because of the social commentary and one that I recommend to both women and men alike.
