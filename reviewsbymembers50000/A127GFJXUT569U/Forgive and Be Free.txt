 The story of the James family takes us into their world of despair, domestic violence, anger and hatred.  As the book opens you are exposed to a tragic act of violence that will haunt the children into adulthood. Aja, the oldest takes on the responsibility of being her brother and sister's keeper at the expense of her own needs.  Aja was so concerned about Eric's need for help that she didn't realize that she too had a need for help.  The one theme that struck this reader was Aja placing blame on her brother's behavior on the father.  While that may have been the case to a certain degree, Eric needed to let it go to heal. Little sister Jada is the one that helped all to realize that to forgive is to be free. And Roxanne, aka Roxie, was funny as all get out and provided some much needed humor and insight for Aja. The one lesson learned and overall message was to forgive and overcome hatred or it can destroy you and your relationships. You will learn something about forgiveness with this one.
