 Someone's In the Kitchen explores the effects of our childhood on our adulthood relationships.  Highlighting the friendship and relationships of Reggie and Neil, Someone's In the Kitchen is a page turning book filled with the daily escapades of the main characters. Reggie is a player who refuses to commit to one woman until someone comes along and flips the script on him.  Will he commit?  Neil's desire is to be committed to his marriage but his wife refuses to cooperate.  Will he stay in his marriage?  Reggie's player ways often land him in trouble with the women in his life and his job.  Unfortunately, Neil's dream of entrepreneurship is something that is not shared by his wife.   Told in alternating chapters of Reggie and Neil, we travel through their daily routines that not only deal with their relationships with the opposite sex, but we also get a peek at Reggie and Neil's relationship with each other.  While different as night and day, you have to wonder how these two remain friends, or do they?  Told in voices that are entertaining, coupled with a somewhat surprising climax, Someone's In the Kitchen is a recommended read for the drama-filled enthusiast.  Reviewed by Dawn R.
