 This book answered it for me.  Men go through the trials and tribulations within relationships just as women do.  The one possible difference-we tell all!  This book was realistic-four brothers owning their own businesses, who all happen to be friends.  I guess you surround yourself with "like" people.  What so strange about that?   As for streotyping the "sistas", please, we women do it all the time.  If the shoe doesn't fit, don't wear it.  I thought the charactersation was "real", the storyline "real" and the ending good.  I knew that Angela would take him back, WRONG!  GOOD JOB and very ENTERTAINING!
