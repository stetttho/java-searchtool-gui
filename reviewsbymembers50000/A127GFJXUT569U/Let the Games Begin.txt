 When Coco Nimburu begins a killing spree in and around the Washington D.C. metro area and beyond, FBI agent Phoenix Perry is on the case.  Assigned by the President of the United States, Phoenix's career is on the line and her loved ones are in danger.  However, Coco is always one or two steps ahead of Phoenix.  Pretenses by Keith Lee Johnson is the prequel to Sugar & Spice which for me left some unanswered questions; with Pretenses those questions are answered.  A Supreme Court nominee and her husband are murdered while a serial rapist of men is on the loose.  Coco is a hired assassin, skilled in martial arts, who is as aloof as she is deadly.  Phoenix is her nemesis, which only provokes Coco to lure her to a duel.  Coco is a character you will despise but at the same time empathize with; her moral code is skewed at best.  Coco's employer will surprise you and the reasoning behind the killings will shock you even more.    The dialogue between the characters is engaging; the attention to detail and imagery is vivid.  Johnson has penned a suspenseful, inviting and unpredictable novel with all of the elements of surprise.    Reviewed by Dawn R. Reeves APOOO BookClub
