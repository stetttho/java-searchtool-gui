 When I picked this book up I thought it was another romance book which I have begun to read again. While reading I realized that this book was more than that.  Skin Deep has romance, intrigue and drama.  The storyline is not predicatable and the questions that I had throughout were not easily answered until the end.  Kathleen Cross has done a wonderful job with this book.  How can she top this? Nina, the story's center, was outwardly comfortable with her bi-racial make-up but inwardly she was confused and had every right to be.  Too many secrets were being kept from her.  I enjoyed the romance between Nina and Ahmad and was glad to see it play itself out.  Ahmad was a stand up type of guy and a blessing for his daughter Ebony.  Ahmad was betrayed throughout his life but came out on top.  Nina's best friend Tonya was a true friend indeed and was the most humorous of them all. All the characters portrayed are believable which makes this book very captivating. There are so many twists and turns in this book that it's hard to categorize and hard to put down (one day to read).  My favorite sections are Rasheed and his poetry (deep) and Ahmad's determination to have Nina as his wife. He never gave up! Excellent job!
