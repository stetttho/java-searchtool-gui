 Is the red dress a symbol of freedom, chances taken, or womanhood?  You'll have to read to find out.  In Pearl Cleage's latest installment and what I assumed was a follow up to What Look Likes Crazy On An Ordinary Day, the focus is on Joyce Mitchell, Ava's older sister.  This is not a sequel to Crazy; this is Joyce's story. The setting takes place in Idlewind, Michigan, once a resort town for the black elite, now a dilapidated small town with all the ills of the inner city.  Joyce Mitchell is a woman who has experienced much loss through death.  She is social worker who directs a community program for teenage mothers.  She attempts to teach the members to be "free women".  Again, you'll have to read it to understand.  She also is a surrogate mother to the members.  At the same time Nate Anderson (vice principal of the local high school) comes into her life and breaks down her barriers of having a relationship.  This is not an easy task because Joyce flip-flops between not needing his help and needing his help.  She becomes angry when she feels that men are not stepping up to the plate, but the men in her circle feel that she doesn't want them or any man involved with her "free woman" message.   The story is written in many short chapters that will keep you  turning the pages.  There is some tragedy that is overcome and  learning that takes place among all the participants.  A quick and descriptive read with characters that are full of themselves.
