 This is a story of young love at its best and worst.  Cinnamon Browne and Michael (Chunky) Taylor were childhood friends and schoolmates.  As the story progresses we are treated to Cinnamon and Chunky's love story as teenagers; their shenanigans of trying to be together sexually unbeknownst to their parents.  The story takes the reader on a journey through their college years and their young adult years.  We are also treated to the meddling of their family and friends into their relationship.  My favorite sections are Cinnamon's attempts at life without Chunky; we go on dates and go through relationships with Cinnamon.  Lauren Spicer is animated when describing this portion of Cinnamon's story. This is a true coming of age story and in my opinion geared towards the late teen and young adult age group.  Lauren Spicer has written a very good book with a realistic storyline, fast paced plot and a climatic ending............Reviewed by Dawn R. Reeves, APOOO BookClub
