 A weeping willow tree sways back and forth just like the days of our lives.  It can provide a sense of peace and a resting place as it did for Mozelle.  As a child, Mozelle was often relegated to helping out with the many children in her household; whether they were her siblings or the children her mother took in.  A tomboy at heart, Mozelle's desires were to leave her Southern town at age eighteen, find work, buy some of the finer things in life and never marry nor raise children.  She wanted to be a free woman.  At age fifteen, Randall Tate walks into town, chooses Mozelle as his wife and because it would be one less mouth to feed, her parents reluctantly consent against Mozelle's wishes. What follows is a hardship of a marriage and life in general.  Mozelle had borne several children, worked in the cotton fields, cleaned houses and cooked in restaurants throughout several Southern towns. Randall was not the man she assumed him to be.  He was a womanizer, refused to give Mozelle money for food and denied his children the presence of a father. This is not the life Mozelle envisioned but because of her resolve, she did what many strong, God-fearing woman would do-she accepted her fate and vowed to make it on her own.   Gloria's Mallette's Weeping Willows Dance is a testament of a woman's strength when faced with hard times during a sad period in American history.  Written with a strong Southern dialect and literary flair, Weeping Willows Dance could provide a blueprint for many to follow.  Excellent! Reviewed by Dawn R. Reeves APOOO BookClub
