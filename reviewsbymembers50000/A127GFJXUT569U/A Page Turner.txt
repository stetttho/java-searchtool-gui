 Casting was a page turner for this reader.  Kimberla is fast becoming one of my favorite writers.  Her writing style is easy to read and message was so clear, we do tend to worship the messenger and money and power is the root of all evil.   The characters were portrayed very realistically.  This was quick read because I needed to know what Curtis's problems were. Closure was needed and it was there!
