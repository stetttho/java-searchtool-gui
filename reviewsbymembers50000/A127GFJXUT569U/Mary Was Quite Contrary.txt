 The novella, All About Mary, gives you just that, everything about Mary. Mary Jane Jenkins is a woman that lived hard for what she needed to survive.  A single mother of two young children, Mary used men just as they used her.  When the novella opens, we are introduced to the gruesome death of Mary and the arrest of her fiance'Perry Rogers.  Perry is the prime suspect and to the police department, it's an open and shut case.  However, private investigator Mick Hart does not see it that way and goes about tracking down Mary's killer at the request of Perry's mother.  Hart comes across a list of suspects each of whom had a personal interest in Mary.  Their interest ranged from lust, to like, to love.   Lawrence Christopher gives us a tale that is short but very complete.  We understand Mary and her plight because we are privy to her childhood and her adulthood pre-Perry.  I thoroughly enjoyed the comparison of butter to Mary's body; the chapter titles of some nursery school rhymes and song titles with references to "Mary". This is very good murder-mystery that will make you shake your head just as you would have shaken some sense into Mary.
