 For Ina, the matter is a life of unfulfillment, discontent and frustration.  As she contemplates her life, her husband announces that he is leaving her and their three children.  Never following her dreams because of doubts from others and her need for a safety net, Ina is forced to be all that she can be for the sake of herself and her children.  Jay is a man from humble beginnings who wanted it all, worked to achieve his dream, and it still was not enough to prevent failure.  Forced to look within his bourgeoisie psyche, lessons are abundant as Jay comes to terms with the world that he never quite fit into.   Told through the voice of Ina, she dwells on her childhood, her college years, her courtship with Jay and a lost love.  A host of secondary characters add to the mixture forcing the reader to understand whom Ina and Jay are and what they really are trying to escape, hence the good character development. Thought provoking, intricate and somewhat complicated at times, Benilde Little forces the reader into Ina and Jay's world as we navigate the past, present and future with them. Acting Out explores how our past can dictate our future, our hopes and our dreams and reverts back to that age-old quote, "be careful what you wish for."  Reviewed by Dawn R.
