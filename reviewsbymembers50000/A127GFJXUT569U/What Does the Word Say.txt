 LaShondra is looking for her Boaz just as many women are waiting on their Boaz.  In Boaz Brown by Michelle Stimpson, LaShondra is a thirty-something Assistant Principal who endures all of the contemporary issues of being a single and saved woman, juggling a career and trying to keep harmony within her family.  The oldest of two, she was raised to be prejudiced by default, but when her Boaz appears in another color all bets are off and an internal struggle begins causing havoc with her friendships, her family and people in general.  After living what some may consider a promiscuous lifestyle, LaShondra commits herself to the Lord and lives her life accordingly.  Deeply rooted in the Word, LaShondra approaches her career and her relationships according to the text.  Alternating between past and present passages we come to understand LaShondra's childhood in Black and White.  After a secret is revealed about her father we further understand his behavior, his racist attitude and why it was passed on to his children.  Boaz Brown exhibits an example to women and men alike, utilizing scriptures and prayers, which are interpreted for the issues at hand.  However, the Christian theme is not forced but subtly instituted to make for a great novel offering lessons on life, romance and understanding of human behavior and commitment.  Kudos to Michelle Stimpson for a spirit-filled lesson.  Reviewed by Dawn R. Reeves APOOO BookClub
