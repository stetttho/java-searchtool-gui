 The Styles family consists of four grown children who are as different as night and day.  Genesis is a self-proclaimed player who can't help himself; Phyllis appears to hate the black man so she marries outside of her race; Grover, Jr., is a single father who is drug and alcohol addicted and Grace is the baby of the family who struggles with forgiveness while trying to bring her family back together and find peace within.  As you continue to read you will understand the root of their behavior. From The Hearts of Men we are reintroduced to Prodigy and Nina, which is a treat.  The story centers on Genesis and his impending marriage to Terri.  Terri is everything that Genesis wants and needs in a woman but for some reason he can't stay faithful.  Each sibling has his or her share of drama in addition to Genesis, which gives the story its completeness and leaves you with a better understanding of the crosses they have to bare to get to a semi-happy medium.   Travis Hunter does an excellent job of portraying and developing his characters in a very realistic manner. I found myself caring about these characters and hoping for a resolution to their issues.    Married But Still Looking is quick, emotional and heartfelt read with a surprising ending, a very surprising ending!  I to enjoyed The Hearts of Men and I can't decide which book is better.  I've decided that it doesn't matter.......Reviewed by Dawn R. Reeves, APOOO Bookclub
