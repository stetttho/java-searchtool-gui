 This is first book that I read by Margaret Johnson-Hodge and I enjoyed it.  This book is very emotional and will have you questioning what you would do in Sandy's situation.  I had three crying episodes!  I found it ironic that Sandy did the exact opposite of what Adrian did to his ex-wife (leaving).  This book could have been four novels with each of the female characters telling her story.  The book was a page turner, somewhat predictable behavior but a good read.  I enjoyed the many characters with all their "issues" and their ways of resolving  them.
