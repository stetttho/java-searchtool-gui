 What is the price of passion?  According to Oufoula, discretion is the better part of valor.  Oufoula is an African man representing his country as an diplomat.  Oufoula is married to Nerida, the daughter of the President of his homeland.  Through his extensive travels, Oufoula meets and greets like-minded people; people interested in securing necessities for their homelands.  One evening the name Marguerite is mentioned and Oufoula is mesmerized.  He has dreamt about a woman named Margarete; the woman that Goethe's Faust sold his soul to the devil for.  When dreaming of Margarete, Oufoula is actually despising a past love by the name of Mulenga.  Oufoula is bound and determined not to let the love of someone destroy him as it did his mother.   To replace passion, he has his work for his country to contend with.  After meeting "the" Marguerite, Oufoula's life changes and love enters.  Can a man actually love two women for two totally different reasons at the same time? Elizabeth Nunez has weaved an intricate tale of passion coupled with forbidden love at the expense of it all.  While the prose may appear typical, Discretion offers a look into the mind and history of man who has lost and gained much throughout his life.  Nunez takes the reader on a journey through Africa and New York City, setting in place the necessary landscape to embrace this story.  Many references are made of other literary works, which offer an insight into the minds of Oufoula and Marguerite.  Her characterizations are developed, symbolic and heartfelt!
