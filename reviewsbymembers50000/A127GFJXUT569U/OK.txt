 The characters were interesting but the plot was boring.  I enjoyed their friendships and their bonds.  However, too much time was spent on the past. While explaining each character's past was informative, too much time was  spent revisiting and I found myself bored.  I also thought that Roz and  Tam's conflict should have been explored more. I was disappointed that the  author did not explore how Roz dealt with Hiriam and his infidelity. What,  their life went on without any discussion about his affair with one of her  best friends.  I doubt it. I would not recommend this book.
