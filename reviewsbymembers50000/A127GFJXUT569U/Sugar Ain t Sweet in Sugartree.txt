 The List, by Patti Flinn, is one of the most profound and suspenseful books I have read. The List is a very poignant story filled with incest, evil, hate and color issues. Set in the small, southern town of Sugartree, the natives and other inhabitants must deal with the rich and powerful Beauville family. The Beauville family had curses placed upon them four-generations ago but the current generation, while not outwardly believing in the curses, secretly harbors their fears of them. The List is the story of four young men that must marry young women placed on "the list" by the twenty-first birthday of the youngest son, Leonard. Throughout the story, you are wondering why would Pierre Beauville, their father, place such a stipulation in his will. It is not until the end that you realize the list's significance and that revelation will have your mouth gaped. Francois, Rene', Gerard and Leonard Beauville are four young men with deep-rooted issues from the past. You come to learn through a historical picture their lives as children and the lives of their ancestors. When the dust clears, after all hell breaks loose, you will be amazed at the result. The four young women they choose to marry have stories of their own and thus they are highlighted as main characters also and you have to love Grandma Dudyen! I had to make a family tree of this clan to follow the story but in the end it provided for a very absorbing read. Told with clarity, The List is an engaging novel with a crazed proposition. Excellent and highly recommended!
