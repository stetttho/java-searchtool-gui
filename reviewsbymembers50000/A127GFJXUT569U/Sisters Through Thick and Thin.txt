 First it was Soul Food the movie, then Soul Food the television series and now Soul Food: For Better, For Worse, the book.  Written by Leslie E. Banks, the Soul Food book series has all the makings of a hit with two additional installments to be released.   Soul Food: For Better, For Worse is the continuing story of Bird, the baby of the family, and Lem and their trials and tribulations.  As Lem secretly tries to improve his life, Bird continues to distrust him.  Taking her issues to her sisters Teri and Maxine, the Joseph sisters continue to exhibit the behavior for which they are known.  Teri, the family leader, is high-strung, opinionated, and distrustful of Lem.  Maxine is the classic middle child, poet, and listener.  Kenny, Maxine's husband, continues to be the foundation of the family, Lem's brother-in-law and best friend. The entire family is alive and well, exhibiting classic behaviors that we can all attest to. An excellent storyline is presented as we learn of Lem's desires, through his musings, to be successful.  Bird and the family's suspicions of him further complicate matters as the story climaxes to an exciting conclusion. Bird has an eye opener by way of her distrust that ultimately she must come to terms with. There is a lesson to be learned for all of the family members. In traditional Leslie E. Banks style, you are given characters that come alive from the pages on which they are written.   If you loved the movie and the television series, you will love the written word of Soul Food:  For Better, For Worse.  Another kudos to Leslie! Reviewed by Dawn R. Reeves, Apooo BookClub
