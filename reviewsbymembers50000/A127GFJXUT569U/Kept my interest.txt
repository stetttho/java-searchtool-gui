 "Nappily" was entertaining!.  However, the characters of Venus and Khandi worked my nerves.  Both were shallow and had agendas. A lot of time was spent on Venus and her "finding herself" which is what we need to do from time to time, but so much time was devoted to this.  We were privy to the main characters' thoughts which was an insight into each of them.   The book's opening left you "hanging".  I surprised by the ending.  I give the writing a four (which is what reviews are about?).  I was not bored!
