 I truly loved this book and McKinney-Whetstone's very lyrical words and developed characters.  This story of love, betrayal and reuniting with a lost love kept me enthralled.  Some of the plot endings were predictable (Sage) and some were not (Rowe).  Verdi was very dependent on men (Johnson, Rowe and Leroy), Rowe was pompous (the nerve of him) and Kit was an "around the way girl", LOL.  The twins were interesting, however the relationship between and Posie and Leroy was left unresolved and the hint as to whether Verdi and Kitt were actually sisters was not complete. Hm, could another novel be in the works to resolve these issues?  I say go for it!  The writer took us back twenty years and beyond for the reader to understand the characters' behaviors.  This will be on my list as an all time favorite! Go Diane!
