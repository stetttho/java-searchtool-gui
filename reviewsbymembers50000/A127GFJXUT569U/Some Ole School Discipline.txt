 Whippins, Switches and Peach Cobbler is a great coming of age story about Benny Dempkins. We watch Benny as a small child and his transformation into adulthood.  Along the way we are privy to Benny's shenanigans and his whippins.  We are also privy to the same discipline technique used on one of his neighbors and lack of discipline with one of his classmates.  What affect do these techniques have on Benny, his partner Ryan and his classmate Will?  What are their lives like as young men and adults?  How will they treat their own children? We also get a large dose of his parents relationship and what affect Benny has on them.  Is this a boy that kept his parents marriage together?  We watch as Sheila, Benny's mother and Ronald, Benny's father, dole out strict discipline techniques but also offer their love and support of their son.   The family reunion theme appears to be prevalent throughout 2001 and one that is needed in these trying times.  What is demonstrated in Whippins, Switches and Peach Cobbler  is the family unit and how the extended family plays a big part in who we are and what we become. Spare the rod and spoil the child is a recurring theme throughout this novel and it definitely brings back memories, I am sure, of many of our childhoods.  This is very good novel offering many lessons.  The Peach Cobbler is to die for!
