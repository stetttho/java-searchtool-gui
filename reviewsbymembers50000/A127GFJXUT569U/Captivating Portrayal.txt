 Harlem Redux by Persia Walker could be described as a history lesson with a murder mystery thrown in for good measure or vice versa.  Walker's portrayal of the affluent McKay family and other families on Harlem's Striver's Row during the 1920 era, is rich in detail as the mystery is superbly laid before our eyes. David McKay, an attorney living in Philadelphia, returns to Harlem after a four-year hiatus to question his sister's suicide.  What he finds is, "all is not as it seems" and he sets out to find the truth about his sister's death.  As David investigates, several characters stand in his way of the truth.  David thoughts constantly revert back to "all is not as it seems" as he stubbornly rushes into seedy joints and ruthless people who have something to hide. David too, has a secret that he would rather keep hidden because it could destroy the family name.  But as David inches closer to the truth, the threat of his secret being revealed is probable at best.  Harlem Redux is a complicated murder mystery and just when you believe you can name the culprit, Walker reveals other riveting details to further complicate matters.  When all is said and done "all was not as it seemed."   Persia Walker has written an excellent murder mystery that provides necessary and vivid descriptions of Harlem and its people, both rich and poor, during a time when people were proud of their determinations.  Harlem Redux will go down as one of my all-time favorite mysteries and one of my all-time favorite books......Reviewed by Dawn R. Reeves, APOOO BookClub
