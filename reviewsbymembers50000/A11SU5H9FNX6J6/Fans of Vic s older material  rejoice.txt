 Artists evolve, and Vic's last 2 albums--_Salesman and Bernadette_, and _Merriment_--signaled an evolution of Vic's style, relying on fuller accompaniment and a less folksy sound.  But with _Left to His Own Devices_, Vic returns to familiar territory for his longtime fans.  Many of the 15 tracks bring the attention back to the rich, compelling lyrics for which Vic is so well-known.  On all but two tracks of this minimally mastered home recording, Vic plays all the instruments (with Tina Chesnutt contributing lead guitar and bass on a couple of songs).  "Cash," "In Amongst the Millions," and "My Last Act" are as at home on this album as on _West of Rome_ or _Is the Actor Happy?_  This is the Vic album I've been waiting for since _About to Choke_.
