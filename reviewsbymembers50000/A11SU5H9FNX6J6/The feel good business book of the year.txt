 It's true that the authors of The Cluetrain Manifesto aren't saying anything new to those who've believed in the power of the Internet from the first time they launched a web browser or read a newsgroup.  But they've  enumerated those beliefs in a very compelling and awe-inspiring volume of  the truths of operating in the Internet Economy.  Namely that doing  business in this world means opening up your organization to the scrutiny  of your customers and every member of your organization; that markets are  conversations and those who can best facilitate communication will triumph;  that information yearns to be free.  If you're looking for a how-to book or  a silver bullet to reinvigorate your business, look elsewhere.  But if you  believe in the power of technology to connect you to your customers, or  desperately want to believe, get on board the Cluetrain.
