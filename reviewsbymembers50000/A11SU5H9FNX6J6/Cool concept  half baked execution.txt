 This is an idea whose time has come.  USB is ubiquitous, and mobile warriors have enough power bricks to carry around, such that eliminating a couple in favor of a more portable solution is worth its weight in gold. Problem is when I received this item, the plug was too small for my Nokia 3650's AC input.  I think the plug bundled with this kit is for smaller/older Nokias whose AC input is smaller.   But fear not!  Keyspan will replace this for you, and send you the right plug.  You can do this by emailing the support team at the product's website at ziplinq.com.  They replaced it for me quickly, no questions asked.   Now it works like a champ!  Too bad they didn't bundle all the right connectors in the first place though.
