 I haven't read any books on computer security before this one, so I can't say whether or not this is the authoritative title on the subject of Linux security.  I will say that I have read quite a few books on Linux in  general (Linux in a Nutshell, Running Linux, etc.) and this is the best  Linux book I have read so far.  It taught me more about Linux system  administration than any website, man page, or other book I've looked at,  despite its focus on security. Aside from the excellent pointers it gave  on properly administering your Linux workstation or server, it was a very  fun, informative read.   Mr. Anonymous is a lively technical writer, and   downright funny to boot.  On biometric access controls, he/she writes:  "I hope you're not using your computers for illegal activity.  But if  you are, you may want to avoid using biometric access controls, or at least  not keep logs.  Nothing will kill a good clean hack like incontrovertible  logs." In short, buy this if you want to get up to speed on Linux  system administration in a hurry and you're already comfortable with *nix.
