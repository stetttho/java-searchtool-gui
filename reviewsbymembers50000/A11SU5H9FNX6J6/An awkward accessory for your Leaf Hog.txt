 I was thrilled to see this accessory offered as the shoulder bag included with my BV2500 Leaf Hog was too small for the volume of autumn leaves my maple and Japanese plum trees deposit on my front lawn (not to mention the year-round shedding of bamboo leaves in my backyard). The system looks great in pictures, but what the pictures don't show is what happens to the attachment once you actually turn on the vac.  The porous fabric cover fills with air, putting a big cotton/nylon baloon over the top of your waste can.  If you don't secure the bag tightly enough (which is quite a chore given the design of the drawstring), it comes flying off.   And the drawstring.  Given how much tugging and pulling and tying (!) it takes to get the attachment secure, it'll be a miracle if it lasts more than a season. The design appears to be optimized for waste cans with square tops, so perhaps my round can is the problem.  Attaching the cover to the lip of the can does not work, so I've been wrapping the cover over the top of it such that there's no slack in the bag.  That works well enough, but I end up spilling leaf mulch all over the place when removing the cover. It's better than emptying the shoulder bag every three minutes, but not by much.
