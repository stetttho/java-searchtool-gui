 I've had this unit for 6 months now and have zero complaints. Audio quality is excellent, despite the flak that                                   MD audio compression takes from critics who mistakenly believe it takes a  $1000 DAT unit to get high fidelity                                    recordings. I've used the AM-F70 with binaural mics to record concerts and  have been extremely pleased with                                   the  results, which I would say give similar DAT recordings a real run for their  money.
