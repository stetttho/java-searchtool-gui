 Buying this hub could be the worst thing you ever do to your computer.  I run Windows XP, and it warned me that this hub is not Windows XP certified.  Fine by me, since most hardware isn't, but works just fine. Everything was going fine until I tried plugging in USB peripherals.  None of them worked, including my Logitech Quickcam, Epson C80 printer, and Handspring Visor cradle. Later that night, it was driver conflict hell.  Before long, I lost my entire Windows XP install due to repeated appearances of the Blue Screen of Death (yep, it does exist in Windows XP after all). Needless to say, I will never buy another Belkin product again, if I can help it.
