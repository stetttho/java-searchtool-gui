 I've got to echo what what everyone else is saying about this product: a simple, but effective alternative to expensive proprietary laptop docks and superfluous monitors.   Sadly, my Apple Powerbook (15.2" Aluminum) does not open wide enough, making me wonder as others have why Sherpaq didn't design the dock to allow the front height to be adjusted.  In fact, the bottom of the dock appears to have two threaded holes just waiting for adjustable legs.  Perhaps this Oyster accessory is coming soon? Despite this flaw, I am in love with this product.
