 For years I've waited for _The Big Lebowski_ to get a proper DVD edition.  When this Achiever's Edition was announced I was thrilled.  When it arrived, I was underwhelmed.  The sound and picture don't appear any better in this edition than the original DVD released 7 years ago.  Also, the disc in the Achievers Edition is identical to the Collectors Edition also released at the same time.  For $20, you get some lousy cardboard coasters, a chamois and some postcards.   A huge disappointment, and a major disservice to one of the best movies of the 1990s.
