 Since buying one of these grills last August, I use this more than I use my microwave.  This appliance makes grilling meat and vegetables a quick, hassle-free alternative to the microwave fare I had become so sadly  accustomed to.  Clean-up isn't as easy as the infomercials would lead you  to believe, but the speed with which the grill produces tasty results makes  it a must-have item for those leading a busy lifestyle.
