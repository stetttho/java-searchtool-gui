 A little-known fact: Billy Bob Thornton--star, director and writer of this amazing film--is the greatest southern voice since William Faulkner. This film is essential southern gothic retooled for the New South of mini-malls  and subdivisions. The old demons still lurk, most graphically through Doyle  (played remarkably by Dwight Yoakam). Watch for a cameo appearance from  indie/y'allternative musician Vic Chesnutt!    Besides being an incredibly  important film about the South, it's emotional rollercoaster ride: from  Carl (Thornton) and his shocking past, to the awkwardness of his first days  away from institutionalization, to the amazing paternal relationship he  forges with a neglected boy--the one person who will accept him  unconditionally.  Heart-wrenching, dark and beautiful.
