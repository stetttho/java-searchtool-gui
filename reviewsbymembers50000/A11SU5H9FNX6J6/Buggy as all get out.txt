 I bought this answering machine thinking this would be a low-cost, high-quality alternative to voice mail.   You get what you pay for with this turkey.  Be careful how you scroll through your call history, for you  might find your voice messages inaccessible as a result.  See an item in  your call history in the first scroll through, then...poof...gone without a  trace.
