 I will say that I have tried quite a few consumer-end depp fryers in my time.  This one makes hastening your death and hardening your arteries easier and cleaner than ever: the snap-shut lid, odor filter and incredibly  cool oil release valve all make this deep fryer a far cry from the $20  excuse for an appliance you'd find at most department stores.  And do  follow the instructions to the letter: the instructions say use peanut oil  for best results.  Sadly, vegetable and canola oils just do not cut it.
