 Tech Media makes an excellent, affordably-priced product that will protect your investment without making your Palm or Visor handheld screen hard to see or use. Application was simple enough, as the shields act like those static-cling stickers that allow for easy removal.  They're glossy and perfectly clear, and do not impact the contrast or resolution of your screen in any way.  The writing surface is a little stickier, but it feels more like writing on paper than the unshielded screen does, which improves my Graffiti accuracy to a certain extent. As for the size, I use these shields on a Handspring Visor Deluxe, and they're a perfect fit.  As has been reported by other reviewers, they're not quite the right size for other Handspring models such as the Edge, but the instructions do prescribe trimming the shields in such cases. This product is a must for Palm/Handspring device power users looking for the best screen protection available.
