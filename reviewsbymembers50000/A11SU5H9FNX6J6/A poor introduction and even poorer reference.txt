 I really tried to like this book.  After all, it's one of 5 titles available for those looking for a reference/tutorial on WML, WMLScript and wireless applications development in general.  I found much of the info to  be out of date.  What little there was didn't focus on practical advice on  how to develop wireless apps.  It reads more like a textbook, providing a  framework for what WAP is, rather than substantive code examples,  references to development tools, device pitfalls, etc.  I purposely avoided  the Wrox title on WAP, but it looks like I have little choice if I want a  hardcopy reference to look at.
