 The marketing on this card is a little misleading.  The card has two tuners, but only one cable TV input.  (The second 'F' connector you see is for the FM radio antenna).    If all you want to do is take one analog cable TV line to this card and record/watch two different analog channels, this card can do that out of the box.  But if you want to feed two different set-top boxes to this card, it can't do that out of the box.  There is an add-on composite/svideo connector that should let you feed two different signals to the card and make that work but you'll still have to sort out the remote control of those two cable boxes.
