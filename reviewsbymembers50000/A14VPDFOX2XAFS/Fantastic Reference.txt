 I use this book whenever I'm building any complex client-side web stuff.  It's an excellent reference for an experienced HTML/Javascript coder.  It has excellent descriptions of each HTML tag and attribute, style sheet attributes, Javascript, and the DOM methods and properties.  I have two other books about HTML and Dynamic HTML but I should sell them because I don't use them any more. Now the bad: It's getting a bit old (stops at IE4, NS4).  I would have loved a couple more cross-reference listings in the back and maybe one or two more chapters walking through common tasks like dynamic forms and form validation.  It needs a table or other list of what each event does when the handler returns true or false.
