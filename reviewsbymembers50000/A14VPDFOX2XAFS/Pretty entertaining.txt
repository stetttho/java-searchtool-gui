 Our daughter played with these a lot up until she was almost 10mo.  She especially loved it when we put the rattle pieces into the big holes on the  plain pieces (blue and green).  That made a big rattle with lots of  chewable spots.  She never really played with these as a string though.   They've held up to a lot of chewing better than almost any toys and  furniture.
