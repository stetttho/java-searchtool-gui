 I just got one of these this week and am still amazed at the value.  I worked with robots in graduate school just a couple years ago.  A similar robot (Lego parts, motors, bump sensors, and controller) would have easily cost $400 or more, taken hours to assemble (probably with some soldering), and have to be programmed in assembler or possibly a subset of C. With this kit I had a running robot with about 15 minutes of work.  Within an hour or so and I had one with bump sensors and my own code running on it.  On top of that, I'm convinced that any bright 12-year-old could have done the same thing. I do wish I had a couple more sensor inputs and motor outputs on the controller.  Maybe if an upgraded controller was available? There are a lot of other sensors available....
