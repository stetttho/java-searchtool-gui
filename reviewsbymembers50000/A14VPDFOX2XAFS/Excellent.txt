 I skimmed through much of this book at a brick store.  It looks excellent  for someone looking to use XML in a Microsoft-centric setting.   It  appears very up-to-date (talks about the MS XML parsers beyond what comes  with IE5).  It goes through some very realistic applications of XML. I  didn't buy it because I've already "been there done that", but it  did give me some good pointers to go digging in the MSDN library.
