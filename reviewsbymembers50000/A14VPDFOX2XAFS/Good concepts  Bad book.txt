 I've been using most of the techniques from this book off and on for the last three years and I think they're quite effective.  Like the author said, if code reviews are good, do them all the time (programming in  teams).  If testing is good, do it all the time.  Nothing earth-shattering  there but I think this style is much more efficient if you have the right  team members. However, I thought the book was weak.  I'd agree with the  other reviewer that said this would have made a better article than a  book. If I had paid $30 to read this book, I would have been  disappointed.  I would much rather have a five page article version I could  pass around to other developers.
