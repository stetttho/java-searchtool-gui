 We got this toy when our daughter (about 8 mo at the time) was struggling to pick up small things with her finger and thumb.  This was supposed to be  the perfect toy for that.  She played with this toy a bit, but I think  picking up Cheerios did more for her pincher grip than this toy.  She  tended to just grab one of the knobs on a string and haul the toy around.   She ignored the squeaky button on top and the mouth and eyes that were  supposed to be so exciting.  The little green rubber knob on the back got  chewed on a few times, but this isn't close to her favorite chew toy.    This seemed like a good toy that would help her learn some motor skills.   Maybe we should have bought it earlier.  My advice would be to skip this  one and buy a box of Cheerios instead.
