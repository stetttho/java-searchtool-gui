 I bought this at a deep discount here and it definately seems worth  more than I paid.  I don't have a real serious internal frame bag to compare it to and I don't have any miles on the bag yet, but I've loaded it with over 50 pounds and it's been pretty comfortable compared to my trusty external frame.  It's definately a bit warmer and won't ventilate the back, but that's just what internal frames are like.  The zippers seem quite sturdy and smooth and the stitching is clean.  The bottom compartment has a detachable divider.  The top flap can snap to the compression straps in two different places to manage any sized load.  I was surprised how much of a load I could fit into it.  It's almost too large for my needs.  The waist belt is removable if you really wanted to.    Negatives: The shoulder straps attach to the bag with velco.  It seems pretty sturdy, but I'd worry about long-term wear.  I think the shoulder straps really only adjust to 3 different positions, so it might not fit every torso length, particularly really long ones.  I don't think the raincover is sturdy enough to trust the bag as checked luggage on an airline.  I could live without the ski pole/ice axe/bike helmet attachment features.  The buckles aren't the latest anti-pinch ones.  The waist buckle is a little tough to get aligned properly and might take 2 or 3 tries to get buckled.
