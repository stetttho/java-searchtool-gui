 The first 60-75% of the book was not state-specific and covers all the general corporation vs. partnership type of information.  If that's what you're looking for, fine, but I would recommend another general  "starting a business" book. For specific information on  incorporating in Florida, I think "How to Form Your Own Corporation in  Florida" from SourceBooks is a better book. The book is also a bit  dated.  The copyright is 1997.  Nowhere did I notice them mentioning any  URLs or internet resources.
