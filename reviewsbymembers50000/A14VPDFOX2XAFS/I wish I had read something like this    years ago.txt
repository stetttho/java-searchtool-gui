 This answers many of those nagging questions that we use for excuses for not really examining our faith.   What about evolution? Is the Bible really credible? Why is there so much suffering? Aren't all religions  essentially the same? Why do Christians commit sin? Why do Christians seem  so strange? These are the sorts of questions that get answered.  I wish I  had read this as a teenager.   I would recommend giving this book to  anyone who needs help getting over these common hurdles that keep us from  the Christian faith.
