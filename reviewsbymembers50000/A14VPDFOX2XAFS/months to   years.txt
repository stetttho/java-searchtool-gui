 We got this when our daughter was under 3 months old.  She loved it then and played with it for a few months.  She loved the noises it made (which  are admittedly a bit annoying).  This toy was one of the few that could  stop her from crying.  We were suprised when we saw that this was supposed  to be for children from 24 months to 4 years.  She doesn't really play with  the toy now (10 mo) and I'm not sure she'll play with it very much as she  gets older.  We'll see.  The toy is very well made and has held up to a lot  of chewing.  It seems very safe for kids of all ages.
