 I'd love to give this camera the 4 stars it deserves, but this morning I finally got the persistant "Memory Card Error" or "E50" error message.  I've had this in the past an was able to reformat the otherwise seemingly perfect memory card and get past it, but this time it wouldn't go away.  I read all about this error online and tried a freshly charged battery and reformatting the card in a PC, but nothing made it go away.    I finally cleared it up in time for today's birthday party by inserting and removing the card 20 times in a row, so possibly it is a dirty contact problem, but I've used Compact Flash cards (and PC cards) for almost 10 years without having a problem that I'd blame on dirty contacts.  The next time it happens I'll try the factory reset or disassembling the camera, but this is unacceptable in a $400+ camera that has less than 6,000 pictures taken on it.  Otherwise, the camera has performed well.  The macro focus is amazing and it's almost nearly like having a microscope in your pocket.  The high speed continuous shooting feature works well, at least with the flash off at not at the highest resolution.  The indoor lower-light performance is pretty pathetic compared to my in-law's higher-end Canon.  I absolutely need the flash to take any indoor pictures except still lifes.  The flash is pretty harsh and I often soften it with a tissue over the flash lens.  The autofocus is a pain and I often have to refocus a shot several times to get it right.  At least you can lock the focus once you get it where you want it, but a manual focus would have been a great additional feature.  Much more useful than all the customizable sounds and graphics on the display.
