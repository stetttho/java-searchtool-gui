 I loved the book (Red Dragon) but was pretty disappointed by the movie.  I never really got the "creeps" from the movie that I got from the book.   What didn't I like?  I thought Tom Noonan as Dollarhyde was pretty weak.  He seemed too skinny and creepy/goofy looking to match the character.  The book's ending is a great twist, but would probably not work in a movie.  (In fact, when I first watched the movie, I even wondered ahead of time how they'd do the ending).  The movie didn't develop Dollarhyde very well or give us any insight into what makes him tick. What did I like?  The Miami Vice look and feel, especially these days.  Lector's scenes.  The ending with Dollarhyde (the music and the shooting scene). Definately worth viewing, but if you're a "reader", check out the book.
