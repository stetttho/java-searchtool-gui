 I bought this for my 2005 Honda CR-V.  It fits pretty well, especially since it can mount off-center to make up for the off-center CR-V spare tire.  I didn't have any problem fitting my full-sized bike on it and the bike is almost centered on the back of the vehicle.  I've seen another spare-tire mount that just fastens over the tire, but it's really meant for full-sized SUV tires, so it really hangs loosly.  Before I bought this rack, a friend with a CR-V expressed concern about the additional weight on the hinges of the rear door, but I've had no problems after more than 6 months.  Negatives: I've noticed a little rust on it.  The post coming out of the mounting bracket is a little too long for my smallish spare tire, so even when the rack is tightened all the way down on the bracket, it's not pressing very hard on the actual tire.  It's just  barely tight enough to keep it secure, but if you had a really small spare, like on a older CR-V, the rack may never actually make contact with the spare at all.
