 Another great and fun game for Sony PlayStation 2 with Ratchet and Clank. It follows a similar vein to Jak and Daxter, except it now becomes an outer space adventure against a variety of aliens from mouse robots, mutant snakes, sand sharks, green blobs, flame-throwers, ship gunners, and many others. The infobots and in-level scenes are hilarious, especially the scenes with the whimsical Captain Qwark and the main villain Supreme Executive Chairman Drek. I have played this game many times and have mastered pretty much everything, except the skill points for doing the Twisty McMarx and completing the Hoverboard Race in less than 1:35. If you like STAR WARS, you'll love this!
