 The graphics, sound effects, and Michael Giacchino's score are fantastic. According to the credits Steven Spielberg helped contribute to this game. Which is very believable considering the smashing success with the Indiana Jones Sage, Schindler's List, and now Saving Private Ryan, which the game borrows very well from. Although the movements from the enemy Nazis are mostly predictable, the game gives many challenges along the way. The opening D-Day attack is pretty tough, as is the Panzers, and Airfield locations. Some nazis are also harder to kill the others. The knife-throwing chefs, Gestapos, the guys with bazookas, and machine gunners are a little tough. The easier kills are the soldiers, guards, bartenders, and working staff. The funnest levels I thought were Operation Repunzel, Nijmegen Bridge, and The Golden Lion. Game very effectively gives player a spy adventure remarkably similar to a James Bond style. You play Lt. James Patterson, and are given some great weapons to use along the way. The funniest moments I think are where you sneak into bars, pop a guard, and several soldiers go in for the kill shouting "Ein Americana!", or "Kum Zoo Puppie!" or other German phrases. The disguise scenes in the bar tipping the piano player or sneaking into the mansion are also cool. The imagery of the games is great looking remarkably similar to key sequences in Saving Private Ryan, The Longest Day, and Bridge on the River Kwai. AWESOME GAME!
