 This is the original, and the best of the three original Muppet Movies. Following this was THE GREAT MUPPET CAPER and THE MUPPETS TAKE MANHATTAN. Those are also very good, but THE MUPPET MOVIE is by far the best for many  reasons. Not only does it make a wonderful family film, but a good film to  watch with your loved one. This movie contains the best cast of Celebrity  Cameos, has the most memorable moments, and is an important movie, due to  the story of Kermit the Frog and friends pursuing their dreams of going to  stardom in Hollywood. It inspires us as young viewers to have a dream and  to pursue it without ever giving up. Last reason, and the best reason as to  why this film is so great is the soundtrack. I personally love THE RAINBOW  CONNECTION song at the beginning. It is such a beautiful song. It is so  bittersweet and most of the time when I hear it, it makes me cry. What are  you waiting for? Buy this wonderful film now!
