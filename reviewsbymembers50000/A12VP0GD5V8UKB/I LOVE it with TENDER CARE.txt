 There is an entirely new meaning to TLC - courtesty of this WWF release. A clever compilation of all of the most grueling matches ever all featuring - you guessed it: tables, ladders, and chairs. There is violence, splintered boards, and high flying excitement a plenty containing live interviews from the Dudley Boys, Edge and Christian, and Matt and Jeff Hardy all detailing their quests for super stardom. Flashbacks from many Wrestlemania and Survivor Series matches, as well as recycled footage from Mick Foley's "3 FACES OF FOLEY" release keep the action going. Among the many matches are: the ladder match at Wrestlemania 16, the street fight at the Royal Rumble 2000, recent Summer Slams, and much more. All viewers be advised - PLEASE DO NOT TRY ANY OF THIS AT HOME!
