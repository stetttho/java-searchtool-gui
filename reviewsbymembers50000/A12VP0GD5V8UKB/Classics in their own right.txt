 The Prequel Trilogy aside, nothing gives me more quintessential George Lucas-ish entertainment than to see his original masterpiece once again. The STAR WARS TRILOGY is back and is now better than ever (STAR WARS: A NEW HOPE, THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, and RETURN OF THE JEDI), after having been re-released theatrically with Special Editions, and the films are now the way George intended them to be in the first place, but could not do it due to time and money restraints and not having the digital technology. All of these classic films include new scenes, digitally enhanced special effects, and superior sound quality to bring a wonderful viewing experience making "a galaxy far, far, away" seem that much closer. Don't be too put off by the die hard fans rating this as a terrible disappointment simply because it's not the much-awaited DVD versions. The sound and picture qualities in this version of the trilogy is by far the best yet. Oh yes, let's not forget John Williams' awe-inspiring scores for the films! These films have been my passion since childhood and always will be. May the Force Be With You, George!
