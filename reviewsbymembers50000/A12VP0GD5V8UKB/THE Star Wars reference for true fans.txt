 Except for the fact of missing references to the prequels, but with so many people complaining of their (minor) inferiorities who's arguing? The undying classic trilogy is brought in splendid life with characters, droids, creatures, monsters, and technologies from A to Z. Whether it's the history of the Skywalkers, Jabba the Hutt, droids, Imperial Commanders, Super Class Warships, alien species, or monsters from all sorts of galaxies - this book is the source of information bringing the evolution of how they came to be in each film. Given it was published in 1998 it gave audiences an even wetter appetite to view the trilogy in full splendor and understand how all of it came to be a story. Stephen Sansweet, who also wrote earlier books of STAR WARS collectibles ranging from toys to audio cassettes gives classic depth to the classic trilogy. It's heavy and rich with information, so this is a must for any true fan. By the way, George Lucas, we can't wait until September 21, 2004 for the release of the trilogy on DVD! Even more so for EPISODE 3 in May 2005! MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU!
