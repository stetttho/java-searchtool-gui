 ....as Lois Maxwell quoted as Miss Moneypenny in DR. NO the very first James Bond film adventure. This 2-disc set is a must for any major James Bond film fan. Disc 1 contains the opening theme songs to all the first 16 films from DR. NO to LICENCE TO KILL. The songs were recorded in December 1992 and they all sound fantastic! Disc 2 contains rare outtakes and unrealesed music ranging from John Barry's composed "James Bond Theme" and "007", along with many missing music from GOLDFINGER, the THUNDERBALL suite, and "Mr. Kiss-Kiss Bang Bang" both the Dionne Warwick and Shirley Bassey version. Anthony Newley's version of GOLDFINGER is in no way as great as Shirley Bassey's version however. The only let-down is it doesn't contain the music to the Pierce Brosnan films. Of course this album was released in 1992, three years before GOLDENEYE was released. Nevertheless, I highly recommend it! You will be glad you did, and the linear notes inside are very nice.
