 1931's leading stars of Horror, FRANKENSTEIN's Boris Karloff and DRACULA's BELA LUGOSI star in this classic 1934 Horror Drama where married couple David Manners and Jacqueline Wells (later Julie Bishop) travel to Vienna by train, where their compartment is joined by Lugosi portraying an eccentric war veteran also en route to the same destination, but for entirely different purposes. At the train stop, they take a bus along a stormy ravine. The bus crashes, leaving Wells injured, and they are forced to seek shelter at a dark, spooky mansion inhabited by Karloff a retired architect, and as we later learn - devil worshipper! While the couple are in the midst of recovery, it is revealed Karloff and Lugosi were old enemies during the bloody years of War. Whenever Lugosi threatens to avenge Karloff, he becomes spooked by Karloff's black cat. Soon Karloff has evil plans for his guests. I will stop here as I do not want to spoil anything. The film is a real classic of the Horror Genre, full of creepy visuals, eerie camera angles, and the scenes with Karloff and Lugosi are compelling and terrifying. I love the chess scene myself.... The dialogue is somewhat silly at times, but the script is very well written and simply grasps your attention from beginning to end. Not quite faithful to Edgar Allan Poe's original story, but sensational nonetheless. Of course when you have Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi together in the same picture, how can you go wrong? ....
