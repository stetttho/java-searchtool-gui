 THE PRINCESS BRIDE is more than a fantasy/romance. It has something for everyone; action, romance, adventure, heroics, treachery, villains, monsters, and magic. This is by far Rob Reiner's best movie to date as the direction, and story re-written by William Goldman makes it even more enjoyable than the actual novel. Excellent choice of casting makes the characters firm and believable: Cary Elwes is Westley, the farm boy and swashbuckling hero. Robin Wright is Princess Buttercup, brave, rebellious, never afraid to die for her lover. Chris Sarandon is Prince Humperdinck, usurping, bold, evil to the bone, loves watching people tortured, and at the same time charming. Mandy Patinkin is Inigo Montoya, a Spanish Swordsman who seeks the Murderer of his Father. Christopher Guest is the 6-fingered Count Rugen, silent, sinister, and gives an excellent impersonation of Henry Daniell from THE SEA HAWK. Andre the Giant is Fezzik, fearsome and funny with some good rhymes to spare. Wallace Shawn is Vizzini, witty, volatile, and in many wasy "Inconceivable!" Fred Savage is home sick with the flu, and Peter Falk as Grandfather reads the tale throughout. Film gets more exciting as voracious sea eels, gigantic cliffs, sword fights, quicksand, large rodents, and witches and warlocks, are only to name a few of the many obstacles throughout the quest. Special Edition DVD has great special features, commentary by Rob Reiner and cast members, and the color contrast is splendid and looks great in widescreen. Relentless adventure and excitement. You're all going to love this one!
