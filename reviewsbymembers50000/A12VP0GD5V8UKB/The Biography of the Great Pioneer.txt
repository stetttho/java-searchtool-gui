 German born author Lotte Eisner adapts an interesting biography into the life of F.W. Murnau, giving fans of his films an interesting read into the influences that enhanced German Expressionism as we know it today. There are eerie comparisons to Renaissance paintings and ancient myths of the macabre throughout. Book has many screenshots from Murnau's films such as THE LAST LAUGH, SUNRISE, and NOSFERATU most importantly. Also included as a special surprise is the original screenplay to NOSFERATU, with an actual copy of a transcript written in German, and the films' original intertitles. Highly recommended, no matter how hard it may be to obtain a copy!
