 ....when THUNDERBALL was such a classic? Plus it's overlong and we had already seen action aplenty before in all other Bond films. Even worse is the music score, and the climax is recycled into a more boring script lacking originality or great gadgets. What I also can't figure it is why does Connery look so much better in this film at 53 then he did in DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER at 41? He's thin, quick, agile, and still quick with the quips. When Barbara Carrera's Fatima Blush waterskis up to him in Nassau she apologizes with "I've made you all wet!", Bond replies, "Yes, but my martini is still dry." Who but Connery could get away with a line like that? Good supporting cast includes Klaus Maria Brandauer as a young blonde haired Largo lacking the eye-patch. Still where's Adolfo Celi when we need him? Kim Basinger and Barbara Carrera may not have been the best Bond gals, but are they as always sexy. The best sequences in the film come from an opening war-game teaser, the battle with Lippe at Shrublands, and a great motorcycle chase. At least with Connery in the role the film has some class to it, helped with Kim Basinger and Valerie Leon in the cast. Aside from Connery the best performance comes from Barbara Carrera as the assassin Fatima Blush. She's clever, wicked, and has a love for deadly snakes. What's also missing is the ticking clock element of THUNDERBALL creating the worldwide panic. Thus there is no sense of urgency for Bond to save the world from the A-bomb. So where does the film stand out? Irvin Kershner hot off the success of THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK brings some class to it with Carrera's Fatima Blush, the Domination video game, Basinger's dancing, the Health Club sequence, and the tango. The real let down is Edward Fox's terrible performance as M and a lousy music score.
