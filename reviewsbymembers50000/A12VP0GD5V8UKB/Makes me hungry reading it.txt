 Great addition to your cookbook collection and Star Wars collection, but if you're like me your collection is big enough already! Book contains a variety of delicious looking recipes from "a galaxy far, far away". Whether it's Boonta Classic Waffles for Breakfast to start your day, Pit Droid Pizza for a party with friends, or Panakacakes for a sweet evening treat for your loved one, you will have great fun cooking away with this book. Even if you are not too experienced a chef, you will have to give it your Jedi best, but try not - DO or DO NOT...there is no try!
