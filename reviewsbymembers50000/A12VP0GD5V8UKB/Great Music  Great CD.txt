 This is actually a 1988 recording from the Peter Wohlert Orchestra of concerto pieces. The best and probably most recognizable of the Brandenburg Concertos is No. 3 in G Major. Film historians may remember it being the background music for the soundtrack of 1920's DER GOLEM starring Paul Wegener. The composition is lushly beautiful and brings to mind blossoming landscapes, and in some ways the film DER GOLEM itself. This is the best recording I could find. So the price alone is worth it.
