 Sounds like two words that don't go well together, right? Well never has the classic "Beauty and the Beast" tale been more splendidly presented than in this film version of Victor Hugo's novel. As THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME, Lon Chaney is simply unforgettable with his disshevelled hair, stooped shoulders, rounded eye sockets, and a through his grin the ugly tip of the epilectic. Great supporting cast also includes Brandon Hurst (Sir George Carew in DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE), Ernest Torrance, Raymond Hatton, Norman Kerry, and many others. I can never watch this film and not instantly fall in love with Patsy Ruth Miller, a truly beautiful actress whose performance of Esmeralda can still make you likewise of Quasimodo feel for her. Although Chaney's hunchback is somewhat mocking and barbaric at times, he is also sympathetic like Karloff's Frankenstein Monster. In one scene he delivers food for Esmeralda after rescuing her, and turns away, as so she doesn't need to look at his ugly features while she eats. What does Esmeralda do? She consoles Quasimodo, and allows him to sit calmly beside her. Audio essay by Make-Up Artist, and long-time Lon Chaney archivist Michael F. Blake is also very captivating. It wasn't until 1998 that I was able to see this for the first time, and by then it's 75th anniversary the film was very stunning to be seen in locations that DO look strikingly similar to Paris, although shot truthfully on Universal's back lot. The lavish production values and a cast of many all help make this an enduring classic. Skip the lame Disney production - THIS is the TRUE Hunchback!
