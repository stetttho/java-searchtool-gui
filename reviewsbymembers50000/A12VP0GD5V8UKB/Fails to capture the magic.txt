 It may have lived up to the hype, but the entire film itself runs back and worth with the same tedious fade outs and ins Chris Columbus directs in all of his movies. The children in the film are too much, Rupert Grint and Daniel Radcliffe give the best performances I thought, even if the rest don't. Why? Listen to their British accents - they sound like they are completely faking it! Tom Felton's Draco Malfoy is absolutely dreadful. He tries too hard to come across as a scheming villain. He sure seemed like a little wimp to me during the Troll attack scene, and especially towards the end - he does however provide an outstanding Morton Lowry impersonation! Emma Watson sure is a cute little girl, but she badly hams it up with the most cultivated accent of all of the characters "Yoov gawt dart awn yoor noaz!". Alan Rickman and Robbie Coltrane are equally banal. The only saving graces come from Richard Harris and Maggie Smith who are excellent as always. For those who disagree, I'm sorry but the film has too many midsections, flaws, and routine performances to make it enjoyable.
