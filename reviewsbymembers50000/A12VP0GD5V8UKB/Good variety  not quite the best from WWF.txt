 As advertised this video/DVD contains the history of the past Survivor Series from 1987 to 1997. It's no HISTORY OF WRESTLEMANIA, but it's still great fun to sit through. Michael Cole narrates as many memorable matches are revisited. Beginning with the very first at the Richfield Coliseum in 1987 with the Hulk Hogan against Andre the Giant team. Also memorable is the development of Shawn Michaels as a superstar when he was a former Rocker tag team partner in the 1989 Survivor Series. There is the introduction to the Undertaker in 1990, and the 1991 match against Hulk Hogan. The real highlight is the controversial finisher match-up in 1997 with Bret Hart against Shawn Michaels, leading to the Hitman's ultimate downfall as a WWF Wrestler. There are memorable matches aplenty, so I'd recommend it for a real die hard wrestling fan, but for a real trip down memory lane, pick up a HISTORY OF WRESTLEMANIA instead.
