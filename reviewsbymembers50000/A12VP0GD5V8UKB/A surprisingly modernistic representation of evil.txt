 This is the most famous of Haunted House spoofs, with its' collection of greedy relatives assembled for the reading of a will, mutual hatreds circulating around the lovely heiress (Laura La Plante) indeed proving her a helpless canary surrounded by hungry cats.  The opening sequence as a gloved hand brushes away the cobwebs to reveal the film's printed intertitle is a spectacular gimmick, which would be reused in 1943's SON OF DRACULA. In an old dark house with spiky battlements overlooking an ancient hilltop, the old Cyrus West cringes in an armchair, menaced by shadows that become giant medicine bottles and monstrous cats, and soon perishes. Now it is 20 years later and the greedy relatives of his acquaintance, with the accompany of the house maid (Martha Mattox), a family lawyer (Tully Marshall), and his daughter gather for the formal reading of his will and who will inherit his estate.  Director Paul Leni draws freshly on Expressionistic resources as characters lurch out of the darkness until their backs ominously blot out the entire screen; disembodied hands hovering timidly, curling round doorways, slowly reaching for the heroine's throat, and among the surprises is an uncanny similarity to Dr. Caligari. He arrives a mysterious stranger with pebble glasses and limp hands to announce "I am the Doctor!" The most arresting angle of all is the double exposure showing the mechanism of the clock that hasn't struck in years since the old Cyrus died. Finally the clock chimes midnight to laboriously gather its forces to start up again as the lights dim and the assembled company await.  Based on John Willard's 1922 stageplay, it would be remade in 1989 and 1978, however this still remains the best, and would certainly influence other Gothic chillers to come, most notably THE OLD DARK HOUSE and THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN.
