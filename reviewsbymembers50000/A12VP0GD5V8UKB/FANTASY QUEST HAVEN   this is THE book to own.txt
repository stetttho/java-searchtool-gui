 Anybody who is really into or owns versions of the popular Dungeon Master(DM) of the Advanced Dundeons & Dragons (AD&D) Role-playing games should definitely make an investment into this book. Not only is it very detailed, and appropriately alphabetical, but lists complete data info on each monster through fantasy, mythology, or in some cases reality. I was much of a fan of fantasy games until I started a collection of Sony PlayStation games, and with the technology that can knock your socks off nowadays, the visuals in monster morphing are great. When you reading through chapters you may discover certain things about monsters you never knew before. For instance the different varieties of dragons; not just the most common green, but the red, black, white, and blue, and the book details their attack status and breathing weapon. Like sea monsters? There is also hydras and whales. Real die hard fantasy fans will have fun reading over the trolls, purple worms, cerberus, and scorpions. I seem to remember an older version of this book that also listed hornet wasps. Upon damage if a hornet gets its' wings burned off, the creature is not damaged, but is now flightless. If you love DUNGEONS and DRAGONS from old Odyssey games, witchcraft, bats, and warlocks are also listed. I found information on Golems (Frankenstein's Monster for instance is a Flesh Golem), Mummies, and Vampires informative. Did you know werewolves aren't the only lycanthropes. The book is rich with information on weretigers, wereboars, wererats, and even werebears. There are also weredragons, but they aren't listed. Definitely worth the investment, and I would highly recommend picking it up together with the ADVANCED DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS: VOLUME 4 and the MONSTROUS COMPENDIUM ANNUAL. This will make your game playing trivia complete!
