 I remember seeing this at a neighbor's house when I was only 5 in 1981. Darn, it's been that long? I remember how much I loved every second of it. It may be dated given the werewolf segments seemed too short and unconvincing, but why AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON works so well is 1) Rick Baker's as always spectacular make-up, 2) John Landis' direction, 3) great supporting cast, I personally loved John Woodvine as the good doctor, and Paul Kember as the clumsy police sergeant, 4) the soundtrack, 5) the locale makes the film properly eerie, especially the beginning as "Blue Moon" is heard, and 6) the entire transformation effects given this was some years before Computer Graphics Technology came along. Had this film been made now with that technology anyway it would not have been so great. This film doesn't need any special effects to make it so great. The entire film may seem somewhat formulaic and short, but it all works so well you simply take it for granted. David Naughton's werewolf as originally intended from Rick Baker was to be a biped similar to the Lon Chaney, Jr. werewolf, but director Landis proposed a sort of demon hound from Hell look would be much more frightening. He was right. Everytime I watch the transformation scenes, and the scenes were the werewolf is running amok in Piccadilly Square, it all looks so convincing. Even by today's standards. DVD includes great special features such as a "Making of Featurette", which is disappointly short, interviews with John Landis and Rick Baker, and behind the scenes segments. The commentary by David Naughton and Griffin Dunne isn't all that great though. All in all great addition to your horror film collection. (if you're feeling a little nostalgic anyway) Oh yes, loved the lovemaking scenes :)
