 I was surprised to discover the mint quality of each video, and all even include a theatrical trailer you can watch before the film itself begins. Which is pretty appropriate and makes you feel you actually are back in time watching each film when it was first released. Not only was Hitchcock such a genius at generated sheer excitement and suspense, but he was eloquently able to tap into our worst and most deep-seated fears. VERTIGO with acrophobia, and THE BIRDS with a fear of wicked winged creatures on the rampage, and who knows what else. Then again there's PSYCHO, everybody knows that movie's reputation for thrills and chills. Even people who have seen the movie a million times are still galvanized by the weird camera angles, and slow-moving camera, the film is intensively more terrifying with each viewing. Anyway, I think back in those days if you were to look in the dictionary under genius, it would say Alfred Hitchcock. So invite some friends over and buy the collection. You will not be disappointed!
