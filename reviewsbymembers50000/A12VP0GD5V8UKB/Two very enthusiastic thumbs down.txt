 I wanted to enjoy this movie, but I simply could not. Take the plot (if there is one) for instance. You have three gorgeous females; Shannon Tweed, Julie Strain, and Deanna Brooks in from my impression of reading the DVD box would be a violent western in the TOMBSTONE genre mixed with hardcore erotica. If that is what you are expecting, you will be disappointed anyway. The only moments I enjoyed are the first 10 minutes or so when the first three female stars are introduced, after that it's all boredom and general bad taste. Had I been the director, I would have, (1) make those pretty boy Sheriffs the bad guys, who needs them anyway? (2) Julie is the bad girl, make her more of a rival for her followers, not for Shannon and Deanna, and (3) I stress this one...far better character development. I ardently hope these three gorgeous women will star in another film of this sort, but with a better supporting cast, and better directing crew. Makes me want to do it myself. It would have gotten a far better treatment. Do yourself a favor...DO NOT BUY IT!
