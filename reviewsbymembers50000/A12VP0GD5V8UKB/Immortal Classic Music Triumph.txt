 Beethoven's "Symphony No. 9 in D Minor - Ode to Joy" goes beyond the realm of heart-pounding, classical opera. The work is a masterpiece in itself that has been performed and re-performed through numerous re-workings through many different Opera Composers and Orchestras. Unlike the somewhat muted rendition we heard on the Die Hard soundtrack, or the disappointingly short and abridged rendition of the main hymn heard on the Immortal Beloved soundtrack, this particular orchestra plays it the best I think because it sounds almost precisely as you would hear it on the radio while driving. The introductory music swells perfectly with the atmosphere, and almost leads you to believe you are watching the orchestra in person. Buy the cassette first if you have any doubts, but this is the best orchestra I've heard composing Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 choral yet.
