 With a clever script from John Hughes and the zany antics of Michael Keaton as a housefather, something's bound to be unorthodox. Such is truly the case here as Michael Keaton and Teri Garr fresh from their earlier careers portray ordinary parents who, on one fateful day, reverse their roles - the Mother goes to work, while the Father stays at home with the children. As the eldest son comments - it is indeed a jungle out there - when stepping into life's realities. Whether preparing grilled cheese with the iron, warming up dirty socks in the microwave, or fixing torn clothes with the stapler, Michael Keaton's performance as Mechanic turned House Father Jack Butler proves parenting is not easy for one with little experience. Especially when trouble comes in the form of Ann Jillian as a curvaceous neighbor offering "extra help". Is there more at risk than one may suspect? Director Stan Dragoti mixes many familiar cliches into the film; soap opera episodes, being lost whiling grocery shopping, and preparing family meals for special occasions. Although it may be too familiar for the taste of many, it works so well because the characters are so believable. The children are great, as is Martin Mull as Garr's overly charming executive. Many classy family comedies from the 80s have stocked the shelves, but I can't think of too many aside from PARENTHOOD with appeal such as this offers. Michael Keaton fans are sure to be pleased.
