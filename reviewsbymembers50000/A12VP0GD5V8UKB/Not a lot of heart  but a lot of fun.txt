 Orlando Bloom looks as though he's the hot newcomer on the block off the success of THE LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy. So it is only natural to feature him as Will Turner the swashbuckling good guy, and with Johnny Depp who is fantastic as an eccentric rogue pirate Captain Jack Sparrow. Thus an odd companionship develops against Geoffrey Rush as the leader of skeleton warriors. I get real kicks out of watching films taking place during the late 18th or 19th century detailing events about gold rushes or war crusades and under director Gore Verbinski, we are treated to clever blend of both. There is a great music score, and the action sequences and special effects are incredible. Keira Knightley sure lights up the screen as lovely Elizabeth. Another great action flick, if somehow lacking historical originality, but much better than the average trash the cinema has been throwing at us lately.
