 Personally I didn't care for DIE HARD'S 2 and 3, but loved the first film! I bought this collection a few days ago and the extra footage on each disc makes this collection very unique and authentic. On the disc for the original DIE HARD I love being able to watch the film in English or French Audio, with the subtitles it is a little advantageous because now I can understand the dialogue because the actors in this film mumble so much. It makes the plot a little easier to follow. You can also watch a special "Extra Branching Version" in which several scenes cut from the original release are restored. I also loved the Director John McTiernan/Production Designer Jackson DeGovia Commentary. I think what makes the original DIE HARD so credible is 1) Michael Kamen's beautiful music score and how he is able to weave themes of Beethoven's "Symphony No. 9" in so sporadically and spontaneously with the live action, 2) Jackson DeGovia's as always wonderful production designs - Jackson DeGovia is simply a Production Designing Expert if there ever was one (by the way, Jackson if you happen to be reading this review - YOU'RE THE BEST!), and 3) Bruce Willis' John McClane is the perfect Good Guy, he's not Indiana Jones who never looses his hat, he's not an indestructible super hero, he is simply an ordinary mortal man caught in a precarious situation with professional terrorists. Whether he endures setting off false alarms, setting up calls for the police, playing cat and mouse with the bad guys, or having to step barefoot on shards of broken glass, John McClane is simply the perfect Terrorist foiler! No wonder this film was simply the prototype for all action films to be shortly after. I think it's just too bad the film had to withstand so many rip-offs. As I mentioned earlier, I never was too much of a fan of DIE HARDs 2 and 3, but this collection alone with all of the extra features available makes this worth the pick up price.
