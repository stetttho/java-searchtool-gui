 In this companion piece to FLESH FOR FRANKENSTEIN, producer Antonio Margheriti has apparently taken more attention to the  film's setting and tone rather than his previous collaborations with director Paul Morrissey, one of Andy Warhol's acolytes who is usually credited a "supervisory" function throughout their filmography. Kier's Dracula needs virginal blood the way alcoholics need a fix. Unable to find any fresh virgins in his native Romania, the emaciated Count and his servant Anton (Arno Juerging) travel to Italy in search of female virgins. They become guests of an impoverished family of Aristocrats who are presided over by Vittorio de Sica and Maxime McKendry. However the sex-crazed gardener (Joe D'Allesandro), who is prone to mouthing American undergraduate ideas of revolutionary slogans, infects the blood of all available women, including the 14 year old daughter. Starved of his fax Dracula collapses to a vomiting heap in the bathroom after sucking the "impure" blood, until he and his servant are exposed in a gloriously bloody ending I will not give away here.  The story is silly and filled with sexual motifs which inpolitically correctly suggesting woman as disgusting and terrifying. Director Morrissey does on occasion get away with many visual gags; most notably Dracula grooming himself before a mirror which casts no reflection, and his use of the decadent decor which ultimately saves the picture. This is one of those moves that is so bad it's fantastic. If not Udo Kier, acting honors would definitely go to Roman Polanski for his cameo as a belligerent peasant and Vittorio de Sica who is rather excellent in the role of the pompous, yet curiously mercenary-like Aristocratic patriarch.  The dialogue throughout the film is both nonsensical and hilarious. Here's my favorite "Perhaps you're right"...."Of course I am". Did YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN rip that off?
