 Sure the cover sucks, but who cares? Watching this DVD is a tour through time into the early days of Jim Henson's career for puppet sketches. Those of you real Muppet Aficionados should look carefully at the cover and try to identify some of the characters, and who they would evolve into later. Despite Kermit the Frog, an early Beautiful Day Monster design, and the obvious Sesame Street characters, watch the skits and try to notice any similarities. One of the first puppet show appearances in SAM AND FRIENDS hosts memorable skits such as "I've Grown Accustomed to Your Face" with a bewigged Kermit the Frog being taunted by the ravenous monster Yorick (who later became Cookie Monster), and the classic "Inchworm" sketch. No, not the song Inchworm, but the sketch with Kermit sitting on a bench and the worm taps him on the leg until he eats it, when the third worm appears, Kermit tries to eat it, but a giant monster appears and eats him. It was a classic sketch used later on THE MUPPET SHOW guest starring Rich Little, with Lennie the Lizard standing in for Kermit. There is also the "Java" skit from the Ed Sullivan Show, which later featured on THE MUPPET SHOW with Ethel Merman. Many of these skits look great after being preserved for so long, and it's enduring to see how the characters have evolved over the years. Those of you real fans should recognize I FEEL PRETTY, MAHNA MAHNA, and BIG BIRD'S DANCE which would also be re-enacted in shows later. I, for one, would love to see flashbacks of the product commercials which were popular around the late 1950s which lasted six seconds during each skit to sell a product and tell a joke. Who can forget Wilkins Coffee, the La Choy Dragon, Claussens Bread, or Purina Dog Chow? For more information on these rarities, I recommend Danny's Tough Pigs website or Kaptain Kidshow Memories. This is a great collectible, and I sense there will be more to follow.
