 This would be director Paul Leni's first Gothic film, in a similar production vein to 1923's THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME, also adapted by Victor Hugo. A historical tale of romance and macabre horror.  Conrad Veidt is Gwynplaine, a Scottish nobleman sentenced to death by King James II for political defection. He is subjected to torture having his face carved into a hideous fixed grin. He escapes into the night where he befriends a blind baby girl. They seek shelter with a kind-hearted mountebank (Cesare Gravina), and as the girl grows a strange love affair forms between Gwynplaine and the girl Dea who through her sightless eyes is unable to behold the horror of Gywnplaine's deformity but a beacon of light. Trouble brews when he is recognized by the late King's Jester (Brandon Hurst) and after entertaining folks as a carnival freak at the sideshows, he is escorted to the court in a plot designed to humble the Queen's sex-craved sister (Olga Baclanova).  Although the second half tends to be heavy handed, particular the drawn out love affair between Conrad Veidt and Mary Philbin, the film is blessed with spectacular sets, and expressive camera angles that really seem ahead of their time. DVD includes extras with a rare vintage with Conrad Veidt at his estate, and a publicity short on the production of the film. Great addition to your Universal Horrors collection!
