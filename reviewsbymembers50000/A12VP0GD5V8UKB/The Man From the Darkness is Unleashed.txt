 This is by far one of the better WWF video/DVD releases detailing the career of the Undertaker. Who can forget his shocking first introduction when he single-handedly ambushed nearly half of THE DREAM TEAM in the 1990 SURVIVOR SERIES? Or for that matter his match with HULK HOGAN in the 1991 SURVIVOR SERIES? He has been loved by many fans whether he was good or bad or neutral. There are memorable matches a many throughout such as the Boiler Room Brawl with Mick Foley, feuds with Giant Gonzales, the SURVIVOR SERIES feud with Yokozuna, and King Kong Bundy at WM11, and more provocatively the ongoing battle against his brother Kane, particular at WM14. There's the burial match, the tombstone match, and many others all included. This is sure to please. That's Classy Freddy Blassie narrating.
