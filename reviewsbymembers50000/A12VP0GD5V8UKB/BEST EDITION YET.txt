 I was always disappointed with all of the video releases of NOSFERATU around the 80's certain key scenes were left omitted. When Blackhawk Videos re-released it in 1991, I was able to see what scenes I missed. It all gave me a clearer idea of how the entire story unfolds. Not to mention different background music being heard. Some where better or worse than others. I should also mention because it was around this time that I first got into the old horror classics. I had always been fascinated in particular with the DRACULA legend. The making of NOSFERATU alone is in interesting key note in film history. What I really enjoyed was the audio commentary by Lokke Heiss, which along with alternate background scores are also accessible on the main menu. Check out the fascinating "NOSFERATOUR" where you get a look at the locations of certain scenes - what they look like now! In closing, if it is an old horror classic you want to scare your friends you invite at home for, NOSFERATU will be hard to beat. One look at Max Schreck will make that obvious!
