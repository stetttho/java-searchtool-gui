 The first of several great cookbooks, aimed mostly for young readers, but die hard STAR WARS fans are guaranteed not to be disappointed. There are delicacies aplenty for all of the special occasions and pertaining to all of the original trilogy films. Need a good boost for breakfast? Nothing like a Mos Eisley Morsel, Twin Sunset Toast, or C-3PO Pancakes to start your day. Hungry for a lunch? Dark Side Salsa, Tusken Raider Taters, or Ewok Eats are sure to fire up your taste buds. Need a hearty supper? Greedo's Burritos, Ohi-Wan Kebabs, or TIE-Fighter Ties are yummies to name a few. Great book! So long as you're looking into purchasing it, goes great with STAR WARS: EPISODE 2 COOKBOOK and STAR WARS PARTY BOOK! MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU!
