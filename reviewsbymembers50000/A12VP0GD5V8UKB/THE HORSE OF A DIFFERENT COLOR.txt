 A different color indeed as being released in splendid technicolor. This unforgettable 1939 classic remains one of my best loved movies of all time. It is absolutely delightful from beginning to end. The special effects and music are nothing short of extraordinary. Whether watching the tornado, the house floating in the air, or seeing monkeys fly - I ask myself, how did they do it? Had this been released with todays' special effects luxury who knows what could have been accomplished? Of course with the way films today have been going lately it could not have possibly been made so well. It goes to show you they just don't make movies like this anymore. They probably never will. Additionally the story of Dorothy (unforgettably played by a 17 year old Judy Garland, it's too bad she had a tragic alcohol downfall later) and Toto meeting up with the brain yearning Scarecrow, heart wishing Tinman, and Cowardly Lion is a classic in itself. One of those bedtime stories you could read again and again. Seeing is definitely believing. Who I really loved was the gorgeous Billie Burke as Glinda the Good Witch. Margaret Hamilton is also wonderful as the Wicked Witch of the East, she almost steals the entire show from Frank Morgan as the Wizard. Documentary supplements on the DVD including outtakes and missing musical numbers is fascinating. I could go on forever with how wonderful this film is, but I think you get the point. A genuine Hollywood Classic - to be loved and cherished by you, your loved one, and entire family - BUY IT NOW!
