 Pretty formulaic plot - Detective Michael Madsen investigates the murder of a rich tycoon and his prime suspect is Laura Johnson, seductive lover of the man believed to be the killer. Director (and cameraman) John Dirlam gives the film a clever twist with style under George Putnam's screenplay. It works reasonably well due to good performances from both leads. It may not be the film alive, but I recommend it to anyone in the mood for a late night thriller. BTW: Yes, there are lovemaking scenes! Just be careful you don't confuse this with the comedy FATAL INSTINCT. Also when buying erotic thrillers, remember the unrated versions are usually the best.
