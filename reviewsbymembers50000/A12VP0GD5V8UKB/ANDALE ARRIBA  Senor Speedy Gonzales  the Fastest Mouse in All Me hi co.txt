 Another great collection of classic Warner Brothers cartoon, and as many reviewers before me noted should be obtained while it lasts. Includes:  THE PIED PIPER OF GUADALUPE: Sylvester the cat plays music to lure the mice to him, which is shortlived when Speedy is to the rescue.  TORTILLA FLAPS: A carnival is interrupted when a voracious black crow seeks supper. Can Speedy outsmart Senor Bon Toro?  CAT TAILS FOR TWO: Two dumb cats hitch aboard a cargo ship, hungry for mice - and soon meet up with Senor Speedy - in his very first appearance, and wait until you see how different he looks and sounds.  CANNERY WOE: A cheese festival is in halt when the cheese store is guarded by Sylvester. Who better than Speedy to get the cheese?  LUMBER JERKS: The goofy gophers endure all obstacles of danger to reclaim their lumber house.  GONZALES TAMALES: The male mice are outraged as Speedy Gonzales is taking all their Senioritas from them, and they seek Sylvester to chase Speedy out of town....good luck Sly - you'll need it!  HERE TODAY, GONE TAMALE: The starving mice come upon a cargo ship full of cheese - guarded by Sylvester. Looks like this is where Speedy comes in.  TABASCO ROAD: After a night in the pub, Manuel and Jose are mucho loaded and come across a hungry cat. Luckily Speedy is still the fastest mouse in all Me-hi-co.  Great WB cartoon addition!
