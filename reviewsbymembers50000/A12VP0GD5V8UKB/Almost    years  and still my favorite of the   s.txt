 Next to STAR WARS and THE GODFATHER that is! I watched this movie in High School after reading the novel for Literature class. Like most films made after a novel I can't decide which I liked better - probably the movie in this case! The 2002 DVD is much better than the 1997 DVD edition. It contains everything missing from the former giving the film the justice it deserves: special features, and even better a Director's Commentary. Jack Nicholson may look a little hard to take with spiked hair and stirring up rebellios inmates to free themselves against Louise Fletcher's evil to the bone Nurse (she didn't scare me all that much, but she still plays the role to perfection). From beginning to end you watch the film with so many emotions; humor, sadness, this movie has it all. I personally loved the card playing scenes, and the cheering, and the Chief carrying the sink away in retribution for Nicholson's...sorry don't want to spoil it. Definitely recommended, and I must say, even though it's within his younger years, Nicholson's best film to date! Not only Nicholson but seeing so many other actors in their younger years: Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd, Vincent Schiavelli, Brad Dourif, Peter Brocco, Michael Berryman, Sydney Lassick, William Redfield...just a fantastic cast and a must see!
