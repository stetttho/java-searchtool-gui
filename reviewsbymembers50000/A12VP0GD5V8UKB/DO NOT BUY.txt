 Die hard wrestling fans of the world, heed my words well! DO NOT BUY THESE VIDEOS! I have seen Quentin Tarantino movies with less mindless bloodshed than this, and these videos don't even try to be entertaining. The wrestling moves used are not real, the so-called Wrestlers executing the moves are not professionals but amateurish 17-year olds giving professional championship Wrestling a black eye in the process. There is no entertainment in watching these psychos almost kill each other with sloppy piledrivers or running cheese grinders over their heads. The only thing that would make this even mildly entertaining is viewing footage of the Police Officers arresting them for assault, battery, and homicide. Evidently there is some market out there that seems to find value in this stuff, or the tapes wouldn't exist. Bottom line: DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS! By doing so you would only end up supporting a bad product and paying the taxes for these freaks' medical bills - who are probably permanently disabled.
