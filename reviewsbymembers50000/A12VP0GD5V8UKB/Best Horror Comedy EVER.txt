 Bud and Lou's first rendezvous with the Classic Monsters of Universal, if not counting 1941's HOLD THAT GHOST, is a bonanza to be cherished even after it's initial release over 50 years ago. The screenplay of Count Dracula plotting to use Lou's dimwitted brain for the Monster is clever, funny, original, and scary. Lenore Aubert makes a great vampire villainous, and Lugosi's Dracula, Chaney's Wolfman, and Glenn Strange's Frankenstein Monster all help keep the film suspenseful and funny. The chase scenes, the "You and 20 million other guys" joke, and the forest chases, are still uproarious to this day. The DVD is truly amazing, and Gregory Mank's commentary, and the Documentary "Abbott and Costello Meet the Monsters" are fantastic treats for the eye and ears. Yes, that's Vincent Price's voice for the Invisible Man. Look out for the lit cigarette. This is simply the BEST! A true classic!
