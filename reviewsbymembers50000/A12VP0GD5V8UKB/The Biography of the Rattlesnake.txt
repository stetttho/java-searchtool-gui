 This is a must see for any hardcore Steve Austin fan! It was originally presented on A&E, and provides interviews with Steve Austin, his parents, Vince McMahon, Mick Foley, Jerry Lawler, Michael Seitz and many others. From Steve's childhood to amateur teenage wrestling to his emerging as a WWF Superstar - this video goes deep into the life and times of the man who you never want to see getting in your face. I can only be referring to one person - Steve Austin. Not as great as Wrestlemania or Royal Rumble events, but a definite must for collectors!
