 Frank Oz makes another comedy triumph with BOWFINGER as Steve Martin plays Bobby K. Bowfinger, a director with a hot new script and not many actors to fill in. Eddie Murphy plays a duel role as Kit Ramsey, the hottest star since James Dean, and his nerdy brother Jiff, who when Kit refuses the script, gets the far-away shots instead. Murphy with his exaggerated gestures, and stunning wit proves what a comic genius he is all throughout. Although no credit is given, one must wonder if he contributed to the script in any way. Christine Baranski is also great. MAJOR HIGHLIGHT: Sexy doll Heather Graham as Daisy.....YOU GO BABY!!!!! The scenes in which Murphy is chased and harassed by Martin's crew, unknowing that he is being filmed every step of the way are hilarious, and the acting is splendid. BUY IT!!!!!
