 Three classics books, three classic monsters, and three classic stories that have been told and retold time and time again, all here in one great book! I'm sure you Horror Film fans like me have seen the Boris Karloff  Frankenstein, the Bela Lugosi Dracula, and the Fredric March Dr. Jekyll and  Mr. Hyde, but if you haven't read the original novels...YOU AIN'T SEEN OR  READ NOTHING YET! Buy this book now, you won't regret it!
