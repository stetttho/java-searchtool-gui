 It isn't quite as good or as influential as Moore's Watchmen, and not quite as much fun to read as Gaiman, Busiek, or Robinson.  It's still great and a revelation as to what you can do within the comic book genre.  There's some pretty sharp political satire here, aimed at both right and left, but the whole fascist undercurrent of the book is pretty troubling.  Anyone who says it's an apology for fascism and nothing more doesn't appreciate the subtlety of Miller's work, but on the other hand anyone who says the book couldn't be read as a qualified defense of fascism hasn't read very closely.   All in all the story's a heck of a ride, and it's pretty much THE definitive Batman story (though Loeb's work is worth a look too).
