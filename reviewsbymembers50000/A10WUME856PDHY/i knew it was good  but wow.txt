 I'd forgotten just how many of the great episodes took place during the first two seasons.  On this DVD you've got "Three Men and Adena," "Gone for Goode," and "Black and Blue," which are to my mind three of the best episodes I've seen.  Most series take a season or two to really hit their stride, but "Homicide" was great from the get go.  In fact as good as seasons three through five were, I'd have to say that I like the show best in these early episodes.  When they started ignoring Ned Beatty to focus on Braugher's character it lost a little something, I liked Pembleton but Bolander was just as interesting to me, and it started to get a little gimmicky by season five or so.  My only complaint about the DVDs is that the sound leaves just a little to be desired.  Sure, sometimes I think they want it to be hard to hear, but there are other times where I think the sound is just a little murky for no real reason.  Despite this little caveat it's still and excellent set.
