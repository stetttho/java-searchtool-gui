 I like this book a lot, but it's part of a larger arc and that larger arc really starts to sag a few books later.  What we find here isn't too uncommon in serialized stories like comics or television shows that actually have a long narrative planned in advance, and that's that the stage setting proves to be much more fun than the resolution.  I can't say when it gets really bad but it does and it seems to do so over a long period of time.  Or possibly Ennis' whole schtick and his characters, never quite as fresh as those of Gaiman to whom he owes a large and obvious debt, get tiring after awhile.  You probably won't go wrong with this one, but I wouldn't suggest buying all the books at once.
