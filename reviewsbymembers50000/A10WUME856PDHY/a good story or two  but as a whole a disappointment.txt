 The story about Emperor Norton is a real gem, and possibly worth the price of the book in itself.  None of the others are nearly as good.  They range from the very enjoyable stories about falling and flying (which perhaps borders on trite but just manages to avoid it) and the other about the Caliph's deal with the dream king to the boring slog about werewolves and the overly long and didactic bit that takes place in the French revolution, which is so far the worst thing I've read that Gaiman has written.  Gaiman's take on Orpheus and Eurydice falls somewhere in the middle; I'd call it workmanlike.  If it wasn't so important for what comes later in the series it'd be pretty easy to forget.  The problem with this book is that it's much weaker than the other collection of stories in the Sandman series that I've read, "Dream Country," but more important to the story as a whole.  My recommendation would be borrow this one from a friend or read it in a book store if you don't have the whole set.  Your money would be better spent on almost any other book in the series.  It isn't bad, it's probably as good or better than anything Garth Ennis, to take a random example, ever wrote, but it is without a doubt the weakest of the Sandman series that I've read so far (I haven't gotten around to "A Game of You" or Worlds End).
