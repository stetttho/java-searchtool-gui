 You probably either love Faulkner's work or you hate it.  If you hate it I won't argue with you.  There are good reasons why you might not like his work (talk about acquired tastes).  If you love him then you can't really find a much better deal than this book.  "Absalom, Absalom," "If I Forget Thee Oh Jerusalem," and "The Hamlet" are some of his best work and you can get this book, which is a nice little volume in about every way, for about 2/3 of what you'd pay to get them seperately as paperbacks.  I'm not overly impressed by what I've read of "The Unvanquished," and scholars seem to share my opinion, but with works as good as the other three I think a little filler is okay.
