 Mr. Reed sure can write.  I don't always agree with him; to turn around what he says about Steve Earle, Reed's politics are suspect.  And more importantly how can he believe that Randy Travis is better than Earle and Dwight Yoakam?  Still even when I didn't agree  with the book I enjoyed reading it.  The essays on country music and Ted Kennedy are worth the price of the book by themselves.  Best of all it's wonderful to see someone defending my home region who isn't a confederate flag waving idiot.
