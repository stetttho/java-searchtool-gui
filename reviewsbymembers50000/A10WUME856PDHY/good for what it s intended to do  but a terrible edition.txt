 This book is good for what it is: a no frills, down to business, intermediate to advanced book on chess tactics.  It isn't the most fun chess book to read (though I find it much less of a slog than some of the reviewers do), but then again if you're serious enough about improving your game to buy this book you no doubt realize that not everything you need to do to so will be fun. My main complaint is that this edition of the book is terrible.   I am not referring to the fact that the descriptive notation hasn't been replaced with algebraic, which isn't so bad, but to the book's shortcomings as a physical object; this book was made on the cheap and it shows.  It literally stinks (that reek of bargain basement ink and paper), the diagrams are blurry and sometimes splotchy, and worst of all the binding is bad- mine started to come apart almost as soon as I opened it.  I'm tempted to give it two stars but I won't.  I'd say it's a three and a half to four for content and a two for the edition.
