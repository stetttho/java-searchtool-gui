 Somewhere along the way Paul Auster was decreed a "literary author," so if you dare to say he's boring, pretentious, and not really all that good with words, you are simply one of the great unwashed who don't get it.  The first two novels in this book  book are flat our lousy, no two ways about it (I lost the book after the I slogged through the second novel and didn't much miss it.  The concluding story looked better than the other two but that ain't saying much).  Auster's characters are wan bloodless abstractions.  You can have abstractions in your stories and still write engaging stuff, look at Kafka, but make us feel for your abstractions; that's the secret.  Auster doesn't come close to managing this feat.  Auster writes "literature" for philosophy students who never got literature or maybe "philosophy" for English students who never understood philosophy.  At any rate it's boring and self important drivel, worse when you  get down to it Mr. Auster's great insights are really rather insipid.  They're the kinds of things fifteen year olds happen on and feel really, really deep and special for thinking of, for a year or two anyway.  James Ellroy and Dashiell Hammett have written much better books, but unfortunately they're crime authors so we can't take them seriously now can we?  But Mr. Auster, talentless though he may be, is a literary author, deigning to write crime albeit in an oh so clever postmodern way so we can't not him serioulsly at risk of looking dumb.  If you read to actually enjoy a book pick up Ellroy or Hammett, but if you want to impress the grad student crowd at parties then go for Auster.  But you'll always wonder just how many of them actually like him, and how many are just saying they do are because they're too afraid of looking stupid to say differently.
