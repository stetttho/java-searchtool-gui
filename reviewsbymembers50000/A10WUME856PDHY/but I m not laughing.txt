 Ayn Rand's "philosophy" is a joke to most philosophers.  According to the Rand cult there's only one reason for this: the academy is overrun by communists.  Now there might be a small kernel of truth to this; the only place in the western world one can be an avowed Maoist and be taken seriously nowadays is the university, but oddly enough Rand and her followers share important traits with many academic marxists including a poor to nonexistent background in philosophy and an immunity to facts and logic.   Rand writes philosophy for people who neither like nor understand philosophy.  If you want a sort of secular theology, then by all means read Ayn Rand.  If, on the other hand, you want a reasoned, philosophical defense of libertarianism, then read Robert Nozick's "Anarchy, State, and Utopia."
