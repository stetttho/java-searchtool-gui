 I generally agree with what the other reviewers say about this book, though I'm not sure they appreciate the level of sympathy, and even love, Bellow has for his flawed creation (and Bellow's warmth is one of many things I love about him).  I would add that this book is the best introduction to Bellow's work.  Like Herzog and The Adventures of Augie March it is unarguably a classic of twentieth century literature; unlike them it's short and relatively straightforward, and once you see what the man can accomplish in a mere 115 pages you'll definitely be primed for more.
