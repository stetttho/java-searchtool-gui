 When I first bought this one I didn't take it out of the player for two weeks.  Even if you don't like what passes for country music nowadays you should give Owens a chance.  I challenge anyone not to sing along with Truck Drivin' Man, Act Naturally, or Storm of Love.  There really isn't a weak song on it though I think these are the standouts.
