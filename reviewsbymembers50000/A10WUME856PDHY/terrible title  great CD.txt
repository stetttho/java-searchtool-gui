 I beg to differ with the last reviewer about this CD not winning Dwight Yoakam any new fans.  A friend of mine who's big into stuff like Uncle Tupelo and its offspring gave this CD a listen and was instantly converted into a Yoakam fan.  I think the stripped down versions on here are as good if not better than a lot of the other versions of the same songs.  The acoustic Readin', Rightin', Rt 23. on here is heads and shoulders better than the other versions I've heard.  The acoustic treatments also gave me more of an appreciation of the fact that Yoakam has his roots in the likes of Ralph Stanley and old mountain acoustic music as well as Bakersfield and Buck Owens.  A great CD, it never fails to find its way back into my player.
