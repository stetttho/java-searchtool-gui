 Let me start by stating clearly that this is not a book of home remedies for children's illnesses.  If that's what you're looking for, you will be disappointed with this book.  If, however, you are looking for a book to tell you whether a certain set of symptoms requires no treatment, a morning call to the doctor or a midnight trip to the hospital, you won't be disappointed.  This basic format of the book is simple.  For each condition (say, spitting up), there is a page or so of general information.  Then, there's a chart of possible symptoms (ie, Does your child spit up excessively when played with after nursing?), what the cause could be (ie, If yes, the cause could be overstimulation) and what kind of action should be taken (ie, let the baby rest quietly after nursing).  Basically, I think of this as my "Should I worry?" book.  When I'm not sure whether I need to call the doctor or not, I pull out this reference and find out.  A definite "must" for the bookshelf of any parent.  Incidentally, this book comes in both hardcover and softcover.  Based on some reviews that complained about the small typeface in the softcover, I bought a used hardcover in perfect condition for less than what was being charged for the softcover version - there seem to be a lot of hardcovers for sale in good condition pretty cheaply through Amazon, so I'd check that out before buying a softcover.
