 I put this on my registry so I wouldn't have to worry about buying all the different baby soaps and shampoos separately.  Everything in the set is full-size, which is nice.  The tote is very large and roomy - I've added several more full-size bottles to what came in the original set and there's still plenty of room to spare.  While it would probably be a couple of dollars cheaper to buy all the items separately and put them into a plastic tote, the set makes a nice shower gift and saves time and effort over buying each item individually.
