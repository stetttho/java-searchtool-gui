 Now your little fan of the Rainbow Fish series can bring his or her own personal artistic vision to the story in The Rainbow Fish Coloring Storybook.  This book tells essentially the same story as the original Rainbow Fish, but instead of having the original watercolor pictures, this book is presented in color-it-yourself form.  As an added bonus, a variety of glittering Rainbow Fish stickers are included; each page indicates which sticker should be attached.  Children who already enjoy the Rainbow Fish series should like this opportunity to color in the famous fish and his underwater world.  Tip: Look for this book at a discount (I found it at a local dollar store).
