 Although I learned to knit as a child, I've always been a much stronger (and more skillful) crocheter.  Since becoming a mom, I've decided to work on improving my knitting skills, but since I mainly knit on the train to and from work, I didn't want patterns that involved too much complexity or concentration.  I also didn't want to keep knitting the same baby blanket/scarf patterns I'd started out with.  Enter this book.  I love the fact that the patterns are truly designed to be knit up quickly and with a minimum of fuss.  The review section at the beginning of the book was perfect for me - I could easily check how to do things I'd forgotten or never learned (increasing and decreasing come immediately to mind).  I also REALLY like that these baby/toddler patterns aren't 40 years out of style.  The Yarn Girls really came up with some updated classic-style  patterns that won't go out of fashion any time soon.  It's also very helpful to see each project knit up in two different color schemes - it gives me lots of ideas when choosing colors.    Overall, this book provides clear instructions for stylish patterns that knit up in a breeze - what more could a knitter want?  I highly recommend this book!
