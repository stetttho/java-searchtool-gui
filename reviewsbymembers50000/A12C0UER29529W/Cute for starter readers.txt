 This is a very simple book.  Page by page, it "builds" a wolf, one body part at a time ("This is my nose..." "This is my eye...").  Once the wolf is all there, we find out what he's having for lunch - and you may be surprised at what it is!  This is a nice little book for introducing body parts as well as for building up suspense in a story.  Bonus: the artwork is pretty cool, too!
