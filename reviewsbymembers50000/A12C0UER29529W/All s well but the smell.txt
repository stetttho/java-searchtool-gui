 We received this as a gift for our daughter when she was about two and a half months old.  At first, she wasn't at all interested in it.  I think it was a bit too large for her and the unfamiliar cube shape didn't do it for her.  Now at about three and a half months, she's just starting to play with it.  We've clipped it to the toy bar of her swing, and she'll pull on the various loops and rings as she swings.  She seems to especially like the crinkling sound that the toy makes.  My only complaint about this item is the "green apple scent."  When we first opened the box, this toy REEKED of some sickly chemical odor - definitely unlike any apple I've ever smelled!  If you or your child is sensitive to scents, watch out for this one.  On the upside, after a few weeks out of the box, the smell was entirely gone and we were left with a nice little soft toy.
