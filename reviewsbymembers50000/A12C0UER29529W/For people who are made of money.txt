 The folks at L'Occitane must be crazy.  What else could explain charging $15 for 2 oz of shea butter when for half that price you can get twice as much at a health food store?  Yes, L'Occitane shea butter is nice and smooth, and it doesn't get grainy after being exposed to summer heat the way some other shea butters can.  But, really, $15 for 2 ounces?  I just can't get past the price.  The product independent of the pricing is worth 5 stars, but in terms of cost-effectiveness it earns 0 stars - if I could have given this 2.5 stars, that's what it would have gotten.  Save your money and skip this shea butter!
