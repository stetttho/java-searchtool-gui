 I received a set of Carter's sage receiving blankets as well as a set of Carter's animal print receiving blankets as gifts.  I thought both sets would be identical in everything except the design on the cloth, but I was wrong.  I actually find the animal prints softer and nicer-feeling in general.  The sage blankets, however, are fairly large - as with the animal prints, they are big enough for me to lay one end under my baby's head as she nurses and still have enough left to wrap around her body - like having a burp cloth and blanket in one. I've also used these as coverups for nursing in public.  They have held up well to washing and drying, too.  If you're really into the sage color/design, by all means get this set; however, if you want a softer blanket from the get-go and the design isn't so important to you, go with the animal prints.
