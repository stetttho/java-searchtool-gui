 I picked this book up on clearance for 50 cents, mainly because my daughter is at the stage where she wants to participate in reading by grabbing at the pages of her books, so board books are a necessity.  There's no real story line here; each page begins with "I want to see" and finishes the sentence with some funny image, like the Queen of France wearing polka-dotted pants.  Of course, all the Muppet Babies chime in on what they want to see.  While not destined to be a classic, this is a cute little book that's certainly worth half a buck.
