 After buying several sets of Gerber's 2-snap gowns and being very satisfied with them, we received these Carter's gowns as a gift.  Carter's, known for their good quality, doesn't disappoint in terms of the fabric (soft and able to stand up to many washings) or most of the gown's features (fold-over mitts so baby doesn't scratch herself in her sleep; elastic bottom to help keep the gown from riding up).  However, the big disappointment in these gowns is the design of the neck.  While Gerber puts two snaps down the front of its gowns, which makes it VERY easy to pull the gowns over the head of a cranky baby, Carter's has no way of opening up the neckhole at all.  It's always a struggle for us to put these gowns on our daughter, and she winds up crying hysterically (NOT what we want just before bedtime).  In short, while I'm usually a big fan of Carter's clothes, I'll stick with Gerber's gowns.
