 This is the second time I'm trying Luvs, and I'm annoyed with myself for even giving them a second chance.  The first time I tried Luvs (size 1-2), they leaked HORRIBLY nearly every time my daughter wore them.  I contacted customer service and they were snotty and definitely not customer-oriented.  However, after many emails on my part they did send me a coupon for free Luvs (my first thought: Just what I need - more diapers that I hate!).  After thinking it over, though, I figured I'd try Luvs again in the larger size (I thought maybe my daughter was too close to the weight limit of the 1-2s for them to work at their best).  What a mistake!  The very first size 3 diaper I tried leaked HORRIBLY at the waist (the same place where the 1-2 diapers leaked) and poop got all over the place...EXACTLY what happened with the last batch of Luvs.  This is clearly not an issue with my daughter (who uses Pampers and Huggies with no problem) nor is it an issue with a single batch of diapers that somehow had a defect.  If I could give Luvs zero stars, I would.  NEVER, NEVER BUY LUVS!!!
