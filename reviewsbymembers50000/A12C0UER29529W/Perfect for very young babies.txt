 I wanted a toy to hang from my month-old daughter's play gym.  The toys she already had hanging there gave her stuff to look at, but at her young age, not much to actually do.  All she could really manage was to bat the toys around, and none made any noise when she did this.  I bought the wind chime hoping to give her at least some sort of "reward" for her batting efforts.  I wasn't disappointed!  The chime rings with the slightest touch, and the sound is sweet and melodious - I don't get tired of hearing it (and neither, it seems, does my daughter).  It *is* a little expensive at about $10 compared to other hanging toys, which is why I haven't yet invested in another one to hang on her carseat/stroller.  However, the price is really the only downside I've found - overall, this is a fabulous toy for even the smallest of babies.
