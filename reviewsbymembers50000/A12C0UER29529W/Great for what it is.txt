 First let me say that if you're expecting this stroller to be on par with a full-fledged "travel system," you're bound to be disappointed; however, if you're looking for the most basic type of stroller, this one is a fairly good bet.  Like many other reviewers, we also received our safari umbrella stroller for free with a Babies R Us purchase.  I brought this stroller to my mother's house to have on hand for visits, and it's been a real convenience.  At under 3 months old, my baby fits nicely inside without sliding around or slumping down too much.  The stroller itself rolls smoothly, and the fact that it's lightweight and not at all "complicated" (unlike our Graco stroller, which can be a bit intimidating to someone who's never seen one before) makes it ideal for my elderly mother to use with her granddaughter.  This is really the perfect stroller to use in a city where you can walk to most places from home - just belt the baby into the seat and step right out the door.  The only two real drawbacks I've found are the seatbelt (3 point harness only instead of 5) and the fact that there's no sun canopy (make sure baby wears a hat outside if it's sunny).  Other than that, this is exactly what an umbrella stroller should be: portable, lightweight, easy to use and inexpensive.
