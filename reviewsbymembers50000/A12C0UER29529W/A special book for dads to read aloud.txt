 This companion to the popular book "Mama Do You Love Me" transfers the concept of a child seeking reassurance of a parent's unswerving love from the Inuit people of Alaska to the Masai people of Africa.  In this book, a young Masai boy asks his father how much the father loves him.  The resulting dialog, meant to reassure the boy that a father's love is unconditional, makes up the majority of the story.  This book seems to address some of the concerns of some reviewers of "Mama Do You Love Me," who worried that book encouraged bad behavior.  In that book, the young daughter asks  if her mother would love her even if she did very naughty things, like throwing water on the family's lamp; no matter what, the mother's answer was always that she would love the daughter.  In this book, the young son never gets up to any intentional mischief; in fact, many of the son's questions result in the father explaining how he would help teach his son or protect him from danger.  In this way, it seemed like a very realistic way to present one of the differences between how some mothers and fathers relate to their children.  The father in this story says the actual words "I love you" far less than the mother in "Mama Do You Love Me," but he shows his love for his son through his actions.  Children who enjoy the repeated "I love you" refrain in "Mama Do You Love Me" may be disappointed not to find it in this book.  However, the engaging story and beautiful illustrations should go a long way towards making up for that.  Overall, this is a touching story that's perfect for fathers to read to both their sons and daughters.
