 We received this as a gift, and alhough I hadn't thought about using a sleep positioner prior to that, we decided to try it with our newborn.  Until she was about 5 weeks old, our baby stayed flat on her back whether or not we used the positioner - she was simply too young to even begin rolling over.  At about 6 weeks, she was able to scoot herself down the pad so her face was level with the side wedges.  No matter how snugly I confined her within the wedges, she managed to do this over and over again.  I was concerned that she would turn her face into one of the wedges and smother, so I finally removed the positioner completely.  I was very disappointed because it was just at this point that she started to roll herself around and we really could have used a sleep positioner to keep her on her back.  I'm glad that this works for others, but for us it was a bust.
