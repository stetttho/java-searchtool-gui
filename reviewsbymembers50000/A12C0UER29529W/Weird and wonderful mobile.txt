 When I first took this mobile out of the box, I was disappointed.  The shapes looked so weird I couldn't imagine why a child would be interested in them.  But, leave it to my 1-month-old to prove my instinct wrong - she really likes looking at the funny shapes swirling overhead.  By now, they've sort of grown on me, and they remind me somewhat of Dr Seuss' fanciful creations.  I love the music that the mobile plays.  The sound quality is quite good - not tinny or clunky at all.  I haven't had the problem with the mobile falling over that other reviewers have had - it attached to the side of my baby's crib very securely.  My big concern when we first started using the mobile was that the sliding rings on the arms would be too loud and wake the baby, but they've never seemed to bother her.  The only thing I noticed was, on our crib at least, the mobile hangs very high up overhead, so our baby couldn't focus on it too well when she was very young.  (We have a different mobile over her changing table that hangs much lower, and she was able to start to focus on that within a couple of weeks of birth.)  However, I can see how hanging higher would be a plus as children get older and start trying to reach up and grab the mobile.  All in all, I'm very satisfied.
