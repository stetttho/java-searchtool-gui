 I wear a size 40DD nursing bra, and I purchased this bra in size XL.  It really is very comfortable: it doesn't bind, the fabric breathes and the shoulder straps don't cut into my shoulders.  However, the stretchiness of the fabric makes this a rather loose-fitting bra; I probably could have gone with the large size instead of extra-large.  I would certainly never wear this bra while exercising!  I've found it's best as a sleeper bra.  It holds nursing pads in very well, even when lying down and rolling over repeatedly, and it's the most comfortable bra I own to sleep in.  Buy something with more support for during the day, but use this one at night.
