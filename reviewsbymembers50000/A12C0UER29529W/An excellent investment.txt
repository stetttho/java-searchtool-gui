 This is one of the best gifts we received!  We've used this "bouncy" seat every day since bringing our baby home from the hospital two and a half weeks ago.  The vibrations really calm her and lull her to sleep, and she already shows interest in the flashing lights and sounds.  We've even let her sleep in this chair at night when she's too fussy to sleep soundly in her cradle.  My only complaint - a VERY minor one - is that the straps on the 3-point harness are a bit too short on the sides that get threaded through the back of the seat.  They tend to slip back out through the seat back when the straps are unbuckled, which means fishing around and pulling them back through when it's time to buckle the straps again.  However, this really is a MINOR inconvenience and it doesn't detract whatsoever from my 5-star rating.  I would definitely recommend this learning seat to anyone with a new infant!
