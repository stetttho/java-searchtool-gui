 I purchased this travel system for one reason only: the Graco SnugRide earned Consumer Report's highest safety marks for an infant car seat.    The SnugRide itself is heavy and cumbersome, but I'm willing to deal with that for the safety of my baby.  The base was easy to install in our car, and the level on the side makes it very easy to see if it's installed at the proper angle.  The stroller is HUGE - it takes up the entire rear section of our Honda CRV.  However, it's a piece of cake to open and close, and the design always keeps all four wheels firmly on the ground (I don't have to worry about it tipping over while I'm opening or closing it and the fabric landing in mud or on a wet pavement).  All in all, I'm very happy with the entire system.
