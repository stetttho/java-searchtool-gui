 After years of cutting my legs with dollar-store razors, I finally decided to treat myself to a decent razor.  I picked the Intuition because I really liked the idea of having the soap and shaver in one.  The main "pro" of this razor is that, in my opinion, it gives a good, close shave.  I haven't had any of the problems with it not shaving closely enough that other reviewers have mentioned; maybe it's just a matter of personal preference.  I also like that it glides along the leg very smoothly.  I've nicked myself occasionally at the ankle and knee, though - go carefully in those spots.  It's convenient to be able to hang the razor right in the shower from the suction-cup hook.  Since I only shave in the shower, it doesn't bother me that both your legs and the razor need to be wet for it to work.  Now for the cons.  The soap wears down very quickly.  I've even had one soap bar pop off the razor completely after only a couple of uses, and there was no way to reattach it - there went one very expensive refill!  And yes, the refills are EXPENSIVE!  Way overpriced, if you ask me, especially since they don't last very long.  I find that the average refill lasts in good condition (with soap on the sharp side of the blades) for maybe 6 uses; after that, the only soap is left on the dull side of the blades, where it doesn't do any good (what genius is responsible for that bit of designing??).  I usually use the razor anyway until all the soap is gone - maybe a dozen shaves total, only half of which are as they should be.  Poor value for the money there.  I'll keep using the Intuition for now; however, when I run out of refills next time I might just go back to a plain ol' razor and shave gel.  This product deserves an honest 2.5 stars - it's a great idea that's been hamstrung by a poor finished design and overexuberant pricing.
