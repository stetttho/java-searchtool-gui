 We're totally pleased with this changing pad.  It's firm enough to provide excellent support and retain its shape (important because of the high sides) without being hard and uncomfortable.  The plastic cover is easy to wipe clean in case of leak-through, but we use a terry cover with a quilted multi-use pad on top and rarely have problems with leakage.  This sturdy pad can stand up to years of use.  An excellent buy!!
