 This blanket really lives up to its name!  It is incredibly soft and plush - perfect for wrapping up tender newborns or as a "security blanket" for older ones.  Folded in half, the size is just right for tucking around a baby in a car seat or bouncy seat.  Opened up, it makes a great wrap-around blanket.  We couldn't be happier with this blanket!
