 I really liked the idea of having a toy that my daughter could use from a very young age, and this piano seemed to fit the bill.  I received one at my baby shower and immediately attached it to the foot of her cradle.  My daughter is a big kicker, so she started using this piano when she was only a few weeks old.  I've never had a problem with the Kick n Play, and while I'm not sure my baby yet realizes that she's making it work by kicking it, she does kick it quite a bit when it's within reach.  My big complaint is that the selection of music and other sounds that the piano makes aren't very good.  On one setting, it plays several children's songs (instrumental only) - the sound quality is OK, but nothing special...certainly not as good as the sound on the Imaginarium mobiles.  On another setting, it says an animal name when a key is kicked ("dog") and provides the sound of the animal (again, the sound quality of the animal sounds is pretty poor in my opinion).  Another kick and a number is said, then a few bars of a song.  Lights flash.  Really, nothing too exciting.  The songs are the same on every setting; the main difference is how much of each song is played and how many are played in a row.  I find the one-word animal and number identification just plain boring.  I think much more could have been done with the audio part of this toy, which is why I'm only giving it 3 stars.
