 You don't have to be a child to enjoy the beautiful songs on this album.  This is a wonderful change from the "typical" lullabye collections.  In addition to loving the songs themselves (and their calming effect on both my infant and me), I especially appreciated the detailed booklet that explains the origin of each song and gives some background information about the different cultures represented on the album.  This collection truly has something for everyone, no matter what your age.
