 I received two sample pairs of these breast pads when I bought my Medela Pump in Style, and I'm glad I got the pads for free instead of spending $10 on a whole box.  Yes, the pads are thin and so they don't show through clothing.  However, I haven't had a problem with any of the pads I've worn showing.  These pads make a big deal about being "form fitted" due to the two little pleats, which give them a natural 3-dimensional curve.  However, again, I've never had a problem with unpleated pads and how they fit (and I have a VERY large bust).  But, the thing that I really hate about the Medela pads is the adhesive.  It's such a small piece of adhesive that it really should have been left off entirely.  It's just big enough to make it hard to remove the pads from the bra for nursing, but it's too small to really hold the pad in place while the bra is open.  This makes the pad ruffle up badly, and it's very difficult to get it back into shape when you put your bra back in place.  After only one or two times of putting the bra down and back up, I found that the pads were bunched up into uncomfortable, lumpy balls inside my bra, and there was really no way of fixing them.  Personally, I prefer the First Years nursing pads with lanolin.  They are very absorbent, they hold their shape through multiple nursing sessions, and they don't show through clothing.
