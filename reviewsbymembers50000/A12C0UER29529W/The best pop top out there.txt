 I've bought several brands of wipes in an attempt to get a wipes box with a top that I like.  Pampers wins hands-down.  The push button allows me to get the top up with only one hand (a plus as I'm usually holding a squirming baby with the other), and the wipes come out easily and individually (no clumping several together or pulling the whole top up and off as with some others).  The wipes themselves are nicely moist and soft to the touch, with a pleasant, not-too-strong scent.  Buy this tub first and when it's empty keep refilling with more cost-effective Pampers refills (usually 400 for around $10 or less).
