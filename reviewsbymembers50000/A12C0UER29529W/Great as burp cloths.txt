 Even though these are called "diapers," I would never use them that way.  Instead, they really make the ideal burp cloth.  They are incredibly soft and thick - I've never had a leak-through no matter how much drool or spit-up they caught.  I keep one under my baby's head when she's in her bouncy seat and car seat to catch any drool - it cuts way down on the number of times I need to wash the seat covers.  These cloths wash very well - they don't fade or fray, and they just keep getting softer with time.  Buy a couple of sets!
