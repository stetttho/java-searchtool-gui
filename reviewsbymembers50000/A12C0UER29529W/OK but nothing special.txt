 I registered for this kit because I didn't want to have to worry about getting all these things separately.  I really shouldn't have worried - I wound up getting a little comb and brush set myself and the hospital gave us a baby emery board that I've used since day 1.  The comb and brush in this set are OK - I didn't find the brush too hard as another reviewer did, but I think the comb is too short; I would have preferred that the whole comb have teeth instead of having such a short toothed section and such a large handle.  I haven't used either the nail clipper or scissor because the doctors told us not to use them on delicate baby nails (it's too easy to accidentally clip the skin).  I used the emory board from this set once and it was fine, although I prefer the one I got from the hospital because it's larger and teddy-bear shaped (easier to hold as well as keep track of).  I haven't used the toothbrush, either - until my baby gets teeth, I'll just wipe her gums with a damp cloth.  Overall, for the number of things I really use from this set, I don't think it was worth it; however, if you think you'll use more than half of what's in the kit, it's a convenient way to get all the items at once at a reasonable price and with a handy carrying case to boot.
