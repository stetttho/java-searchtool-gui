 Pros:  - These pads retain their shape and don't ball up or shred after a few hours like the Medela pads do - They stay more or less in place even without using the adhesive strip - Absorbent - I've never leaked through the pad - Value for money - at $10 for 100 pads they're a decent buy - They don't show through under clothing  Cons:  - They're a bit too small in diameter - even a little slippage (especially common at night) can cause the pad to be off the nipple  - For those who like to use adhesive (I don't), the adhesive tab is so small that it's effectively useless  The bottom line: While this pad is effective under most circumstances, it's not as good as my favorite pad, by "The First Years."  Buy it if it's the easiest one for you to locate.
