 Based on the reviews I read, I asked for this thermometer on my baby shower registry, hoping to be able to avoid using a rectal thermometer.  I was delighted when a friend (who is a doctor, no less) purchased it for us.  However, I'm been disappointed for several reasons.  First, I haven't been able to get a consistent reading on anyone in our house.  Perhaps it's because the thermometer is sensitive enough to register tenths of a degree, but no matter who I scan and how many times in a row I scan, the temperature always comes out at least one-tenth of a degree different.  Now, that wouldn't be such a bad thing except that the effect seems to be cumulative, so after 5 scans in a row, I'm now half a degree away from where I started, etc.  This really makes me doubt the overall effectiveness and accuracy of the thermometer, especially when my baby's temperature is close to a reading that's too high and needs to be brought to a doctor's attention.  I asked my pediatrician about this thermometer, and she said it's okay for getting a general idea of my baby's temperature, but for times when I need a truly accurate reading, the only thing to use is a rectal thermometer.  She also recommended using an under-the-arm thermometer to get a more accurate reading than on this one, and that's what I now find myself doing.
