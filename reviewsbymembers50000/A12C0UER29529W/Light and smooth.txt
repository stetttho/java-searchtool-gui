 I was given this hand cream as a gift.  I usually use pure shea butter on my skin, so this cream was a definite departure for me.  It has a pleasant scent, and goes on smooth and light as compared to pure shea butter, which can feel somewhat greasy.  However, it doesn't have the same kind of moisturizing effect as pure shea butter; people with extremely dry skin might not find it effective enough.  And at $23 a tube, I consider it vastly overpriced (if it were more reasonably priced, I would have given it 4 stars).  While I appreciate having received this as a gift, bottom line is I won't be buying it for myself when my gift tube runs out.
