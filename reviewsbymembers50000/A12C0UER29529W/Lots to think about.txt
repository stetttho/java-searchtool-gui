 I must admit that I wondered about the message The Rainbow Fish was sending.  After all, the fish does give all but one of his scales away, and unlike in some classics like The Happy Prince, the recipients of his generosity weren't saved from an unhappy fate by his gift - they merely received something they'd admired.  I kind of wondered if this encouraged over-generosity and might lead a sensitive and giving child to be taken advantage of.  However, I do think the overriding message of The Rainbow Fish is that giving is good - a message that we don't hear often enough in society today.  I also think that the characterization of the fish before he decided to give his scales away - as a prideful, rude, unfriendly fish who was more concerned about his appearance than about someone else's feelings - makes it easier for a child to understand why the fish's actions at the beginning of the book were wrong.  In large part, it's not simply the fact that the fish doesn't want to part with his scales but the fact that he rejects the smaller fish's request so brusquely that causes all the other fish to shun him.  In that sense, giving away his scales is almost an atonement for his earlier actions.  Ultimately, though, children who read this story will interpret on a much simpler level: The Rainbow Fish is mean and greedy, so the other fish stop playing with him.  When the fish acts nice and generous, everyone plays with him again.  The moral of the story: Be nice and generous.  I don't think anyone can fault that message.
