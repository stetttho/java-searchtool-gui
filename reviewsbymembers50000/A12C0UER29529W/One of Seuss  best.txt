 Not only does this book make a good case for trying new foods (a big plus right off the bat), it does so in the inimitable rhyme of Dr. Seuss.  What more can be said?  This is a classic among classics, truly the good Dr. at his best.  So, I will read it in a boat And I will read it with a goat And on a plane and on a train And in the dark and in the rain I will read it here and there Yes, I will read it everywhere!
