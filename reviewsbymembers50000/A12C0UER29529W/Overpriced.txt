 I always carry a bottle of hand sanitizer with me.  It comes in handy after changing diapers, before eating out, and especially when riding public transportation (who wants to touch their face after hanging on to a grimy subway pole?).  I've really found that I get sick much less frequently when I use hand sanitizer on a regular basis.  However, Purell is WAY overpriced!  I buy huge refill bottles of store brand from Wal-Mart for what one 8 ounce bottle of Purell costs.  Save your money and buy your store's own brand - it's just as effective as Purell.
