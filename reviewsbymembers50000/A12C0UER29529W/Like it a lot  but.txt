 We have been fortunate enough to receive not one but THREE different swings - this one and two Gracos (one for our house and one for each grandma's house).  In terms of bells and whistles, this one wins hands-down.  I really like the fact that it plays music plus a variety of white noise (rain, ocean, etc); hitting the "reset" button easily starts the sounds up again once they turn off.  The overhead mobile is cute, as is the lighted "aquarium" in the mobile's center.  I also like the fact that the motion and the lights on the mobile operate independently - you can use both at once, each one alone, or keep the mobile shut off completely.  However, even in its furthest-reclined position, the seat doesn't put the baby at an angle where she can easily see the things overhead.  In fact, I was disappointed that this seat only has 2 positions - my older-model Gracos have 3 or 4 seat recline positions.  It's definitely nice that this swing moves in both the traditional swing direction and the less common cradle direction.  However, I found that while swinging in either direction, the swing would build up such momentum that the legs of the swing would lift slightly off the floor.  It always makes me nervous because it looks like it might tip over.  I never had this problem with our Graco swings, and they swing in just as high an arc as this one (albeit only in the traditional swing direction).    I'm also disappointed that this swing is only recommended for babies up to 25 lbs.  My daughter loves her swing but at three months she already weighs nearly 14 pounds; I have a feeling that she'll outgrow this swing long before she's ready to stop swinging in it.  All in all, the extras on this swing are nice to have, but there's nothing here that I'd pay $100 for.  If money isn't an issue, go for it; otherwise, a cheaper swing will still give your baby the fun of swinging without causing you to spend a lot on an item that will soon be outgrown.
