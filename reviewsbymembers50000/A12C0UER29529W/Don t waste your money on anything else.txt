 These diapers are wonderful!  The best thing about Swaddlers as opposed to regular Pampers is the elastic that goes all around the waist.  Not only does this give a perfect fit no matter your baby's size but it really does help prevent messy leaks.  The extra couple of dollars you spend on Swaddlers is more than worth it.  I only wish they came in larger sizes!
