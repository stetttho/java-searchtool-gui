 When I first read "Rainbow Fish to the Rescue," I had to check to make sure this book had, indeed, been written by the author of the original Rainbow Fish book.  "Rescue" has the feeling of a quickly-cranked-out sequel, one that the author of the original would never have approved had he been given the choice.    I really don't know what came over Marcus Pfister.  "Rescue" picks up where "The Rainbow Fish" left off.  Each fish now has its own shiny scale, and they all play together happily.  However, a new fish without a shiny scale comes along, and rather than welcome him to the group, all the fish ignore the newcomer.  The Rainbow Fish goes along with the crowd even though he feels bad for the new guy.  With little or no development to the story, the Rainbow Fish experiences a change of heart, the new fish is welcomed to the group (after being rescued from a prowling shark) and everyone is happy again.  The moral of the story, which practically thumps the reader over the head, is to treat others nicely.  The original "Rainbow Fish" book did a much better job of presenting the exact same moral.  This book feels forced and rushed, as if Marcus Pfister was working under a tight deadline and needed to get his manuscript off to the printer yesterday.  I bought my copy of "Rescue" at a dollar store, and it was worth the buck but certainly not much more.  Stick to the original "Rainbow Fish."
