 This hooded towel is adorable, but aside from that, it's thick, absorbent and large.  I have several hooded towels by different manufacturers, and this one is my favorite because of its thickness, absorbancy and size.  However, the very first time I washed this towel (in cold water), all the colors from the duck's beak and face ran all over the light yellow of the main part of the towel.  I was very disappointed, but fortunately this is only a cosmetic defect - the towel still functions perfectly and is still my favorite.
