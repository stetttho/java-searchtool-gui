 At 3 months old our daughter had full head control and loved to be in an upright position, so we put together the jumperoo I'd received at my baby shower and began using it.  At first, she didn't know what to do - she just hung there and after a minute or two started to cry.  But, after putting her in for a couple of minutes at a time and helping her play in it, she took to it like a fish to water.  Now she loves her jumperoo!  At 25 inches long she can reach the floor well enough to jump with the jumperoo on its lowest setting (at first she was a bit too short and her toes didn't touch the floor solidly enough for her to jump).  There are just enough toys and lights/music for her to be entertained without getting overwhelmed (when we put her in her exersaucer she quickly becomes overwhelmed by all the lights, sounds and toys around her and cries to come out).  The jumperoo has a fairly large footprint and it's cumbersome to move it from room to room in the house, but it's a small price to pay for the entertainment that she gets from it.  When she gets older, she might very well decide that she prefers a stationary exerciser with more bells and whistles, at which time she'll probably make better use of her exersaucer.  But for right now, the jumperoo is absolutely perfect for her.
