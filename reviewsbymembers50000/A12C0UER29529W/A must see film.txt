 I originally saw this film in our local theater and left singing its praises.  I recommended Rabbit Proof Fence to every friend I have, and I think the DVD does a worthy job of bringing the film to the small screen.  In addition to the film itself, the DVD has only a few special features.  The most moving by far was the behind-the-scenes documentary.  At one point, they show how filming the scenes of the girls being ripped away from their mothers affected the entire cast and crew.  Clearly, this film didn't only touch its audience but everyone involved in making it.  See the movie; buy the DVD.  It's a must-have for anyone whose collection includes thoughtful, thought-provoking works.
