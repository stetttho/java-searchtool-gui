 Tom is a mischevious young boy who takes only ONE...TWO...THREE seconds to decide what to do with a can of red paint: paint the entire living room, including the walls, floor, furniture and even the family cat!  It takes Mom ten seconds to explode, and the two of them three weeks to fix Tom's mess.  The story ends in classic "round" fashion, with Tom finding a can of - you guessed it - blue paint.  The bold line drawings in bright colors are lots of fun and the perfect complement to the text.  The book lends itself to an over-the-top dramatic reading, especially sections like Mom freaking out upon finding her entire room painted red.  Kids can join in on the "countdown" sections, and it's a good opportunity to talk about both numbers and time.  Yes, Tom is completely unrepentant and we all have the sneaking suspicion that the can of blue paint will be put to similar use as the can of red before it, but that's part of the fun of the book.  While this isn't what I would consider a classic in the vein of Dr Seuss, it's a very good read nonetheless.
