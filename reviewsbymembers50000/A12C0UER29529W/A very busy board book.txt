 This lovely little story incorporates many of the best things in children's literature.  It is educational (teaching animals and their sounds), it involves repetition of a key line (about how busy the spider is) and it even has a touch-and-feel aspect (the spider web is done in 3-D relief).  Highly recommended for the pre-reader set!
