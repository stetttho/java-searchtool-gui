 I bought this toy to hang from my infant daughter's car seat the day after she screamed nonstop in that seat while we were eating in a restaurant.  I really like the assortment of hanging toys.  The turtle has a mirror in the belly, the snail is a rattle and the butterfly is filled with colorful beads to shake.  I also like that I can hang the toy from the car seat handle in two ways - one to keep the hanging toys up high and spread out, the other to keep them hanging lower and group close together.  But, my favorite feature is the car-window hanger.  I might be tempted to keep the car seat handle up while we're driving so my baby could look at the toy (which would be a safety hazard), but having the suction cup on the window lets me move the toy off the car seat but still let my baby play with it while we're driving.  A great design and a great toy!
