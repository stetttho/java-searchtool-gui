 I am a spinner, weaver, knitter and crocheter, but I've done very little (intentional) felting...until now!  This book starts off with a very brief chapter on machine felting (taking a knitted or crocheted piece of fabric and shrinking it into felt using the washing machine), but then moves quickly on to traditional felting techniques using loose fiber.  Projects are grouped into chapters by felting technique, beginning with the easiest (making flat felt pieces like table runners and rugs) and ending with three-dimensional, seamless felting (hats, jackets, bags, etc).  At all stages, the learning of a technique is emphasized over blindly following a pattern.  Even though many patterns are included for each technique, variations are suggested and experimentation is encouraged.  Just paging through this book is inspirational.  The photography is lush, the projects themselves are comfy yet luxurious (such as a silk-lined, felted child's jacket made without a single seam), and best of all, none of the projects or techniques are the least intimidating.  Very highly recommended!
