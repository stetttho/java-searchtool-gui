 I really like Pampers wipes in general.  They are nicely moist and soft, and the tub they come in is the best on the market.  However, I didn't really find a difference between this wipe and the unscented aloe Pampers wipe.  As far as I'm concerned, it's not worth spending the extra money on these unless your baby is having a bad reaction to regular wipes and you think this hypoallergenic version might help.
