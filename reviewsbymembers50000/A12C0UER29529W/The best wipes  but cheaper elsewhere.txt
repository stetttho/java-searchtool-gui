 Of all the wipes I've tried, I like Pampers best. They are nicely moist and soft to the touch, plus the 80-count tub is the best-quality wipes box out there (save it when it's empty and keep refilling).  However, $24 for 800 wipes isn't such a great price; I can get 400-count refills at the local grocery store for $9.99.  Shop around a bit for a bargain, but definitely stick with Pampers wipes.
