 I'm a fan of Graco products in general, and this monitor does not disappoint.  The base is very sensitive, so it transmits even the smallest sounds from your baby's room.  The dual receivers work even when on different floors from the transmitter - in our 3-level, 2,400 sq ft house there's no spot I've found that doesn't get reception.  Best of all, the frequency doesn't cross our phones, computer network or any of our other electronics.  Highly recommended!!
