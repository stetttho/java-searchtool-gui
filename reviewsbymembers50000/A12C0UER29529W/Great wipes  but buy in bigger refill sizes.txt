 Of all the wipes I've tried, I like Pampers best.  They are nicely moist and soft to the touch, plus the 80-count tub is the best-quality wipes box out there (save it when it's empty and keep refilling).  The refills are packaged in 80-100 count (depending upon the total count of the refill package), individually sealed plastic bags.  One bag of wipes fits in the 80-count tub, while the other bags stay sealed until you're ready for them.  Since you don't have to worry about wipes drying out before you use them, buy the largest size refill you can to save money and time.
