 I made the mistake of having my daughter wear Luvs during a fancy party in her honor.  Well, they leaked HORRIBLY and ruined her party outfit.  I've never had this kind of problem with Pampers, although we do get the occasional leak, especially at the waistband.  I've found that a better choice than Pampers Baby-Dry is Pampers Swaddlers, with elastic all the way around the waist in addition to around the legs.  Still, if leaks at the waist aren't much of an issue for your little one, the Baby-Dry Pampers will do fine.
