 This is the ONLY cleaner that gets my shower truly clean.  I tried soft scrubs and other spray cleaners, but they just couldn't get the soap scum out of the textured shower floor.  This even does a good job of cleaning the residue off the glass shower door.  For such a strong cleaner, the smell is surprisingly mild - a rather perfumey scent rather than the awful ammonia or bleach smell of some of the cleaners out there.  Even though this is a bit pricier than the competition, it's worth it because it really works!
