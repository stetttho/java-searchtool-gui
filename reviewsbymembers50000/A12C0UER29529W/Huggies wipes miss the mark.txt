 I'm a fan of Huggies diapers, but their wipes are a different story.  On the plus side, they are thick.  However, they're not very soft - in fact, I find them fairly rough.  They also aren't as moist as other wipes I've tried.  Worst of all, though, is how hard they are to pull apart.  These non-popup wipes tend to clump together and pull out in a lump of 5-10 wipes at a time - definitely NOT what I want when I'm holding a squirming baby on the changing table and trying to clean up a mess quickly at the same time.  Once I use up the two packages I bought on sale, I'm going back to Pampers wipes.
