 There's no real storyline in The Rainbow Fish Playtime Sticker Storybook; the "plot," thin as it is, is mainly an excuse for the reader to attach a variety of sea creature stickers to the pages of the book.  Basically, Rainbow Fish swims around the ocean playing with all his friends.  The reader needs to identify the correct sea creatures from the assortment of stickers included with the book and stick them on the appropriate pages.  That in and of itself can make for a nice enough activity, although once that's completed the book might easily be shelved instead of being read over and over again.  I bought this book at a dollar store, and it was well worth the price; however, I'd think twice before paying much more than that.
