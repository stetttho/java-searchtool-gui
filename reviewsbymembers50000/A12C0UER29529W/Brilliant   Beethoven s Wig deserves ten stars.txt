 What a refreshing change from the typical classical music collections aimed at kids!  Beethoven's Wig actually gives kids and their parents something to sing along to while listening to great works by Beethoven, Bach, Mozart and others.  The catchy lyrics give information about either the composer, the piece's title/theme or both, but without being dull or "preachy."  Having the instrumental-only versions of the songs in the second half of the CD gives everyone the opportunity to just listen or try to remember the words from the first half and sing.  Either way, Beethoven's Wig is a joyous experience for kids of all ages.
