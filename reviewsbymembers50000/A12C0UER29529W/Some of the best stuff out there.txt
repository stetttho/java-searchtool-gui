 A friend bought this for herself but accidentally left it in my car.  One day when I was out of my own hand cream, I decided to give this a try and I was hooked!  It's very thick but it doesn't go on greasy - it really absorbs into the skin.  While I think it's a bit too heavy for overall body use, I use it on my hands every day, and several times a day during the winter.  Keep a tube in your purse for those cold, hand-chapping months.
