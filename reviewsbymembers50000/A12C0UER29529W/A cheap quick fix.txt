 I wanted a lightweight, compact vacuum to use every evening after dinner on the kitchen floor.  Our regular vac was too bulky to pull out for quick jobs, and we didn't have a spot to charge a cordless.  I settled on the Featherweight because it was small enough to hang from my mop rack and only cost $20.  This vac is ideal for picking up dust and pet hair on wood or tile floors.  However, I've found that with larger, heavier items (such as spilled dog food), the vac often has to be lifted up over the item and placed right down on top of it in order to pick it up; if I just push the vacuum over dog food, it often just pushes the dog food in front of the vacuum head instead of sucking it up.  Removing the vac head and using this as a hand vac works much better for picking up dog food and the like.  I've also found that items about the size of a marble (again, spilled dog food) get jammed right behind the plastic shield covering the intake opening of the vac.  To remove them I need to jam a stick back there, loosen the item and then pry it out.  This is a pain in the neck that I really don't need.    Finally, there's no way to clean the dust off the filter without using your bare hands; this vac really needed just a tiny brush that attached to the unit to make dusting off the filter easier and neater.  As it is, after every use I need to pull clumps of dog fur off the filter with my bare fingers - yuck!  I think that once this breaks (as I'm sure it will - it's made of quite junky plastic and doesn't seem all that durable) I'll go out and spend a bit more money on a higher quality stick vac.  However, for $20 this little cheapie picks up the messes and doesn't take up too much space.
