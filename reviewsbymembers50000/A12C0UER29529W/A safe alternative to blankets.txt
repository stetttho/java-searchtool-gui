 With SIDS to worry about, I really do sleep more soundly at night knowing that my baby is warm but not at risk of being smothered by a loose blanket. The bottom-to-top zipper really is convenient for diaper changes, and while the sleepsack did shrink somewhat in the wash, that really hasn't affected its fit on our baby. We went from a fleece sleepsack (infant size) to a cotton one (medium) when the weather started getting warm. Our baby is big (14 lbs and 25 inches at 12 weeks), so we got a medium (one size larger than recommended) hoping it would fit all summer. We shouldn't have worried. The sizes are very generous, but even a very big sleepsack works - there's enough room to grow into without being loose enough at the arm- or neckholes to cause tangling or a smothering hazard. It's perfect for summer nights that are just cool enough that we want to be sure that the baby's feet and legs stay covered, even if her nightgown rides up.  Overall, I wouldn't trade the sleepsack for a regular blanket, and I highly recommend it to all parents of infants.
