 After years of cutting my legs with dollar-store razors, I finally decided to treat myself to a decent razor. I picked the Intuition because I really liked the idea of having the soap and shaver in one.  The main "pro" of this razor is that, in my opinion, it gives a good, close shave. I also like that it glides along the leg very smoothly. I've nicked myself occasionally at the ankle and knee, though - go carefully in those spots.  Now for the cons. The soap wears down very quickly and unevenly. The soap completely surrounds the blades, but since I shave only in one direction (using the sharp side of the blades, as I believe most people do), the soap on that side wears down much faster that the soap on the other side. In fact, having soap on the dull side of the blade is pretty useless unless you want to wipe your leg with the soap first and then shave, which defeats the purpose of having a "single step" product. I've even had one soap bar pop off the razor completely after only a couple of uses, and there was no way to reattach it - there went one very expensive refill!  And yes, the refills are EXPENSIVE! Way overpriced, if you ask me, especially since they don't last very long.  I find that the average refill lasts in good condition (with soap on the sharp side of the blades) for maybe 6 uses; after that, the only soap is left on the dull side of the blades, where it doesn't do any good (what genius is responsible for that bit of designing??). I usually use the razor anyway until all the soap is gone - maybe a dozen shaves total, only half of which are as they should be. Poor value for the money there.  While the razor itself has some good points, the refills are too expensive for what you get. Think carefully before investing in this system.
