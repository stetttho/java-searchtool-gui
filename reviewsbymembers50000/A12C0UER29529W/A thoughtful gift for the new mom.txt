 I have been a huge fan of Willow Tree figurines ever since I purchased one for a friend as a wedding gift.  These simple figures have the look of real carved wood, and are solid and heavy for their size.  The detail is kept to a deliberate minimum, but a tremendous amount of emotion comes through in each piece nonetheless.  Prices for Willow Tree pieces are always reasonable - you get a lot for what you pay.  I received this figurine, Angel of Mine, as a gift for my first Mother's Day, and I absolutely love it.  If you're looking for a gift for the new mom in your life, this one is a winner.
