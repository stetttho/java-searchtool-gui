 I teach English as a Second Language to college-bound adults, and I'm always looking for reading materials that are both engaging and educational.  This book fits the bill perfectly.  The subject matter - rising affluence - is one that everyone can relate to, no matter what their age or nationality.  The book's premise - that rising affluence is a disease that must be cured - is thought-provoking to say the least, especially since it flies in the face of the current wisdom that economic growth is the benchmark of a healthy society.  The authors support their claims with numerous facts and statistics, but this never reads like a textbook; the consistent use of humor will hold the interest of nearly any reader.  The fact that this book is based on a PBS documentary (available on VHS) is a definite bonus.  Teachers might be interested to know that there is a whole set of free, supplementary lesson plans for Affluenza the video on the PBS website.  Whether you read this book for pleasure or as an educator with an eye towards classroom use, Affluenza is a highly readable analysis of a phenomenon that is affecting not only Americans, but people the world over.
