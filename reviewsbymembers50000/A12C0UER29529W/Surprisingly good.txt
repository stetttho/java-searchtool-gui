 When the blurb about this DVD says it has an all-star cast, it's not kidding.  Each of these short vignettes has not one but several bona fide stars, from Cate Blanchette as a young woman coming unglued over dinner to James Gandolfini as a man waking up from a drunken stupor to find that his wife has left him and, quite literally, taken EVERYTHING.  I have to admit that I didn't expect much at all from this DVD, in part because I'd never heard of it and in part because it came from the bottom of the bargain bin at Wal-Mart.  However, it really is surprisingly good.  The vignettes themselves are a bit uneven - my favorites were "Standing Room Only" (a wordless, nearly slapstick piece starring Hugh Jackman) and "Euston Road" (a short and clever tale of a down-on-his-luck gambler who isn't quite what he seems).  Even if there are only a few of the pieces that you really, really enjoy, for the $5 used DVD price, you can't go wrong.  Give Stories of Lost Souls a try.
