 I brought this with me to the hospital and am so glad I did.  Right from the beginning I used it to nurse my newborn.  All the lactation consultants on staff applauded my choice of breastfeeding pillow.  The fact that it straps onto my body makes it very secure - I can actually walk with my baby still nursing  (holding both the baby and the pillow for safety).  I have the new model with the clip instead of velcro, so I haven't had the noise problems that others have had.  I also find I'm pretty maneuverable in the pillow, so I don't have to take it off to lay my baby down in the cradle or bouncy seat after a feeding.  I've machine washed and dried the removable cover with no shrinkage problems.  Overall, this is one of the most useful items I have for my baby, and I recommend it with no reservations.
