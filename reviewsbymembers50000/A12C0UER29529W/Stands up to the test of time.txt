 As a girl growing up in the pre-VCR/DVD days, I remember my dad staying up late at night to watch Gunga Din every time it made an appearance on TV.  It was his favorite movie, and it's easy to see why.  It's not at all politically correct, but the three stars - Douglas Fairbanks Jr, Cary Grant and Victor McLaglen - make this a truly fun-filled action adventure.  While there are quite a few elements that are dated (the snake pit with visible wires moving the rubber snakes; the cavalier portrayal of war), the sense of fun of this movie is still completely intact.  This DVD does a good job of adding special features, especially the behind-the-scenes documentary.  As a bonus, there are a few restored scenes in the film itself.  These scenes - depicting Rudyard Kipling as a young journalist traveling with the colonial army in India - were deleted even from the theatrical release of the film in 1939, so seeing them for the first time was a real treat.  If you're a fan of adventure movies of the 30's and 40's, don't hesitate to add Gunga Din to your collection.
