 Our little one is just under three months old now and is getting more and more interested in this rattle.  The ribbed rods are perfect for her to grab with her little hands, and the large openings allow her to safely put her whole arm through the toy to "wear" it.  She's fascinated by the bright colors and sharp rattling sound that the beads make - I can distract her from fussing by shaking it in front of her eyes.  She's also starting to mouth the toy and even though it's hard plastic it doesn't seem to bother her in the least.  All in all, this is a great value for $10!
