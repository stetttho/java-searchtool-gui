 We received this as a gift and found that the perfect spot for it was in the bathroom.  We enjoy opening it at random and reading the interesting, funny or just plain unbelievable bits of trivia that it contains.  This lighthearted collection of facts isn't designed to do anything more than amuse its readers, and if you expect that from the beginning you should enjoy it immensely.    While this little volume is entertaining, it also isn't something I'd recommend spending any significant amount of money on for yourself.  Buy it new as a gift for the colleague whose baby shower you were invited to - it's much more clever and original than yet another pack of onesies or layette set - or pick it up used for yourself and enjoy.
