 My husband suffers from exteremely sensitive skin.  He will periodically break out in itchy rashes that nothing really seems to help.  However, since he's been drinking George's aloe daily, his skin has really improved.  The rashes are much milder than before, and the best part is they're much less itchy.  George's looks, tastes and even has the "mouth-feel" of water, so it's refreshing and pleasant to drink.  Highly recommended for anyone with skin problems!
