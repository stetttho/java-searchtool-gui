 Our daughter was born at the beginning of April, while it was still fairly cold out.  We used the Bundle Me Lite from the day we took her home, and we still use it on her carseat now, nearly four monts later.  During winter, we simply tucked an additional blanket over our daughter; in the height of summer, we rolled the cover under our daughter's feet.  Having it on the carseat all year means we're never without some sort of cover for our girl - especially when going from outdoor summer heat to indoor air conditioning.  I've had no problems with shrinkage or falling apart in the wash.  Overall, this is one of the most versatile and useful products we own, and I highly recommend it.
