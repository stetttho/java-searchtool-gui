 These are my absolute favorite receiving blankets.  They are very soft and stay that way even after many washes.  They are large enough to swaddle my 11+ pound one month old with room to spare.  They are also big enough for me to lay one end under my baby's head as she nurses and still have enough left to wrap around her body - like having a burp cloth and blanket in one.  I've even used these as impromptu coverups for nursing in public.  Even after much use and many washings these blankets still look and feel as good as new.  At less than $4 per blanket it's worth getting enough to keep a supply both at home and in the diaper bag for travel.
