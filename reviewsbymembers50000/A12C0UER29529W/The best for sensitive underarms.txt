 It's nice when the best product on the market is also made by a socially responsible company.  Tom's of Maine donates 10% of their pre-tax profits to non-profit organizations that support everything from environmental protection to childhood health and wellness.  That's part of why I don't mind paying a bit more for their products.  The other reason, of course, is that Tom's products work.  Their deodorant is the only kind that doesn't make my husband's sensitive skin break out in a rash.  While the "unscented" deodorant does have a slight odor, it's light and pleasant, not the overpowering perfumey smell you get with most other deodorants.  Be warned: It does take a little time to dry, so don't go putting your shirt on right after application or it might leak through.  Overall, Tom's deodorant is a huge hit in our house!
