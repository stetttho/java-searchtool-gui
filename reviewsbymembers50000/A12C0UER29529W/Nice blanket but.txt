 I registered for this blanket based on its excellent reviews and was delighted to receive it as a gift.  It is incredibly soft and comfortable, plus the sage color is just lovely.  My big complaint is that it holds a lot of static electricity - it always gives me little shocks when I touch it, and I'm sure my baby has gotten zapped, too.  I'm hoping that time and lots of fabric softener/dryer sheets will help.
