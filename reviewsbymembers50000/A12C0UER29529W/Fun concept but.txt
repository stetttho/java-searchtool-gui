 Okay, who wouldn't want to pick up a children's book and win a fortune?  It's the ultimate fairy tale come to life.  Conceptually, then, this book is a winner.  However, if you're looking for a good story to go along with the treasure hunt, you'll have to look elsewhere.  Other reviewers have complained about the book's clunky prose and poor editing.  For my part, I was most annoyed by the abrupt and amateurish literary device used to avoid out-and-out telling the reader where the treasures were located.  It reminded me of a humorous essay in which a veteran writer explains to novices that when he is unsure of how to end a novel, he solves the problem by writing "Suddenly, everyone was run over by a truck.  The End."  Bottom line: Don't expect an enduring work of children's literature -- or even a book worth re-reading (save for the treasure hunt part) -- and you won't be disappointed.
