 I really love the convenience of the Playtex Premium system with Drop-Ins liners.  I can pump directly into the liners, seal them up and then just pop them into a bottle at feeding time.  The bottles themselves have slow-flow nipples, which I find are very easy for my baby to nurse from.  However, this is definitely a "starter" set, and anyone who wants to use this system for all their bottle needs will have to make several additional purchases.  First of all, only one of the four bottles in the set (an eight ounce bottle) has the slide at the bottom to squeeze the air out of the liners.  Even with the short four-ounce bottles, when the liner gets up toward the top I couldn't get my fingers in far enough to squeeze out the air that had accumulated inside.  So, I would recommend buying a couple of more of the bottles with the slide to make it easier to squeeze air out of the liners.  Also, there are only two storage caps included in the starter set - you will definitely need more to amass any sort of milk supply.  These have to be bought in "kits" with Drop-Ins liners (but you'll need extra liners anyway as they're disposable, so that won't go to waste).  However, in every kit there's also a breast pump adaptor included.  This seems like a waste to me since you don't really need more than two of those.  I would like to be able to buy the storage caps separately.  Otherwise, though, this really is a nice way to see whether this system will work for you without investing a lot of money up front but still getting a little bit of everything you would need.
