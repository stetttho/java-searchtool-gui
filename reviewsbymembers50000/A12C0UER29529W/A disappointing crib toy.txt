 I was given this toy at my baby shower by a relative with young children.  I assumed her kids liked this toy and that's why she'd given us one (I hadn't requested it on our registry).  Unfortunately, our baby has never been interested in this toy.  I'm rather surprised because her Leap Frog Learning Seat is one of her absolute favorite things.  However, I can understand why she's not interested in the Dreamscapes Soother.  Personally, I don't find that there's much to look at - the flat lighted pictures that spin around are nothing compared to the three-dimensional, moving fish and real bubbles in the Ocean Wonders Aquarium (my daughter's very favorite crib toy).  Moreover, the sound of the pictures moving is VERY loud.  When we first used this toy (at night), my husband and I wondered if it was broken - that's how loud and grating the sound was.  We figured out, however, that it's simply the noise of the pictures turning.  Unfortunately, to cover up that horrible noise, we found we had to turn the volume up way too loud for sleeping purposes.  Overall, I wish I'd kept the box because I am so dissatisfied with this toy that I would return it if I could.
