 When my daughter was born, a relative and I wound up reminiscing about this album and how much we both loved it growing up.  Next thing I knew, a copy of the DVD arrived as a gift for my daughter and me.  The first time I sat down and watched, it brought back all my memories of being a little girl in the 70's.  I could even still sing along with the title song!  Right now, my daughter is too young to do much except listen as I sing or play music for her, but I hope she grows up enjoying these songs as much as I did.  Yes, the visuals are dated, but I believe the messages of these songs are as pertinent now as they were thirty years ago.  Best of all, the songs get their messages across without being "preachy."  I think this is a fabulous alternative to much of what's out there for kids today, and dated as some elements may be, "Free to Be You and Me" is still a long, long way from going out of style.
