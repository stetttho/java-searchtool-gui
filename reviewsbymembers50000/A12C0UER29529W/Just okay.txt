 My daughter was given an autographed copy of this book as a gift.  As far as I'm concerned, the autograph is the best part of the book.  The book tries to show the benefits of cooperation and sharing.  However, the story itself is trite and predictable.  Three friends encounter a rabbit trying in vain to dig up a giant carrot and keep it all for himself.  The three are kind and helpful, even as the rabbit is greedy and unfriendly.  Of course, by the end of the story the carrot is dug up and the rabbit has seen the error of his ways.  There are no surprises here, and even the language is uninspired and dull.  On the plus side, the illustrations are colorful and playful.    Children who are familiar with these characters from TV might react better to this book.  For kids like mine who don't know these characters already, don't bother trying to introduce them through this book.
