 We received these bodysuits in both 0-3 and 3-6 month sizes.  My daughter is pretty big (95th percentile in size) and the 0-3 month size really did fit her until she was about 3 months old. At almost 15 lbs now she wears the 3-6 month sizes and has plenty of room to grow in them.  The cloth in this particular set isn't as thick as in some other Carter's bodysuits.  On the one hand, it makes them more susceptible to rips; on the other, they're great for hot summer wear.  It's worth having at least one set.
