 When I received my copy of Moments of Union, I thought I would glance through it and save it for a rainy day. But no, once I opened it, I could not lay it down. Every painting had a gift of vivid colors and patterns. Gradually, my mind surrendered to something within that was far deeper. Hours later when I closed the book, I felt whole, as if all the parts of my being had joined together in this extraordinary shower of colors dancing freely across the pages. Next, I went through each page a second time to intellectually grasp why these paintings are so fulfilling and how Kramer's use of colors could stimulate such a sense of joy! Instead, I selected 15 favorites, the ones I would love to frame if I ever have the temerity to cut them out.  I highly recommend evenings with this book to bring back an inner balance of heart, mind, and soul.
