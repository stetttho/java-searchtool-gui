 I like this book very much. Dr. Laskow embraces an incredibly wide spectrum of healing methods the reader can practice at home. Here is a man who delivered 1000 babies before he was 35 years old, then decided to devote his remaining years to empower patients to heal themselves and to help others do the same.   L. Lawkow demonstrates his role as a teacher of consciousness-based healing. He presents new contemporary healing techniques, includes more than 20 excercises, and an appendix with the scientific basis for healing with subtle energies by Dr. Glen Rein,   As the author of Healing Yourself with Light, I found it joyful to see how interwoven our healing books are even though we had nor met while writing them. Healing with light and with love is surely the best possible combination for success!
