 Sandy Goldberg reveals the Treasure beneath loss--the loss of her infant daughter! This treasure is the renewed companionship of the soul, bringing solace, peace, and the awakening of "who you really are". Sandy  takes the reader out of the grief that causes bitterness and anger and  introduces the healing guidance of the soul which awakens one's true life  purpose. The story of Talia's birth and death (before the birth  announcements were mailed) is a true story, poignant in its heart-wrenching  details, inspiring in its deeper message. Highly recommended for anyone who  is going through or has experienced this kind of loss.  Thank you, Sandy  Goldberg, for your shared wisdom and compassion for all parents who have or  will endure such a loss, and for your revelations of the Treasure lying  beneath this experience.
