 Peter Ferrucci enriches Roberto Assagioli's Psychosynthesis and gives many gentle step-by-step guided journeys and meditations that assist the reader to experience the vast love and unlimited knowledge of the soul.  In this classic book Mr. Ferruci reveals his highly creative artistry with words that inspire. Using his excellence as a trained psychologist and spiritual leader, he has produced a very fine synthesis of transforming one's personality through spiritual contact. I wholeheartedly recommend this book to anyone who is awakening to the spiritual world.
