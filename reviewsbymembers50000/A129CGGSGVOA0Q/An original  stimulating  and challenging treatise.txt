 Michael Robbins is one of those rare living authors whose extraordinary intelligence and creativity is equaled by his brain/mind/soul alignment. He is one of the best contemporary authorities on the Ageless Wisdom as presented in Alice Bailey's books, in Theosophy, and in the Agni Yoga series. But  Infinitization of Selfhood is not a review of these books; it is the culmination of Robbins' mental/spiritual reach into the cosmos, backed by his broad background of esoteric knowledge. Robbins' earlier book, Tapestry of the Gods, is a very different book, interpreting on a practical note, the effect of the Seven Rays as presented by Bailey, upon the human personality and soul.  Infinitization of Selfhood also expresses the spiritual impressions that have come to Robbins in deep contemplation. After 600 pages of original discussions on the possibilities and inherent problems involved with the idea of Infinitude, Robbins presents 22 original meditative exercises "to help induce Radical Infinitist Realizations." The meditator is encouraged to enter deeply into the process of unveiling the "Self-as-SELF-the HEART OF REAL IDENTITY." Next are 24 original mantras to facilitate the embodiment of the SELF. Section VII is a clear 235-page glossary of Radical Infinitism, complete with practical examples-a tremendous help for the reader.  One might wonder how on earth one author could encompass so grand a subject and not get lost on the way. But Robbins has a brilliant mind and an uncanny ability to express in words the essence of any subject he approaches. For those who enjoy the mental/spiritual grasp (and challenge) of some of our best contemporary  author/philosophers, I highly recommend the Infinitization of Selfhood. It provides a rare opportunity for the esotericist to glimpse and possibly to enter some of the sacred spaces of the cosmos.
