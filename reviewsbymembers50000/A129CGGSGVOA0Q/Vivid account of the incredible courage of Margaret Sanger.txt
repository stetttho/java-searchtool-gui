 Miriam Reed's biography of Margaret Sanger is a book that is hard to lay aside until the last page and hard to forget. Reed details the most dramatic episodes of Margaret Sanger which are enriched by private papers from Sanger's family. How I would love to see author/actress Reed on stage in a monologue as Margaret Sanger! This is an honest and inspiring biography of a woman who literally changed the attitude of the world toward planning a family, inspired research, and established centers. Perhaps this book could help clear up the emotional reactions of current religious and political forces against planned births.  Reed presents Margaret Sanger's life in "her own words" using letters and other papers revealing the passion with which Sanger attempted to give birth control information to desperate American wives and mothers. Such mothers as those who had up to 15 children, half of whom were still living, begged Mrs. Sanger for help. M. Sanger was sent to prison over and over for demanding the right to discuss birth control at a time when the Dutch had had birth control clinics for 30 years and the French enjoyed the most modern birth control methods. I highly recommend this biography for anyone who is even vaguely aware of the pathetic situation of thousands upon thousands of home abortions so common before Sanger's work, many of which resulted in death. This practice is still widespread in countries without the funds for planned parenthood clinics.
