 Irina Tweedie's diary of her experiences with her Sufi Master and Teacher lifts us beyond any one religious viewpoint, beyond set ideas about enlightenment, and catapults us into realizing what a one-pointed focus and continual surrender it takes to become a spiritual master. Mrs. Tweedie's disarming humility and intimate experiences during her years of training in India with her Sufi Master will expand the mind and heart of virtually anyone who is interested in a spiritual life. She is the first Western woman to be trained in this ancient yogic lineage.  This detailed diary spans five years of the agonies, resistance, fright, and doubt that Mrs. Tweedie went through as she gradually opened to the love that surpasses all understanding. Daughter of Fire was such a catalyst for me that I spent several weeks listening and talking to Mrs. Tweedie in London. The author is a living demonstration of the rare synthesis of Spiritual Truth and Spiritual Love.   Daughter of Fire sits close to my meditation chair where I frequently open it to catch another wave of the wisdom and love that radiate from its pages. I expect to keep reading it for the rest of my life. What a rare opportunity to recognize and begin to dissolve the resistance of our own personalities to spiritual direction-and to release this all- too-familiar barrier to our spiritual illumination. I wholeheartedly recommend this rare and beautiful book of wisdom and spiritual understanding. I consider it one of the greatest of all contemporary spiritual literature.
