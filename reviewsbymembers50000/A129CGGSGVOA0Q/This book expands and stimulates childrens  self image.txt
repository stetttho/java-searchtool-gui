 This is one of my favorite books for children. The script is original, the illustrations are brightly colored and fun. I love this book's ingenious ways of building strong self-esteem and a deeper caring for others. I have sent 12 copies to my grandchildren. They have read it so many times the pages are lovingly dog-eared.  I highly recommend this book for its positive message, its beautiful illustrations, and its friendly happy tone!
