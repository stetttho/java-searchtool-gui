 This is one of the most clear, understandable explanations of how  homeopathy works that I have ever read. It just simply makes sense! Dr.  Johnston's analogies and metaphors on the amazing healing process of  homeopathy are really helpful.  The book takes the confusion out of all  the contradictory things I had heard about homeopathy. I never understood  before why this system can cure conditions that conventional medicine can't  help, and now I see how this is possible. It is so reassuring to know that  Linda Johnston, coming from a conventional medical background, has so  actively embraced the homeopathic medical system and shared her knowledge  with us. This book gives the readers a sound hope and confidence that  they can get better! I strongly recommend this book. Anyone can benefit  from reading it!
