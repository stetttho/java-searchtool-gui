 Here is a jewel of a book that takes the wisdom of the ages and puts it  into terms that fit our contemporary mind and culture. Soul Love lifts you  out of ordinary human love into a finer frequency of love--one that is wise  as well as compassionate. This Love that streams forth from the soul is a  living presence of wisdom and intelligence.  The author shows you how to  look at yourself through the soul's eyes and see the beauty of your being.  You practice lifting the love from your solar plexus to your heart center  so that your love can be transformed. Gradually, you realize that you are  connecting with the universal Presence of Love.   Straightforward  step-by-step practices help you to make these transformations that change  your everyday experiences. As you work with these goals, you can join in a  call to the Great Ones and ask for love to be sent to awaken the heart  center of humanity! Soul Love is an invitation to make profound shifts in  your life, in your relationships, and the way you think. It is for everyone  who is ready to do the inner work it takes to create a magnetic life.  I  highly recommend this book to those of you who feel an inner call to bring  soul love into your life and become a shining light for others--an  invitation that few could refuse!
