 Seeing God Face to Face weaves together the great truths of what it really means to be a member of the human race; it focuses on the Universe that each of us reflects, and on our source of "One." With liberal quotations from great thinkers and spiritual leaders through the ages, the author demonstrates the power of an inclusive approach to solve our fears.   Bedrij includes the scientific-experimental method, which is "constant, invariable, and not subject to change" to help reveal the experience of God. He shows that the "unchanging architecture that encodes the deepest secrets of the universe" is like the field of potential action; he reveals how our scientists' focus on that which is invariable, is revealing the hidden world of unity, wisdom and love, "the Unchanging Heart and Mind of God." The architecture of the unchanging software being revealed is opening the cosmic code of the spirit of God.  Even though the author is a physicist, he integrates the teachings of humanity's great saviors, the Christ and the Buddha with the genius of scientists and spiritual leaders of various religions. From Satya Sai Baba, Edward Carpenter, and Albert Einstein to Lao Tzu, Patanjali, Pagels, Rumi, Saint Teresa de Avila, and Abdullah Yusuf Ali, we follow the golden path they weave for all of us to see God face to face.   This is a powerful book that highlights our individual divinity and reveals the "Unchanging Good" that is already at hand and rapidly moving in more solidly with the suggestion that this new state of awareness of our infinity may come sooner (much sooner) than we imagine.   I highly recommend reading this book slowly so that the illumination of its profound message can penetrate the deepest area of the mind and heart.
