 I bought this book at a garage sale and read the first few chapters and skimmed through the rest.  This book is well written and has an interesting message, but it has all been done before.  In modern days, it is hard to find a truly original political book.  Despite the fact that Dick Cheney may possibly be the most boring man in America, his book does have some value, but I would only recommend it for true political history lovers, don't buy it on a whim like I did!
