 While this may not be the most all-encompassing biography of Washington yet, it does present a clear portrait of the man and his surroundings.  Ellis tries to show Washington as a man more than an icon or monument, which has long been the misunderstanding thanks to 1950s biography "Man and Monument." Ellis focuses on debunking Washington myths, proving that Washington was rather smart in his own right, portraying Washington's peers in a different light, examining Washington's fiscal success, and adding quirky, irrelevant details which give this book its value. For example, while explaining that Washington had to make a difficult ride on horseback, Ellis throws in the fact that the ride was made difficult by a violent case of hemorrhoids. In addition, when discussing duels, Ellis does not dwell on the Burr-Hamilton duel (in fact he never mentions it. Ever.)  Instead, he tells of a man who shot another man in the mouth for libelling George Washington.  While this book does not cover Washington's entire life, it does an excellent job of covering Ellis's main points.  Though it may not win a Pulitzer or the National Book Award, it does make great reading and gives even more to posterity's image of one great American.
