 This book by Daniel Handler is remarkable.  It is a collection of interrelated stories about love, mostly. Though it is about romance, it is certainly not light romantic fiction.  There is much more than that.  An adverb classifies each chapter (i.e. Obviously, Collectively).  There are many characters that pop in and out, with no real main character. Within the novel, many characters are seen with different lovers, and they react to seeing their exlovers with new lovers whom they may know from somewhere else. It is a complex portrait of many different romances and how they form from a boy admiring an older boyfriend of his sister's in the locker room to a British chain-smoking novelist worrying that her boyfriend is with her ex when he's really away on business. This book is incredibly sad at time, sexy at time, and very funny at times. Though it may seem light at times, it does touch on very deep topics, which Handler treats with wisdom and creativity. It will keep you reading long into the night and is at a manageable length.  The problems I have with it are that the characters are very numerous and they pop up at different times in different contexts, so that they have the same names as characters previously mentioned in the book, but the reader is left in the dark as to whether or not they are actually the same people as before.  Handler would probably answer that we shouldn't focus on who's doing the action, but how it's done. That, my friends, is the reason for the title.  Adverbs describe how things are done, and that's what this brilliant little novel is about.
