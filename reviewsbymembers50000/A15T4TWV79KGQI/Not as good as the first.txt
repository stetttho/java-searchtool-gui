 This movie is definitely not as good as the first Caddyshack film, but it still holds its own.  It is a pretty funny movie and some of the reviewers were too harsh. They just don't face the facts: It's not the first Caddyshack, that's why it's not good.  It's hard to improve on a American Comedy Classic like Caddyshack.  This is a still a good movie, even though it isn't as good as the original.  Fans of the series should enjoy it!
