 This movie was not anything great.   I thought it was going to be an intense action movie, but it wasn't.  It was still enjoyable though.  A great performance by Farrell and some supporting cast.  The ten minute long sex scene was highly unnecessary, but it may be a perk for some people.  All in all, this isn't a bad movie, but it isn't an intense war movie like you may think.  It's about a lawyer in basic training who finds loopholes and gets people out of the army. Three Stars!
