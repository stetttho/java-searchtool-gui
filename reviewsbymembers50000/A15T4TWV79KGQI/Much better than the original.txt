 Although critics and reviewers alike say the original Time Machine was better, I disagree.  I think this movies special effects, music, and scenery more than make up for the acting and script.  Samantha Mumba is not a terrible actress after all.  If she keeps wearing the skimpy outfits, I'll see all her movies a few times!  This is a good movie any sci-fi lover should like!
