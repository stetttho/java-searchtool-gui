 These are some of Doyle's best Holmes stories, but the Dover Thrift Edition is cheap and cheaply made.  It provides no notes, no nothing besides the bare bones of the stories.  I have liked none of the Dover Thrift series and can barely read them, they are so cheaply made!  I made the mistake of buying 20 or so, so my mission is warning the world.  Do not buy this edition!
