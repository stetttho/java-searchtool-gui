 This is not a book of mathematic formulas or theoretical physics concepts, it is a book of short essays by Albert Einstein on life, freedom, and some aspects of science.  This book really gives us a look into the life of Albert Einstein.  Not only was he a great physicist, but he was also a great thinker and a person. This is a truly remarkable read.
