 This collection is actually not bad.  It provides some of Frost's best poems in an easy to carry book, and for a buck you can't go wrong.  This is great for first time Frost readers, but not for the experienced Frost fan.  I love Frost and carry this book and plenty other Dover poetry books in my laptop case wherever I go!
