 Michael Crichton is a terrific writer!  I consider this one of his best books, and I should know, since I've read most of them.  It has alot of Quantum mechanics in it, which many reviewers complained about, but it is not necessary to understand it to understand the plot.  It is one of Crichton's best work in my opinion!  A must read for Crichton Fans!
