 This is another great book by Al Franken, the self proclaimed comedian/politician. I read it the first day I got it and loved it.  If you liked his other books, you will love this one.  It proves that most politicians are liars and Al Franken is the only one you can trust.  I really LOVE this book.  AL FRANKEN FOR PRESIDENT!
