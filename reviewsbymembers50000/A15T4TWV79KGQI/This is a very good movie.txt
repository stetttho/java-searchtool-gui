 Dan Akroyd and Damon Wayans are the highlight of this movie.  Daniel Stern plays his typical eccentric character.  This movie is a very funny story of two fans going way too far to help their team, the Boston Celtics.  This is one of Dan Akroyd's better films.  I enjoyed it immensely and I would recommend it highly!
