 This is a great movie of friendship, comradery and ...kicking.  Filled with rock and roll coming from trumpets and modern day songs, this movie with the up and coming star Heath Ledger is a very action packed funny movie.  Four stars! I can't wait for more of Ledger's films if they are as good as this one!
