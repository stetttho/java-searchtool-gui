 This is Adam Sandler's, scratch that, THE WORST movie of all time.  It is stupid.  I bought it because it was cheap and I wish I could go back in time because it was so stupid.  I mean, it is one of the rare occasions I pretend I learned to read on AOL and say WTF?  Don't buy this or think about it!  Don't even put your mouse near the ADD TO SHOPPING CART button!
