 In this hilarious Ernest movie, Ernest P. Worrell, Class A goofball, unleashes a curse and must fight to stop a troll from turning all the children into wooden dolls.  Better than Ernest goes to Camp and Ernest saves Christmas.  I've seen it at least a dozen times and still laugh at the "Knowutimeans."  Great family fun!
