 This is an amazing little book full of tips and insight on the robot-building experience.  Also, from all the tools and soldering knowledge, you can build more than just little robots.  You can build a plethora of little electronics toys and whizbangs that are fun.  If you plan on investing about $100 in parts and tools, then this is the book for you.  Some books have you buy the kit FROM the author.  This book is not like that.  The author is simply a robot fanatic who is very skiled at what he does.  I borrowed this book from a friend and didn't want to give it back!! It is so awesome!
