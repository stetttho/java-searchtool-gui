 This is an all around great film.  Damon and Affleck are geniuses and leads me to ask the question "Why haven't they written any more movies?"  If they won an Academy Award for best screenplay on their first try, shouldn't another one be no big deal?   Damon and Williams steal the show.  Williams portray perhaps his best character, next to John Keating of the Dead Poets Society of course, but that's beside the point.  All around great film, keep the kids out of the room though!  It is rated R for language mostly!
