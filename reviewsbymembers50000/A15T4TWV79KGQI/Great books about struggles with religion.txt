 This is one of Steinbeck's more ambitious novels, with a great plot and a clear message.  It is about a man who makes pagan offerings to a tree he believes holds his father's spirit.  When torrential rains and a bad harvest come, his friend's shun him for his ways.  This is a great story about the struggle between man and religion.  It is a truly great book!
