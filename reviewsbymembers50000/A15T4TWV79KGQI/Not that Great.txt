 This is definitely a funny movie, but it is not Mel Brooks' best.  In fact, I would consider it one of his worst movies.  It is old, rather weird, and kind of boring, although it does have some funny parts, they don't make up for its faults.  I'll give it three stars just because Mel Brooks is a genius.
