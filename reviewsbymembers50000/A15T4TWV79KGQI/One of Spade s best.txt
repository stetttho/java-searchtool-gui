 This is David Spade at his best, mullett and all.  This movie is a very funny movie.  Although, as a Louisianan, I don't like how it patronizes us (we don't all have country accents and live in the bayou!)  It is still a good, funny movie, with plenty of fireworks and doggy love to keep you laughin'.  Yee haw!
