 Red Dragon received plenty of beef from the critics, but I enjoyed it immensely.  Since it made less than a hundred million in the box office, I suspect it will sadly be the last in the series.  Edward Norton is terrific in this movie.  Even though Anthony Hopkins has a small role in this film, he is still very scary and believable as Hannibal the Cannibal!  Great movie!
