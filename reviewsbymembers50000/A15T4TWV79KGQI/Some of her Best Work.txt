 This is the story of the original settlers of Pern. They land safely on Pern after a fifteen year space journey and must genetically engineer fire lizards that are large enough to be ridden, because thread is killing of their animals and settlers.  This is technically the first book in the series, although it wasn't written first.  This is McCaffrey at her best!  I have read about fifteen of her books and this is by far my favorite.
