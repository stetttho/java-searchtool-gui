 I am a big fan of Benjamin Franklin's work.  After reading Benjamin Franklin by Walter Isaacson, I eagerly seeked out more.  I bought the cheap autobiography, but it didn't have many extras.  This edition is more extra than autobiography, with 400 pages of other Franklin papers including the Silence Dogood letters of his younger years.  Throughout the book are notes and long sections written by the editor Isaacson which are quirky and intelligent like his book Benjamin Franklin: An American Life. A really great collection of Benjamin Franklin's letters and papers!  A must read for any history buff!
