 This movie is great for kids under three or amnesia victims, who don't remember what a good movie is!  This movie is terribly unfunny and grossly unrealistic.  The stunts are very impossible and fake, the acting and the jokes are crap.  The only use for this DVD would be to use the disc as a frisbee, the booklet as toilet paper, and the case for recycling. That's the only way to get your money out of it.  Don't buy this movie for any reason!  It is very boring and stupid!
