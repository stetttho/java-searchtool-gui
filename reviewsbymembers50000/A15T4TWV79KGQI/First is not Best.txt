 Even though this was Pat's first book, it is definitely not his best.  It is funny, but his more recent work shows a mastery of anecdote writing and his love of it.  I recommend How I got this Way and The Good Samaritan Strikes Again over A Fine and Pleasant Misery because they are more well written and funnier.  This is still not a bad book, McManus just has better.
