 This was the best bond parody until Austin Powers came out, but none the less, it is a great movie.  From his many luscious women in skimpy outfits to his lighter that can do over 80 different things, James Coburn as Derek Flint is one of the best ever pretend spies.  This is a truly classic spy spoof and everyone needs to see it, because it is Austin Powers' favorite movie!
