 I highly enjoyed this movie.  Some reviewers say you have to know your history, but [thats not true].  All you have to know is who the Donner Party was.  John Candy's death was unfortunate, but it did not "jinx" the movie.  I think it is one of his best.  The gay book store owner, Julian, does steal the show, however.  All in all a good movie.
