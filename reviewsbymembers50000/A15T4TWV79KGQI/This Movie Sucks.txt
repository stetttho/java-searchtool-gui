 This movie is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, next to Going Overboard starring Adam Sandler. This movie is filled with stupid physical humor that five year olds may enjoy.  It is also a British movie and alot of the jokes make no sense to me, an American.  I guess if you live in the UK or are a five year old, you should love this movie.  If you fall in the other 4 billion people category of non-British, non five year olds, this movie ain' for you, JimBob!
