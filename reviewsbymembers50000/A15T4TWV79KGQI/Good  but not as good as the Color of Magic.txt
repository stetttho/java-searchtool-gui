 This is the second book in the chronological world of Discworld and also the second book about Rincewind, Twoflower, and Luggage.  The first book leaves a cliffhanger and The Light Fantastic gets straight into it.  The idea for it is awesome, but there is no satisfaction.  No answer to how the problem is solved.  It is just solved.  It kind of leaves you saying to yourself "What Happened?" Then everyone is happy and it is over. All in all not a bad book, but read another Rincewind Novel if possible.
