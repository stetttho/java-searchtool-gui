 This is a great movie novelization unlike most.  In this case, the book is much better than the movie, which in some novelizations, is not the case at all.  The writer actually has some talent that made me want more.  When the second book came out, I bought it right away.  A very good book for any scifi action lover!   A really great read!  Five Stars!
