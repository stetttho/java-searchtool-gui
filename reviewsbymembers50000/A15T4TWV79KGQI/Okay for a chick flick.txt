 I am a guy and I watched this movie with my stepmom.  I have to tell you it was much better than most chick flicks I have seen.  This is a good movie to watch with your girlfriend, because it's actually not that bad.  It is pretty funny and doesn't have too many of those mushy, romantic moments.  I'd say it's great for a girl, but I would only tell the men to watch it with their girlfriends.  This is a man-safe movie which I even enjoyed.
