 I got this book for fifty cents at a used bookstore.  I had read a couple of other Frankin biographies and some of Franklin's writings and it looked pretty interesting.  It is a remarkably easy to read book.  I really like the way it is laid out in chronological order and there is good transition between the chapters.  With all of the crappy books in print about Benjamin Franklin, it is really a shame that this great little volume is out of print.
