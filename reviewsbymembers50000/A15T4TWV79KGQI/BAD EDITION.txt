 I am giving the Dover Thrift Edition 1 star, not the play, the play is a world classic and a masterpiece.  The edition, however, is pitiful.  I would like to know how many people were lured into buying this because it is so cheap? This would not do for any kind of performance because it provides very little, if any, notes as to what is going on in the background, what the actors should be doing, how they are feeling, details at all!  It is simply a horrible edition for anything but putting on your bookshelf to rot. Unless you never plan on reading this book, don't buy it.  PLEASE!
