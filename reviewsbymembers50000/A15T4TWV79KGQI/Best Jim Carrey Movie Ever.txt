 In past few years Carrey hasn't really blown us away like he did with Ace Ventura, until Bruce Almighty.  This is no question Jim Carrey's funniest movie.  Although it makes you laugh, you may feel like repenting afterwards.  I think any true Jim Carrey fan should order it now like I have, or suffer a lack of a laugh.
