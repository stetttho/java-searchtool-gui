 Although the name does seem redundant, this book is a great anthology. It has Kerouc and Ginsberg's work when they were younger and not yet famous. They are some of the best poets in the last 50 years now. I recommend this book for a real poetry enthusiast or someone who needs to add to their poetry library, but if you just want a taste of poetry, find something else.
