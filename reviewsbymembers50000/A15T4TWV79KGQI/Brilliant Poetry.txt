 This is a great collection of poetry from a truly amazing man.  The things he's been through in his life of over 90 years provide amazing backdrops for his poetry and breathe wonderful detail into his poetry.  I can pick up his book every day and still love it as much as the day I bought it.  If you don't take my word for it, take the Nobel Prize distributors' word for it, since he won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1980.  If you buy one book of poetry in your life, buy this book!  It is amazing and will have a great impact on your poetry and your life!
