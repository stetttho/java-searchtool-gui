 This is the hilarious sequel to the unknown movie Shangai Noon.  Why they made a sequel, I don't know, but I'm glad they did.  This movie is funny by itself, but there are many things to catch onto:  A young boy named Charlie Chaplin (famous black and white actor) befriends them and at the end head to Hollywood with them.  Then, Roy O'Bannon pretends to be a general named Sherlock Holmes.  Then, he allows his friend Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (writer of the Sherlock Holmes novels)  to use the name for a story he's going to write.  This is a great movie and one of the rare, good sequels!
