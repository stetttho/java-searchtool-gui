 This is a good book by John Steinbeck, but it is not his best work. If you have never read John Steinbeck before read Of Mice and Men or Cannery Row before this.  If you read this book, you may not want to read any more of his work.  While it is a good story, it has a rather dull ending that could have been much more interesting if he would have made it longer that 100 pages.  All in all, it is a good book for a fan of Steinbeck, but not for everyone.  Three Stars
