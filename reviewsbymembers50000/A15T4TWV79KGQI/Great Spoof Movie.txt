 This movie is based on real events from actual movies.  This is the ultimate spoof and a great Leslie Nielsen movie.  It parodies more movies than you can shake a severed arm at!  It's got action, comedy and romance, but mostly comedy.  This laugh-a-minute class Nielsen movie is sure to be a great addition to your DVD library!  A Great Movie!
