 This is yet another of Steinbeck's great California novels.  It is a story of friendship, camradery and trust.  It is a truly great story that a fan of Steinbeck, or anybody should enjoy.  The setting of Southern California provides a great canvas for Steinbeck's work, unlike East of Eden or The Winter of Our Discontent, which are not California novels.  This is a truly great book and is a true American clasic.
