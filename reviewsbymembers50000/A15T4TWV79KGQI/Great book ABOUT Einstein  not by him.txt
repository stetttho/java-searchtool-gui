 This book has very little actually written by Einstein himself. It gives a brief biography and background of Einstein. The letters are from children and show the enormity of his fanbase in the 1940's and 50's.  The biography is informative and there are plenty of interesting pictures.  The letters are interesting, but toward the end, they seem repetitive.  Still, it is a great book worth buying.  Barnes and noble has a cheaper edition, which makes it well worth the 6 dollars!
