 This is one of Robin Williams' best movies.  It is funny, action-packed, and dramatic.  This is a great film with great acting, especially on Forest Whitaker's part, he was exceptional.  Robin Williams is highly believable as the Vietnam dj that says "GOOOOOOOOOD MOOOOOOOOORRRNING, VIETNAMMMMMMMMM!"  This is a great movie!
