 This new version of the been done subject of Joan of Arc is not bad in its own right.  LeeLee plays a good Joan and the supporting cast are terrific.  This movie is very engrossing and interesting.  The music isn't great and the special features leave much to be desired, and the cutouts to go to commercial (it was a miniseries) are negatives.  I do recommend the movie The Messenger:  The Story of Joan of Arc instead.  If you already have it, this will make a great addition and you can compare the two!  All in all a good movie.  NOTE= the Messenger has a lot of gore and violence where Joan of Arc has very little.
