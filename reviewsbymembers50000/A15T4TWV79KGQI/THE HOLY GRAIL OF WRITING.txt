 This book is a writing classic.  It is short, simple, and yet, you can always find what you are looking for, perhaps that is why Stephen King recommends it over his book, On Writing.  When an established writer openly says that another book is better than theirs, you know it is pure gold.  This is great to read at least once a year, or to skim over periodically.  It's not that boring to read, since less than half of it is just rules and it's only 90 pages long.  It is an essential for any bookshelf, desk, or home library. Or you can be like Charles Osgood and I and carry it with you at all times.  If you are a writer or think you are, get this book!
