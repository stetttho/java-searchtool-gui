 This book IS mostly about DNA, but it contains so much more. Watson is one of the best science writers of all time. He makes it so interesting that even the most unknowledgable layman of all time will grasp most of the concepts in this vivid portrait.  It reads like a novel at times and like an excerpt from a scientific journal other times.  If you don't like reading, buy this book for the pictures, it has very interesting pictures with great captions!  There is a picture on nearly every page! This book is really interest for scientist and layman alike!
