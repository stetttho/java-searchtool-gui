 This is a great military thriller that is as full of turns and twists as your small intestine.  John Travolta is great, but Samuel L. Jackson is, well Samuel L. Jackson.  This movie's ending is very confusing and unexpected.  All in all it is a good movie to watch ONCE, then it gets old.  I'd recommend it to a military or action lover.
