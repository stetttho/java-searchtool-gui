 Discworld is Terry Pratchett's brainchild.  A world shaped like a CD on which due to the powerful magic, the light moves slowly and poets are not allowed to used unrealistic similes. The farther you get into the world of Discworld, the more well written and humorous Terry's books become.  The Color of Magic is an interesting tale introducing Rincewind (About whom 6 Discworld Novels are written) and Twoflower and the entire world.  This book has a decent plot and moves along fairly quickly.  The sequel to this book is the Light Fantastic.
