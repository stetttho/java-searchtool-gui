 This book is about the 90+ million acres of longleaf pine forest America had.  Now, there are very few acres of longleaf pine. This book is a carefully woven tale of the history of the longleaf pine and its rise and fall.  Along with biological discussions of the longleaf pine ecosystem, there are anecdotes about tarheels, Native Americans, and insects. Earley is very knowledgable in environmental history. Also, he recounts many conversations with other experts in the field.  These are interesting and bring a different perspective to the book. The author's style is light and easy to read. Although he often discusses very complicated subjects, his style is never difficult. There are a lot of grammatical errors in the book; however, this is the first edition and can be forgiven. It is a really great read for anyone interesting in biology, history, or just good books!
