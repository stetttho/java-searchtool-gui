 I was kind of disappointed with this album. Fantasia did great stuff on the AI Show but somehow fell short in this album. Her personal style has been subsumed under the attempts by the producers and the songs to define what her style should be.   As a result, her interpretations, which has always conveyed vitality (eg. Chain of Fools), depth of emotions (eg. Summertime, when performed live) or hope (eg. I Believe) is missing or curtailed. This is a big mistake. Big.  We need her to, like she said, "feel it, man".  It is a pity, because her talent is great. Let's hope she finds herself in the next album, like Ruben did in his second album.
