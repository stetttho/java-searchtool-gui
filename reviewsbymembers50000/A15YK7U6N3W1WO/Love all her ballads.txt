  I love all her ballads. They are all good. Clearly she has the voice and all the chops.  WIth the slow and jazzy numbers, she is in her elements and at her souldering best. Her smoky voice is defintiely her strength and is showed off best in the ballads.  Remove the R&B numbers and replace with more of the same and this would be a perfect album.  Thank goodness I was able to reburn it to make it perfect.
