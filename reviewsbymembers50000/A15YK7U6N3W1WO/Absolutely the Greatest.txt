 Fantastic Christmas Album. Clay is clearly in his elements and this is definitely going to be my all time favourite every time Christmas comes around.  His voice is crisp and clear, and his joy and jubilation comes through convincingly. "Mary did you know" bears special mention because it was absolutely mesmerising.  In all, a captivating album well worth every cent. This album will make me wait with bated breath for his next.  Clay has indeed redeemed himself with this album. His debut was, how should I put it, nondescript and a waste of his talent.  But he is clearly king of the heap with this one.   Get it, it's a great addition to any Christmas collection, proving that the songs don't have to be different to make it good when the voice is good enough.
