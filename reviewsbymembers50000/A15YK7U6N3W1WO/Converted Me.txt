 Believe it or not, after swearing off Wong's film because of In the Mood for Love, this film brought me back into his fold. First of all, I do realise a bit of the significance and nuances of a gay life and gay relatinship may have been lost on me. There was no explantion of the significance of things, it just assumes you know the sub-culture in which the main characters live. So for a non-participant of such a sub-culture or psyche, it was intriguing for me to pick up the clues and hints of the greater sub-culture backdrop and particular psyche in which everything unfolds. I definitely have a better understanding and appreciation although definitely not a complete one. I was irritated with the characters initially but once understanding creeps in, empathy dawns. It will only be complex to those who do not understand, intriguing to those who gets a whiff of understanding and I am sure, beautiful for those whose stories are actually being told.
