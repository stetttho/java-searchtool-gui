  From the very first track, "The Real Thing", it was all good for me. It was all very consistently good tracks all the way to the end, "Valley of Angels", that I was hard pressed to find what track stands out more.   Usually, it is easy to pick out the better tracks in an album because there are usually mediocre fillers along the way with only one or two good songs that are supposed to carry the album.  For "The Real Thing", I have a feeling I will be liking all of the tracks over repeated listening, in order of appearance in the album. Yes, it is that strong an album.  It was tough finding the weaker songs because there just ain't any. Even the so called less catchy weaker songs, I have no doubt, are great if listened in isolation from the rest.  This is a great pop rock album that has a very comfortable familiar feel that no other albums currently out there has right now.  It harks back to the days of good old rock songs delivered the good old way, without trying too hard to be different or new. If you have had enough of rap and grunge and R&B and all that crap, welcome to "The Real Thing".   Enjoy.
