 Get it, Get it, Get it.  Now that we've gone past the subtleties, this is indeed one of the better feel good oldies and definitely one of the best Cary Grant shows.  Amazingly, even though made in 1948, it is still soooo.. relevant today. The issues raised and the sentiments felt are still so real and alive even today.  The best part is that for an old show it is amazingly accepting and non-preachy about a lot of things. There is also sufficient twists and turns in the plot to rise above the genre of innocent and simplistic films from the past.  Love it. It is still excellent and will definitely more than hold its own with the best shows of today.
