  Yep, I didn't expect it to be that good but it was.  John Stevens is definitely in his elements. He sounds better than he ever did on AI and this is the potential the judges probably saw in him in the first place. And he acquitted himself par excellance.  Forget Buble and the whole host of overrated youngsters trying to milk the genre for its nostalgic value.   This is it. I swear I actually thought I was listening to a young old blue eyes, especially as I had both albums put back to back in my car.   It was with a start that I realised that the CD had changed.  What are you waiting for? Get it.
