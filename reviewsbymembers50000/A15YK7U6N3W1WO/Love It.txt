 It's a great album. Love her voice in the various genre that Kimberly attempted in this album.  Her duet with Clay is definitely worth many listening and showed off both their voices very well. It's pop, but it's pop at its very best.  I also love Before, which has a catchy tune that stays in your head and makes you want to learn the lyrics to. It's simple but nice.  Overall a great album which you will listen to over and over again. Get it.  Well done, Kimberly. Can we have more?
