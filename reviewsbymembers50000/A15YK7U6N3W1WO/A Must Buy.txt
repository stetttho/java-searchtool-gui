 This is definitely a must buy.  Itis not available anywhere else, either on the AI compilations or his debut album, and your collection will defintely not be complete without his best song ever - Solitaire.  Clay has set a very high bar for himself with this song. He redefined what was previously a nice but not so impressive song, vocal-wise, done and redone by sooo many people, and made his version the absolute best, and the only acceptable standard for this song from now on.   Get it, get it, don't wait a moment longer. You won't regret it.
