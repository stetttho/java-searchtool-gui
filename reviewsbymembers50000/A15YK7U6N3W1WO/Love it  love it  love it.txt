 What can I say? Love it, love it, love it.  Easy to like songs, great vocals, well done job all round.  In particular, Kim No. 1 is fantastic in "Somewhere Over The Rainbow" and Kim No. 2 was also great in "Killing Me Softly"  Throw in the undisputable greats like Clay and Ruben, with a dash of Trenyce and the rousing group anthems, why, you will be "Overjoyed".  Definitely one to add to your collection.
