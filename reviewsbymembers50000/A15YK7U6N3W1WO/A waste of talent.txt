 This album does not do justice to his talents.  Ruben is definitely capable of so much more. This is basically a hip hop album, which although Ruben can pull off, it does not really show off his voice and also does not quite suit his style.  We need him to be smooth, warm and fuzzy, with deep rich vocals that can melt chocolate and vocal improvisations that will impress the pants of you.  Clearly, his better songs hark from the AI2 days. The new ballads here for some reason are very slow and draggy and not catchy enough.  Please give us something better in your next outing Ruben. You definitely can do it.
