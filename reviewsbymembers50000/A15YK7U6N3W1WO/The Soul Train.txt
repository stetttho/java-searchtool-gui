 Tracks 1 to 4, 10 and 11 are great.  With so many good tracks, it is definitely a worthwhile buy.  Fantasia is hypnotic with "Chain", Jennifer oozes with sexual tension in "Neither", La Toya did great, Diana surprises with her more than credible soulfulness, John Stevens was smooth and charming, but Camille was the real surprise winner in this album. She was never better.  Great stuff.
