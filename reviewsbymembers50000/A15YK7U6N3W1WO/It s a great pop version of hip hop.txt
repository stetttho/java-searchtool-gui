 It is entirely listenable and pleasant. I enjoyed it very much.  However, not being a fan of this genre of music, I craved a little variation at times to break the monotony for me. A few more ballads would have been great.  But for those who like the genre, this is great.  Jasmine sounds good and hip and very into the happenings and gooves. She deserves more exposure for her album. Any chance of any MTV clips?
