 Overall, it is a fairly listenable album, but it is a bit patchy in terms of the standard and quality of singing, recording and genre of songs chosen.  1. Carrie - Good but does not particularly excite.  2. Bo - Good, but he definitely has done much better, like Time a Bottle, Vehicle, Whipping Post, For the Love of Money and especially, the a cappella In a Dream.   3. Vonz - Good but forgettable, vocally. Her covers of Whitney are more memorable vocally.  4. Anwar - Fairly good, but I wished he had done Moon River instead, which was spectacular.  5. Nadia - Good, loved it but it does seem a little dated and out of place .  6. Nikko - Fairly good, but somehow lacks the pacing and energy level of Phil Collins.  7. Constantine - Fairly good, but the vocal seems uneven at parts. If only he could have done Bohemian Raphsody. That was spectacular.  8. Jessica - Excellent and totally memorable. Definitely one of the better tracks. As good as, if not better than, Bonnie Tyler. Good job.  9. Anthony - Great job, with soaring vocals that are better than the original. One of the better tracks for sure.  10. Scott - Fairly good, but slightly sluggish and lacks the angst that Phil Collins had, that made the song touching. Didn't feel it.  11. Lindsey - Huh? Weak link, I'm afraid. She's capable of better.  12. Mikalah - Sigh, the songs sits uncomfortably in the album, and so does the vocals. She's also capable of better.  13. Ensemble - It was awright but needs the individual brilliance to lift it from just choral mass singing.  Perhaps the producers may want to wait a bit to include the best of those still in the competition. As is, the best is sorely missed. Overeall, still worth it as a keepsake.
