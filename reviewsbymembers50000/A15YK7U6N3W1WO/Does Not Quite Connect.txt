 This is a nice fluffy album that is entirely forgettable. Which is all the more the pity because of Diana's tremendous talents that should leave a more lasting impression. The songs are by and large forgettable, teeny bopper stuff.  It was definitely a wrong decision to record Don't Cry Out Loud over the original music soundtrack, and an even worse decision to have Melissa give her some tips.   That robbed Diana of the fresh feel and interpretation which she would have given the song to make it more updated and hip. Now it just sounds constricted and dated. What a pity.  What she really need is great songs to showcase the awesome purity of her voice and the tremendous technique in her singing style. That is enough and will leave a more lasting impression.  Let's hope her next album will see that come true.
