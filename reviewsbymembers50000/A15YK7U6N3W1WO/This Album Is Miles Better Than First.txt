 Wow, this album is indeed miles better than his first. I listened to his first album and wondered why he won, but with this ablum, it is clear why he won.  It is an extremely listenable album, that although many would generalise as a gospel album, it actually contains a variety of subtle influences from many styles from soul to jazz to pop to funk.  It is a joyous album that Ruben clearly enjoyed doing and his joy and exhilaration does come through clearly , especially in Angel and Centre. When cranked loud, Angel has a heart-stopping moment that will definitely take your breath away. Shout is smooth and well done by Ruben, and the funky Restoration shows a fun and upbeat side of Ruben and his vocals worked it to perfection. One of the those albums you can actually get addicted to and have your favourite tracks list grow the more you listen to it. Great buy, get it.
