 Great Stuff- The man is smooth. It whets the appetite and makes you long for more.   I hope George won't make us wait too long for a taste of the full blown album. An EP really doesn't do him justice. We want more.   However, George, please keep true to your style and preferences in view of the unrecognisable personnae of the other AI3 idols in their bland and completely forgettable debut album offerings.  We're waitng Georgie boy, don't disappoint us.
