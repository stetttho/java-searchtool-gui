 It's a so so album that is only disappointing because we have come to expect so much more of Clay.  There are no songs the calibre of Solitare and Bridge, or even his rendition of Don't Let the Sun Go Down On Me or Somewhere Out There or To Love Somebody as performed on AI2.  What have the producers and songwriters done to him? Can we have the old Clay back? Time to bring out the real songwriters like Elton, Simon, Neil, Bee Gees and Barry.  That said, I still enjoyed the album but only because of his tremendous talent and the fact that I am a die hard fan.
