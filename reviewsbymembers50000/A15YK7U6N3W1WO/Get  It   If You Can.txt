 To quote from Get Here, "get (it) if you can". Great album, and great versatility. A surprisingly wide spectrum of genre done it in the indomitable style of the one and only Harlemm. You can feel his musicality in every song, done in his refreshing personal way. Blessed will leave you incredulous, Get Here is great, Careless is interpreted well and is what Harlem is all about, Destiny is good, and Annie is a pleasant surprise too. The album brings forth Harlemm's personality and will leave an indelible impression in your mind about his enormous talent. Now, why isn't finally an album  worth promoting being promoted to the extent it deserves?
