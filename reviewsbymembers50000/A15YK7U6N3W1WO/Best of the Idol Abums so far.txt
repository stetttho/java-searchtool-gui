 Great stuff, Tamyra. After having dutifully bought and listed to all the AI solo albums, I clearly like this album the best. Technically superb and great songs that do not border on being boring or background listening, too mainstream  or too inaccessible. Raindrops is great, Star is good, Legend is good, God Bless is great, and so are the rest as well. As a whole, great buy. The material, pacing  and instrumentaton is also clearly superior to the rest so far. Now, I wish that the others will also come out with quality albums that do justice to their talent. Well done, Tamyra.
