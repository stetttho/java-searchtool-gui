 The timeframe for I, Jedi surrounds the timeframe of the Jedi Academy Trilogy. Though the novel focuses around the poorly written Jedi Academy Trilogy, the book, I Jedi, is wonderful in its narrative and well developed characters. The novel also answers many of the questions that the Jedi Academy Trilogy does not answer.  The novel is told in the first person point of view through the Rogue Squadron pilot and Jedi descendant, Corran Horn. At the beginning the novel he finds that his wife has been taken prisoner and the only way for him to save her is through developing his Jedi powers. The narrative focuses on Corran's experiences at the Jedi Academy and the teachings of Luke Skywalker. It is interesting to see what Corran's opinion on Luke's training techniques and the way he views how a Jedi should act.  The novel's pace really picks up when Corran leaves the Jedi to find his wife. At that point in the novel, the character Taviria is introduced in great detail. Through her actions and views on situations, the characterization of the Imperial female commander, Taviria, is done so well that she becomes one of the most believable characters in the novel.  What also makes this novel unique is that the author does not rely on most of the usual characters (Han and Leia) in this book. What the author effectively does is use the major Star Wars figures as a backdrop to the storyline. Only Luke is used as a major character with a lot of dialog. I, Jedi by Micheal Stackpole provides a unique look at how a Jedi is trained. Anyone interested in that aspect of the Star Wars universe would love this novel. This book is very well written, and I recommend it to anyone.
