 I purchased the new Hellseeker on the basis that it was the latest installment in the series, and I must say that it was VERY DISAPPOINTING. The movie lacks just about everything. The story line in not written well, and the acting is terrible.  Overall, the movie will put anyone to sleep. So, if you are an insomniac and can't sleep- I highly recommend Hellseeker, but if you want to spend your time watching a more quality horror film, I recommend one of the first two Hellraiser films. Hellseeker is a waste of money (to make and to buy). Look elsewhere.
