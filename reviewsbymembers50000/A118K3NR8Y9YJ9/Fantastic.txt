 Tangerine Dream does a good job in attempting to create a fantasy world of feeling through music, but in some cases through the album the electronics gets in the way of creating a feeling of legendary magic (which is not at fault of the composer, but in the digital keyboards used back in the mid eighties).  Still, the beautiful tracks of Opening, Cottage, and Unicorn Theme create such striking images of fantasy that I was surprised when I heard it the first time through.  Also, accompanying one of the beautiful tracks is Jon Anderson's (known best from the group YES) fantasy type voice in the beautiful song "Loved By the Sun."  Overall it is a good album and worth the purchase.
