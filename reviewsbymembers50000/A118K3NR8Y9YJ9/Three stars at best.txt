 Truce at Bakura takes place immediately following Return of the Jedi.  Ms. Tyers does an important job of illustrating to the reader that even though the Emperor has fallen , the Empire is still somewhat in tact.  This overlying theme follows most of the New Republic novels in the series. Unfortunately, what Truce at Bakura lacks is characterization.  Outside of the three dimensional characters crated by George Lucas, the characters of the Bakurans and the Ssi-ruuk are not fully developed.  Their flat characterizations force the readers to go through the motions in order to reach the action sequences at the end of the book. The first half of the book debates on the opportunity differences between the New Republic and the old Galactic Empire, which is shown through the arguments Leia brings to the leaders of Bakura (a plant still under the influence of the Galactic Empire.  This debate quickly ends when the Empire and the Ssi rue both hunt down Luke Skywalker. So, with flat characterization, why did the book receive three stars?  Well, fortunately, Ms Tyers created a transitional character in the novel called Dev, who seems to have the ability to use the force.  Dev was conflicted between his honor with the Ssi-ruuk and his own human race, which the Ssi ruuk wanted to enslave.  The force draws Dev and Luke together which creates a wonderful and surprising transition in Dev's character.   So, if you are looking for a reason to read Truce at Bakura, the only reason that I feel adequate enough was Dev's storyline.  The rest of the novel just goes through the motions.
