 For anyone who has never seen the Sopranos before, where else better to start than from the beginning of the story.  Right from the first episode the viewer is drawn to the character of Tony Soprano, a ruthless mobster, because of his love for these DUCKS that make a home in his pool.  The off beat characterization ties into this psychological dramatic comedy that deals with family as much as it does about the mob.  Then, like any other great story, it gets more involved and brings the viewer to love all the chatracers (even the ones that are hateful).  Tell me of an italian family (or possibly any family for that matter) that can not relate to how Tony's family acts.  It will have you roaring with laughter.  This is one of the few intelligent series that can have you laughing one second and then be totally serious the next.  No one should have to go through life without ever having the Sopranos experience.
