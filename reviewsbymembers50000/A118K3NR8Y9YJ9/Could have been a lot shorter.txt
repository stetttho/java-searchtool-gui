 I do enjoy Mr. Koontz's work a lot, but FROM THE CORNER OF HIS EYE was not one of them.  The book is a little over 600 pages long, and the story really could have been told in a little over 200 pages.  Most of the story did not need to be told.  For example, the main antagonist, Cain, is set against the main protagonist, Bartholomew, and the two do not have their conflict until the end of the novel. There was one saving grace to the book, which was why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1.  The saving grace in the novel was the traumatic situation that both Bartholomew and his mother, Agnes Lampion, must face.  That situation does make a person think a little differently about how precious life really can be.  Still, that situation does not last long in the novel.  Hopefully next time Mr. Koontz's next book will be better.
