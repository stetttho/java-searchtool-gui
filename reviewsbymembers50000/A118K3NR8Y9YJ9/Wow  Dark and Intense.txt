 This opening to the New Jedi Order hits the reader where it hurts the most, his or her heart.  The effective narrative pulls with anticipation and moves at the speed of light.  The scenes are so darkly graphic that it is easy to tell that the Star Wars novels have matured.  Even the death of a major character is involved.  Also, the Yuuzhan Vong are such a biological threat to the major characters that they even rival the Emperor himself.  Nom Anor, the Yuuzhan Vong leader, is characterized with style and darkness that it brings back recollections of Darth Vader.   If this is how the series opens, I wonder how it will end.  Intensity begins on the first page and ends on the last.  You won't be disappointed.  I couldn't recommend this book more.  It is worth every penny.  Purchase the book and behold the wonder of Star Wars again.
