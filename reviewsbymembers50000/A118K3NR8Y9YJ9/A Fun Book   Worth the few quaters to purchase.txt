 Barry Trotter not only pokes fun at the Harry Potter storyline.  It also is a social satire for everyone.  It angles much of its humor toward a capitalistic society that has to market every aspect of a great idea (like Harry Potter or Barry Trotter).  The purpose of Lord Valumart is to make money wherever possible, and he does a great job of it too. Also, the inflection and notes from the author throughout the book are hysterical.  I especially loved the last note of the book that pokes fun of post modernism.   Oh, and if the reader hates the book, that is fine too.  The author was nice enough to have a generic letter of offense at the back that can be photocopied and sent to the publisher that allows the readers to check off why they hate the author. The book receives four stars instead of five because some of the jokes are just beat to death in this book.  Perhaps the book should have been shorter.  But, then again, the book would then turn into a short story.  The book is already only 174 pages long.
