 The New Jedi Order series begins the new era of Star Wars with new characters, new enemies, and new plot lines. Unfortunately, the narrative of the Dark Tide books does not help a reader imagine what is happening because it was not properly described. Michael A. Stackpole chronically denies the reader any descriptive detail on what Yuuzhan Vong ships and weapons look like.  He also denies detailed background on any major Yuuzhan Vong characters.  It is as if he didn't fully understand the enemy he was writing about.  He just plainly stated the name of the object or character and moved on with the story.  This effect for a novel does help keep the story moving at a quick pace, but the lack of detail and description harmed the overall narrative.  It prevented the reader from wanting to care about characters and situations.  The author simply went through the motions so that the reader could move onto the next book.  For this reason the Dark Tide books are very disappointing.
