 Ambush at Correllia is an interesting read.  The only reason why it was given four stars instead of five was because of the extremely slow pace of the novel.  The pace almost seemed to be non existent at parts of the book, but that was because Ambush at Correllia seemed to be written to support the action in the other two novels.   Ambush at Correllia, though just background for the other two books, does deliver its story with an interesting narrative.  The depth of story and characterization is enough to forgive the very slow pace of the book.  As a matter of fact, the action does not begin until the last twenty pages of the novel.  Still, with the extremely interesting build-up, it is worth the wait.  I hope the other two novels live up to the expectation that the first novel created.
