 This film is awful. There is really nothing much else that can be said. Clive Barker must be furious with what has become of his beloved creation - Pinhead.   The focus of the Hellraiser series began about obsession of mortality and the hunger for understanding what is unknown. That answer of course came with a punishment of pain that pinhead would find most exquisite.  Unfortunately, Hellseeker has become a hell in itself - for the viewer this time. The Hellraiser series has turned into a jumbled story with an identity crisis. First, pinhead is content with being the keeper of hell, but then he wants to take over the world, and then he becomes the Sherlock Holmes of the great answer at the end of the last two movies. Unfortunately, the answer in Hellseeker is obvious from the first quarter of the film.  One would think that because the character of Christy had returned that the Hellraiser series has begun to redeem itself from Hellraiser III, IV, and V. This is not the case. Hellseeker is the worst of them all. The acting is poor, and the story is not consistent. It is clear why the series has now gone direct to video.
