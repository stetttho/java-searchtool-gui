 Tatooine Ghost is about Leia coming to terms with understanding her real father's past.  Led by the force, she is drawn into Anakin's past, watching as the events of his childhood unfold in a mysterious way.  Unfortunately, the depth of the story is presented as a chase after a painting that contains information that could destroy the Wraith Squadron.  The purpose of chasing after the painting is an obvious ploy to get the reader to experience Leia's coming to understand herself and her anger toward Anakin Skywalker. The storyline of chasing after the painting is what hurts the story.  The whole premise of that story makes the story seem a bit forced (and also a bit slow paced), because as the story unravels, the characters seems to just be drawn like tourists through an unknown land and learning little things along the way.  Still, the real reason why the book was written helps to keep the story alive:  to link the prequel films with the current Star Wars universe.  The book even answers some unanswered questions that lingered between Courtship of Princess Leia and Heir to the Empire.  Still, the characters are the best quality of the book.  From Leia to the Squibs, it is clear that Troy Denning has a knack for characterization.  From his realistic dialog that rivals the dialog in the films to the decisions that the characters make, Troy Denning paints the characters as real people.  Leia, especially, is quite a dynamic character.  After all her experiences in the novel, Leia's mindset changes almost completely concerning several pressing issues that she had been faced with since the destruction of the second death star.   Overall, the book is for anyone who wishes only to fill in the gaps between the Courtship of Princess Leia and Heir to the Empire.  Troy Denning, a very good writer, has written a good novel, but he has written better.
