 If you want a digital audio conection with or without the S-video hookup, this is the product to purchase.  Don't worry about the monster cable connections.  It really won't provide you with the sound quality that the offical X-box digital AV pack audio connection would provide.  With the Advance AV pack, the optical or coax cable can plug directly into the connector without the purchase of any other equipment.  It's nice and it's not expensive.
