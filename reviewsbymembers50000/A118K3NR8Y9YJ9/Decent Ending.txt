 Timothy Zahn gave it his best when he wrote the first three books in the Thrawn trilogy.  Unfortunately, Vision of the Future falls a little short of expectations from the original Thrawn trilogy, but that is not to say that Vision of the Future is not a good novel.  On the contrary, it surpasses most of the novels in the New Republic era of Star Wars.  Zahn does a terrific job answering many questions that remained hanging during the New Republic era of the Star Wars universe.  And to top it off, Luke finally finds his true love with Mara Jade.  Their wedding is found in the comic novel Union. The reason why Vision of the Future is given four stars instead of five is that the threat to the New Republic is quite minimal compared to the original Thrawn trilogy.  The novel is close to seven hundred pages long, and because of its mild imperial threat, the book could have been told in four or five hundred.  Many characters did not need to be introduced, because they did not have any dramatic effect on the overall plot.  Still, the narrative is well written, and the story overall was good enough to hold my interest.  It is a decent ending to the New Republic era before the New Jedi Order begins.
