 The detail of this game far surpasses the second silent hill.  Part three is the sequal to the first silent hill.  You guide Heather through a deserted mall, into the subway, thorugh the sewers, and eventually to Silent Hill, where she must uncover who she truly is.  The fear factor of this game is high, so if you like playing alone in the dark, try to have someone with you.  It plays with you mind.  The soundtrack that comes with it is also a nice bonus.  Some cool songs are recorded on it.  I highly recommend it, especially if you played the first Silent Hill.  The third Silent Hill contains a suprise about what the main character from the first game, Harry, is now doing, and its not what you would expect.
