 Kevin J. Anderson's second novel in the Jedi Academy Trilogy far surpasses the first book, Jedi Search.  It is in Dark Apprentice where the Jedi Academy students begin their training, and where one student falls toward the dark side.  Bringing about images that are reminiscent of Darth Vader, Kyp Durron, under the influence of dark Jedi Master Exar Kun, acts out with good intentions using the powers of the darkside.  His inner conflict and the outer conflict between him and Luke Skywalker almost parallel one another.  It is a storyline that is almost as good as the Thrawn Trilogy. It is also in Dark Apprentice that the forces of Admiral Daala hurt the New Republic by using guerilla warfare tactics.  Though her character had a minor role to play in the first book, she has a major role to play in the second, and it is a welcome change. The language and characterization in Dark Apprentice is better that expected.  In the first book, Jedi Search, the language was simple, and the characters were very one dimensional, but Mr. Anderson seemed to have fixed those problems in Dark Apprentice.  One of the characters is Kyp Durron, a strong transitional character that has many great qualities.  His naive and rugged outlook on the world, along with his dark past, helps to provoke him toward the dark side.  Everyone affected by his character help to show their dimension in the book.  Han comes across as a father figure, and Luke comes across as a mild mentor who bears the brunt of his anger. Just the conflict with the character of Kyp Durron alone is enough to warrant reading this book.  It is worth your time.
