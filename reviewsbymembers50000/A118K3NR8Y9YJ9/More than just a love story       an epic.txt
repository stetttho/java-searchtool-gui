 The Courtship of Princess Leia immediately begins with the conflict between Han Solo and the impressive Prince Isolder, bringing all the hopes that Leia and Han would marry to a halt.  It is obvious to any Star Wars fan that Han and Leia are married in later novels, and to think the conflict to be trivial would be incorrect.  Fortunately, that conflict is only actually a tool used to create the larger story by forcing Han to kidnap Leia and take her to the remote world of Dathomir, which is under Imperial control by the  Warlord Zsinj. It is on this plant that the real story begins.  With the Falcon broken down on the strange and beautiful planet, Han, Leia, and Chewie try to find a way to escape before Warlord Zsinj finds out.  Also, Luke teams with Isolder to find Han and Leia on this world.  Once all the major characters are on Dathomir, they discover a new society of "witches" who battle for supremacy.  These witches utilize both the light side of the force (by the White Singing Clan) and dark side of the force(by the Nightsisters).  I can't recommend this novel more.  The Courtship of Princess Leia is more than just a love story - it is a novel of epic determination, old traditions battling new possibilities, and an adventurous battle that could only mirror the old battles of Hoth and Endor.  It is a must read for anyone thinking of reading the expanding universe.
