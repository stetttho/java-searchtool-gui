 This is one of best conclusions to a Star Wars trilogy of books that I have read.  Zahn by far beats out all the Star Wars authors I have read so far, but Roger Allen's conclusion to the Corellian Trilogy had much of the same feel that Zahn had in his Thrawn trilogy. Filled with deep rooted good characterization and actions, the author does a wonderful job at bringing the reader close to the characters as they uncover the secrets to the repulsors and Centerpoint Station.  It is also the author's natural ability for good characterization that makes the sacrifices that are made in these books by many characters both heart wrenching and heart warming at the same time.  This book has emotional pull as well as solid action.   The only hesitation I have toward all three books is the overdone technical narrative, which slows down much of the action (until the end).  The book could easily have been thirty to fifty pages shorter if Roger Allen had cut down the technical thought process on how to fix things like sublight engines and nav computers.  Still, with the way the author conducted the ending to this trilogy, this little issue can be forgiven.  I can't think of giving the final book to this series anything less than five stars.  It's a wonderful series overall.
