 A3 changed their style on "Le Peste" from the sound they had used in "Exile on Coldharbor Lane".  With songs like "Too Sick to Pray" and "Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlife" it is evident of the musical maturity in their melodic harmonies and sound.  The songs are more full than just the simple standard rhythms on the Coldharbor Lane album (which was also a good album).  Though it is evident that they wanted to stick with the heavy bass tone of "Woke up this Morning" on their original album, which gave the song that cool laid back flow, they also decided to make this album more a serious artistic endeavor in the lyrical quality of their content in most cases.  During the final track the album ends on a hopeful lyrical statement, "Everything's going to be alright."  Hopefully the band is telling us, the listeners, that they're going to be around for a while, so that we can hear more of their "sweet sculptural rhythms."
