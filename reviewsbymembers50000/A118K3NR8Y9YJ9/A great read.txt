 It is the end of the world, and man must decide between the forces of good and evil to determine the fate of humanity.  This is a classic epic tale that will be told for a very long time.  Only a talent such as Stephen King can produce a story like this. I am sure it will stand as a testament to his creative talents.        I have rarely read a book where the main characters are so real, that I believed they really existed.  I cried when they cried.  I laughed when they laughed.  I even screamed at the book in times of great peril for the main characters.  This is a must read for all good readers out there.        Overall, the book is absorbing.  Along with great main characters the narrative itself is told in a such a way that it draws the reader into its world and makes everything else disappear.  The real world does not exist until the book is over, I guarantee it.
