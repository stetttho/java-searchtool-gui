 Though the game starts off pretty slow, once the main characters receives his sword and is off to save his sister, the story and pace of the game really picks up.  The farther into the story the game progresses, the more involved the game gets.  Soon you'll find yourself in front of your system at 4 AM n the morning not wanting to stop the game until Ganondorf is defeated.
