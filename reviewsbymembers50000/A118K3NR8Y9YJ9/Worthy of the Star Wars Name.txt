 Heir to the Empire is the first book in the Thrawn trilogy.  Rumors once circulated that the Thrawn trilogy was Star Wars Episodes 7, 8, and 9.  Well, if the rumors weren't true, then they should have been.  Heir to the Empire is comparable to the films in character, plot, pace, mood, and overall quality. Through the voice of the narrative, the rich design of the worlds, and the intensity of the characters, Timothy Zahn recreates the Star Wars universe to absolute perfection.  The character of the evil Grand Admiral Thrawn is drawn to show that he is quite distinct from Darth Vader, and could even possible rival Vader as a leader.  Where Vader ruled with fear, Thrawn ruled with intellect.   Besides Thrawn, two of the best characters in Heir to the Empire are Talon Karde and Mara Jade.  Talon Karde's outer struggle to maintain a business balance with the Empire and The New Republic seems to almost rival Mara Jade inner struggle with wanting to kill Luke Skywalker.  Why does she want to kill Luke?  Guess you'll have to read to find out. The novel carries the familiar characters of Luke, Han, Chewbacca, Leia, Lando, Threepio, and Artoo through situations of mystery, political upheaval, and assassination.  As they are hunted, the characters are drawn to worlds such as Chewbacca's home planet of Kashyyyk.  Kashyyyk as well as the other worlds are drawn to perfection so that the reader sees exactly what Zahn is describing. The pace of the book, especially with the battle scenes, are so vividly described with such effective phrasing, that it can even deceive the reader to think that he or she is watching the films on the big screen.  It is certain that Heir to the Empire is truly worthy of the Star Wars name.
