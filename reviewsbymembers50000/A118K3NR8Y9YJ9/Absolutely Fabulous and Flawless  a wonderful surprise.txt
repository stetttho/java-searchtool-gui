 The New Rebellion begins with a bang and doesn't stop the tension until the very last page.  This wonderful page turner by Kristine Kathryn Rusch brought out every element in the Star Wars expanded universe by executing a flawless narrative that wound around an intense plotline.    By reading the narrative, it was clear that the author had done her homework.  Every character down to the evil Kueller and fallen Brakiss were very round and dynamic.  Also, many of the expanded universe books fail to illustrate good Star Wars heroes, but in the New Rebellion even the major familiar heroes held the qualities that were given to them in the films.   The pace was as quick as the film.  While reading the novel, I could almost hear John Williams' soundtrack in the background during several scenes.  I would have to honestly say that The New Rebellion almost matches the intensity and depth of the Thrawn Trilogy.  Read the book and remember the feeling of being part of the Star Wars universe once again.  If you already read the novel, read it again.  It is wonderful.  I certainly hope she writes another Star Wars novel.
