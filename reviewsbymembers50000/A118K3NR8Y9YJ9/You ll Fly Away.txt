 With its combination of Hip Hop and Rock Opera styles, Moulin Rogue can make the listener believe that love can stand the tests of time.  With songs like "One Day I'll Fly Away", "Come What May", and the remake of Elton John's "Your Song" the emotional aspect of the album is pushed to inspirational levels.  I can see "Come What May" becoming a traditional song at any modern wedding.  On the other hand, the hip hop songs help to bring life and attitude to such an emotional album.  David Bowie, being as great as he is, does a wonderful job in singing the lines that John Leguizamo had performed in the film.  Together, this emotional ablum with attitude will take any listener away into his or her mind and make him or her believe that love can conquer all.
