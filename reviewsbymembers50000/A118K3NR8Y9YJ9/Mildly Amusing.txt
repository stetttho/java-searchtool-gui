 Assault on Selonia begins where Ambush at Correllia left off.  Han is captured, Leia is trapped, and Luke is on his way to find help.  Luke is able to find help with the Bakurian navy that readers meet in the novel Truce at Bakura by Kathy Tyers.   Bringing the two books together helped to tie some loose ends that were never really answered (like whatever happened to Gaeirel Captison).   Also, the characterization stayed pretty much true to the other books.  The dialog and actions were believable.   What also helped Assult at Selonia was the detailed craftsmanship of the narrative to bring the Selonia and Drall culture into the storyline.  The anthropological feel to the cultures and how they worked helped to illustrate how the new characters Dracmus, Marcha, and Ebrihim reacted to certain situations. The book receives four stars because of its narrative.  Though it helped to convey the culture and action of the Star Wars universe, it took too long to explain certain aspects of the story.  At certain points, I felt as if I was reading a technical manual on the Millennium Falcon or any other ship.  Much of the detail about repairing that ship or any other didn't really need to be in there and slowed the pace of the book down a lot.  But overall, it was an interesting read, and I recommend it for any Star Wars fan.
