 When Tolkien created Middle Earth, he created a new mythology that people would read long after his death.  The Lord of the Rings is an inspiration for many modern day writers as well as readers.  The culters brought out in the book seem real.  The characters are rich.  The story is classic. No one can go through life without ever experiencing such a wonderful story. The story is about a hobbit, Frodo, who is given the ONE RING that can destroy all of Middle Earth if it is put into the hands of its maker, the Dark Lord Sauron.  Now, this simple innocent fellow, who lives in a part of the land where nothing bad ever happens, must travel out into the dark and evil realm of Middle Earth to throw the ring into the fires where it was created.  The past converges with the present in order to save the future of their world.  The epic war of the ring has begun, and the Halfling must fulfill his quest or all would be lost.   If you haven't read the book, there is no time to waste.  The movie will be out soon, and books are always better than their film adaptations.
