 From the Corner of His Eye is a little over six hundred pages long.  The story itself can be told in two hundred pages.  The drive in the story is that the main villian, Cain, is after the child Bartholomew, and the two only meet briefly near the end of the novel.  The pace is slow, and the conflict is trivial.  The emotional pull to hate the antagonist is not there.  Actually, the voice of the narrative doesn't even come across as allowing the reader to feel anything for Cain.  'So, he is a killer with a crazy thought process' is what went through my mind when I read the novel. Overall, the book was a bad novel. The reason why the book gets two stars instead of one in my opinion is because of the emotional anguish that Bartholomew's mother had to face when she found out that her son would lose her sight.  That portion of the narrative was beautiful.  Koontz has written better, and I hope he will write better in the future.
