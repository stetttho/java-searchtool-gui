 Timothy Zahn gave it his best when he wrote the first three books in the Thrawn trilogy.  Specter of the past only gets four stars this time, because its mildly slow pace.  Unlike the trilogy, his first book in the Hand of Thrawn series, Specter of the Past, is not as quick paced.  The action sequences are few and far between, but the narrative and dynamic characters keep the reader intrigued.   What this novel has that the first three books did not was a lot of political struggle.  Zahn shows the reader that the Empire is not the enemy anymore.  Politics is the enemy.  He shows how the little issues can be the cause for a government's possible downfall.  With a sharp mind and cunning plan, that downfall can be executed to ensure that it happens.   Several old characters from the expanded universe are reintroduced and brought to show a slight turn in their beliefs.  General Pellaeon, for example, is the most dynamic character when he says in the first chapter that he wants to surrender the Empire to the New Republic.  This and several other surprises await the reader in this wonderful novel.  I recommend this to any Star Wars fan.  I just hope the buildup is paid off in the next book Vision of the Future.
