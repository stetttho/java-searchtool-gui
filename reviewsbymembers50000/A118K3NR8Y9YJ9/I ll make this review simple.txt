 The writing style is too choppy to be considered a decent narrative.  The plot is very weak.  The characters are flat, especially Luke's love interest (who isn't even human).  It is almost painful to read.  The story even contradicts many beliefs of the Star Wars universe.  I wouldn't even consider this a Star Wars novel hadn't the major Star Wars players been involved.  I do not recommend this book.
