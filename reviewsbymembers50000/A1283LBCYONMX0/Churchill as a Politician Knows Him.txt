 Churchill died at 90.  Roy Jenkins, now well into his 80's, seems determined to match him not only for age, but for literary merit.  "Churchill" is his most ambitious biography to date, and certainly his best.  A prominent cabinet minister of the Wilson Labour government, Jenkins brings to this book a particularly insightful take on Churchill the politician.  ("It takes one to know one!") Perhaps most surprising for a past member of a (once) leftist (and now centrist) party, he seems to bring no rigid ideological bias to his interpretation of the greatest parliamentarian of all time, and assesses him in a decidedly pragmatic, even-handed fashion. Appropriately, he does so in a very "English" English, which initially strikes the North American ear as being overly complex and needlessly wordy; but as you become used to his majesterial cadence, its richness and depth of content become apparent, and begin to match that of Churchill himself.  Jenkin's Churchill the man is displayed "warts and all", but his conclusion with respect to his subject is somewhat different from the revisionist view of such recent (and predominantly critical) biographers as John Charmley ("Churchill: The End of Glory"); in his own words:  "I now put Churchill...as the greatest human being ever to occupy 10 Downing Street."  And he should know; as Chancellor of the Exchequer, he once lived just next door at number 11!
