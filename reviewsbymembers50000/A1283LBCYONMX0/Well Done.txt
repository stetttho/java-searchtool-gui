 Having just received my copy of this book in the mail, I can't say that I've read through the entire text yet.  But this is not necessarily the type of book that you plod through dutifully from the first to the last page in rigid sequence.  After all, as one veteran of the First Special Service Force commented to me, this is a "coffee table" book.  And, as with the best of that species (whatever the subject matter), it's meant to be savored slowly and appreciated over time! Lavishly illustrated in both colour and black and white, it presents a fine visual record of almost every aspect of the First Special Service Force.  Numerous contemporary photos are complemented by frequent carefully constructed plates which meticulously document more than half a century later the uniforms, equipment, and insignia of the Force.  (The author, incidentally, is present in more than one, photographed wearing the typical "kit" of Forcemen from various periods of the unit's short but significant existence.)  Maps  show the major areas of operations, and are graphically clean and easily absorbed.  An appendix at the end even corrects omissions made in a previously published list of all men who served with the Force. While the illustrations immediately catch the eye, there is also a detailed and rigorously annotated text.  A quick examination of the extensive bibliographic notes at the end of the book reveals an impressive depth and comprehensiveness of background research.  That matches the  overall production values of this large book, which is simply a pleasure to hold in your lap and and enjoy the more you browse through it. Well done!
