 Murder mysteries are not a genre that I read with any frequency.  But I do like books.  And perhaps even more to the point, I like books about books.  "Books are your friends" is an aphorism that my father frequently used to encourage me read.  In an interesting twist on that saying, John Dunning reveals that books can also be your enemies; that besides their intrinsic value as entertainment and purveyors of enlightenment, they can be the cause of envy, greed, and ultimately...murder!  That is, if they are the right (or should I say the "wrong") books.  Does this seem a little cryptic?  If so, that's because I don't want to give away the plot, which I think is competently developed and sufficiently filled with enough diversions and blind alleys to be intellectually challenging.  But the thing that Dunning has so shrewdly and insightfully captured is the seductiveness of books.  For those truly caught in their web, for those who deeply revere the printed word in all its different forms, books take on a life of their own and assume a value as great as any other source of wealth.  And since wealth as we are so frequently told is a "source of all evil", it is--in retrospect--not so surprising that they too can lead to cruel and calculated killing.  It's this additional element that subversively underlies the appeal of "Booked to Die" and makes it so much more than simply another murder mystery.
