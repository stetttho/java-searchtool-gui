 Douglas Waller has a real talent for immersing you in the world of the present-day American submariner.  He deals not just with the technical nuts and bolts of the nuclear powered Trident submarine Nebraska, but he gives you a real feel for the crew, both individually and collectively.  I suspect that this is a somewhat sanitized view of life under water; after all he did live with these men for an extended period of time, undoubtedly shared confidences with them, and almost certainly grew to like and admire them.  He probably wouldn't produce a "reveal all" expose as a result.  Yet having stated that caveat, to the uninitiated at least the book nonetheless rings true.  This a valuable contribution to our understanding of why the American military is usually so successful, and offers an insight into how it maintains the United States as the last remaining superpower.  In many respects, Waller's writing does for the undersea navy what the likes of Anna Simons ("The Company They Keep:  Life Inside the U.S. Army Special Forces") have done for other branches of the military.  Not only is this a good, entertaining read, but it is an excellent study into the sociology of a very unique, small, but surely very important social group!
