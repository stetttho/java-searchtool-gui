 I purchased this book with great anticipation, having very much enjoyed "Gates of Fire".  Unfortunately the things which I liked so much in that book are largely missing in this one.  The depiction of the  hoplite's experience in very personal terms made "Gates of Fire"  an engrossing read; as with all great historical fiction (whether the facts  are right or not), Pressfield created a detailed and believable world  populated by realistic characters with which we could empathize.   "Tides of War" has flashes of this (as with the carefully  constructed description of the critical action at Syracuse), but most of it  is a rather dry, impersonal exposition of chronological history, that--most  of the time--does not engage us on a visceral level. I read "Gates of  Fire" with so much pleasure that I will probably continue to buy  further Pressfield books, but had "Tides of War" been his first  endeavour, that would not be the case.  Still, not a bad try (given its  ambitious story line), but only a middling success!
