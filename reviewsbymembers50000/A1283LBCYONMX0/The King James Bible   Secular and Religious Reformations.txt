 Benson Bobrick was critically acclaimed for his history of the American Revolution, "Angel in the Whirlwind:  The Triumph of the American Revolution".  "Wide as the Waters:  The Story of the English Bible and the Revolution It Inspired" is equally well written, but deals with the less well known--although nonetheless related--topic of the evolution of the various English language bibles into the linguistically glorious King James version.   This is a multilayered story which combines the chronological histories of the various biblical translations with the political and religious transformations/reformations occuring in England at the same time.  Bobrick skillfully interweaves the linguistic and literary aspects of a great feat of religious publishing with the social, political, religious, and intellectual revolutions that were taking place concurrently, and convincingly shows how one area of change was inextricably connected and causally related to each of the others.  The conerstone of his interpretation is the thesis that history is not a set of unrelated, individual, unconnected events or processes, but a seamless flow where all historical forces are intimately and irrevocably intertwined.  While the literal "revolution" that he referres to is ultimately the American separation from Great Britain beginning in 1776, the term could equally be a reference to the development of democratic parliamentary government in England at the expense of monarchial power; or the dramatic transformation in religion in Britain that came about as a result of the schism in the Roman Catholic Church; or the social and intellectual upheaval brought about by easy access to scriptural reading in colloquial language; or, perhaps most signficantly, the simple freedom to read in your own language, uncensored and for yourself, whatever it is that you want to read. All of these things set the stage both metaphorically and concretely for the American Revolution that was shortly to follow. This is a book which is not simply religious in context, although it makes a valuable contribution to theological history.  Rather, it is foremost a history of ideas (primarily religious though they may be), and therefore also falls well within the realm of political and social history.
