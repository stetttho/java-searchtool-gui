 This is not a book which sets a hectic pace.  It gradually unwinds along a slow and circuitous path, taking its time to get to where it's ultimately going.  And in some ways (as with many good trips), it's the getting there and not the final destination that's most important. Turow develops plot; no surprise there, since he's a mystery writer of sorts.  But he also develops mood; he creates ambiance; he establishes context. And above all, he formulates character and characters.  Robbie Feaver (the book's protagonist) is one of the best drawn figures that I've seen in recent literature. You just have to like (and finally admire) the guy.  Lawyer or not (and I do have my problems with the legal profession), he is a strangely sympathetic man who is perhaps more moral in his own idiosyncratic way than many of the supposedly "good" people that entrap him.  It is this very ethical ambiguity that gives this book the heft and feel of a John LeCarre (sorry I'm not set up for accents!) novel. Add to this carefully set literary construction a deliberative and understated prose which effectively captures nuance and subtlety, and you pass from the realm of simple story telling to the domain of literature!
