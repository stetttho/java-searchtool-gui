 Sometimes it's not even the book itself, but where, how, and why you read it that makes it memorable.  For instance, right now I'm in quarantine in a major Canadian city after having inadvertently been in contact with someone who subsequently developed SARS.  I do not necessarily have the disease, but I may get it and pass it on to others; and to protect society I have to stay sequestered in my home for at least ten days. So for want of anything better to do I read this book, author previously unknown to me, the book picked up for a fraction of its original cost on a whim at a remainder sale.  I think it was the cover that probably first attracted me:  a nifty design that includes a compass rose and the torn fragment of a chart from the Spanish coast.  You don't have high expectations for literature under such circumstances; about all you might hope for is some degree of diversion. And diverted I really was!  Although the plot is certainly not original (it can be summed up as a search for sunken treasure and the double-crosses that inevitably take place in the process), the way in which it is played out definitely is.  For someone with plenty of time on their hands and no where to go, the story unfolds with welcome slowness and frequent forays into the abstruse details of maratime lore, coastal geography, centuries-old history, and Hispanic culture.  The characters emerge gradually, rather than being presented full-formed.  They assume a richness and depth not common in most adventure yarns, and are set in a intricately woven atmosphere that is seductive in its ambience.  And the language is complex and cadenced to match the deliberate spiral to the end that seems inevitable when it finally comes but willingly isn't until that moment. I could think of worse ways to spend a quarantine.
