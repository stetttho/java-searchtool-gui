 One thing that can be said for Michael Crichton is that he's prolific.  For reasons that are not entirely clear even to me, I've read most of his numerous books.  Perhaps its the shear volume and diversity of his work that makes me continue to hope that one--at least--will turn out to be more than just a script waiting to be converted into yet another technothriller movie.  After all, he does usually have an interesting concept at the heart of each of his science fiction novels.  In this one it's time travel, and he mobilizes a considerable amount of selective science interpretation to give it at least some sense of technical plausibility.  Subtlety, plot development, characterization, challenging literary structure, allegory, nuance, or even humour are not his strong suites, however.  Neither is originality, since the likes of H.G. Wells ("The Time Machine") and Mark Twain ("A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court") have passed this way before, usually with greater literary (if not financial) success.  Nonetheless you have to grudgingly admire the guy, if only for his advocacy in this book of historical study as an important (and even potentially remunerative) pursuit.  If your looking for even a poor facsimile of literature, "Timeline" won't be for you.  If you want to preview in written form what inevitably will be his next Hollywood megaproject, then this one may be worth a passing glance!
