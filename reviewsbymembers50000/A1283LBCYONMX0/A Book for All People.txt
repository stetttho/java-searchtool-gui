 Some books try to have "something for everybody", to be  "all things to all people".  You get the drift, I think.  After  all, this book is a murder mystery, a coutroom drama, a war story, a prison  escape story, a treatise on American race relations at the midpoint of the  last century, a study in aging, a commentary on friendship...  By all  standards it shouldn't work; it's just too ambitious, and--one might  suspect--too contrived, maybe too much a movie script marketed to a mass  reading audience before going to Hollywood for production into its screen  version.  And yet, it seems to work!  In spite of myself I enjoyed this  book.  Sure,there's formula; yeah, there are sterotypes (as a Canadian I  can certainly say that of at least one of the main characters); for  certain, some of the plot is a little too convenient.  But in spite of all  that the book ultimately entraps you in its web and carries you along,  willing or unwilling.  I came to care for the characters and their plight.   I thought the final chapter a very moving summation of the depth of  appreciation that can sometimes be expressed for help voluntarily rendered  at a dire time, no strings attached.  In the final analysis, it's just a  really good story and a pretty good book as well!
