 Coming of age books (like coming of age movies) have long constituted a well established genre.  The prototypical example is J.D. Salinger's classical "Catcher in the Rye".  James Kirkwood's "Good Times/Bad Times"--written more than a quarter century later--is another one that immediately comes to mind.  Most explore the edgie, dysfunctional side of life, where youthful angst is not necessarily just a rite of passage but begins to assume life or death proportions.  Don't get me wrong; these are marvellous, wonderfully wrought pieces of literature which have stood the test of time.  But there is something to be said for a "kinder, gentler" approach to defining the transition from child to adult, if only to acknowlege that most of us make the journey without dire consequences.  Bentz Plagemann's short novel exemplifies this latter approach.  He has no great literary pretentions, but in a solidly crafted story of one young man's emergence from adolescence (circa early 1960's), he has managed to thoughtfully and humorously explore a less problematic, more ordinary, certainly more traditional path to adulthood.  It may not rank in the same league as the other titles cited above, but it is well worth the read.  It's only too bad that such good, "small" novels can pass out of print and not be readily available for subsequent generations to enjoy.
