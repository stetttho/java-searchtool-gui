 Few military "picture books" have given me as much unexpected pleasure as this one.  Having bought it by mail on the basis of its subject matter alone, I was very pleasantly surprised when it not only met - but exceeded - my expectations.  Lavishly (dare I say beautifully) illustrated by abundant carefully selected and wonderfully reproduced photos and charts, it exhaustively covers almost all aspects of the Canadian soldier in Northwest Europe in the final year of World War II.  The succinct text (written in homage by French authors, but adequately transcribed into English) provides a good outline against which to appreciate this visual material.  While the treatment of any individual subject may not be as deep as that found in books dediciated to a specific topic, I can confidently say that no one single volume provides as much useful information as this one does!
