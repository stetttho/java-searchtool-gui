 To try to encompass the entire American experience in one volume is an example of hubris in historical writing taken to an extreme.  Yet Paul Johnson has a track record of undertaking similar gargantuan projects and producing remarkable results.  The present work nonetheless suffers in comparison with some of his earlier works.  Errors of fact compound an interpretation of relatively modern events which suffers from the same (rightist) lack of objectivity that he ascribes to earlier (leftist) historians.  (Surely FDR could not have been all that bad as a president, and still fooled more than one generation of analysts as to his greatness?)  Still, revisionist history is somewhat in vogue now. (Churchill, for one, is an example of a larger-than-life figure who seems to attract modern detracting biographers like a plague of locusts!)  And revisionist history is useful if only to stir the pot of mummified thought and make us re-evaluate what is truly "great" (if we are allowed to use that word) about a country, leader, or whatever.  The trick, of course, in any book such as this, is to exclude the valid from the invalid; to (in somewhat coarser terminology) "pick the flyshit from the pepper".  If you can do that successfully in this instance, you are left with a wonderfully ambitious and entertaining treatment of a great nation.
