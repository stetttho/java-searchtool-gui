 Simply put, this book is a marvel!  I can't remember one in recent years that I've enjoyed more.  And--to add icing to the cake--I picked it up on a whim, having no prior familiarity with either the author or his apparent critical acclaim.  He certainly warrants the latter, however, having produced a book of exceptional clarity and economy of language.   An initial story of smoulderingly passionate infidelity (paradoxically  and yet effectively described in cool dispassion) is chronologically followed by a subsequent tale which is immersed in the mind-numbing violence and brutish existence of World War I's Western Front.  The resultant "disconnect" between the prewar and wartime circumstances of the novel's central character--a singularly self-contained business functionary who transforms somehow into a quietly combative junior British infantry officer--couldn't be greater, and becomes the central theme of the novel.  His progression through literal and figurative hell (concisely, almost clinically captured in spar prose) represents nothing less than a aching eulogy for a complete generation of young men who were either physically or spiritually destroyed by a war of unbelievable personal degradation.   And yet, the book finally ends on a note of unexpected--if delayed--optimism, which in lesser hands might seem contrived but with Faulks' skillful narration feels only proper.  Tempted though I might be, I can feel no  cynicism about the ultimate triumph of life over death.  This is a true testament to the superlative nature of this book!
