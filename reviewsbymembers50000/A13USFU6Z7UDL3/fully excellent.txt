 I agree with each of the reviews which predate this one. Katrin Eismann has written a wonderful book, the very best on the specialized techniques involved in building photo composites since some much earlier texts which accompanied the debut of layer masks and adjustment layers (in and around about the Adobe Photoshop version 4 era).   A couple of observations of my own are:  1.  that the worked examples in the book cover a wide range of potential applications from commercial graphics (for advertising, web design, etc., inclusive of some useful short-cuts) all the way to fine art photographic projects, 2.  nevertheless, the author is not afraid to issue a challenge (or two) to some of the "conventional wisdoms" which have firmed-up in the world of digital photography, 3.  that the book works well on at least three fronts:  -- the detailed description of many multi-step techniques (including criteria for pre-judging which is the likely best technique for the task at hand),  -- an encouragement for the faint-hearted to just keep going (the possibilities in traveling between original image inputs and satisfaction with the composite output are, after all, truly limitless), and,  -- following from this, that the book is one of the few Photoshop treatises which truly "gets" the foundation that the very best outputs result from some type of pre-visualization (where the reader is encouraged to veer away from working restrictively, either in terms of composing just one photographic input image or of gaining just a specific visual effect from Photoshop, by which she or he will miss the opportunity to have the two activities work in a complementary way).   If I had any criticism at all it would be that in a book of 500+ pages, and priced at $50+, no space could be made to cover the utility of third-party plug-ins for Photoshop (as they could augment the assembly and finishing of photo composite images).  But, given the scope of what is accomplished within the worked examples presented throughout the entire book, this is a very minor detraction.
