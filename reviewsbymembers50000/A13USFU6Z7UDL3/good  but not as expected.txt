 I am a little disappointed with this book.  It contains exactly the best plan right on the cover and in the Introduction - that what is needed for a reader involved with natural world photography is a specialized, workshop-type tutorial. Better still, there's a short but practical philosophical point made right up-front, on the advantages of pre-visualizing the image output opportunities that Photoshop can provide whilst actually taking/making the original photographs. But, thereafter, specialization and pre-visualization disappear almost completely for a good long while. To the point that only at p. 107 (of 297 pages in total) can the authors exclaim: "At last we're in Photoshop itself!".  So, by then, about a third of the volume has been consumed with a preamble; a valuable one perhaps for the Photoshop beginner, but - equally well - covering material which is already available from numerous of the mainstream Photoshop guides. Moreover, the preamble itself is based entirely on digital capture in-camera (i.e., none of it covers converting conventional film-based images to digital files, even though many nature photographers still choose to shoot on film and/or have archives of excellent work on slides). Overall, the guts of the book, containing valuable workshop material for (say) a wildlife photographer, is just chapters 5 through 8 (though the last two of these are "Composites" and "Creative Effects", which will not appeal to everyone, at least not for a while yet...).  And as to whether there might be different or better options in image correction and optimization for say floral close-ups as distinct from landscapes, or yet for those opportunistic wildlife shots where the exposure is definitely wayward; well, we still do not know. Perhaps the book (plus CD) will be the most useful for a photographer who has just transferred to "shooting digital" and is also a newcomer to Photoshop's digital darkroom.
