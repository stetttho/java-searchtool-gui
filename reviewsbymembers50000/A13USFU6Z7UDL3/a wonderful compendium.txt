 In summary, this is a very insightful book, which works well on several different levels.  First, it is clearly intended to be inspirational - to draw its readers into new avenues of image making and creativity.  In this respect the book is wonderful, since it not only contains many intriguing and appealing images (and sets of ideas) worked through by the author herself, but also showcases work from other artists (many of whom have established high and worthy reputations in their own right).  It's a digital visual feast!  Secondly, the book is also intended to be instructional; to deal - essentially - with artist toolkit issues and specific project guidelines.  Here the biggest depth of detail is centered on what will likely be the most unconventional of approaches to the majority of readers.  For example, more information is provided on alternative physical media involved in many of the projects and categories of work - covering "non-standard" print media, materials for image transfers, pencils, fixatives, paints (including encaustic forms), etc.  Photographic technique and imaging software procedures are covered less comprehensively (in any event, and despite the comments of an earlier reviewer, this is not a book about Photoshop expertise).  Finally, the book is also a little bit of a memoir.  The author describes herself as an image maker rather than a photographer; but, nevertheless, she includes little pieces of information on the context of the original photography - what she was trying simply to record in that place on that day.  So, altogether, a splendid book - highly recommended.
