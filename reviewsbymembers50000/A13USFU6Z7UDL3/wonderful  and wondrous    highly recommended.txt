 This is a great book, full of practical guidance, inspirational ideas and impressive/intriguing images produced by the authors (all in about equal measure).  Just as one simple illustration of the scope covered, there are example images throughout the book taken using conventional film cameras (old and new, in several different formats), pinhole cameras and digital cameras, plus others generated via photograms and from digital scanners when used as "cameras".  Further, the book even includes work based on the use of found-object photographic originals (old magic lantern slides).  The mixed media artwork described in the book all uses conventional photography as its basis: but, as I counted, about fifteen different techniques are outlined (sic) by which added media can be incorporated into the final presentation of the image itself. And my count doesn't include a separate section which encourages the printing of images onto bolts or segments of fabric (using tee-shirt transfer film, for example).  Finally, at the very end of the book, there's a short chapter focused on depicting the passage of time via still images.  Personally I feel that this is one of the truly under-explored "provinces" of contemporary creative photography - particularly given all of the digital toolkits that are available today.  About the only reason for an aspiring fine art photographer not to buy this book would be if he or she wanted to find specific detailed routines for the use of Photoshop or similar photo-editing software.  In that circumstance, it might be best to purchase a companion handbook, just dealing with the basic application(s) of the software by itself.  But then again, he or she could wait until the author's newer book "Digital Photo Art" becomes available in the U.S. (currently it can only be found in the U.K.) ...
