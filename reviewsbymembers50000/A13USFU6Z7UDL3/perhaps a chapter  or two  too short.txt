 The digital graphics "revolution" has now been underway for long enough that people with almost a full career as a digital artist can author well produced books on the various specializations involved.  Such should be the case here.  Ms. Threinen-Pendarvis certainly holds the right credentials, since her book contains examples of her own work dating all the way back to 1987.  But while her book will certainly provide many readers with very detailed (and useful) recipes on how to use a PC plus imaging software plus a graphics tablet and pen to duplicate many traditional painting techniques, it also seems to me to have side-stepped an opportunity to do more exploring along the way.  Good artist's handbooks should not always be about technique; they might also try and at least encourage the reader to break new ground.  And it is in this last area that this book falls short.  For example, many of the individual projects described in the book use a photograph as a starting point.  Most often the next step is to create a sketch from the photo image, using the graphics tablet.  But the potential use of software - for example the sketch and/or stylize filters native to Photoshop - to do this autonomously is not covered at all.  Additionally, while some basic use of image layer blending is covered on a project-by-project basis, it is not covered thoroughly as an integral means of assembling a final (and fine art) output.  Further, the use of adjustment layers incorporating masking makes no appearance in this book at all. `tis a shame.
