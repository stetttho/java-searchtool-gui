 My daughter and I read this book right after "The Mystery of King Karfu" which features the same detective/photographer team.  Both books are presented in a diary scrapbook format, so the illustrations contain photographs, sketches, ticket stubs and all manner of other interesting objects related to the case (as well as varios stains and blotches).  This format allows the child to explore the story beyond just the narrative and shows Cushman's mastery of the picture book format.  The clues presented are easily used by a young child to solve the mystery and the "red herring" is difficult enough to be challenging without being frustrating.  The book also contains a maze for readers to work through as part of the final solution to the adventure, further involving the child in the narrative.  My daughter and I hope that Mr. Cushman will write more installments of the Seymour Sleuth series!
