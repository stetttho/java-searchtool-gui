 I bought this game for my toddler because I thought it would be nice for her to have the tin box, which is beautiful and very helpful since it has molded spaces for the parts inside.  The playing pieces are great, and they're not flat.  Very sturdy too.  The big problem with this edition of Candyland is that after they went through all the trouble of making the greta box, board, playing pieces, they added a cardboard castle that needs to be assembled each time you play (at leats my daughter MAKES me put it together, I'd play without it!).  The cardboard is thin and starts to wear immediately after the first time you assemble it, not to mention how awful it gets after many uses. Get the kid the game, but throw away the castle before you give it to him/her.
