 I had wonderful memories of Lennart Nilsson's wondrous photography and book from the 1975 edition my mother got me at age 3.  Now, as a mother and a doula I wanted to share it with my own daughter.  I did not like the new edition at all.  The old edition included more photographs of the developing fetus as well as actually explaining reproduction.  It includes multi age nude group photos so children can see the differences between male and female, and there is a photograph of a crowning infant, rather than the sanitized and cleaned up newborn of this book.  Overall, I found this book dumbed down and wanting.  If you want your child to really understand what is happening inside your body, and how it started, I would recommend Nilsson's "A Story in Pictures" form 1975, which you can get used.  It is realistic, everything is illustrated with photographs, not cartoons.  The only exception to that is penetration, which is represented by a cross section illustration. It is overall a much better introduction to reproduction and childbirth for children than all of these patronizing, cartoony books that are so common nowadays.
