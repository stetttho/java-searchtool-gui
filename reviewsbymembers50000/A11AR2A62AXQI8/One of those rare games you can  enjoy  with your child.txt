 As a parent who enjoys board games, I can go on forever about the frustration of dumb and boring children's games.  But there are always certain exceptions: fun, simple games which can challenge the adult and still allow the child a fair chance to beat you.  Rapid 4 is one of those games.  The instructions are extremely simple:  take a marble, drop it through the game wall (which constantly changes, due to the lever ramps in it) and try to form a row of 4 marbles in the exit tray.  You can play it quickly and mindlessly, just letting the marbles fall where they may or try to figure out exactly how it will bounce and roll inside the game structure.  It's trickier than you think.  Games are usually quick, you choose the length of the games by deciding how many rounds you wish to go. If your kid can manipulate a marble enough to drop into into a round hole and is old nough not to try to swallow it, you will both have fun with this game.
