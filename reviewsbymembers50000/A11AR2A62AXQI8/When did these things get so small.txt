 I had one of these styling heads as a kid and seem to remember that mine was bigger than this one.  Still, this toy is pretty good and even my friends like to play with her.  The clips and pins may be hard to work fir very little fingers (my toddler needs help), but they are perfectly fine for bigger kids.  A few extra accessories would have been nice.  For example, Teresa has pierced ears, but no earrings.  I still look forward to letting my three year old tangle her hair instead of mine.
