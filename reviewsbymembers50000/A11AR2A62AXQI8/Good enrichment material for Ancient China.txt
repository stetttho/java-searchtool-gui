 This is the second item from Running Press' "Treasure Chest" series that I have used (I bought "Ancient Egypt" before.)  Overall, the Ancient China set is good, and I would recommend it, but it does have some problems.   The calligraphy kit worked better than I expected, and we both had a good time with it.  My daughter lost the I Ching coins, so I never got to try them.  Both the Chinese chess and the Great Wall watchtower model were relatively simple, but the instructions were unclear, this was the biggest flaw of the whole kit.  The map and stickers were a hit with my daughter,as was the deities poster.  I was surprised to see some of the figures included, like Shi-Huangdi (no mention of his campaign of terror and book burning) and Buddha while Confucius was excluded.  The folding fan was cute, but stickers don't adhere too well to the folds, as can be expected.  The book provided excellent snippets of information surrounded with great illustrations, I was very pleased with it.   Overall, I would say my 7yo and I enjoyed it and I intend to buy more kits form this series.
