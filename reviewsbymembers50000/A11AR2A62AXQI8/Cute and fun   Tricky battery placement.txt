 This doll is quite cute (I think she's a lot prettier than her blonde counterpart) and she works pretty well.  My daughter has had lots of fun demonstrating her to everyone who visits.  Be very careful with the battery placement, the doll will not work unless the plastic separator/placeholders are correctly positioned and I nearly broke these (possibly because I had not read the instructions and had no clue what they were).  I know I'm not the only one who skips the instructions out there.  Be careful with her top also, as it tends to come off rather easily.
