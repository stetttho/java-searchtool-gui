 My daughter and I have just finished reading a lot of introduction to prehistory books.  This was, by far, my favorite.   The sections are divided logically into aspects of culture and civilizations, such as burial, art, dwellings and food.  For example, the "Early Homes" section shows 6 different types of dwelling, each with a descriptive caption.  Examples are not just drawn form Europe, either, but from all over the world, which is a big plus.  The book also includes copies and reconstructions of prehistoric art accompanied by legends that enumerate and decsribe the elements in each.  The book works well for multilevel teaching, a small child can listen to the short introduction for each chapter and the names of all the pictures; older children can get into the specific information framing the copious illustrations. This book is an excellent springboard to start learning about prehistoric peoples with children.
