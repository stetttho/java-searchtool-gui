 I bought this book when I was a junior in High School because I enjoyed fantasy and the cover was so beautiful; it turned me into a fairy tale scholar.  I have since written at least 5 university papers on fairy tales, specifically Beauty and the Beast, and this book has been in every bibliography.  I even did my Honors Research project on Beauty and the Beast because of the incredible influence Jack Zipes has had on me.  Through this book I learned what fairy tales were really like, not those bowdlerized silly things that we usually read, and I learned that other people took them seriously.  The introduction is fantastic background into the French figures whose tales have so far become a part of our culture, and the stories are not the kind you are prone to find in usual anthologies. Along with fairy tale as Myth and The Wondrous Fairy Tales of Western Culture,I recommend it wholeheartedly, especially if you are interested in pursuing a scholarly approach to wonder tales.
