 My three year old daughter just got this one for Christmas and she loves it, but the button that she has to press to keep the light on has to be pushed very hard and most of the time it shuts off on her.  In fact, sometimes I find it hard to turn on again.  I wonder if I got a dud?  Still, she loves the color change feature, which she can use just fine, and the thing has stood up to several big drops already (not to mention a nasty banging with her new skates).  Overall a good toy, especially for bigger kids who have the strength for the mechanism.
