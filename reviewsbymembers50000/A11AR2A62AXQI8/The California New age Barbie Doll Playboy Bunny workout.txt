 Some of the other reviewers said it best when they described Dolphina's workout as a Playboy Bunny tape.  The constant location and costume changes are pretty, but they add nothing to the workout, the "goddess" element is uninformed pop-new age (I am a Pagan, so I don't necessarily have a problem with new age per se) and the camera angles are AWFUL.  Over and over the camera focused on Dolphina's head and chest when she was performing lower body movements.  Have you ever tried to mimic an ankle to chest undulation while staring only at a girl's breasts?  It's HARD.  On the other hand, the workout is fun, and my guy friends love to watch it.  At times the routines went from very simple steps to relatively hard steps without a perceptible transition, but perhaps this will become easier as I keep using the tapes.  It will work your arms well, and it does give you a general idea of the isolations involved in belly dancing.  It is simple enough for beginners, but I would not recommend it to anyone who has had more than three belly dancing lessons.  Borrow it before you buy if you can.
