 Gaiman is a gifted storyteller, and I believe he is at his best in short genres:  short stories, children's fiction, poetry.  This is a well chosen collection of 4 short pieces and a charming interview (by the author's daughter daughter).  Gaiman's interpretations of his work are excellent, and the whole collection left me wanting more.  It's children's literature at its best, in the hands of an author who does not equate childhood with idiocy.
