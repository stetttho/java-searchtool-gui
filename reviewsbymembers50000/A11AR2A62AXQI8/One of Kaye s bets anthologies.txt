 Marvi Kaye is an excellent anthology editor, and this is probably one of his finest anthologies.  It includes not only short stories, but also poetry and even one short play.  The dark aspects of love are thouroughly explored, in everything from stark realism, to fantasy, science fiction, horror, comedy; the variety is impressive, but Kaye manages to create unity of it all through his careful sub-thematic arrangement: Odd Couples, Worldly Love, Not of this World, Out of this World and Fatal Attractions.  The selections flow into one another masterfully, and I can honestly say that not a single one of them could be considered bad;they were all of exceeding quality.  I would be hard pressed to even recommend some of them over others; the book is so well arranged that each individual piece seems to play its part for the perfect final effect.
