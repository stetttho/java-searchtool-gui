 My 6yo daughter and I have been learning baout ancient Egypt, and I picked this book up to have add some light fiction to our theme.  It was great!  The narrative is presented as a diary/scrapbook with pictures, sketches, ticket stubs and a number of other objects that add visual interest and require very small children to make connections.  The clues were easy enough for a young child to make sense of and there was enough there to keep an adult laughing too (one of the clues was "a red fish").  The book also requires the reader to decode two messages using a simple substitution table (one letter=one symbol).  My reluctant little writer spelled out the whole message herself, several sentences' worth.  She also requested more Seymour Wombat books.  We just got "The Mystery of the Monkey's Maze" and look forward to enjoying more mysteries as Mr. Cushman writes them.
