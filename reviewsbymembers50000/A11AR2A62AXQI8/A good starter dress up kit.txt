 My three year old just got this for Christmas also, and she loves dressing up.  I belive she'll have to get a fashion doll now, because all of the sets come in duplicate: one for the girl and one for the doll.  The fashion doll house feature is a good bonus, and when the trunk is closed you still have space to fit in more dress up accessories as you add to your child's collection.  I wish I could find other sets like this, with other themes (not just "glamour") appropriate for a toddler like mine.  I have seen other dress up kits with more varied themes, but they really are for big kids.  Perhaps a set with career dress up items such as doctor, astronaut, etc.  Or fantasy and scifi sets.  Anything to expand the whole idea of roleplaying to more than one role.  I would not recommend this toy for a girl who is to much bigger than mine, because the play clothes fit my daughter perfectly. An older or larger girl might not be comfortable in the outfits.  Also, for the parents, be very careful when removing the labels attached to the trunk's sides.  Although I tried to be, I still ripped off some of the photos on the trunk's sides when I took these off.
