   I give this base a 3-star rating because it could be better.  As has been stated before me, this base is easy to set up (NO TOOLS!!), though I did have to wedge the legs of my all ready set up Jet contractors saw into it.  It might be easier if both are assembled at the same time.  I do like that it is a four wheel system, but... what's this, no leveling system?  Come on, Jet.  }:-D  Also, and like many other bases, the rear does not have casters but locking wheels, which can be a little inconvenient in tight spaces... or if you have side/outfeed-table(s) attached, like I do. And all the wheels/casters have to be locked and unlocked individually.  This is a problem in tight spaces and if you have extended fence rails to contend with, and with the afore mentioned extension tables.   If I had it to do over again perhaps I would've spent a little more  on something else (e.g. on the Delta as mentioned by another reviewer), but I couldn't live without it.  For the money (edit: now ten dollars more...), it ain't bad, but it ain't perfect either.
