    As anyone who has read my other Amazon reviews can tell you this is not my first Skil 18V tool. I have only had mine for several weeks now and I LOVE IT!!  While the 5-3/8" Skil that I also own has it's place I will probably be using this one more often.     Powerful, quiet (for a saw), as advertised it is well balanced, accurate (for a hand-held saw) and the magnified flip up scale is an ingenious idea. It has more solid/stable adjustment controls and a real nice blade guard compared to the 5-3/8"er too. And of course the portability of battery power, but expect to have several charged batteries on hand as this thing goes through them FAST!  I've already used up three in the course of fifteen minutes.    As a leftie, my only complaint is that this saw has a traditional right sited/handed blade.     As before, I hope you find this review helpful, and Good Luck with your own dreams!
