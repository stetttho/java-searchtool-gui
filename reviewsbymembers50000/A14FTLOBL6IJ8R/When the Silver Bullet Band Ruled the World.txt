  Like many of us back in the mid-'70's, this album was my introduction to Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band, and what an introduction is was too.  If you like live music, recorded or in person, this is one you need to get.  It Rocks, it's funky, and it's full of energy.    By this time the recording engineers and technicians had greatly improved their skills at recording live concerts (analog.  Remember tape machines?) and this is a good example of that.  Even in it's original form it was good and clear.  My very favorite use for this particular music was/is driving.  (A little personal history here) By the early eighties I was making regular trips to New York city by car and Live Bullet got me through the traffic and mayhem of Friday afternoon traffic in New Jersey and Manhattan many o' times.    Nearly all of this album has a driving beat (no pun intended) and seems to push you along.  I always felt more in tune with the road and the traffic when listening to it.  As another reviewer here states, Seger was at his very best in concert and the audience fed him and consequently, the band.   Their studio recordings are generally a disappointment and pale by comparison after Live Bullet.  I have NOTHING bad to say about Live Bullet.  I hope this review helps you, and Good Luck with your own dreams.
