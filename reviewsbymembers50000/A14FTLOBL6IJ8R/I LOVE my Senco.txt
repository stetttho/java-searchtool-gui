  This gun is lightweight, reasonably quiet, well balanced and I like it just a bit better than the more expensive Porter Cable I received as a gift. It just "feels" better in the hand.   My only complaint is that I am limited to 1-1/4" nails, enough for most jobs I do.  If I had it to do over again, I would spend just a little more and buy the FinishPro 18 instead (2" capacity.)  I hope this helps!  Good Luck.
