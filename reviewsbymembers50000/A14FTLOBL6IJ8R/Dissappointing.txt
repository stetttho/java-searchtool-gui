  I bought this DVD on a whim, sight unseen from the $5.99 bin on Val Kilmer's reputation as an intelligent and entertaining actor.  After viewing it with my wife we both agree with the general feeling of the reviews listed here.  It SHOULD be a better movie.  It SHOULD be a captivating story.  It HAS a terrific cast.  So, why is it so boring to watch?  I respect Val Kilmer's acting and his integrity as an actor.  Most critics seem to agree that he is an "intelligent" actor.   Why is he so miscast in so many things?  Would someone please write a script specifically with the talents of Val Kilmer in mind... please?   This story tries to be many things from a story of independance to a love story, but fails pretty miserably at all that it attempts.   Like many of us, I was introduced to his acting in the low budget, now cult icon film "Real Genus" (naturally, I have reviewed this film also) where as the young, smart mouthed, fast talking College senior he literally stole the show from Gabe Jarrett who got top billing and was virtually never heard from again.  I'm sorry to say that overall it has been his best (high profile) vehicle to date, though I personally thought it unfair that he was universally panned as Batman.  Good Luck with your own dreams.
