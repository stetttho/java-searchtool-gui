   I bought this exact same stand on eBay for less than half the money.  It's made in China, of course, ("they" called it a "Pit Bull" stand) and it is not really heavy enough.  It will need to be bolted and bracketed to the floor for stable operation. This is not a difficult thing to do, but it's a good idea.     As you can see from looking closely at the picture, there are only two holes drilled(?) and they are in the MIDDLE of the mounting plate (??).  I don't know a your grinder, but mine mounts with a more traditional four bolt pattern. I had to drill my own holes.       On the good side, it is easy to assemble and is 32" high for most people of average height. The Delta sales literature doesn't tell you this either.  If you're taller, like I am, you may want to consider a taller (35") stand.        If you simply MUST have this stand, buy it from eBay.  There are hundreds of people reselling Chinese made tools there and they are easy to find.  Including shipping, mine cost around $28.00.     I hope this help you and Good Luck with your own dreams!
