  edit-01/23/2006: It's been several months now and I still LOVE this blade.  I have used it to cut everything from oak to treated pine to plastic but it even handles that stuff like a real trooper.  It is a little slow to rip with, but not bad.  For what I do in my hobby shop I don't mind at all. The last cut I made with it is as smooth as the first.  original text: I have to admit that I only bought this blade this morning and couldn't wait to try it out.  I installed it on my Jet JWTS-10 table saw, the cheapest of the line. I have made other improvements to the saw but this blade has been one of the best.     In my review of the saw I state that the original blade is good for a starter blade. This one DEFINITELY takes it to the next level and beyond.  No tear out AT ALL, either ripping or cross cutting.  SMOOTH finish.  NO SAW MARKS!!!  And it's fairly quick at ripping too.  I was concerned about buying another blade designed primarily for cross cutting, and Freud doesn't rate this blade as the best for ripping either, but my results so far have been excellent.  I may add a blade stabilizer, though Freud claims you don't need one with this blade.  The plate is a bit thicker near the arbor than it is at the teeth.  A 3.5" should do it.   Enough said.  Buy it!!  For around $35.00 you can't, CAN'T go wrong.  A Forrest Woodworker of this quality will cost you nearly THREE TIMES as much.  I hope you find this review helpful, and as always, Good Luck with your own dreams!
