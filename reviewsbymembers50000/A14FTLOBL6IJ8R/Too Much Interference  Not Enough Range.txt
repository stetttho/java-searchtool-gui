 I received these as a birthday gift just days ago to replace my outdated 25 channel Panasonics.  These are NOT a replacement. These are worse!! They have a lot of nice features, but as phones, work terrible!!!  Also, as stated before, you may only use one handset at a time!!  WHAT????  After the initial battery charge of 20+ hours, I installed the base unit and discovered that I couldn't move around at all w/o experiencing static.  I couldn't go outside w/o losing the signal, then was unable to reconnect.  I have moved the base unit to another location only to experience the same symptoms.  I plan to return these if I can.  Don't waste your hard earned money on these.
