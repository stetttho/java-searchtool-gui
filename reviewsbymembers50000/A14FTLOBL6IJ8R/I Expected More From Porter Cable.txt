 Yet another Christmas present from my wife, and a very thoughtful one too, but I own Senco's and this PC just doesn't cut it.  To me it seems rather clunky and old school.    I recently installed some 5/8" plywood shelves that I wanted to pin into the poplar supports.  A project this gun should've handled with ease.  Not only did I have a difficult time getting this gun into the space, which my Senco fit into, but it wouldn't even sink the nails!!  I really couldn't believe it, so I got out my Senco and using the same 90 psi had no problems at all... it even countersunk them.   I had recently read a review of the 250 "A" model in a magazine and they loved it.  Could there be that much difference? PC, like all tool companies, should stick with what they do best...  in PC's case probably routers. I'll stick with Senco for nail guns.  After reading my own review perhaps I should've given it two stars. Stick with the Senco.  Thanks and I hope you find this review helpful.  And, Good Luck with your own dreams!
