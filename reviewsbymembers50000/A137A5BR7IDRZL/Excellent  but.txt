 I read the first edition of the book (Anchor paperback, 1965), and I concur with the other reviewer that it is a first-rate brief introduction to Wittgenstein's work.  The short biographical introduction has a big problem, however. About LW's service in WWI, Hartnack writes, "At the outbreak of the first World War he enlisted in the Austrian army, was trained to be an officer, but was taken prisoner by the Italians at the time of the Austrian debacle."  That makes it sound like LW took the officer route, was quickly captured, then sat out the war.  Well, as they say, that could hardly be further from the truth.  According to Martin Gilbert's, 'The First World War," LW won the Silver Medal for Valour Second Class as a lance corporal, "a rare honor for someone of such a low rank."  This was in June of 1916, on the Eastern Front.  In July 1917, he won the Silver Medal for Valour as an artillery observer, directing the guns under "heavy fire," again against the Russians.  In June 1918 he was recommended for Austria's highest award, the Gold Medal for Valour, for "exceptionally courageous behavior," this time in a fierce artillery and machinegun duel with the British, in which his "heroism won the total admiration of the troops."  Wittgenstein was not captured until November of 1918, at the virtual end of the war.  And, incredibly, it was during these years of combat that he wrote the 'Tractatus,' delivering the manuscript to Russell at the end of the war.
