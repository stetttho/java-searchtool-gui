 Beware of the new cut-price printing of this set being offered various places for $99.99.  The ads say you are saving $180.00, but it's not the same product.  The cheap version has a cheap glued binding and no dustjackets.  These books are too thick and heavy to be bound that way.  With mine, the picture pages in the center just cracked loose and fell out.  A 200-page novel that will be read once can have any kind of binding, but heavy reference books that will be used repeatedly are a different story.  What looks like a super deal on eBay or Amazon Market is likely to be the cheapo version.    Earlier printings are available used for about the same price, with dust jackets and some of them (not all) have a far-superior sewn binding.  It's nice not to worry about pages coming loose, and to have a book that lays open flat.  The ISBN does not tell you what you are getting.  For example, the May 1993 reprint of Vol 4 has a sewn binding, but the otherwise identical November 1988 printing does not.  Maybe there were complaints about the earlier printing coming apart, I have no idea.   I don't know whether the set Amazon sells for $176.40 has a sewn or glued binding; my advice is to call Eerdmans and find out before buying. The text is always identical, as long as it's the "Fully Revised" version; I believe the last volume, Vol 4, was first issued in its fully revised version in 1988, the other volumes earlier than that.  The first printings of fully revised Vol 4 have 1211 pages, later printings have 1240.  The difference is a set of errata pages, which you can photocopy from a library.
