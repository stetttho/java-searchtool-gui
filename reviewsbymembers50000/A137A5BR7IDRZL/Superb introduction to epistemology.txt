 Landesman has taught epistemology at the graduate and undergraduate levels for many years, and this book reflects that experience in finding ways to get these often rather abstruse ideas across.  It is everything an introductory treatment should be.  It is very intelligently organized and written with an obvious eye to clarity at each point.  It gives the reader a basic understanding of the key issues in the history of epistemological debate, and it also provides a look at questions closer to the current frontier of the  discipline.  To take the reader from Descartes to Quine in 200 pages without losing focus along the way is no mean feat, but Landesman does it.  If there is a better introduction to this philosophical specialty, I haven't seen it.  Recommended without reservation.
