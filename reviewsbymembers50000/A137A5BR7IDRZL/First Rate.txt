 The person who develops an interest in philosophy is likely to discover that, much as you might prefer it weren't so, you can't get very far without a decent knowledge of Kant.  Everywhere you turn, he keeps showing up. You can finesse Hegel, you can finesse Heidegger, but you can't finesse Kant. You have to bite that bullet, the only question is where to start. This is where to start.  Gardner has written a superb guidebook to Kant's Critique of Pure Reason, and by far the best available introduction to Kant, period. This book has been reprinted four times since it was published in 2000, and I think that's because there is nothing else like it. A few reviewers have complained about a lack of clarity here and there.  Well, maybe, (an early section on the problem of reality struck me that way on first reading), but we are talking about Kant here, after all. If you hit a patch like that, just plow ahead and come back and try that section again later on.  If it's a discussion of some specialized topic that doesn't interest you, skip it.  There is so much in Kant, that if you get most of it, you get a lot.  Besides describing and explaining Kant's ideas themselves, Gardner also does a terrific job of discussing the major issues and controversies connected with the interpretation and implications of those ideas. Some of those, like questions about the ontological and epistemological status of ultimate reality ("things in themselves"), have never receded from philosophical debate and probably never will.  Near the back is an excellent chapter that locates the CPR within the larger body of Kant's work; the final chapter describes the kind of reception the CPR got when it was originally published, and the sort of influence it has had subsequently.  The bibliography is outstanding, and if you want more, the philosophy department at University College London (Gardner  is a faculty member there) has outstanding bibliographic resources available on-line.
