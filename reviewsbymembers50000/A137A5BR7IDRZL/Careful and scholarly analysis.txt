 Comments between reviewers are generally an undesirable distraction, but the review below by "malenor" is so egregiously unethical that it demands comment.  The problem is that the reviewer, as he admits, HAS NOT READ THE BOOK he is reviewing!  Any such "review" deserves only to be utterly disregarded or, better yet, removed from the Amazon website.   What malenor did was to read the few pages available on Amazon, then arrogantly to proceed to write his "review."  The result, predictably, is farcical.  Malenor's insulting contention that Bennett, a Kant scholar of the first rank, does not understand Kant's analytic-synthetic distinction is preposterous on its face.  The problem, of course, is that malenor does not comprehend what is at issue in Bennett's treatment of it.  Bennett questions Kant's claim that `7 + 5 = 12' is a synthetic proposition because that claim does not allow for chains of inference within a deductive system, but instead relies on what seems to be a psychological account to support the original distinction.  That is a cogent, serious, and productive line of criticism.  There is much more of similar quality to be found in this book, and malenor should consider someday taking the trouble to read it.
