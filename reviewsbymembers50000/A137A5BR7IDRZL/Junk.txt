 I bought one of these because it claimed to be heavy duty. Mine suffered electrical failure almost immediately.  And look at the grab nub on the cap.  It's smooth and beveled backwards (like a teepee instead of like a vee), so if your fingers are the least bit slippery, you cannot use that nub for its sole and only purpose, which is to remove the cap.  Poor reliability and careless design work by a company that's been making blenders far too long to be putting out a product like this.
