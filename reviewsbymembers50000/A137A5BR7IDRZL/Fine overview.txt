 Everything you ever wanted to know about the Dead Sea Scrolls, written by experts, up to date, and lavishly illustrated with drawings and magnificent photos. The experts who wrote the book seem to be on the skeptical wing of DSS theorizing, arguing that every aspect of the early consensus (Qumran was inhabited by sectarian Essenes, who wrote the DSS and hid them in area caves before being wiped out by the Romans) is much less certain than generally believed.  The story of how the scrolls were discovered, collected, and restored is highly interesting and very well described; but even more fascinating to me was the description of the vicious, cut-throat competition and in-fighting among the various researchers as they fought for decades over access to the materials.  And a unique copper scroll that contains clues about the location of huge quantities of gold and silver supposedly hidden in the area, perhaps as much as 100 tons of it, has caused more than one scholar to leave his desk and go looking.  There is much left to be learned about the origin and meaning of these scrolls, but no matter how that eventually turns out, they have greatly changed our view of Judaism as it existed around the first century.  The DSS show that there was far more diversity and ferment than previously thought.  For example, different groups seem to  have been operating according to different calendars.  That would mean different schedules of festival days, and may have resulted in different groups sharing the Temple on some basis.  It is even possible that the Essenes were not a single small community of extreme pietists holed up at Qumran, but just one more variety of Judaism, with adherents living in many places, including in an Essene Quarter in Jerusalem itself.
