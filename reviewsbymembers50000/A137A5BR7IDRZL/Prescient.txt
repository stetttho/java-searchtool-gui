 A first novel with the kind of uneveness that you might expect, but a very good read, and often very funny -- especially if you've spent some time around universities. Liberal academics are the target here, although the book is not unsympathetic or mean-spirited; he's writing about Britain, but it connects with the US scene pretty seamlessly.  "Liberal" here refers to the 1950s version (the book came out in 1959) of the well-meaning socialist left, with its ideological moorings in the 1930s and beginning to entertain guilty doubts about the perfectibility of either man or society. Bradbury was writing before the appearance of the New Left, Black Power, militant feminism, and political correctness, but his antennae were up and humming. He saw what was coming, and something about why it would all find a home among university liberal arts faculty.  There is a fascinating Afterword, where Bradbury writes about the context of the times, and how he came to write the book.
