 Viewed side by side, this is a much nicer Bible than the pebble-grain bonded leather ones; those don't seem enough like real leather.  This one does; it looks right, feels right, and smells right.  I gave it four stars instead of five because it doesn't seem to be available with indexing.  I would also have preferred gold edging to the silver that mine came with, but that's a matter of individual taste only.  I didn't like the rather cheap-looking stamped text on the spine, so I put some acetone on a soft cloth and wiped that away.  The stamped text impressions without the silver fill make for a much-improved appearance.
