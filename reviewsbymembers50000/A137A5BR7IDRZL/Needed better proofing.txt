 A nice looking book, but as I get into it the need for better editorial work is showing.  The battle of Pharsalus is mistakenly placed in Thrace instead of in Thessaly, and two pages later the battle of Philippi is called the battle of Pharsalus! Another reviewer noted that Tacitus is misspelled in the Foreword. This book was published in 1995, so things like this should have been fixed by now.  Maybe the rest will be acccurate, but so far it does not inspire confidence.
