 I confess a weakness for this kind of format, a fictional situation in which historical figures meet around a table and argue their various points of view face-to face. This short book is an especially nice example of the genre, with the protagonists meeting around the dinner table in Cambridge on a stormy English night in 1949.  It recalls a certain variety of detective story, and in a way that's what it is.  But the essential mystery, what it means to be a thinking human being, is not finally solved.   Many of the key issues connected with language, thought, and the possibilities for machine intelligence are touched on in these conversations, giving the reader a good sense of the kinds of  philosophical and technical questions that remain unresolved even today.  The mode of presentation is probably about as entertaining a one as possible for an introduction to this kind of material.  At a minimum, I think your reaction to the book will tell you whether you have enough interest in the subject matter to pursue it much further.  But even if you don't, you will have encountered a great many stimulating ideas in these pages.  And you will know enough not to have to sit there like a stupid lump should the subject of AI (Artificial Intelligence) come up in conversation.  The book does not go as far as some reviewers would have liked, but I think it nicely does the introductory overview job it set out to do.  My only quibble is that while Chomsky's later ideas about language are presented (Casti admits the anachronism as a way to get certain ideas into the conversation), behavioral psychology is not given the benefit of a similar updating.  Skinner's work on verbal behavior was quite sophisticated, much akin to the view here put forth by Wittgenstein, and far from the old Watsonian stimulus-response version of behaviorism used as a foil in the book.  That was a difference, by the way, that Chomsky never managed to comprehend.
