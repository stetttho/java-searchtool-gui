 A terrific read, and an absolute must for anyone with even a passing interest in recent philosophers.  Wittgenstein and Popper were two of the most difficult, driven, egotistical, and contrary individuals imaginable, and completely brilliant to boot. As expats from very different social strata of pre-WWII Vienna, and given their sharply opposed views about what philosophy should be about, a clash of some kind was inevitable.  But combat between rival philosophers usually takes place in print; this one was up close and personal, with luminaries like Bertrand Russell present as onlookers.  The reader has to wonder what might have happened if there had been two fireplace pokers available that night in Cambridge, instead of only one.  A book not to be missed.
