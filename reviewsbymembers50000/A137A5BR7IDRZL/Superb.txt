 If you have never read the New Testament, read it long ago, or only sampled around in it in no organized way, this book is for you.  It will have you read the NT books, and some of the non-canonical works, in historical order and in light of the various controversies and agendas they reflect.  White really knows his stuff, and he nicely demonstrates the gradual consolidation of the NT canon, and the orthodox consensus it represents.  The NT can seem to be something of a hodge-podge of overlapping Gospels and epistles, but there are good reasons why it is like it is.  Whether the author has in a few cases over-imposed his explanatory scheme on the material is a matter for Biblical scholars to debate, but I found this to be a very plausible account.  If you follow White's presentation and read the works as he discusses them, you will spend a few weeks, at least, working your way though the book; but it will be well worth the investment.  Be aware, though, that this is an extended and serious argument, not a popularizing superficial treatment that you can read with one eye on the TV. The book is tightly written, and you will have to pay attention.  Even so, I found myself losing the thread once in a while and having to go back and re-read a section.     Committed Christians of conservative stripe may be made uncomfortable here and there, but there is no need for that.  This kind of historical reconstruction exists at right angles to the spiritual content of scripture, and to the leap of faith that believers must be willing to make in any case.  Highly recommended for anyone with an interest in NT writings, from whatever perspective.
