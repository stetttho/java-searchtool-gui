 A very impressive first novel and the perfect summer read. Plot, characters, fabulous Aegean location, non-stop action, love interest, I don't see how it can miss as a movie; the screenplay writes itself. If this doesn't end up on the screen, the author needs to find himself a new agent.  I like face-paced books, and this one is warp speed all the way.  Hang on!
