 I guess you could say I'm not really a musical fan (or I didn't used to be), but after I saw the movie Chicago (which I'm going to rent on DVD when it comes out) I had to go out and buy the soundtrack since I loved the music in the movie. Let me tell you, I'm glad I got the CD. It's great. I never realized Catherine Zeta Jones and Renee Zellweger were such good singers.  Overture/And all that Jazz - I love this song. Along with being the first song on the soundtrack, it's the first song that was performed in the movie. Catherine Zeta Jones does a great job in this song. Her voice is cool. It's unique. When you're good to Mama - This song has a good beat. I've never heard Queen Latifah sing before! Cell Block Tango - This is my favorite out of all the song on the soundtrack. And it's funny too, when the women say lines such as "and then he ran into my knife. He ran into my knife ten times" and "it was a murder but not a crime". All I care About - This is the first song I've head Richard Gere sing. His voice is really interesting. It's hard to explain the tone of his voice. Roxie - I like this song. It's cool. Mister Cellophane - Wow, this song is really cool. I don't know why.  These are the songs I like the most. Half of the other ones I didn't mention were almost as good. The rest of them I just don't like. If you like the music from the movie, buy this CD!
