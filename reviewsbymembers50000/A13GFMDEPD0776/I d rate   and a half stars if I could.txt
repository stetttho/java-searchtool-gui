 Something I found rather amusing in this book was in an early chapter. Maria and Ken went to see a movie, and after the movie Maria was discussing it, saying "All these movies make it seem like [teenagers are] incapable of being with members of the opposite sex without wanting to jump them." Then 5 or 6 pages later you have Conner talking to Elizabeth. He can barely get through a sentence without thinking how gorgeous she is, how nice her stomach is, how nice her body is, and how much he wants to kiss her. Yep, Conner definitely seems like he wants to "jump" Liz. Basically, one second you're listening to Maria talk about how teenagers don't just think about kissing and sex and the next second you have a scene where Conner's hormones are raging because he wants Liz so badly. Did the writer do that intentionally? *Shrug* Maybe. Moving on... Has Conner realized he has feelings for Liz? Yes, he has. At the end of the book he admits he loves Liz...not to her, naturally, but to himself. And that's a huge step for him. I don't care much for the Liz rebelling plot. It's annoying, but if you like Liz acting rebellious then also check out the Sweet Valley High book (#7) Dear Sister. Now the Maria and Ken plot. It's cute. They go on "dates". Maria doesn't think they're dates, despite what Jessica and Elizabeth say. The absolute best part of the book with the two of them is at the end when they dance together.  There's the Conner/Megan/Gary plot. Not much to say here. I just don't like Gary. What an a** This book is worth checking out if you like reading Sweet Valley High/Senior Year books or if you like reading about teen romance.
