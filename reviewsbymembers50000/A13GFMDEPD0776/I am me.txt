 I feel like I'm the only one, but I like this CD. Forget the SNL incident, the McDonalds incident, the Orange Bowl incident and whatever else. I like her music. It's good. Highlights from this album are the first single "Boyfriend", "Coming Back For More", where Ashlee sings (I know that's subjective) about not being able to stay away from a guy that's not good for her, "Burning Up", "Dancing Alone", and her two SNL songs, "Catch Me When I Fall" and "Beautifully Broken". Is it better than her debut? Well...no, but there are some really good songs on this album. However, while I could listen to "Autobiography" for a long time, I got a little tired of this album faster. Still good, though.
