 You couldn't take her home because she was misundastood, and now she's saying "Try This" Let's face it: Pink's second single "God is a DJ" is better than her first one, "Trouble". The lyrics are great ("If god is a DJ, life is a dance floor...you are the music") and it has a good beat. "Walk Away" is another one of my favorite song, which is about a guy who walks away "when times get hard". I like "Unwind" also ("I had the pain like the rest of them. That's why I'm always laughing. I'm troubled and brilliant and miserable too". Nice). There are other good songs, like "Oh My God" and "Waiting for love", and bad ones, like "Catch me while I'm sleeping" and "Hooker".  It's a good CD. Not awful, not great. Good.
