 I gave this album a few listens through, beginning to end. Not bad. It's a solid album, pop/rock or whatnot. Nothing to spectacular, but it's good. One gripe, though, is that there are too many love songs. And "You're Everything" makes me cringe a little bit because of its lyrics. I don't care who's singing this song. The lyrics are just too sappy for me. He sings "I'd stick my hand in the flame, subject myself to the pain/ I'd even sleep in the rain/God, I'd do anything". Umm...okay? But it's a nice CD to listen to in your car, especially "It's My Life". Very relaxing. And keep in mind that I don't listen to male singers for the most part.
