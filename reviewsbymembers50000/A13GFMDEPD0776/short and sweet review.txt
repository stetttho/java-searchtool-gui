 Standout tracks, in my opinion, are "Early Mornin", "Showdown", "Toxic" and "I've got that (Boom Boom)". "Breathe on me" is the song that you can imagine hearing in a club filled with tons of sweaty people. It's pretty good and the lyrics are hot ("Boy don't stop `cause I'm halfway there"). But I can't stand the song "Brave New Girl" (it's too upbeat and weird and annoying). Overall, the songs really grow on you. I recommend it if you bought any of her previous albums.
