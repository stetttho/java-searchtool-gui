 On her latest album, Real Fine Place, Sara sings about a lover that did her wrong on `Cheatin' to the unconditional love she receives from her father on earth and her father in heaven (God) on the track `You'll Always Be My Baby' to the bond she shares with her husband on `The Secrets That We Keep'. Great vocals all the way through and worth checking out.
