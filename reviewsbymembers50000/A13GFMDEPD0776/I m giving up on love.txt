 The very first song I heard by Miranda Lambert was `Kerosene', and I immediately fell in love with this song about her cheating boyfriend. I never watched Nashville star, so I have no previous exposure to her, but that's okay. I'm glad I came across the song and this CD nonetheless.  My favorite tracks include: Kerosene, of course, I Wanna Die (which has great lyrics such as "If you're the death of me, darlin', I wanna die"), and Mama, I'm Alright. This on is about breaking away and reassuring her mother that she's going to be okay. She sings "Mama, I'm okay out here/I've seen how hard the world can be/My step is sure and I know my name/I'm strong just like you prayed I'd be".   She sings about young love in "Me and Charlie Talking" and her relationship with a married man in "Greyhound Bound for Nowhere", which is my favorite slow-paced song on the album. On her song "What About Georgia", I was hooked on the first note. It's about a guy who is "too scared to hold the hand that wants to help [him] up". He wants to be independent and live on the edge, but needs to realize he shouldn't forget about his mother who is still there for him and wants to be there for him. At least, that's the way I interpret the song. I could be wrong.  Overall, the theme of this album is about breaking away, growing up, and learning about life. "Mama, I'm Alright", "New Strings", "What About Georgia", and "Me and Charlie Talking" are examples of this. I'm so glad I came across this amazing CD and I think is one everyone should check out.
