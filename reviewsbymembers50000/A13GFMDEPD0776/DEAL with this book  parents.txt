 Okay, all these parents complaining about this book are seriously annoying. Yeah, this book has pictures of sex position, talks about orgasms, masturbation, and oral sex...what's wrong with that? Your children, as hard as it is to believe, are going to find out about this stuff sooner or later. Maybe they already have. (At school, on TV, from friends...) You can't hide it forever. Just face it. I doubt it's going to make your daughter want to run out and have sex with someone. If they do, maybe you're partly to blame. This book deals with sexual positions and what not, but it also talks about protection, such as condoms and Depo-Provera (and tells you the effectiveness and how to use it, the advantages and disadvantages) and about STDs like AIDS and Chlamydia (PREVENTION, symptoms, how you can contract it...). It talks about rape, adoption, sexual preference, molestation, date rape, drugs (and their risks), periods, friends, fitting in, boobs, and just about being a girl. What's wrong with that? If I had a daughter, I would definitely give it to her.
