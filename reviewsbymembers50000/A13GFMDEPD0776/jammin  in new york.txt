 George Carlin. I can't believe I've gone this long without listening to his material. Then again, I'm only 18. "Jammin' In New York" is great, funny, hilarious. I especially love his take on flying ("`Put the mask over your face and breath deeply'. Sure, I have no problem with that. I always breathe normally when I'm in a six-hundred mile an hour uncontrolled vertical dive") and experiences that bring us together ("You ever been talking to yourself and someone comes into the room and you have to make believe you were singing?"). It's coarse and it's fun.   Also check out Complaints and Grievances, You Are All Diseased, and Parental Advisory.
