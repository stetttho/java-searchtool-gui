 I'm not one of Madonna's biggest fans. I've listened to a lot of the music she's put out as singles, but never had a desire to own any of her albums. However, when I heard "Hung Up" I didn't like it, but it eventually grew on me so I decided to give it a try just for the heck of it. I usually have to play the album a few times for it to grow on me, and this one was no exception. Some great tracks are her first single, Hung Up, as well as her soon-to-be single, "Sorry", "Let It Will Be", "How High", "Jump" and "Like it or Not". My favorite on the album would be "Push", where she sings "You push me to go the extra mile/You push me when it's difficult to smile". I'm not a big fan of "Isaac", which I usually skip; "I Love New York" is starting to grow on me a bit, but "Get Together" and "Forbidden Love" are not. While each song flows into the other, it's still easy to distinguish each track from the previous. This album hasn't persuaded me to go out and buy any of her other albums, but I must say that I really like it and I'm glad I purchased it.
