 I didn't care much for Clay on AI (or Ruben, for that matter), but I got the CD anyway since he has a really good voice. Well, there are a couple good songs on this CD, such as "Invisible", although some of the lyrics are weird ("if I was invisible then I could just watch you in your room"), "No More Sad Songs", and the chorus to "I survived you". Overall, though, I didn't really care for the CD. If you were a fan of him on the show, you'll definitely like this album.
