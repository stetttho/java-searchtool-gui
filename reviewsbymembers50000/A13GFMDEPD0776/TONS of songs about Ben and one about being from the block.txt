 Out of all the albums she has out, why did I have to buy this one? I was torn between Aaliyah's CD and hers. I should have gone with Aaliyah's. I got this one mainly because of the song "All I have", but now I don't like it that much. "Jenny from the block" was okay when I heard it the first few (or more) times, but then it started to get boring. A lot of the tracks on this CD sound the same to me. It's unbelievable (and not in a good way). "I'm glad" is an okay song, but it's just not that great. Plus, there are ONLY 11 songs? You might as well download them. Or just download the songs I mentioned. Why is every song (except "Jenny from the block") about Ben? Don't get me wrong, I like J-Lo, but this CD is terrible. And what's with the title (This is me...then)? Huh?
