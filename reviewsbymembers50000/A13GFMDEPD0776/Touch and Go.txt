 I defend Alanna too (see review by Christiana Davis)! Everyone hates her because she "stole" Conner!?! Okay, Conner has a mind of his own. He can do what he wants. Alanna's actually a pretty cool character. She goes through a lot, but all most people can say is that she's an alcoholic who needs to get a life and leave Conner and Liz alone. Alanna's parents annoy me. I don't know how she can put up with them. In this book, Alanna meets Sandy Bieche, a recovering alcoholic (i think). Alanna is worried that she and Conner should not be together since they're recovering alcoholic. Interesting storyline. Also in this book Andy decides to do Standup comedy at a club. The first time he goes, he bombs, but the second time he did awesome. Alot of the stuff he said was really funny. Okay, now the Will/Melissa/Aaron/Cherie plot. I like this plot, and i especially like what happened at the end of the book. Melissa sure puts a lot of her time and energy into something like trying to steal Aaron from Cherie. Overall, a good book. If you like/love Liz and Conner as a couple, and can't stand Alanna then maybe this isn't the book for you.
