 This DVD includes some great performances by Joss in concert in New York, and she sounds amazing. But I always like live performances better because there is just something very raw and amazing about them, and Joss's are just that. And she's so cute. Before almost each song she goes "I hope you like it". I really loved the performances of "Don't Know How", "Don't Cha Wanna Ride?" and "Jet Lag". The music videos for "Fell in Love with a Boy", "Super Duper Love" and "You Had Me" are included on the DVD, which is nice since I hadn't seen the videos before and I never seem to catch them on TV.
