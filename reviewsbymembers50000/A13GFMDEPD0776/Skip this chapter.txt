 This CD is so-so. There are a couple songs I like, including "Rain on me" and "Then ya gone" (which has a good message with lyrics like "See, everyday we complain about lil ups and downs/ We needa be thanking the lord that we're still around/ U gotta live everyday as if its ya last one"). Since most of the songs aren't catchy, don't have good lyrics or beats, you're forced to pay attention to Ashanti's singing, or lack thereof. It's not good. The tracks I mentioned would be sooooo much better if they were sung by someone with a really good voice like Mariah or Christina, but, nonetheless, they're still good. The only other song I like on this album is the first single from this CD, "Rock wit U (aww baby)". She does say "awww baby" way too much, though. Her voice sounded better on her debut album. Or maybe I didn't notice her voice because the songs were good.
