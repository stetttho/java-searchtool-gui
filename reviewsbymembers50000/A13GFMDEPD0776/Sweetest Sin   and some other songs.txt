 OK, Sweetest Sin isn't exactly single material in my opinion. The only 2 songs on this CD I could see as singles are "I Have Loved You" and "With You" But after listening to those songs a few times, I'm kinda sick of them. The best track on this CD is "I have loved you". No question about it. "Be" is okay, "Forbidden Fruit" is just weird. The beginning beat of this song sounds like something I've heard on a math CD-Rom. "Everyday See You" (couldn't they think of a better title for this song?) is boring and forgettable, "In this skin" is boring. If you like those kinds of songs (I do, but I just don't like THIS song) then check out "Unpretty" by TLC or "Beautiful" by Christina Aguilera, which are MUCH better. There are a couple more songs, but I forget the names. A lot of this CD is forgettable. She just goes on and on about Nick. And there aren't even that many songs. This CD reminds me of J-Lo's "This is me...Then", where her album is short and she drowns on and on about her lover boy Ben Affleck. Yeah, um, no thanks. But Jessica Simpson DOES have a better voice than J-Lo...well, most people do. I don't. What a shame. In conclusion, if you're a fan of Jessica and/or bought her previous CD's, then get it. But I wouldn't suggest it. Maybe if you want tons of love songs...I dunno. Go buy Christina Aguilera's "Stripped" album. It's MUCH better!
