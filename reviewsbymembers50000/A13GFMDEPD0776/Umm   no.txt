 He has an decent voice, i'll give him that. I've heard worse, believe me, but this album was awful. "Unchained melody" was so long and boring and it did seem like time went by slowly, "Sorry" was nice for a while, then it got boring and annoying, and "Timeless" is good, but only because Kelly sings in it. The rest are boring. "Inner child" is laughable. It's one of the worst songs i've heard, right up there with the hampsterdance and some other stupid songs. The lyrics in it are so bad that it's funny ("you gave me touchin' and lovin and took me to the moon"). But I guess it's not Justin's fault that the lyrics are bad. Oh well. I'm still blaming him for this bad CD.
