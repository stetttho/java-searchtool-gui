 Liz annoys me in this book. Throughout the book she is convinced that Conner still has feelings for her, but at the end when Conner goes after Alanna Liz goes home and realizes that she and Conner do not make a good couple. Please! She's probably only thinking this because Conner just ditched her for Alanna. If he hadn't done that she would have been all over him, but I don't exactly blame her ;) However, I did like the parts in the book where Todd and Conner both seemed a little jealous that Liz was with Jeff.  The Aaron/Melissa plot is really good. Also, I laughed at the name of the band Alanna and her mother went to see, "Boy Toy". Is that a real boy band?  I rate this book four stars only because I didn't care too much for the Jeremy/Trent plot. That was just boring.
