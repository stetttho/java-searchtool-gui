 I just finished reading this book, and now I'm hooked. I plan on getting the ones that follow from the library. I'd heard of this book for quite some time now, but was never interested in reading it until now. It's funny, cute, silly, and the main character, 25-year-old Becky Bloomwood, is adorable. I like her, partly because she reminds me of myself in some ways (not her shopping tendencies, but the way she tries to ignore her problems, and then tries to "fix" them, and then...*sigh*). I definitely recommend the book. It's all in good fun!
