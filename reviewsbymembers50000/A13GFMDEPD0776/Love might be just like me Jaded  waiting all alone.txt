 Anna Nalick's CD `Wreck of the Day' is an interesting one. Her lyrics really make you think, and each time you listen you find something new. "Citadel" is one of my favorite tracks, one about being scared of the "life down below", as she puts it. It's relatable because I think at some point in everyone's life, usually when they're starting something new, like College, there is a feeling of hesitancy, like `I don't know if I can do this'. She really brings that out when she sings "What if I fall? / What if I don't? / What if I never make it home? / What if I bleed? / What if I break? / And I find that I can't take the city below the Citadel holding my own hand?" She's saying, `What if I can't make it on my own?' By the way, a citadel is "a fortress for protecting a town".   Another great track is "Paper Bag", a song about a girl being insecure, yet knowing "someday we'll all be old and I'll be so damn beautiful", but in the meantime she'll hide her face under a paper bag because "if I can't see you then you can't see me". The lyrics make you visualize the girl, with her eyeglasses and wire around her neck.   Other standout tracks include the first single, "Breathe (2 AM)", "In The Rough", "In My Head" and "Wreck of the Day". Wreck of the day is a very slow, relaxing song that you can imagine listening to driving home after a hard day at work ("Driving away from the wreck of the day and it's finally quiet in my head/Driving alone, finally on my way home to the comfort of my bed") despite the fact that this song is about a love you must give up and leave behind.   I'm looking forward to her next album. She has amazing writing skills and an engaging voice.
