 I got a copy years ago when this first came out, and it is now so badly worn that I decided to pick up a fresh copy a couple years back when I saw them on sale.  If you have ever enjoyed, and now miss, The Far Side, this book is absolutely worth it.  The comics page just isn't the same without my daily dose of Gary Larson's twisted humor, though.
