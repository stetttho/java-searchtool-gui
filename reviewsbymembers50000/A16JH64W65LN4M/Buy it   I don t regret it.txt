 First off: don't skip through the end credits.  You can continue to play your game after finishing the main storyline.  What is with short XBOX action RPGs lately?  At least it does a better job with towns that Sudeki.  I don't think it quite tops Knights of the Old Republic overall, though it is very close.  There are so many cool things you can do, but I've found the controls and menus are surprisingly simple.  One downside is I wish the melee combat had a little more depth: there is little in the way of combos.  I like that peoples' reactions to you will often vary depending on the circumstances, and your behavior.  For example, attack a few wandering traders, and they will start to all run at the sight of you, once word gets around.    Even if the voice acting isn't Oscar quality, it at least is believable.  I think they sometimes ham it up intentionally, though, which I think keeps it a bit fun.  A lot of the interaction reminds me of The Sims games  The towns are a lot of fun to goof around in.  Gambling, buying houses, and interacting with the people is a blast.  I just wish there were more towns to do that in.  Nevertheless, I wasted quite a few hours just in the towns.  Graphic quality is pretty high.  I won't say too much, since it isn't that important to me, other than that there weren't any glaring problems there.  It is nice to be able to see the small changes in my character with time.  I tend to get down and just brawl in a fight, so my characters have often come out pretty scarred with time.  Also, the replay value is pretty high, due to the variety of possibilities in the character.  Of course, if you just like finishing the storyline, then you won't find this to be the case.  Me, I like trying things out and experimenting, and Fable is an excellent game for that.
