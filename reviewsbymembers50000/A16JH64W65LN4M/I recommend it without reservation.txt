 The amazing thing about this movie is how powerful it is without becoming gruesome.    For those people who have a hard time seeing graphic violence, this movie gets the point across without massive amounts of close-up blood-and-guts.    There is little else I can add about this movie that has not already been said.  I recommend you buy it, but even if you don't, at least borrow it or rent it.  I think it's one of those movies that has a strong potential to become a classic.
