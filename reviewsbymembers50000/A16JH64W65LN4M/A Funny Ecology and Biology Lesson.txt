 First off, I don't consider this to really be a children's book.  A kid would probably have to be at least around 7th grade before he/she is likely to get many of the jokes.  It's great for adults, though.  Gary Larson has always been popular with scientists and those who just love science, and this book is another reason why.  A friend of mine who teaches High School biology loved it so much she read it to her class one day.  If you liked The Far Side, you'll love this.
