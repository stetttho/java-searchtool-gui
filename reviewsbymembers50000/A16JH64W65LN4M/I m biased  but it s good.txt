 Since I'm related to the author, I was given this book with the expectation that I read it, and I could only hope that it would be a halfway decent read.  It is his first novel, so I had no idea what to expect.  I'm glad to be able to say that he did an excellent job, and I enjoyed the read.  It's a fun story, reminiscent of Ian Fleming's James Bond or Dirk Pitt from Clive Cussler's writing.  In this case, the hero works in the entertainment industry as a freelance "Fixxer" of problems.  I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a fun adventure story.  Good job, Steve.
