 I ended up buying this program for work.  I was able to immediately sit down and begin working on floor plans, with a little experimentation. I ran into a few stability issues, but they are few and far between.  "Buggy" would be an overstatement. I found the symbol libraries very useful.  It is also very easy to create your own library by re-organizing the current symbols and/or creating your own. In short, it may not have the power of the big, expensive products, but it is an excellent product for its price range.
