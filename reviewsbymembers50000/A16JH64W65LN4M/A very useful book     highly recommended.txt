 This book promotes self-discovery and/or understanding for others.  I recommend it highly for all.  I have run into very few people who are not facinated at how well Keirsey describes many of their traits. The previously-mentioned redundancy in many of the chapters is helpful if you just want to skip ahead to the section on your type. The one reservation I have found is his tendency to use technical words that have confused some people who are not used to these types of books.  However, this is often not much of a problem for NT Rationals like me.  ;) Buy it.  I find it very unlikely that you will regret it.
