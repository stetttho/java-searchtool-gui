 This is definitely one of the best martial arts films I have seen.  It has a solid story, with characters who, for the most part, are well rounded.  This film has an excellent variety of fights, as well.  They mix up one on one fights with Jet Li taking down groups of samurai.  Li also uses multiple fighting styles, so the fights don't always look the same.  Even if it doesn't become your favorite, I think you will find it worth adding to your collection.  I only wish there was a subtitled version available.
