 I decided to pick this book out of list of choices for reading for a class.  I did not expect it to be an enjoyable book, but I was pleasantly surprised. I know that the topic of racism generally has an accusatory feel for "white" people like me.  Miller-Shearer wants to encourage us to change, but avoids condemning us personally either. I think that the way he uses the word "racist" can get confusing at times.  Miller-Shearer uses the word to describe systems, rather than individuals.  Getting past that will go a long way towards understanding his point. I have rarely seen the topic of racism handled in a way that doesn't make me feel like I'm being personally attacked as a bad person.  Miller-Shearer pulls it off. I highly recommend this book.  I know most people will probably be a bit uncertain like I was, but I think it is worth the time.
