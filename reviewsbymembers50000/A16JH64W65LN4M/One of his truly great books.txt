 This is one of the best apologetics book out there.  I have read this book multiple times, and find it to be one of the easiest reads for some pretty deep subjects. I think his explanation of faith is the best that I have ever read, even after all the reading I did for my B.A. in Biblical and Religious Studies. I recommend this book to any christian who wants to learn more about his/her walk.
