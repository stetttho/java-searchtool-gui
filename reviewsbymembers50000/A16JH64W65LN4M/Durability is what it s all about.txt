 I needed something durable that I can keep on my keychain and not worry about breaking when I do some hard work.  This is the device.  I think the titanium coating is just a gimmick, but the metal case truly is nearly unbreakable.  There are also no flimsy caps to lose, either.  It's not perfect, but it will fit in all but the most ridiculously recessed USB slots.  Cons: The cruzersync software is just a 30-day trial version though, so I opted not to use it, rather than shell out more money.  The keychain is really hard to put on, but that also means it's not going to accidentally fall off, either.  It's a little more expensive than some, but I think having a device that can take some punishment is worth it.
