 I don't reget buying this DVD.  If you love the Simpsons, this is a good choice. I agree with the common gripes.  Why didn't they release more of the good stuff.  A collection of Treehouse of Horror episodes would sell big.  I found the lack of good extra's disappointing, too.  The DVD seemed just thrown together.   On the plus side, these probably are the best epidodes of Treehouse of Horror, for a pretty low price.  Number V is probably my favorite, and clinched my decision to by the disc. I probably would have given this a two, but I think that the low price brings up the rating.  The store price is about half the price of the average new DVD.  They aren't trying to pass this off as some "special edition" DVD.  This is just some of the best episodes of the Simpsons you are going to find on one disc.
