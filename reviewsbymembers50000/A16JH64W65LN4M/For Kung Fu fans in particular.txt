 This movie has taken a place among my all-time favorites; it absolutely cracks me up every time.  The only movie that I have seen which is similar to this one is Kung Pow.  However, I found Kung Pow to have only a few truly funny moments, and it rapidly grew annoying.  Kung-Fu pulls of the jokes perfectly, where Kung Pow ultimately fell flat.  I have not seen Shaolin Soccer yet, but I plan to after laughing so hard at this one.  It focuses mostly on spoofing Kung-Fu films, as well as the Matrix movies, but you'll also see a Roadrunner scene, and a reference to Spiderman and The Untouchables (which left me in stitches), among others.  Besides the way-over-the-top spoofing, the comedy also involves slapstick, irony, and sometimes being just plain goofy.  Unless you have trouble reading fast enough, I definitely recommend watching it subtitled rather than dubbed.  Some of the best jokes don't come across as well with the voice-overs.
