 If only they put as much time into creating a quality RPG as they seem to have spent on the backsides of female character models.  This fits in my category of adventure, with several RPG elements.  It's about as close to an RPG as Riddick (also on XBOX), which I enjoyed more.  I started this game very impressed with the visuals, and quickly became more and more disappointed with the actual gaming experience.  Exploration sucks.  It's a beautiful world, but very small.  You spend a lot of time going back and forth over one particular path.  There are only a total of 5 very small towns.  I spent a lot of time hitting locked doors, and never finding a way to open them.  Side quests invariably involve going someplace you have already been and fighting more of the same creatures.  Dialogue is often inane.  Between nonsensical sexual innuendo from shopkeepers, to oddball monologues about the tension between science and faith (poorly delivered), dialogue kills a lot of the fun.  Having to listen to that stuff dragged the review down a star.  Character development on your first two PCs suddenly stops about halfway through, when they start developing the other two PCs.  In the end, I felt unsatisfied with the story regarding any of the four.  Added to the rest... you don't get to buy armor at all, and weapons are acquired in various locations.  Modifications are a nice touch, but more weapon options would have been nice.  If you're curious, it makes a decent weekend rental, but I doubt you will find it worth purchasing.
