 I also have heard that this movie was "confusing" or "random."  I felt it was just the opposite.  This is a strongly character-driven story... not just another dumb adventure.  The point is there, but you can't sit there brain-dead, drooling through the movie and expect the point to be hammered home at the end. BUY IT... no matter what your age, it's a movie worth watching many times.
