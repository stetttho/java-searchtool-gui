 I consider this game a must-have for XBOX or PS2.    Personally, I have gotten more gameplay out of Timsplitters than Halo. It's a solid game with a lot of things to do.    The storyline is a bit weak, but, who cares (the original Timesplitters didn't even have one)? It offers what few FPS do: variety. One level you're handling a futuristic plasma rifle, the next it's a crossbow, and then six-shooters. The variety of weapons and locations means that you can have a different experience depending on what you feel like. I'm partial to the retro weapons myself.    If you feel like doing something other than the story mode, try the challenge or arcade modes. They are often intended to be a bit tongue-in-cheek, so here is where you pick up off-the-wall characters, like the gingerbread man (one of my favorites). There is more to unlock, and getting a high enough score can sometimes be pretty hard.    Multiplayer offers Bots, and you can customize the character set to change difficulty, so you can still have a fun multiplayer experience by yourself or with just a couple of friends.     Some have complained about the cartoony look, but I feel that is a strength. I can play this around people where I might feel a little guilty pulling out Halo. The violence takes on a Wile E. Coyote feel.    My main complaint is that the controls are often a little twitchy when compared to Halo. If they had been more polished, it would probably take top billing, in my opinion. It's problematic, but not enough to make me dislike the game.    Ultimately Timesplitters is not a game that takes itself seriously. Really, what else can I say with challenges like "Behead the Undead"?    I've noticed that even the people that complain endlessly about the game still give it about 4 stars. This game is definitely worth buying, especially at the current pricing.
