 This is the best RPG I have played in years.  What an incredible game!  I like the variety of characters and interactions.  Some of the characters, such as HK-47, the assassin droid, are downright hilarious.  The story is certainly better than either of the two new Star Wars movies by a long shot.  There is not only a detailed main storyline, but numerous sidequests as well.  This is more of a classic turnbased combat system, rather than direct, real-time combat.  This may disappoint players looking for an action RPG.  Nevertheless, combat looks great, and sometimes it's fun just to sit back and watch the battles unfold.  This is one of my favorite games for XBox.  I consider it a must-have, especially if you enjoy RPGs.
