 The Palm Tungsten|C is quite possibly the most unreliable product I have ever owned. The power button will get pressed while the Palm is in your pocket or laptop case and run the battery down. If you hit more than one of the keys on the keyboard at the same time, the system will lock, you have to reset the Palm and about one out of every three of these resets ends with a complete lose of data. So if you depend on that data being at hand, you are going to be stuck. When you ask for support from Palm they blame the third-party software and tell you to erase the data and rebuild your system. The keyboard is software driven and the software is shaky at best. Read some of the other reviews and see how frustrating it is when the screen cracks. The product is poorly designed and they need to work out the bugs before they damage there reputation any further. As it stands now, I'm going to have to spend an additional $90 for a hard case and an expansion card to keep a back up of the data on hand.
