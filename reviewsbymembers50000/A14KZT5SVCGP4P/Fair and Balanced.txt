 Curiosity drove me to this book and the only reason I didn't give it five stars is due to my own personal bias: I think five stars should be reserved for time tested classic literature.  Marriage is a social as well as historic fact that has affected us all. Everyone on earth should read this book. Coontz's research is well documented and balanced. She comes to her own conclusions only after presenting documentation supporting both sides of an argument regarding a particular social or historic view on marriage. As citizens of the world we have an obligation to understand the role marriage plays for us all; Coontz's book definitely gives us the foundation we need to do just that.
