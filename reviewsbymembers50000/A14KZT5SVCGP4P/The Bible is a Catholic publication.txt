 Claiming that the Catholic Church doesn't believe in and misinterprets the Bible is like saying that the founding fathers of the United States didn't believe in the Bill of Rights and, in their later writings, misinterpreted it. That's just nuts. The Bible is a collection of books ("biblia" is Greek for "the books") written over a 1500 year span (Genesis to Revelations) and was compiled by the Church: THE CATHOLIC CHURCH.  McCarthy is a well known and virulent anti-Catholic. Reading this book to gain a better understanding of Catholicism is like attending a Klan rally to gain a better understanding of race relations. If you're looking for an academic and unbiased understanding of the Catholic faith, look elsewhere.
