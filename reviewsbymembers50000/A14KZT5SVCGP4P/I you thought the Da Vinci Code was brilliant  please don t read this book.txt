 If you liked the Da Vinci Code, please don't read this book and write a bad review. You're doing literate people everywhere a disservice.  This book has a couple of glaring problems: It was over-hyped and it was written by a couple of privileged, Ivy League dons.   Shame on publishers that over-hype a book; the reading public is the only legitimate generator of literary and popular kudos. Shame on you for trying to cheat the system; it most likely backfired on you.   The authors are young and educated by a couple of the most prestigious learning institutions in the world. They already have so much. Do they really deserve a best seller? I think a lot of the negative reviews are driven by envy and over-hype by the publishers.  I found the book entertaining and plausible: Unlike anything written by Dan Brown. This book was a combination of erudite mystery and coming of age at the transition between student and adult. It was entertaining and was peppered with some very poignant and well-placed single sentences, but there were also some points in the book that sounded high-brow and showy.  I'm giving this book five stars to help counteract some of the popular, mob mentality that has undeservedly bashed this book.
