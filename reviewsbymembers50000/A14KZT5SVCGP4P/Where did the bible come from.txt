 Many self-described Bible Christians must believe that a leather-bond gilt edged English version of the bible fell from the sky and landed in the hands of King James. Since the Canon of the bible (The New Testament) was compiled by the Catholic Church, it's a Catholic publication. So to say that Catholics don't believe in the bible is akin to arguing that a mother doesn't believe in the existence of her own child. McCarthy, like Boettner, the Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan is simply anti- Catholic. He takes half-truths and history out of context to support his own prejudices. Bible Christians lack the history, the physical presence during the time of Christ and the Tradition of the Catholic Church so they have to make up lies to denounce it. This book is a foundation for those lies.
