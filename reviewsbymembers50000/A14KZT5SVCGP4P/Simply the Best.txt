 With the introduction of the Voyager 510, Plantronics has taken their headset expertise from the wired world to the unwired world of Bluetooth. This is by far the best Bluetooth headset I've ever used. It's sound is so clear and loud, I almost can't turn my phone down far enough. The sound quality on the recieving end is crytal clear. And, with the ear piece inserting into the ear in addition to the noise cancelling microphone, the noisest environments are a non-issue. Combine all these features with the low price and it becomes the best Bluetooth headset on the market.
