 Ehrman has an easy to follow, fluid style that makes for an easy read. This can be a very nuanced and detail heavy subject, so the small size of the book should let readers know that this is a pretty broad overview of textual criticism as applied to the bible.  I would recommend that the author find a new editor or at least purchase a copy of Strunk and White (see the first two paragraphs under A Few Matters of Form). He puts quotations around colloquialisms and tries to enforce emphasis with the use of exclamation points. He comes off sounding excited and smug all at the same time.  Ehrman makes pains to walk right up to the precipice of Catholic doctrine but refuses to take the plunge. At one point he mentions "This group determined the creeds" and, "This group decided which books would be included in the bible" but he refuses to use the words Catholic Church. He has no problem being very succinct when it comes to his opinions, but falls short when it comes time to be historically clear.  This book may have its minor flaws, but Misquoting Jesus is an eye opener and should be a prerequisite before reading the bible. Unfortunately, the Sola Scriptura crowd seems to only have room on their bookshelves for one book and this book most definitely will not be it.
