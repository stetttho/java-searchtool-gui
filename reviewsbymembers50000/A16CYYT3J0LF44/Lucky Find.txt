 Picked this up in a thrift shop for .10 and now have ordered a few more of Ms Link's works. I had run out of known favorite authors and was despairing of finding another gem, which is exactly how I would categorize GL after reading this story.  What a lovely story. Go figure...a historical romance with no kidnappings or near death experiences or persistant evil or battles or misunderstandings that take on unrealistic dimensions orrrr many of the things that are the norm with this type of story. And yet I would not call it fluff OR boring. This is the first book in a while that has kept me up until 4AM. Essentially it is a story about love, the deepest kind of love that is too right to let us walk away from it. And there is no doubt about the hero's or heroine's feelings from the get-go. And yet, Ms Link wraps this lovely tale around our heart that just draws us in (with a sigh) as we watch them fight against and for what they know is right. A unique (in terms of the genre) and wonderful story and one that will be read again.
