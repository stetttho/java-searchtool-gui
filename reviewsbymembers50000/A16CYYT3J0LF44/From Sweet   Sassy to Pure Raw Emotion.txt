 That is the roller coaster I have been on with this book. How could an idea that started out so well-meaning & sweet result in such tortured souls? I feel so emotionally raw right now. Part of me wants this sweet torture to end (I have about 100 pgs to go) and yet I know I will carry these people in my heart and I will come back to this story again. This story will grab you by the throat and not let go.
