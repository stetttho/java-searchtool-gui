 Well done. Extremely well done. My only wish is for more. I would love to see her books be a bit longer but this was just a nice story beautifully told. And I am now about halfway through her follow up book 'By Starlight' (about Clarise's sister Merry) and it is proving to also be wonderful.  Keep it up, Ms Moon! My list of preferred authors is rather narrow but your books are definitely keepers.
