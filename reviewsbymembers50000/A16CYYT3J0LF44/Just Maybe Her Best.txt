 Wow. Very well done story. It always bugs me a bit when someone is ready to die of love 24 hrs after meeting. In this story the chemistry is almost immediate but the relationship is very believable. The storyline is unique and engaging and just a great romance. Definitely one of Meagan's best, on a scale with Penelope Williamson, who holds #1 in my heart right now for great romance-writing for grown-ups.
