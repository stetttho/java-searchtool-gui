 Great story; rich; 4 1/2 stars really. I am looking forward to reading The Last Arrow, about Lucien and Servanne's daughter. Truthfully, I intend at this point to read about every Canham book I can get my hands on. The woman writes a breathtakingly mature, dramatic, passionate novel, richly textured with great secondary characters who only enhance the experience. Ms. Canham creates passionate couples without relying on sex to carry the entire story. And, Lordy, can she set a merciless tension level. The only reason I did not give this a 5 is because Ms Canham can write some female characters who truly start out as quite annoying...AND because I could have lived with a bit more romance\relationship development between our h\h. Not a big thing though A word of warning regarding this story. It is a bit graphic in terms of physical violence\torture methods described (not quite so heavy as the Outlander Jack Randall\Jaime scenes but not light, either). No doubt historically accurate regarding punishments meted out in that time period but, nevertheless, not for the weak of heart...orrr...if it gets to be a bit too graphic, just skim over some of those descriptions. It will still be a great story. It's just not a real gentle story.
