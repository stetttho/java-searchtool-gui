 This book may well have been the most accurate portrayal (to my limited knowledge) of the Victorian era I have ever read. Unfortunately that means I was grinding my teeth through the entire book.   Had it been any other author I probably would have tossed it by pg 100. But I know how well MB can put a story together, how touchingly real, and so I kept going. And truth be told it was an excellent story, I suppose. But I read a love story for warmth and passion. The overwhelming stiffness here, the self-denial, the inability for the heroine to acknowledge truth vs duty EVEN to HERSELF just left me empty. And OH LORD the sex scenes just made me cringe.   Again, it is NOT the author's skill but my personal taste. If anything she did TOO well here. If one can appreciate that utter Stepford-ness and moral imprisonment of the Victorian era you will no doubt appreciate this story. If however you read romances for just that, romance & warmth & passion, I would suggest one of the other Balogh novels...Truly or Heartless or Longing.
