 The story was apparently written as a prequel to Encantadora & All I Ask Of You... and, to some degree, Forsaking All Others (which carries the story of a family friend we meet in All I Ask Of You). This is the story of The Buchanan and Marisa Fitzgerald, who are patriarch\matriarch to Rhyss and Gillie, who we meet in the other 2 stories above. I have thoroughly enjoyed them all. This book and All I Ask were my favorites of the 4 but I would recommend all of them in the above order. Those who have complained in the past about books that don't have enough h/h 'together' time would like Link, I believe. Her stories focus mainly on what is going on in the hearts of our hero & heroine and their interaction. The plot line relating to the villain du jour is usually rather minimal compared to the time spent developing the love story with all it's drama & frustrations. And there seems always to be a little kinder edge to Link's heroes. Tormented, most definitely, but less roughness towards the lady than I see in some books and less of those unrealistic dramas. I'm just so pleased I found her work.
