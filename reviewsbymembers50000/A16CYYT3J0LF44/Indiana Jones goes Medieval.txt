 Another great story, Candice! Certainly one of your most adventurous, edge-of-the-seat stories. I tell ya, the first 1/2 of this story was like an Indiana Jones remake but I mean that in the best way. My heart was in my throat for quite a while.  I really fell in love with Damien & Attica...wonderful characters. While I thought they fell in love a bit quicker than usual...well, hey it does happen that way. And, as usual, Candice has a way of 'keeping it real' when it comes to love. So hard to define, what makes one writer so much better at drawing us into the love story than another, but Candice does it so well.  If I have any wee wee tiny complaint, it is in her proclivity towards the descriptive terms "his man's body" or "her woman's body". She uses this phraseology a LOT in all her books I have read, and I find it just a wee bit off-putting...redundant anyway.   Nevertheless, I have yet to be disappointed by one of her stories...except for the fact that I am getting ready to read the last one!
