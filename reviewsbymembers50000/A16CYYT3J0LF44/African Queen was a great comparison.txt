 There are so few romances that I truly adore. I decided to try Candice when I discovered she was Penelope Williamson's sister, a magically gifted writer who unfortunately moved to the mystery genre.   While Candice's style is her own, the one thing she does have in common with PW is the maturity of her stories, both in character development and rich scene description. Also, like her sister, she has lovely variety in her story placement. Let's see, we have Australia & Tasmania & Colorado & New Orleans & even a medieval story. So many writers stay stuck in one genre, eg medieval or regency which eventually bores me, no matter how great the writer. This is my 3rd CP book and I have not been disappointed other than the knowledge that I am going to run out of her books too quickly.  Whoever compared this story to the African Queen was dead on. The interactions between Jack and India often make me laugh out loud. I just love his ascerbic wit and India does a pretty good job of holding her own...and then, of course, there is the love.  I would not only recommend this story but would strongly recommend everything Candice has written.
