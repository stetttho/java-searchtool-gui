 After not being thrilled with All Through The Night, my first Brockway story, I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The storyline was interesting, the h\h chemistry was wonderful, the writing superb. Ach, a couple scenes took my breath away. I can't imagine anyone, who likes a good historical romance, not enjoying this story.
