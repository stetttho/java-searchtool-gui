 I expected to be disappointed in this story after reading some of the reviews. I actually liked it very well. It does seem, upon reflection, that there was less 1:1 interaction between Stephen & Sherry in this story (not sure if that is my imagination or not), but I still came away with my normal sore heart after reading one of this JM series. I think it's the intensity of her characters' anger, at the crisis points, that shadows my heart for days after they have patched things up. When I say this story gets you on 2 levels it is because, if you have read all the predecessor stories to this, there is the melancholy awareness that you are watching your favorite characters take a final curtain call in this story. It is quite touching to see everyone come together to help Stephen find HIS happiness and allow us to also remember their stories. I am only surprised that somehow Ian & Elizabeth were left out cause it seems everyone else takes a bow. Kinda chokes me up.
