 I went searching for Penelope's first 2 books, Beloved Rogue and this (at least they appear to be her first). Beloved Rogue was so-so (not a huge surprise considering I was comparing to her later stories) but I was amazed at the quantum leap her skill took from Rogue to Hearts Bequiled. Don't hesitate to pay a few extra dollars for this harder-to-find book, particularly if you have enjoyed PW's other stories. It never ceases to amaze me how one author can wring so much more depth & detail & emotion from the typical 350 pgs of a historical romance than do other authors. Penelope fills every page with something you can sink your teeth...and your heart...into. Well-written, extremely engaging storyline (*yawn* and another 3AM bedtime), very likeable h\h and absolutely adorable supporting characters. This is just a wonderful love story and, as another reader mentioned, the uniqueness of pre-revolutionary France just adds to the enjoyment. I really did not want this story to end. Classic Penelope; believable, flawed but totally lovable, charming, memorable characters with integrity AND sex appeal.
