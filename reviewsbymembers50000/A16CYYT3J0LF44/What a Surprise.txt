 I would give this book 5 just on originality alone and the addition of a wee bit o' Celtic magic only rates it higher for me.  This book was in my 'emergency' read pile. In other words, I didn't expect much. I had liked Prince of Midnight, but not in a way that left me mooning afterwards. Then one of Kinsale's most highly reviewed books, Shadow & Star, left me totally flat & I put it down in disgust. So, THIS book just hung around until I had nothing else to read. Well...now I'm going to have to look at Kinsale's offerings with renewed interest.  Not only is the storyline very unique, I really liked Roddy AND Faelen (and yeaaah the heroine was not so uptight!). It is one of the few books I have read that really, REALLY kept me on the edge of my seat throughout even though we knew from the get-go that they were both crazy about each other. So hard not to peek at the back pages! Instead of the usual "Gee does he love her or doesn't he, will the rake be reformed or not?" this story is rooted in "Is he mad (as in insane) or isn't he and do we care in the end when he is so damned adorable?" I thought it was a very mature, exciting, and interesting story with just enough depth & dark edginess to keep the reader really engaged. Neat, neat story.
