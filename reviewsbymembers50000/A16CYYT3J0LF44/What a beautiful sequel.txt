 English has just done a lovely job here. There is a softness about her stories (not to be confused with lack of drama) that is like a breath of fresh air. Not shallow fluff atall, but a subtle gentility that I really enjoy after some of the more angst-riddled dramas I get caught up in.  This sequel was just as sweet and magical as The Border Bride and provides much more follow up than I ever expected of Jemmy & Alyson's life (rather than the cameo appearance in many sequels) while carving a warm place in our hearts for Alistair, also. When last we left our H\H of The Border Bride it was a qualified happy ending. Great love found, yes, but it was also clear that they had a tough road ahead of them. Now we come full circle. Alistair is redeemed and in a big and believable way; ie redeemed through human growth and acquiring perspective. We see a lot of things made right and get another welcome view of Jemmy & Alyson's love.  Do read Border Bride first. You will enjoy this one twice as much. Then prepare for an utterly satisfying 'happy ending' when you finish Laird. *sigh* Very nice, Elizabeth. The only reason I don't give this 5 stars is because I would love for it to have been longer. The material was certainly there for it.
