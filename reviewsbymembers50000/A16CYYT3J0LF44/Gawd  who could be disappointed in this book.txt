 This was my 4th PW book read (Emma is still waiting) and the one that led me to find the earlier 2 out of print books. I was a bit concerned that earlier books often don't have the maturity or fully developed style but, even if without, they will still be good stories if they came from PW's romantic, meant-to-be, passionate heart. I didn't notice Jessalyn's character being underdeveloped. If true, then the raw passion of McCady more than made up for it. Some of their scenes together just took my breath away, the emotion was so soul-wrenching. But then I have come to expect nothing less. I actually think this is one of her better books if it is even possible to grade PWs stories; they are all so beautiful. I keep repeating myself on every PW book review. Just buy it; buy them all. A great passionate, grown up romance novel from a great writer. Her men are real men.
