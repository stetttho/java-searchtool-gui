 While the premise of this story is similar to Truly, which I also recommend, there was something about this book that seemed to have even more depth & emotion & richness. I have read several of Balogh's books and, so far, I would put this one at the top of the heap. It's not often I am taken to tears by a story but, boy, a couple scenes in this one certainly did it.  I saw nothing bloodless in Sian & Alex...anything BUT. They are decent, passionate people, not even beginning to try to deny their feelings, but caught in the social mores of their time. I thought they were very real & believable...and Oh God please find me a man like Alex. He's one of the best I have ever 'met'.  The only thing I found odd at all was that there was really no mention or thought to Alex's deceased wife or their relationship...but then it's not their story. The plot does not rely on the tortured hero syndrome nor does it need it...and how refreshing to have a gentle, kind hero...NOT to be confused with boring!  This book, at 375 or so pages, seemed longer than it was; I think because the story is so rich and has so many interesting issues occurring that it is like Haagen-Daz to low fat ice cream. At one point I couldn't believe (happily) that I was only halfway through and there was so much more story to go. Maybe this is also partly due to the author not making us wait until the last 2 chapters for the H\H to come together. Regardless, there is a lot of bang for the buck in this novel...memorable characters, sizzling passion, interesting and active storyline, tension, drama...they just don't get much better than this.
