 Pride of Lions and this, it's continuance, were the first I read by MC and I will definitely look into more of her work. The heroine is quite annoying in Pride of Lions, almost to the end, but the story was still good and it just gets even better with Blood Of Roses as you realize how Catherine's character has evolved and matured. Any story relating to the massacre at Culloden really tears at my heart and Canham really holds nothing back in realistic detail. A tough read in places but a wonderful book for those who like to be wholly emotionally involved with a story. This is a very well written, dramatic love story and she developed the secondary characters so well that you won't mind the few times she diverges to their stories. Just makes the entire story more real. But doggone it, Marsha, I could shoot you for that one scene, which I won't ruin for others by divulging. Played me like a fiddle you did. I was so sick & disgusted I actually had to set the book down for an hour. Shame on you. What a talented writer! :-)
