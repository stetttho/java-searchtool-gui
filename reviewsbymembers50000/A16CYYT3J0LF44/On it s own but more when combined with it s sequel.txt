 This was a good story. I found myself disappointed in Catherine's spoiled, annoying personality. She really only becomes likeable towards the end... BUT... this is, I'm sure, an intentional evolution by the author which really culminates in the sequel, Blood of Roses, which I would have to give a 5 or close to it. Read both and you will have a wonderful, if heartbreaking (in terms of the way the Culloden history always breaks my heart) love story. Even the secondary characters steal your heart and there is no shortage of drama or action...or tenderhearted love.  I may give this story a 4 but the 2 combined are an 8.
