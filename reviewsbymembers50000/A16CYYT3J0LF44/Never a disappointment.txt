 What a great story!...again! I have turned into Ms Williamson's #1 fan in the romance category. I hope she doesn't completely turn her back on a genre in which she has so much to offer. I have now tracked down her only 2 novels that I do not yet own and dread the day I have no new PW novels on my shelf. Another classy, exciting, believeable read is assured with this story; a great adult love with sexiness & tenderness & all the emotional angst you can handle and more. Even though her stories, like with most writers, have a slight similarity in storyline PW very adeptly gives each one a twist to make it fresh & unique & engaging.  If you like Judith McNaught or the Outlander series, if you like believable grown-up romances with some real depth and drama to them, just buy all of Penelope's books. You won't be disappointed.
