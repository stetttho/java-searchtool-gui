 BUT...while many sequel-type stories will also stand alone, one simply MUST read The Secret before Ransom. The enjoyment of Ransom will be 10-fold. Usually these sequels give a passing nod to our H/Hs of earlier books. In this book they play a much more significant role. Besides, The Secret was also a lovely story and the 2 together are just 10 stars. I have had mixed reaction to the JG stories I have read because they were a bit 'light' to the historical romances I usually preferred. She certainly got my attention with these 2 stories however.
