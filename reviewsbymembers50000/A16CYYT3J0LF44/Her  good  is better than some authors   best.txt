 I would tend to agree that this is not Marsha's best though I can't quite put my finger on why because it is still a very good story. I was almost convinced it was just my mood at the time.   There are a couple surprises along the way and, as usual, Marsha somehow gives us characters with hearts AND racing pulses. Maybe it is that the secondary characters are not quite as engaging as we have come to expect (you're spoiling us, Marsha).   Regardless, if you are a Marsha Canham fan, you will definitely want to read this story. If a newcomer to Ms. Canham's work, read her other books first and read this one later. Then again, maybe this one SHOULD be read first before sampling her other, even BETTER, stories.
