 Wow! Thank you Amazon reviewers for introducing me to P Williamson. What an author...and Ms. Williamson must have had a muse over her shoulder while writing this story. I read Outsider first, and loved it, but still had NO idea what was waiting for me with Keeper Of The Dream. This story is amazing in every way...words alone do not convey. This is not a romance novel but a true fairy tale; beautiful, magical, lyrical, sexual, mystical, even hysterical in places. I will carry this story in my heart forever. I don't usually buy books in hardback version because I buy so many. This is one of the few, aside from the Outlander series, that I now want in hardcover. It deserves that dignity. A classic, beautifully written fairy tale...and with love scenes that will melt the elastic in your drawers to boot.
