 Just a lovely story in so many ways. Somehow, even though Johnny speaks few words of love (completely in keeping with his character) we somehow understand...FEEL...very clearly how deep his feelings are becoming for Rachel. Now THAT is good writing.  Also, knowing a bit about the Amish, I found PW's portrayal of Rachel's family & values very heartfelt and believable. She somehow shows us the positive and negative, which helps us to understand the depth of Rachel's confusion. Knowing how 'closed' the society is she really portrays the agony and life-altering scope of Rachel's choices very well. Just a great story. I am glad I listened to you guys and bought a couple more of Penelope's books at the same time.
