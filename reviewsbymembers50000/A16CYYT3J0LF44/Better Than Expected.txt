 I put this on my Christmas list and then regretted it after reading many of the reviews and thinking this was going to be too complicated and fiddly. Thankfully, my "Santa" had already purchased it before I could retract the request. It is a nice machine. I got the red, which is fun. The box said "easier to clean" which says Cuisinart has heard your complaints though I don't know what has been changed since I have no basis of comparison. I will say that I don't see a problem at all with the cleaning aspect. There is a little rubber stopper that holds the whole grind basket together IF you remove it while still warm (is that what they changed?). Once it cools somewhat, the grind basket comes out in 2 parts. All I can say it, this system makes a nice cup of coffee and looks great. The cleaning is NOT a big deal! You just remove the two baskets and rinse out.  Additional positives: The pour-spout on the carafe is excellent, the handle is very sturdy, and the coffeepot sits very deeply and securely into the machine base, which is excellent.  One negative: The system is engineered to only work if all parts are in place. Gawd forbid if you should accidentally hit the 'program' or 'on' button by mistake while it is apart for cleaning. The bloody thing will NOT stop beeping until you insert the complete grinder basket AND filter basket! I got a little crazy the first 2 times trying to figure out WHY my coffeemaker would not stop beeping, even when I tried to hit the off button. I could probably have unplugged it but that would have messed up my clock/timer.  Other than that annoyance, it really is a nice system. OH, and the grinder is NOT loud, in my opinion.
