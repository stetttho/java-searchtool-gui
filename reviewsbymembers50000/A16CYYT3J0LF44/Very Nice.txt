 This is a very good story and I liked Miles and Olivia's personalities and interaction right from the get-go. The storyline was pretty unique, also, in regards to the Bryan situation.  I have read a few Sutcliffe stories now and my only complaint is that, while they are the standard length of an historical romance, somehow they really draw me in but then seem to suddenly move too quickly with too little interaction or romance. It's hard to explain. Maybe she tries to cover too large a time period because, about halfway through I start feeling like I'm getting a Cliff Notes version of the love story. For that reason I gave it a 4. Good story though.
