 I've read this whole series and am anxiously awaiting the next volume in this epic love story. I happily just heard that Breath of Snow and Ashes will NOT be the last Jamie\Clare chapter. I don't know if my heart can stand it.      'Romance' it is...and an understatement that. I don't think Ms Gabaldon is crazy for that categorization but it truly is the overriding plotline that keeps we addicts hungering for more. Yes, it has a lot of detail. That will either make it more 'real' to you, if you like to become immersed in another world, or put you off if you prefer a lighter fiction 'fix'. If you fall in love with Jamie (trust me; you'll know very early on if you do; I got chills with the ghost appearance in chap 1, was it?) you will devour this series and beg for more. And if you DO fall in love with Jamie he will become a living, breathing part of you forever...like an ex-lover. She made magic with him.      Sure, in an epic this huge, there are going to be some chapters the reader likes more than others, but taken as a whole, it is a phenomenal bit of suspended reality...which is what the best stories are...and it just keeps going. What a luxury!
