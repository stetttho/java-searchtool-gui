 I couldn't find it in this book...anywhere. I tried.  I wanted to like this book even though I tend to shy away from these real uptight, judgemental prude types. Innocence is fine but some heroines are just too extreme for me. However, I still believed, with all the reviews that this would be a book to buy.  Just could not get into these characters or the storyline at all.  I thought Prince of Midnight was better than this and I can't say I would put IT on my top authors list by any stretch. Star literally went into the trash which is really rare for me. Just not my cuppa or picked a wrong day to read it I suppose.
