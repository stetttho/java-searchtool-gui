 I don't even know where to begin other than to say do not pass this magic by. This one will stir your soul. This breath-taking story has everything we want from a romance and more. The drama and conflict are heart-wrenching and yet never created by the overdone bitterness & cruelty we often see between our H\H...and when the conflict IS between them it is utterly believable & understandable (as is the love), not some overexaggerated miscommunication. Even the ending has just the right kiss of realism to make us scream for more, and the secondary characters in this story are distinct and 'real', not just room decoration. The touch of the 'otherworld', in my opinion, just puts Ms. English at the head of the class for this effort. Ahhh, please bring us Malcolm's story and a chance to revisit Jemmy and alyson. This story is not finished yet...
