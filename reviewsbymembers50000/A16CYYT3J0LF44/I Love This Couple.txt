 I have not even finished yet and already I know I will hold Grant & 'Vivien' in my heart with JM's Ian & Elizabeth (Almost Heaven). I love their hearts. The scene in the library is one of the most tender, touching scenes I have ever read in a novel. Not sexual at all yet I just kept re-reading it...and the tender way he looks after her in the beginning.  *sigh* Wonderful love story.
