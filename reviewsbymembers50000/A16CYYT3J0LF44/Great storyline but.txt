 I thought this storyline was a 5+, the physical encounters were a sizzling 10, and I really liked the characters. However, much of the writing was just so stiff that I found it rather distracting. I mean, how many people "think thus"? I certainly appreciate historical accuracy and I understand that part of Jack's charm is his gentlemanly behavior juxtaposed against the dichotomy of his rough background. Nevertheless, something just didn't flow. It was still a nice story. I just see where it could have been so much more with a more fluid, poetic writing style.
