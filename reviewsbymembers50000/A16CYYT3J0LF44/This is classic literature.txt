 No, not your typical historical romance and not for the emotionally timid but the kind of novel that will steal a bit of your heart forever. The love between Shay and his wife is so tangible that it is difficult, for quite a bit of the book, to even imagine he and Emma finding love together. And yet, for that reason alone, it is a real story about learning to go on after trajedy, learning to open your heart again. It is about finding what matters in life and grabbing onto it and knowing the cost is worth it. Penelope has such a gift for making us feel and know real love and passion with just a look or word or touch. With so little she can twist your heart into a knot that makes you gasp. Her characters are real, their hurdles are gut-wrenchingly believable, and their love is breathtaking. I could not give this less than 5 stars. It deserves more. My only complaint is that I think this book deserved another 20 pages at least. I wish, with all my aching heart, that we could have been given just a wee bit more of a peek into the start of their life together. Heck, I would like to see a sequel. But that is not so much a complaint as a testimony to just how wonderful a story this is.
