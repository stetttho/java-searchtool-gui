 As historical romances go, this one is very grown up, very realistic. I love the way Reggie and Allie interact. There is such a depth of comeraderie and humor and friendship that seems so real as opposed as opposed to the 'over the top' melodrama that occurs in so many romances. Short on sex but long on substance and real love and engaging storyline.  This was my first Putney and I will definitely read more.
