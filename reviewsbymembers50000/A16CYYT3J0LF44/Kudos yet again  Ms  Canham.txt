 I defy anyone to name a writer who does better secondary characters than Ms. Canham and the stories are SO much richer for this. I was also amazed at the poignancy, the gladness & sadness I felt, to see our hero from Through A Dark Mist some 2+ decades later. She has aged him realistically and Lucien is paying for all the physical trauma he suffered over the years and that just really touched me and made the story seem so real. As usual, Ms. Canham takes us on a great roller coaster ride full of drama, deceipt, passion, & humor with a strong hero AND heroine. I despair of the day I run out of her books. I tend to space them apart, with 1 or 2 other stories in between, so I always have the anticipation of another Canham on the shelf. And it's an even greater plus that her stories lean towards 500 pages, usually, so there's more of her to love! :-)
