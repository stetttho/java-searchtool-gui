 Canham definitely has a new fan here, following up Pride of Lions & Blood of Roses with this fantastic story. I was on the edge of my seat through this entire book it seems. The hero & heroine & villains are in such close proximity the entire time that I was constantly on edge for something to go wrong...in a most delicious way. The hero is unabashedly UNapologetic for his lifestyle; he is not troubled or tormented, there is no deep pain rooted in his past. I found that refreshingly different. The heroine is a refugeee from the French revolution, towing along a younger brother & a humorously stiff but protective servant.  Pale Moon Rider is well written, fast moving, and just has all the right elements of a great romance; passion, humor, excitement, drama, tenderness.  Ms Canham, I put you right up there with my other favorite, Penelope Williamson. You have a beautiful skill for 'making it real' and drawing us deeply into a story.
