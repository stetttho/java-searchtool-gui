 What a story. I was emotionally exhausted by the end of this book AND missing an entire night's sleep...and westerns are not usually my first choice...and I am ready to read it again.  This story has so many wonderful characters in it and so many possibilities that I found myself, at times, actually feeling guilty for wanting the H\H to get together because I didn't want the other people hurt. This is a 'grown up' romance. One that recognizes there is more than 1 kind of love between a woman and man; that sometimes it is not good guy vs bad guy but just 2 good & very different men; that sometimes there ARE commitments in life that take precedence over one's passion. I had a difficult time not 'back-paging' this book (out of fear for where PW was going to take my bleeding heart) but, despite all I just said, I kept faith that PW does believe in 'meant to be' kind of loves, even if they take a while. After reading Outsider and Keeper of the Dream I knew it was time to seek out everything PW has written. What an amazing storyteller. Her stories are each unique, without a totally predictable plotline. Her writing style is also her own in a very classy, understated way that just feels real and puts you right into the character's emotions. Somehow she grabs your heart and soul without losing believability. And while PW's men are sexy & handsome as can be, they are also real men, with scars inside & out; not always the perfectly pretty, rich boys with perfectly tied cravats...which just makes them even sexier. "My love for you won't stop with my leaving. Come an evening over the years, when you step outside your door and hear the wind blowing through the cottonwoods, that'll be me, thinking of you, whispering your name, and loving you." Gawd, I tear up all over again reading this. This is a love story that will hang over your heart for days after. Penelope, please don't stop writing romances. You are amazing!
