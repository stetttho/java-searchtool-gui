 I thought the storyline was fresh and I fell in love with Devlin in pretty short order. There were a lot of 'laugh out loud' moments with this story.  However, I couldn't give it a 5 for 2 reasons: 1. I felt Megan was just too OTT. I mean, c'mon, we need a few moments of companionability, gentleness, to set the foundation for love. I found myself wondering why the heck he wanted her. 2. I think Ms Lindsay missed a great opportunity, particularly with the Scotland trip, to interject some real gut-clenching, heart-stopping drama. For some reason she decided to make fluff of what shoulda\coulda been an emotional pivot-point of the book. That being said, I did really like the story and, in fact, read it in 1 day. If you are in the mood for a lighter romance this is a great read.
