 I bought this album when it came out in 1988.  I think I had it on cassette.  I remember working at a park in Northern California that summer and listening to this wonderful album over and over again.   I loved it then and I love it now.  In fact, I love it even more since my wife and I returned from a trip to Ireland earlier this year, having immersed ourselves in Irish music for a solid week.  I've always loved the traditional Irish music, not only for the melodies but also for the rich sense of history and community the lyrics convey.  However, what makes this album stand out is Van Morrison.  He is an incredible singer who knows these songs and their history in vivid detail.  That he collaborates with the best group of traditional musicians in Ireland means that he can transform these famous songs into something enchanting, memorable: as good as any album you're likely to hear this year (or any year).
