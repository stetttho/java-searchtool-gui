 Yes, this is a fantastic film, made by a rich, beautiful culture, and for these things alone this film should be celebrated and cherished.  However, I have a problem with this DVD.  The running time for the film on this DVD is 161 minutes.  However, if you go to the "Atnarjuat" web site, you'll notice that the running time is officially listed at 172 minutes.  My question is, where are the extra 11 minutes?  I wouldn't complain about this except that the storyline detailed on the official "Atnarjuat" web site includes some rather important plot points that were simply missing from the film I saw (the 161 minute film).  Shame on Lot47!  Give us the film that these wonderful filmmakers created, not your edited version!
