 Yes, these headphones SOUND good.  It's Sennheiser!  Of course it will sound good.  What's important about these things, however, is that they are incredibly light and incredibly comfortable.  I never realized how comfortable they were until I started using a different headphone and found my ears worn red after only an hour or two of use.  This is especially a problem since I wear glasses, and the combination of glasses around my ears and headphones on my ears can be VERY annoying.  I have no problem wearing these headphones for several hours at a time, even with my glasses on.  If you use headphones a lot, you want headphones that sound good and feel good.  That's the 2200!
