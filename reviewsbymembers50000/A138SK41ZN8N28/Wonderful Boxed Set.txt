 Lee Perry's music is not merely the greatest music ever created in Jamaica (remember: he produced most of Bob Marley's essential work), but it ranks up with the most important and influential music of the 20th century.  Perry  was able to transform even the simplest composition into  something new, original, unique.  He demonstrated to generations of musicians the unlimited power of the recording studio, where any and all musical visions can be realized.  The music on this collection is the best of Perry's work, and it is essential for anyone serious fan of popular music.
