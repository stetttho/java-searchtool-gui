 Every Sergei Eisenstein film is essential viewing for students of world cinema.  "Strike" is no exception.  But this version of "Strike"--with a wonderful score by the Alloy Orchestra and a beautifully restored print--is a fantastic purchase for anyone interested in cinema.  Yes, "Strike" is not the epic that "Battleship Potempkin" is.  But it's got an energy, a pulsing sense of excitement that has rarely been matched since.  It is a real treasure.
