 I loved this film, though I can understand some of the comments by people who found it to be slow.  I don't really understand why anyone would say that the film has no plot or that it is boring.  Sure, it seems like a simple plot--a mother dies and a son watches--but these things, mothers and sons and death, are not simple things.  They are also not boring things.  This is a film for anyone who loves beautifully crafted and filmed works of art.
