 "Sculpting in Time" is basically a rant by a great film director. That's not to say that his rants don't have their merit.  They do.  They illuminate his aesthetic approaches to filmmaking and his concept of art (or, as he would say, Art) in society.  The trouble is, his comments do not really assist those who simply want to better understand his films.  If you're like me and want to gain a greater understanding of and appreciation for Tarkovsky's works, get "The Films of Andrei Tarkovsky: A Visual Fugue" by Vida T. Johnson and Graham Petrie.
