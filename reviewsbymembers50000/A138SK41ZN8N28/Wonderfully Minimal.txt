 Minimalist music is music that is barely there--music that usually repeats simple, bare-bones rhythms and melodies until they have exhausted both the listener and the artist. This type of music is certainly popular among  some, but I'm usually bored after the first few songs. However, Mille  Plateaux's Clicks_+_Cuts offers a different, more interesting roadmap for  this genre. Following the lead of Pole (aka Stefan Betke), the diverse  artists that contribute to this 2 CD collection have managed to make  minimal music that both retains the trademarks of the minimal school and  offers new avenues for experimentation. In other words, this album retains  the repetition of minimalism, but incorporates into this repetition new and  unusual sounds, odd time signatures, and even some interesting song  structures. If you have heard Pole's first album, then you'll have a sense  of what to expect here--a plethora of (as the title suggests) clicks and  cuts, static, looped samples, dub effects, a variety of programmed drum and  synth patterns, and a whole host of other, interesting sounds. Dettinger's  "Strange Fruit," for example, starts with clicks and flanged  bubble synth sounds, which meld into a backwards rhythm (clicks now in the  background) that slowly builds into a larger, forward-moving 303 rhythm.  That rhythm expands and does weird things with rhythm manipulation and time  signatures, then abruptly stops. This music is challenging, unusual, and  original. It's great fun, too, which is something I usually don't say about  minimalism.
