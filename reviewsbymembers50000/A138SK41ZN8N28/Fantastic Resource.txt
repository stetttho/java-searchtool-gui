 Johnson's and Petrie's work is an absolute essential resource for any student of film and any fan of Tarkovsky's wonderful work.  When I bought the book, I was hoping that it would help me better understand the Russian context of Tarkovsky films and to help make some of the "murkier" parts of the films a little more lucid.  The work does all this and more.  This book offers a great deal of background on Tarkovsky's life, the Soviet film industry in which he worked, the people he worked with, and the cinematic style that made Tarkovsky's works so memorable.  This is an absolute treasure of a book.  Ignore those people who complain about the poor analysis of the films; they're wrong or stupid or both.  The book's main focus is to help make Tarkovsky's work easier to understand and to provide background on Tarkovsky himself.
