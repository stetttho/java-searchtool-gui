 This is a great show, better than just about anything on American television.  The series has great writing, great directing, great acting, and great music.  Each episode is at once funny, intelligent, warm, caring, and contemplative.  How many other shows can you point to that manage to cram that much into each 50 minutes?  Get this and then watch season two on Showtime!
