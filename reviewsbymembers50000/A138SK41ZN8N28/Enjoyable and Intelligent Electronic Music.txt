 While borrowing certain experimental sounds from the likes of Autechre, these German lads nevertheless manage to make music immediately listenable, immediately enjoyable, and unquestioningly excellent. This album is the  happy medium between frosty chill-out music (Global Communication, Aphex's  ambient stuff) and intense drill-press music (Solar X, Autechre). From the  first track, "I Am in the World with You," to the masterful  "Tomorrow," to the even more masterful "Cars," to the  final track, "Das Blau und der Morgen," this album is stark,  beautiful, esoteric, and hummable. Yes, hummable! Weird sounds mix with  lush atmospherics to create sounds that you actually find yourself thinking  about long after you've finished listening. Not only that, but each song on  this album is under 5 minutes in length. How many electronic albums can you  say that about?
