 Attilio Mineo is one of those obscure artists who created music so far ahead of its time that we are still trying to catch up to it today. What we have today, in 1999, is music that is reminiscent of science fiction  soundtracks from "Forbidden Planet" and "The Day the Earth  Stood Still" to "Terminator 2" and "The Fifth  Element." But the music also resembles some of the earliest tape-loop  experiments by people like Stockhausen, where traditional musical elements  were combined with samples and sound effects. Mineo manages to blends  orchestral scores with sound effects so that there is almost no distinction  between them. The strings and horns are as "alien" as the alarm  sounds and the theromyne wails. What really makes this music contemporary  with 1999, however, is the thing that probably killed its commercial appeal  in the 1960s--the narrator. At the start of each track, a narrator offers a  brief comment, designed to guide the visitor through the fair. From a  modern perspective, however, the narrator merely adds another weird element  to music that is already weirder than most anything I've ever heard. Again,  this is a gem: a found piece of electronic art that deserves recognition.
