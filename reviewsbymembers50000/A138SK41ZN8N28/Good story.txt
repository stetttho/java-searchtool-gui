 I first saw this film when on an airplane trip from Toronto to Los Angeles.  This was the in-flight movie.  I loved every second of it.  The acting, the pacing, the music, and the wonderful idea of centering a film around a train watcher--all of it was wonderful.  However, the other yokels on the plane with me apparently didn't agree.  As soon as it was over, the stewardess got onto the intercom to note that a lot of people had complained about the film, calling it boring and pointless.  She then apologized for showing the film and, to make it up to everyone, she promised to show another film--"Cheaper by the Dozen."  Yep, that's the moviegoing public for you!
