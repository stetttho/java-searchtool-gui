 The guy above who says you should skip the first 200 pages is stupid.  He says this because all the heavy-duty science stuff happens in the second half of the book, but the first half of the book is wonderful.  It's a  refreshing change to see a SF book that is more concerned (initially) with  characters and with the everyday lives of people living on another planet  in the far future.  Bear not only does this very well, but he also manages  to create a believable female narrator who is not a stereotype (Heinlein).   Bravo!
