 I own thousands of CDs but only a handful of comedy ones.  I find most comedy albums are either not very funny or just funny enough for me to listen to them about two or three times before getting bored.  Dave Attell's album, on the other hand, is entirely different.  I've listened to this non stop since I bought a year ago.  I gave a copy of it to my brother recently and he, too, hasn't stopped listening to it.  The album is just flat-out funny; what's more, Attell has the amazing ability to disarm audiences.  He does a lot of "gay" jokes here, but, just as you, the listener, are starting to think, "what's up with all the gay stuff?" he exclaims, "Was that homophobic? ... I hear that a lot: 'Dave, you probably secretly ARE gay.'  I say, 'Listen, voice in my head, I'm not.'"  Sharp, hilarious guy.
