 Another summer, another Autechre album.  Their music is absolutely unsurpassable.  Ep 7 is, in fact, a full-length album, though it was sold as twin EPs in the UK (hence the name, I think).  Unlike last year's  unnamed album (commonly called "lp5" or simply  "Autechre"), this record features far more weird knob noodling  and fractured, confusing beats.  It is certainly not for everyone, but for  those who like their electronic music intelligent, challenging, and  adventurous, you must start with Autechre.
