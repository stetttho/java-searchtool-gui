 The full title is "Dub Gone Crazy: The Evolution of Dub at King Tubby's."  That "at" is key: most of these tracks are NOT King Tubby remixes, but remixes done at his studio by his proteges Prince (later King) Jammy, Scientist, and Philip Smart.  The general absence of Tubby himself does not mean that this disk is not exceptional--it is.  But if you're looking for TUBBY DUBS, you might want to look elsewhere.
