 A few extras I forgot to note in my original review. One page 123, where  the book starts to talk about 88 level data items (Condition Names), it's  time to go find a different reference.  Any other reference.  This book  botches the explanation.  I had trouble with it, the friend I mentioned had  trouble with it (and I did not warn him about it in advance). It's the only  major problem with the book. This book has not been revised since initial  publication, and contains no information on the 1989 Addendum to the COBOL  Standard (which is mostly Intrinsic Functions), and no information looking  at the upcoming release of the new COBOL Standard.
