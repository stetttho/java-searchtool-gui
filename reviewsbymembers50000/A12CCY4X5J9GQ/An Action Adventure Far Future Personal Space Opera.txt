 I started reading this book because it was part of Mike Resnick's general set of future history books including the razor hot Santiago and the triumph of storytelling, Ivory (go put this one in your shopping cart right  now if you're into serious dramatic SF).  I was not to be  disappointed. In a way, The Widowmaker: Unleashed is a study in what it  means to be a famous gunmen in an age of mass media in a vast territory  where "the law" is only sparsely present and enforced on an  irregular basis.  As countless Westerns have shown, aging gunmen face death  at the hands of those looking to make their reputations.  However, being  the best, the Widowmaker will not go down without a fight, and having  walked through a hundred death traps unscathed in his younger days, he  intends to get through this one last challenge: how to survive his own  reputation and failing capabilities. I started the book and within two  days I came to the last page after two late nights up until two in the  morning, the story really drives forward without tripping over itself in an  attempt to get to the end. Definitely worth my money and time.
