 Dragon Magazine has been the literal backbone of continually published support for all the incarnations of Dungeons and Dragons.  It has features a kaleidoscope of the best editors, writers, and artists in the Fantasy RPG industry, and plenty of others from the Science Fiction and SF RPG industry, as well.  New classes and races appears to wet our appetite for the game, followed by weapons, spells, and magical items.  Campaign advice, setting advice, miniatures, and product reviews . . . and we haven't even gotten to issue 100!  We found our first glimpse of the Forgotten Realms Campaign setting in Ed Greenwood's articles about a series of highly detailed magical tomes.  Who knew where that would go when the printer stamped the words "Pages from the Mages" down the first time?  It has played host to the greats of humor, Phil Foglio and David Tampier (of What's New and Wormy fame), plus equally famous strips such as Snarfquest, Knights of the Dinner Table, Dork Tower, Nodwick, and Zagonia.  Its letters from the fans have told us what people think, and the editorials have let us know the mind of management.  A certain special individual often got up on his soapbox and dispensed his view of the gaming industry.  Dragon has stayed a steady course.  It first came into our lives as, "The Strategic Review."  Then it changed to Dragon.  It lived more than twenty years in the fold of TSR, and several more in WotC camp.  Now it lives with a new publisher, Paizo.  In all that time, so many great articles have appeared up and down in all its eras, I don't think there is a way to quantify its contribution to not only D&D, but to so many other games as well.  I have been collecting the magazine steadily since 1981, and have always considered it an invaluable resource for all my gaming needs.
