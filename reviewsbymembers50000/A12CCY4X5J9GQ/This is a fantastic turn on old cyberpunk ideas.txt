 This book was good enough for me to read six times since I found it in 1993.  It completely tramples over most books in this field, only Walter Jon Williams book, Hardwired, is its equal.  The book has excellent pacing and avoids an attempt to drag anything out (the bane of many contemporary F&SF novels).  There are no major plot flaws.  I liked the main character, everything he did seemed completely reasonable.  The other characters were a little less well developed, but the action and plotting were so well developed that I didn't really care.  As the other reviewers have mentioned, this is one book in a huge series, though most of the books do not exist yet.  This shows.  The previous book, Emerald Eyes is practicaly impossible to find.  It took me two years to find this book.  The next book, The Last Dancer, is not nearly as good as this book, but it much easier to get.
