 John Barnes writes a brilliant near future history with one of the nastiest anti-heroes I've ever seen as the central character.  No punches are pulled in this book as the main character eventually winds up doing just about every brazen criminal act possible, from rape, assassination, and casual murder to engaging in planetary ecological warfare (delivering  the weapons, of course, not developing them). The concept of computer program viruses so intelligent that they can study other computer systems unknown to them, figure out how they work, reformat their virus to work on the new system and copy the virus into that foreign system for a takeover is made all the more chilling by the obvious corollary that the human mind is just another operating system to computer programs so awesomely sophisticated.  I honestly found this refreshing in the extreme, quite the opposite pole from panty-waisted Star Trek episodes where computers 300+ years from now are  frequently less sophisticated than the one I'm writing this review on. In short, this book rocked!  I've read it three times already, and while I've  never grown to like the central character (he's a psycho killer who would make Hannibal Lechter sit up and blink), the setting and technological extrapolation combined with a plot that just won't quit brings me back time and again.
