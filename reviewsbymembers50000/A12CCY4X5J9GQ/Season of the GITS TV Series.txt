 For a little more background:  Movies (The Puppet Master plotline):  Ghost in the Shell Ghost in the Shell: Innocence  TV Series (The Puppet Master in the movies never existed):  Season 1: Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex Season 2: Ghost in the Shell: Second GIG  Manga  Ghost in the Shell: Different than the first movie, but related. Ghost in the Shell: Innocence (I have not read it).  Ghost in the Shell: Man Machine Interface (a story set a few years after the first movie, it follows the Major in some later activities; it appears to take place after the second movie, but the second movie was published afterward, and they don't refer to each other as far as I know).  ----------------------------  The second movie picks up after the first movie (the puppet master affair plotline).  ----------------------------  I have seen almost the entire 2ng GIG series.  It possesses a more gritty and tight feel and story than the first season.  The animation style is markedly different.  In fact, the whole production value, while quite high, was still lower than the first season.  This was something of a disappointment to me, as I had expected them to exceed the past, not fall behind it.  The story, though, is still interesting as Section 9 fights for its own life and survival.  We learn a great deal more about the past, and every episode is, like the first season, crafted with what I think is a certain sort of genius.  I await the end of the second season with great anticipation.
