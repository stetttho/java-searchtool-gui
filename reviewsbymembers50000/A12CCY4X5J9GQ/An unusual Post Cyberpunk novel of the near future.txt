 It's hard to easily categorize this novel, as it is certainly nothing ordinary or well known.  It is set in the same fictional milieu as Orbital Resonance and Kaleidoscope Century, and for those who have read those  novels, there is much to find that is familiar, everything about the  setting, but nothing about the Plot.  Orbital Resonance was a Coming of Age  story, Kaleidoscope Century was an Anti-Hero Cautionary story.  What does  that make Candle?  Candle is a story about personal control, internal and  external, and what it really means to be human in relation to whether a  person actually controls their own destiny, or has their destiny controlled  by others.  These are deep subjects, and this novel is neither as fast  paced as Kaleidoscope Century nor as sympathetic as Orbital Resonance.   Instead it tries to point out that a person is not really a person unless  they are themselves free of external control.  This is more and more  important in the real world as various elements of society vie to control the  minds of everyone they can in any way they can.  The book gets deeply into  the minds of the central character and to some degree his opponent as well.   It also showcases some of the effects of growing old out of a profession  and a lifetime of activities based on youth and vigor.  For fans of the  first two books, a variety of questions are resolved, but even larger ones  are raised.  I can't reveal more without revealing things that are left to  the end of the novel, but it raises questions based on things the other books  have speculated will happen in the future.  Overall, I felt the book was  excellent, but as I said, also quite different.
