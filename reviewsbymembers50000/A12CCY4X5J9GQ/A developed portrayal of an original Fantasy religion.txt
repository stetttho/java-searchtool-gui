 What I remember most about this novel on first thought is that from the first pages a well developed and consistent religion dominates the novel.  The gods, their names, their histories, their interactions with the world,  and the impact of their actually existing is found in the flagstones the  novel is built on, and the characters are able to walk around on these  metaphorical flagstones with great confidence. After religion, I found  the comedy of the novel, often based in light cynicism, to help lead me  down through the pages toward the more important parts of the novel.  Then,  the heroic style drama comes to the fore, with the main character and the  main supporting character getting into a lot of fairly serious trouble.   The problems facing them mount and mount, I was afraid the story would  literally cop-out at the end, but surprisingly, it doesn't and provides for  a satisfactory conclusion (something sorely missed in many  stories). Although there is another novel based on the viewpoint  character, The Hunter's Haunt, it has nothing to do with The Reaver Road,  which is a self-contained novel.
