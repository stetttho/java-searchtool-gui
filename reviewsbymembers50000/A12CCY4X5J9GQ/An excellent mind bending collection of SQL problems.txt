 This book contains a set of problems to be solved using SQL, and the problems are such that they make the reader think of SQL and use it in a set based manner as opposed to mixing in procedural techniques. A stellar  book for instruction is SQL, as not only do the problems teach about how to  solve SQL problems correctly, but many of the problems are quite difficult,  providing for major mind expanding opportunities. Definitely worth the  money if you have an SQL package to attempt to solve the problems with.
