 When I read this book, I could find nothing that related it to Hardwired in any way.  That said, this is still a fantastic novel.  In the first pages, a certain well-known story cliche is introduced.  Don't let it throw you, keep reading, you won't regret it.  Mr. Williams stages an intricately layered plot, just as soon as you think everything is wrapped up, a completely unexpected and totally believable new layer is revealed.  I read it in a single day.
