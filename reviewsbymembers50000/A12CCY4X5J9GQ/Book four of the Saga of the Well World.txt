 As a general warning, this is the fourth book of a tightly knit series.  While the book is written to stand on its own, greater enjoyment can be found be reading the previous three novels: Midnight at the Well of Soul, Exiles at the Well of Souls, and Quest for the Well of Souls; before reading this one. This book begins back at the same interstellar community where the previous novels begin (it's know as the Comworlds, or the Com for short).  An alien race has arrived from another galaxy and is bent on conquest of ours, and since they're more advanced than the Com, they're winning. Mavra Chang, survivor of the War of the Well World, has just returned to the Comworlds. The true reality of the situation is far grimmer than they realize, and when they do catch up with Brazil, they regret it. Overall, the series really starts to pick up steam here, and that after admitting that the previous novels are already good to begin with.
