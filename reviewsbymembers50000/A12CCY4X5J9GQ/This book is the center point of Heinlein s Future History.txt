 I'm surprised there are only two other reviews on this book.  It is a collection of stories that forms the backbone of Heinlein's primary Future History.  Although the majority of the stories are quite old (I can't remember for sure, but I think none came out after the sixties, and most are from the forties and fifties), they form, together, one of the first coherent glimpses of the power of Science Fiction to detail a potential future, one that can show us what might happen, for good or for ill, and entertain us along the way. I've read this book about eight times from cover to cover, so often that I don't read it any more because it's burned into my mind.
