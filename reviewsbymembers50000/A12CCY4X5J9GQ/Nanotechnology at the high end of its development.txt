 Come and read about an almost-paradise several thousand years in the future, one in which the concepts of VR and Nanotech are developed by Mr. Williams to a logical extreme given the huge passage of time.  On the character/story side, human nature is examined at its best and worst; two truly altruistic viewpoints go to war, one of them one the side of maintaining paradise, and the other on the side of destroying it.  There wasn't anything here I wasn't willing to believe in.  Although a complete book, Mr. Williams cleverly leaves the door open for future novels.  Somehow, though, I doubt there will ever be one.  I hope I'm wrong.  This book definitely represents one of the best books I've ever read on these subjects.
