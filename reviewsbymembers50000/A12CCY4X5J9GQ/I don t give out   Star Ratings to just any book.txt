 What good things can't be said about this book?  It is probably the single strongest cyberpunk novel ever written, with only Walter Jon Williams' Hardwired coming close.  The action rocks, the humor is dark, sardonic, and counter-authoritarian, just the way I like it.  The hero is strong but not unbeatable (if only his enemies could think like he did).   The hero of the story, Trent, is now in his early twenties, and is a professional high-tech thief and con-man extraordinaire, living his life this way as a statement of principal (and a matter of necessity) against the authorities who used a nuclear weapon to kill his small collective family years before, and in the process, kill hundreds of thousands of bystanders and render millions more homeless.   Trent is thrown from his life as a buccaneer among the underbelly of polite society (or so he sees himself) and is once again pitted against his family's old adversary.  The two play cat and mouse for the rest of the book, with Trent one step ahead of his opponent, and thus the title of the book, "The Long Run".   I enjoyed reading every page of this book, I bought it long ago, in it's original paperback version.  I loaned it to a friend, never saw it again, and did not hesitate to buy it once more after an extensive search.  Now I have this version on order, and will consider that money well-spent, too.  I've read the whole novel six times, and will read it many more times in the future.   Simply outstanding.
