 The story picks up a while after the end of Forever War.  The characters are now firmly entrenched in a dead end life and want out. The first third of the story is them getting out. The second third of the story is  what the encounter on the way. The last third of the story is, well, you'll  have to judge for yourself, but I was quite surprised at by the ending.   The main characters are shown that not only is everything they've ever  known wrong, but that the person who has been running the show all along  doesn't really understand what's going on, either.  In one sense, this can  be thought of as a metaphor for what an author might experience when a  story takes on a life of its own and does things that are beyond simple  writing controls. Honestly, it gave me the feeling the author has more in  mind, as the book's ending didn't really feel like an ending so much as an  epiphany. The Forever War was, really, an astounding novel.  Forever Free  may, as time passes, be seen in the same light.
