 Emily Sachar identifies herself as a journalist, but she is a born teacher, in contrast to Jonathan Kozol, who taught for two years, then left to be a reporter.  He understood nothing at all about teaching, but Emily has the instincts of the true mentor. She notices the poor physical surroundings, but she knows that the real obstacles to learning in this school are otherwise.  Her obstinacy and love for her pupils make all the difference.  If only teachers colleges taught the love of learning and the truth that all children can learn if taught according to their needs, we would have more Emily Sachars, and our schools would be as good as the schools before World War II, when there were only dedicated teachers.  With the low salaries of that time, teachers had to make sacrifices to follow their calling, and it was a real calling.  I am glad that salaries are enough today to support a family, so that a married man is not eliminated, but there are far too many young people who see teaching as merely a job where there are perks; e.g. short hours (they lock the door at three o'clock and go out to their little sports cars); long vacations with the money for European jaunts; and tenure after three years.  What is wrong with education is the calibre of teachers graduated from teachers colleges.  Who knows?  Perhaps we need more journalists in the profession.
