 Wnen I was a girl, I read all of Sabatini's novels, and this was my favorite.  Sometimes Jane Austen's Fitzwilliam Darcy was my ideal man, and other times Bellarion was.  I just reread Bellarion more than fifty years later, and I still love him.  He was fortunate, always escaping by the skin of his teeth, but also misunderstood.  So brave, so self-effacing, so brilliant.  Of course, it turns out all right.  But on the way, one worries so about that strange but loveable boy who sets out to walk to school in Padua in the fifteenth century and ends up in all kinds of fixes, meanwhile becoming the leading condottiere in Italy.  The most fascinating part about him is his inventive and slippery mind.  A really good read.
