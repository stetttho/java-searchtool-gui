 The reason for the four stars is that I think it is not as good as Charlotte Bronte's best, the incomparable Jane Eyre.  But it is, compared with most novels of today, very good indeed.  The character of Shirley is wonderful. It is clear that Caroline is the protagonist, and that she is based on Charlotte herself and is therefore given the lion's share of attention.  I consider this one of the book's few faults.  The character of Robert Moore is beautifully drawn and I disagree with the editors that Louis is not.  Although the device of the diary is a bit clumsy, the dialogue between Louis and Shirley is enthralling.  Highly recommended.
