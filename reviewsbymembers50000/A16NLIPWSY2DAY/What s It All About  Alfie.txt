 The foregoing reviews seem to divide their readers into two groups, those who love it and those who hate it.  It occurs to me that many people start with a handicap, not knowing Tolkien's purpose in writing it.  Tolkien was, above all, a Christian, and he wrote for Christians.  Those who are Biblically illiterate will miss the allusions and evidences of Divine Providence that are of such importance to the narrative.     Having said this, I believe that lovers of the saga are to be found in all walks of life and all ages, including twelve-year-olds like my son, who has said, "This is my very favorite book of all books."  Tolkien himself said that it is not an allegory, but "history, real or feigned."  Whether it is to be viewed as real or feigned is a judgment of each individual.  This work is, arguably, the greatest work of fiction of the twentieth century.  More has been written about it by the best writers than any other novel of our time.  It is either very deep or very shallow.  Try it.  If you have the necessary background, you might like it.
