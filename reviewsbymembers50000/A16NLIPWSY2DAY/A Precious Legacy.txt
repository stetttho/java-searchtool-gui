 This book takes one back to a day when the timeless values were often the subject of literature, and language held beauties we seldom see today.  It is a deeply touching evocation of a long ago world as remote as Middle Earth or Narnia.  The meaning of the title is not clear to me, whether it is Prue's deformity or the passionate devotion to materialism of her brother, but I rather lean to the latter, since his life is so utterly poisoned by his addiction. Highly recommended.
