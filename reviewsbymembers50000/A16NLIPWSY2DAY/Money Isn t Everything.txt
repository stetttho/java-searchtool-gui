 Kozol is a good reporter, but two years of teaching has not made him an authority on education.  The conditions of poor schools are sad and I feel sorry that the physical conditions are so bad, but Kozol's solution to poor education is throwing money at the schools, and his own examples show how wrong his solution is.  In the poor schools where there are dedicated teachers, the learning is immense; in the one wealthy school in Rye, New York, the students not only do not learn anything worth knowing; their attitudes are chilling.  I would rather my children should attend the East St. Louis school and get the marvelous education available there than the Rye school where the curriculum is soul-destroying.  The physical environment is the least of the factors that affect one's education.  President Garfield famously said that education is a great teacher on one end of a log and the student on the other.  This book, though the author's agenda was quite different, proves this without a doubt.
