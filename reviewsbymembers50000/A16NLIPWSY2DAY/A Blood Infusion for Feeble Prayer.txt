 This is a remarkable book.  From the man who was responsible for millions of Bibles smuggled behind the Iron Curtain, he tells his secret strategy.  He refers to scriptures in proving that Christians (and Jews) may indeed justify asking God to change his mind.  Then he gives examples of when he did just that, and GOD DID CHANGE HIS MIND.  He charges the heresy of Christian fatalism with the responsibility for the powerlessness of many of today's Christians.  He points out that Christianity (and Judaism)is the ONLY religion that denies the immovability of the will of God.  If you are into prayer, try it, you'll like it.
