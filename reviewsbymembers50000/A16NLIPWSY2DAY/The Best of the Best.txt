 Jacques Barzun is in his nineties today and still one of the best thinkers of our time.  Forty years ago both my wife and I ran across this book as we were taking wearisome ed courses in teachers college to acquire certification to teach in New York public schools.  Our professors did not like Barzun then, and I am sure they don't like him today.  He is down-to-earth, full of common sense, and brilliantly lucid.  This was our handbook, along with Gilbert Highet's The Art of Teaching, which they didn't like either.  Everything we heard in those classes was   shown to be false after we began teaching, but Barzun's observations were unfailingly accurate.  Any teacher who goes by this book cannot utterly fail, even in this ridiculous system which has persecuted American children for a half century.
