 Brandon Alspaugh's review is by far the most intelligent of all the reviews, but he really missed the point.  In 1945, Orwell saw the signs of things to come.  He was not a prophet in the sense of the Old Testament prophets but a man who could relate seemingly unrelated things, what we used to call prescient.  1984 was a year arbitrarily chosen.  Of course, some things had come true by 1984, and others had not and never would.  One big mistake Orwell made was to make Big Brother an appendage of the government.  Alspaugh is exactly right that Big Brother is the media.  He's a little skewed in leaving out the rest of the media and concentrating on Fox, but he has the idea.  The chief notion of the book is embodied in the character of Winston Smith and his occupation, which is the rewriting of history.  As an historian, I am vividly aware of how much history has been rewritten in the past half century by the revisionists.  But we may yet escape the world of 1984.  There is in the making a rebellion of the proles.  They are beginning to object to the  manipulation of facts by the media.  There are some things the proles know, and they will not accept alternative "facts."  Odd, isn't it, that the folks who think for themselves these days are not the most educated class?
