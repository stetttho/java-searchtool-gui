 I was most interested in Optimus Maximus, though I disagree with two points. Still I said the essay was helpful.  I think most people would find it so.  But--pullease, sir!-- Christianity is NOT complex.  It can be stated in three paragraphs known as The Apostles' Creed. You needn't tell me that many Christians do not know this Creed, and therefore find the many books written ABOUT Christianity complex. Of course.  When one is discussing a world view one ought to go back to the earliest statement of it.   Regarding the other point, I have found that many Christian women, including my wife, do not at all mind obeying their husbands.  It relieves them of a great deal of heavy thinking and gives them more time to do the things they like,--such as spending time with the children, knitting, cooking gourmet meals, and gardening.  My wife cordially detests the women of NOW, refers to them as the "hairy-legged ones" and numerous other nasty epithets.  Not all of today's women, especially Christian women, feel "liberated" by twentieth-century mores.      For me, the value of Lewis's book is its use as a handbook to provide a language by which to speak to Christians of other persuasions.  I have given away more copies than I care to count. You will remember his preface in which he says that he has found those at the center of each denomination in tune with each other more that they are with those on the periphery of their own denomination. I find this is true.  As a traditional Episcopalian, I have more in common with James Kennedy, a traditionsl Presbyterian, Adrian Rogers, a traditional Southern Baptist, and Alan Keyes, a traditional Catholic, than I have with many of the bishops of my own church, who would not find MERE CHRISTIANITY at all palatable. I think the book was not so much written to convert non-Christians as to inform them about basic doctrine and to re-inform Christians when they have strayed into heresy.  Just my opinion.
