 This book is a simple read. It is about one man's life with the Yakuza. I was a bit surprised since it dispelled my preconceived notions of the Yakuza. I agree with the reviewer below - it does seem like a 'goodfellas' set in Japan. It is about the life of a man who started out as a kid as a lookout for dice games held in a warehouse. It progresses through his interesting career and life. At the conclusion of the book, I felt quite sad for the man whose life this book is about. It's a decent lazy Sunday afternoon read about a career criminal in Japan - take it as such. I also agree with another reviewer - it seems like this individual was involved in local, territorial issues - not a high ranking, key player. For me however, it did demystify a lot of my preconceived notions of the Yakuza. I walked away with the feeling that organized crime in Japan is pretty similar to organized crime in the states.
