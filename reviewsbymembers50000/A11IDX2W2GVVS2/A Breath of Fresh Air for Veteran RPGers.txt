 After nearly a decade of not playing CRPGs, I can honestly say that Arcanum sucked me back into the CRPG world. What makes Arcanum great is the flexibility. You can choose to be good, evil, start out good and become evil later (or vice versa - although becoming evil is a bit harder to recover from), become a technologist, or a mage or neither, or a bit of both. What seperates this game from many of its predecessors is the lack of restraints. You don't feel like you MUST do quest A then B then C. You can blunder around aimlessly and pick up a plethora of side quests that have branches of their own.  Another thing to note is the cleverness of the world created and the mystery of the main plot kept me guessing all the way until the end. The atmosphere of the game is unique that has been cleverly adapted with a combination of Victorian England meets the Wild West. The story is not lacking or flat and the dialogue allows you to be as gallant, devious, or just plain ornery as you want to be. The main shortcomings of this game really are the odd tendency to CTD (crash to desktop), so save early and often to avoid losing much. The other shortcoming is the pathfinding of the NPCs leaves a bit to be desired. All in all a very nifty game with a brilliant world that has few constraints. As an aside, their are some clever little mods out there that can enhance the gameplay experience. The most useful of which are those that allow your character to continue to grow and gain experience. The game, as shipped, caps your character at level 50. During my first go, I found myself only 80% through the main quest before I found out that I couldn't advance my character further in experience.
