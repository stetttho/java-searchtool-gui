 I highly recommend this read for anyone. It is the original story of true loyalty and vengance. I was surprised at how few versions of this story are actually written (at least in the US). Keep in mind this is one written version of a popular folktale - much like many popular Robin Hood stories. There are few actual written historical accounts of the true events and what goes on in the story is not to be taken as historically accurate. It is a good yarn and the author has done an excellent job of weaving together this story. You feel Oishi's quiet outrage every step of the way on his quest to avenge his Lord Asano. Parts of the plot of this story have been retold in several popular American movies typically in the form of the son trying to avenge the death of his father rather than the retainer trying to avenge the death of his master (Star Wars anyone?). Needless to say it is a timeless classic tale of Honor, Loyalty, and Revenge.
