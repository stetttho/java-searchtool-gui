 A fantastic tale that will be retold for generations to come. This is the other story that little Alexander the Great's mother told him repeatedly as a child (besides the Iliad). After reading this you will understand why. A mercenary army makes it's way into Persian lands (modern Turkey) only to find themselves cut off from home in the middle of the campaign with their generals betrayed and slaughtered under the pretenses of a peace offering. With their leadership gone, the mercenaries nominate a handful of lower ranking men to take charge and lead them home. This is Xenophon's story as one of those men chosen to save his brethren. The reader is taken on a journey with this band of starving ruffians as they alternatively fight and talk their way through hostile enemy territory the entire time with an army in pursuit. It would seem to be over-the-top Hollywood script if it weren't true. Xenophon tells us this amazing story in his own words.  On a seperate note, this is a Loeb Classical Library book. For those of you unfamiliar with this, it means that the left-hand page is written in Greek for those studying (ancient?) Greek. This is an incredible concept for those learning ancient languages. However, for the rest of us it just looks like nifty scribbly stuff that means nothing.   Another item this book could have used was a really good map. I had to search online to find a relevant map to follow along with the places Xenophon's army was passing through. Even then I was unable to find a decent one that clearly showed the route traveled and clearly identified the towns passed through. Without this one is truly clueless about where the army is at any given point in time.   Lastly, Xenophon was a decent writer, but not a fantastic, dramatic writer. Some of writing can come across rather dry given the circumstances he is describing - written more for posterity than for dramatic reading.
