 I read this book many years after seeing the movie "The 9th Gate" several times. I had always been intrigued by the movie and finally managed to read the book. It should be noted that the movie didn't follow the book all that closely. The Club Dumas is much more intriguing and complex. If you liked the movie, you must absolutely read the book, as the characters are much more interesting. Perez-Reverte's writing style is astoundingly refreshing. As an avid reader of both fiction and non-fiction, I have to admit that I have not encountered such a rich writing style before. Reverte's attention to detail is stunning and astonishing without being dull. It hearkens back to the old 'dark detective' style of writing while remaining invigorating throughout. I am now hooked and will begin reading some of Reverte's other works.
