 I picked up the bundled jewel case as a cheap diversion for a weekend away from home visiting relatives. Rather than be taken hostage on a shopping trip that never ends, I snuck off to the store, found this little gem of a game, hid away with my laptop an opened a wickedly funny universe.  Both of these games are a blast. Many might find the graphics a bit dated, but the open-endedness is unfathomable. You really can do all those stupid things you always want to do in other CRPGs - steal cars, be bad, be good, be both. The campy humor kept me going into the wee hours of the night. I haven't played a game that kept me laughing this long in nearly a decade. The content is a tad on the mature side, particularly in Fallout 2, parents you were warned. It is a small wonder that this game developed a cult following, it is a place all its own. It will stick with you long after you abandon it.
