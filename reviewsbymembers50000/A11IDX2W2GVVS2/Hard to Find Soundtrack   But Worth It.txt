 This is the soundtrack that launched Basil Poledouris' career. Like many artists, the first work is often the best. Few soundtracks to movies could stand alone these days. Fewer still actually play a dominant role as this one did.  Note to afficianodos: There are two versions of this soundtrack on CD - one by Milan and one by Varese Sarabande. The Sarabande soundtrack has been out of print for 10 years and contains 16 tracks versus the 12 on the Milan edition. I own the Milan version and it is spectacular. I still had to do some hunting to get this one. Since it is hard to find to begin with, and now out of print for a long time, expect to pay a hefty fee to acquire the Sarabande version if you must have it.  Regardless, I would venture to say this is one of the top soundtracks one can get. It effectively carries you through all emotions portrayed in the movie - from wonder to adventure to sadness to anger and then to hope. Every time I listen to the Anvil of Crom it triggers something primal. A must have for couch barbarians! Do yourself a favor - pick up copy, [turn] it up, grab your son's plastic sword, throw the wife over your shoulder, growl at your dog and prepare to pillage the neighborhood!!
