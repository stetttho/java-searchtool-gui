 So many books are written about the Crusades. So many books that are so dull. You can literally go to any public library, find the medieval history section, spin around three times and find a very dull, very lengthly book on the Crusades. Maalouf's book is interesting and dare I say it refreshing. There are literally hundreds of accounts from the western perspective of the sacking and pillaging a particular city. It is nice to see accounts revealed from those being sacked and pillaged and how unpleasant they found it.  Maalouf reveals the arabic perspective of the Crusades from a selected period 1096 - 1291. There were several, mostly abysmal attempts before and a few attempts after. This book is a vital companion to anyone studying the Crusades. Maalouf does not pull any punches either revealing both how the Franks lined up and an slaughtered innocents as well as how the various Arab princes constantly played one another against each other in order to expand or preserve their particular realm. He also reveals how the Jewish communities were butchered along with the Muslim (the Crusaders did not distinguish the two since neither were Christian). This book reveals much of what goes on in the Arab mind today and why the West is perceived the way it is. Read this book to get an alternative perspective on a dark part of world history that is all to often glossed over in American public school programs.
