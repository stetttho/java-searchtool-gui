 This is the type of movie that will make you think. For those that want to disengage their brain and be entertained - look elsewhere. This is an intriguing movie where the witnesses of horrific act each tell their own version of what happened. The story takes a peek into how the mind copes with what it can't understand (or isn't ready to). For those unfamiliar with Kurosawa's work, this film is a masterpiece. Kurosawa makes clever use of the camera in building the audience's suspense in a very similar fashion to what Alfred Hitchcock did. Contemporary audiences may find this technique more agitating than viewers in the 1950's as audience attention spans have shrunk - however this only makes the technique more effective.   For those seeking a psychological exploration of the human mind at it's worst (and best), you will definitely enjoy this film. It bears resemblance to classic greek plays where the audience is asked to think and reflect rather than be whirled around on ride like modern films. For film students, it is an first-hand example of innovation in film-making technique and dramatic effect.
