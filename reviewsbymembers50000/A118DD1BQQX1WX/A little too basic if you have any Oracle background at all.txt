 I thought that this book was O.K. Unfortunately, I ended up taking it back  because it wasn't quite what I needed.  I would suggest this book to anyone  who has absolutely no clue about being a DBA or Oracle8.x.  The first 100  or so pages are dedicated to providing the reader insight into the world of  database administration. This book gives some worthwile information on db  setup, and not as much specific information as I would like to see on the  actual job(s) that a dba does.  My suggestion is to combine this book with  another (Oracle8i DBA reference or Oracle8i reference).  Overall, this book  gives decent elementary knowledge of the world of Oracle, but unless you  are a complete novice to Oracle/dba buy another book, or look for something  more intermediate.
