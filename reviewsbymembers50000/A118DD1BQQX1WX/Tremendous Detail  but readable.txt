 I think that this is one of the best books on the market if you want to understand what is happening to the body while doing yoga postures.  A previous reviewer mentioned that it would be good to have the Sandskit terms for many of the poses, which would be nice, but I can understand the rationale for having all poses in their english equivalent.  If you are a teacher, serious practioner/student this is a must buy, because it provides great detail about anatomical perspective of yoga.
