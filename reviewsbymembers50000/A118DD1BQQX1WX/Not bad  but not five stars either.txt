 I will admit that the book does have some very good information on JSP.  The code in the book is good, and the code does work for real life situations.  However, this book was a tough read for me.  I found that this book at times would drone on and on about some definitions that may or may not actually help you in the real world.  In addition, I wish that it explained more adequately about setting up your Java environment for a Windows o/s.  The book gives a very detailed installation on Unix, but virtually nothing for any Windows o/s, which to me is strange since most people have Win 95', 98' or NT.  If you want to get snippets of code that will help you at the job, then this book is great.  However, if you are new to JSP and trying to figure JSP out, or have a Windows box, then find another book.
