 I have used Source Safe on two occassions.  The first was a consulting project where we created all the web pages from day one.  In this situation, Source Safe is great.  You have fewer worries.  The second instance is now, where I am currently migrating legacy code into source safe, and it is a little more difficult to deal with.  There are not enough resources on how to use this product.  The basics of using the product are fairly intuitive and pretty well documented on MSDN online or CD.  Unfortunately, the intermediate to advanced (i.e. tips, tricks, etc.)information is a little more difficult to come across.  The only thing I have been able to find on Source Safe training is a three video series (about $250 for the set), which I am still trying to find more information about before I purchase it, and even it that was not all that easy to find.  I cannot believe that someone has not written about this application.  Overall, I think Source Safe is a great tool, especially if you are starting from scratch.  However, just keep in mind that you must plan well if you are implementing it into an environment that already exists.
