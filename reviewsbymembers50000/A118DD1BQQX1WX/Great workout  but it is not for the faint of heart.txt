 This workout is one of the most difficult work out videos I've dealt with.  I haven't sweated this hard since I stop running track in college.  The first work out (The basics) is cool, it teaches you basic form and footwork and lays the ground work for the other three workouts.  The following three (Combo, Shadow boxing, and Cardio) are serious.  The Combo workout is approximately 35 minutes, the other two are about 45 minutes.  I felt very muched worked over when I did any of the workouts.  The Combo workout used weights and emphasized strength little more than the other two, but they were all great workouts.  If you are looking to sweat (hard) and lose some weight, buy this DVD.  I would not suggest this DVD to anyone who is not use to mid to high intensity workouts.  This work out is no joke.
