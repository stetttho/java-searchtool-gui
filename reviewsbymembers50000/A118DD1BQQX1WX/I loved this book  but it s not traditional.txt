 This book took the most novel approach to learning Java that I have ever seen.  I learned more about Java patterns reading this book then I learned in 1 class and 2 books.  With that said, the books learning style will not be for everyone.  This book uses lots of humor and quirky examples to get it's point across.  I took to the style like a fish to water.  However, for those of you who are into the more traditional format of Java books and computer books in general, then this book is not for you.  If you are a little more open minded and are willing to try something different when it comes to learning Java patterns, then I suggest this book.  I enjoyed this book so much that order two of the other books in the Head First Series (Java and EJB).
