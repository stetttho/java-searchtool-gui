 Prior to purchasing this DVD, I heard many things about Forrest Yoga.  All of it good.  I bought the DVD and was initially not impressed with the poses I saw performed.  Then I actually tried the workout and it was great.  The poses performed on this DVD aren't anything a person with 2 or more years of experience could not perform.  With that said, what makes this DVD solid, is the amount of time poses are held and the core abdominal work.  For people who are used to vinyasa flow constant movement type yoga (like myself), this DVD is a nice alternative.  Forrest Yoga is slower flowing yoga (compared to Ashtanga or Vinyasa Flow/Power Yoga) with more of an emphasis on holding poses for a longer period of time.  I look forward to purchasing more of Ana's DVDs.
