 Quick is a relative term.  Normally the Primary Series takes about 1.5-2 hrs to complete, so 15-45 minutes is fast considering.  In David Swenson's Practice Manual there are 3 of what Swenson refers to as Short Forms.  These Short Forms are 15, 30, and 45 minutes respectively.  They are geared for people who either don't have the 90 minutes required to complete the entire Primary Series, or people who are not ready for the entire Primary Series.  Swenson's instruction is awesome.  He guides you through the modified versions of the Primary Series in very reassuring and expert manner.  Swenson also offers some modifications for some of the more difficult poses.  This DVD makes the Primary Series more approachable.  I would suggest watching the DVD (or at least the practice time you select) all the way through before doing it (unless you are familar with Swenson's book and have some experience with Short Forms already).  Swenson has a great demo at the beginning of the DVD, very inspiring.  To truly get the benefit of the DVD, order his book along with the DVD to get the best of both worlds.  I think almost anyone could benefit from this DVD, as long as the person keeps in mind that this is a very physical style of yoga, and will make most (novice to intermediate especially) practioners sweat.
