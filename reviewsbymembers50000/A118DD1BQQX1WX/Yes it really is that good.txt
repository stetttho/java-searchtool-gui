 I recently started practicing The Primary Series, and although there are some really good books out there (Julie Pegram, Berly Bender Birch, Richard Freeman, etc.) I must say this is the best.  This book gives a lot of what alot of the other books give (History, Sanskrit Terminology, The entire Primary Series, some or all of the Intermediate Series, modifications to postures, etc.), but this book goes a little beyond.  A prime example of this concept is the abbreviated workouts (aka "Short Forms").  The Short Forms range from 15-45 minutes.  I can speak from personal experience on how well even a 15 minute Short Form can improve your overall wellness.  In addition David Swenson's breaking down of how to properly perform a half vinyasa (the Up Dog, Down Dog, jump through after every seated posture) is unparalled, a very detailed step-by-step analysis that makes this impossible display of dexterity seem attainable.  Any person with at least a base understanding of Ashtanga Yoga, or Yoga in general, could benefit from this book.  In fact, anybody interested in developing an at home practice could benefit from what this book has to offer.  What else can I say, this book is really that good.
