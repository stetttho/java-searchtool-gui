 I have only gone through the first few days of this book thus far, and I find that none of the vbscript works.  I am not sure as to whether or not you need to have Windows NT, or not.  It seems that FrontPage 97 or 98 will  not accept much VBScript.  I know the author cautions readers that  FrontPage won't do much in the way of ASP, but give me a break!  It won't  do anything as far as ASP is concerned.  I sent an e-mail to the author,  and I am currently awaiting a reply.  My overall analysis of this book is  that it has some good information about ASP for novice programmers, but  this book needs an accompanying CD that can provide an environment to play  around in, because FrontPage just doesn't cut it.
