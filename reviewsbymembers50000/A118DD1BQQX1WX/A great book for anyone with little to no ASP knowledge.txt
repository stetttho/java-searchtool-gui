 I found this book to be the best beginners ASP book I have come across.  I tried the SAM'S series first (i.e. Active Server Pages 2.0 in 24 hrs and 21 days respectively) I found these books to have too many coding errors and  not being able to properly route you to an ASP environment.  This book on  the other hand did a great job of telling you what you needed to run ASP on  your laptop/desktop, and how to find it.  My personal suggestion is that if  you have the means of downloading PWS 4.0 from a network do so, because the  download takes forever otherwise.  I found the example programs to be  pretty much on the mark.  I would also suggest downloading HomePage 4.0  from Allaire, it is an excellent HTML editor. The book tells you how to go  about downloading HomePage as well.  I have had a lot to say about this  book because it is just that good, the authors do a fantastic job of  explaining how each part of the code works.  Some other readers may have  found this repetitive, but with limited HTML and no ASP experience, I found  it to be a God sent.
