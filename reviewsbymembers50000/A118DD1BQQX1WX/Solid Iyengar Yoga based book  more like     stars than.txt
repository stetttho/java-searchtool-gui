 This book does a nice job of talking about and demonstrating many poses that people do in yoga classes and on yoga dvds.  This book is broken up into sections (standing poses, seated poses, twisting poses, etc) and does a nice job with providing modifications for the poses.  The advanced section towards the back of the book is also very good, and helps people who have a nice degree of flexibility (or who are looking for increased range of motion) to go a little deeper and try some tougher poses.  My only problem with this book is that there were not enough seated poses.  The book only covered Cobbler's Pose and Full Lotus Pose (I admit to being slightly bias because these are the poses I struggle the most with).  While these are great poses to cover, adding a few more of the seated poses would made this book 5 stars for me.  Otherwise, this is a great book, and I think anyone from any level or any style of yoga can get something out of this book.
