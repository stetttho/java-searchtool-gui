 I love this book.  I often look through it for inspiration.  The photos are well done.  However, I do not agree with a previous reviewer in that something is missing (i.e the yogis/yoginnis are not sweating).  I think that was the idea.  The idea is to get to a level where yoga is like breathing.  Do you need to sweat to breath?  For most people the answer is no.  I thought of this book as a demonstration of various poses performed at the highest level possible.  It depicted yoga as an art form.  I enjoyed this book immensely.
