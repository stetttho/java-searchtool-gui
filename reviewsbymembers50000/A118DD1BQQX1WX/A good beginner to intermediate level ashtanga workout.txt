 I found this to be one of the best beginner/intermediate ashtanga workouts that I've seen.  This DVD cuts right to chase, no special features tabs, about the teacher tabs, etc.  There is a brief introduction by the Baron, and then he gets right into it. Baron and his class (composed of 4 women and two men of various skill levels) stay pretty true to the warmup and standing poses section of the primary series (Sun Salutations A & B, forward bends, balance pose, etc.).  The only adjustment is the half bound lotus forward bend is modified so that you can either grab the foot and hold it to the inside of opposite thigh without having to "bind" the foot and bend forward, or do tree pose if that's too difficult.  Baron then gets into the floor exercises, he pretty much performs the beginner and few intermediate level floor poses (eastern plank, one-legged forward bends A and B, Marichyasana A, etc.).  The more advanced poses are left out (i.e. tortise, sleeping tortise, rooster, headstands, etc.).  He then goes into a modified closing sequence, and ends the class with the corpse pose.  Overall, I think this DVD is a great intro to ashtanga yoga.  It makes the Primary Series accessible to either yoga newbies or beginner/intermediate level students who are trying to ease there way into ashtanga yoga.  This tape is a great building block towards completing the Primary Series.  This DVD could also be used (along w/ attending regualr classes) as a stepping stone towards more advanced DVDs like Richard Freeman's Primary Series DVD which teaches the entire Primary Series with no modifications, see my review for details (not for the faint of heart ;-)).  Overall I enjoyed this DVD and would suggest it to anyone looking to start learning the Primary Series without being intimidated by the some of the poses it includes.  The advanced practicioner of the Primary Series however, would be grow bored easily.
