 I am an avid reader of novels (sci-fi, horror, adventure, etc.).   This one of the best sci-fi adventures I have ever read.  This book is non-stop action from start to finish.  I will not get into too much detail about the contents of the book for fear of spoiling it for someone, but the protagonist of the book Memnon (or Memna-un in  Kemtic) is the son of great warrior whose fame is spread far and wide. Memnon's mother tries to steer Memnon away from a warrior's life by having him learn to be a scribe.  Memnon excells while training to be a scribe but is not happy and decides to tell his mother (after graduation) how he wants to become a warrior like his father, and from their the story takes off, leading Memnon across seas doing battle with monsters, magicians, kings, etc.. This first book is primarily concerned with how he starts his legend and some of the exploits along the way.  The use of African mythology and history are amazing.  When I met the author of this book at an African Cultural Convention, he told me this book was as good anything Steven Barnes (author of Lion's Heart,Zulu Heart,Blood Brothers, etc.) had written.  I was skeptical initially, but thought I'd give the book a shot anyway.  After reading this book I can say that the book is on par with Lion's Blood and Zulu Heart in terms of non-stop action.  I think Barnes book are slightly more imaginative.  However, Barnes books are almost completely fictional, while Memnon is based a little more in historical facts.  Either way, this a fantastic book, and I look forward to reading the second installment.
