 I found this book to be exciting from start to finish.  The story starts in Louisiana where "King" Tremain is still a teenager and goes with his favorite uncle on a raid of the hated DuMont property.  The situation goes bad and young Tremain has to leave town to avoid certain death.  Tremain joins the army and this is just the beginning.  His adventures leads the reader through France, Germany, to New York, back to Louisiana, to Oklahoma, again to Louisiana and finally San Fransico.  Tremain is a hard, determined man who is a highly skilled fighter who is no stranger to violence and death.  However, he does have a strict moral code, and is a staunch believer in family and loyalty.  Despite how he is able to evade death and serious harm throughout the book when it comes to dealing with his enemies, the same cannot be said for Tremain's family life.  In some ways Tremain's family problems are a result of the way he deals with the his enemies.  If you are the type of person who enjoys action adventures, where the hero overcomes all odds to right wrongs, etc.  then this book is definitely for you.
