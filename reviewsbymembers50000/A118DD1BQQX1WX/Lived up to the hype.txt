 Sometimes when a book has been given a high rating by an over whelming number of people, my inclination is to be a little suspicious.  However, this book is worth every penny.  I learned something almost immediately reading this book.  What I liked most about this book is the fact that you do not have to read one chapter to understand another one.  The examples in this book do work, and I have used a few as a guide to real life problems.  Overall, I thought that this book is one of the best T-SQL books out there.  If you want to improve your T-SQL skills you can spend the $... bucks for this book, or take a $2000+ class.  This the best book on the market for T-SQL period.
