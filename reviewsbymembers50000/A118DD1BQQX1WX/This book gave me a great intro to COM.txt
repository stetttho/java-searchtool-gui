 I bought this book knowing absolutely nothing about COM/DCOM.  This book does a good job of orientating you to the world of COM.  In the process it does a pretty good job of explaining object-oriented programming.  The only  remotely bad thing I can say about this book is that it shows some  favortism towards C++ (too many C++ references and not enough Java/J++  and/or Visual Basic).  otherwise this is a great book for gaining  understanding about COM/DCOM.
