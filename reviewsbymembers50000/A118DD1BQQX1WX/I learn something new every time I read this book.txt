 Although there is some good basic level information in this book, it is not for the person trying to learn how to program Cold Fusion, but how to make your Cold Fusion programming better.  The book has great examples and how tos of everything from setting up the Cold Fusion Administrator to writing better SQL statements.  I particularly found the SQL statement information very helpful.  The author (Chris Cortes) goes beyond writing simple SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, and DELETE  statements.  He gets into far more complex SQL like writing SELECT statements within a SELECT statement, and writing your SQL so that you optimize the speed of your queries.  He also provides good examples of the new query of a query functionality that CF 5.0 offers.  Cortes also offers great information on the proper usage of various CF tags and functions, not just telling you how to use them, but when it is best to use them.  Overall, this is the best CF book I have read.  However, make sure you know a little something about CF before buying this book.
