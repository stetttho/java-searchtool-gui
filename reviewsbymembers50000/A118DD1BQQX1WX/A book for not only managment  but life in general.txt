 I found this to be one of the best books I have ever read.  This book speaks of things we as people should already know and do, but the way the information is presented is outstanding.  In addition, I found this book to entertaining as well.  I would recommend this book for anyone who is either working towards a career in management, or has a career in management.  A definite must buy.
