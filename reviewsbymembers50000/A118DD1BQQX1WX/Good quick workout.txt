 I enjoyed working out to this dvd, looking at the cover, I expected more challenging poses, but the tape does live up to it's name in terms of sweating.  The workout is roughly 30 minutes long, which is good, if you're starting out, or just want variety.  I prefer longer workouts (60-90 minutes), but Rainbeau starts off very slowly, and progresses to get you sweating.  Overall, I thought that this tape was good, but I would have enjoyed a longer workout, and maybe even an interview with the instuctor.
