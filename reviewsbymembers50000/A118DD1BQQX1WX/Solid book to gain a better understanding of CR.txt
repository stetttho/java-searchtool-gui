 I purchased this book for a specific job I needed to do.  I have about a year of experience with CR 8, but I use it only in special circumstances.  This book helped me learn what I needed to know about subreports.  I skimmed some of the other chapters, and they looked pretty good.  Particularly chapters geared towards SQL (14, 15, & 18).  Overall, it's a good, solid book to help beginner to intermediate users gain a better understanding of CR 8.
