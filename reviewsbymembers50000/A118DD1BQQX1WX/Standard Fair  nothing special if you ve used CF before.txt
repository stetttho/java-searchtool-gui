 This book is ok, especialy if you are a newbie to CF programming.  My problem with this book is that it reads alot like the CF 4.0-5.0 books that I've seen.  The vast majority of the chapters are the same as the books befor this one, which is fine if you haven't used CF before.  If you have, save your money, and get the CF MX Developer Cookbook, or The CFMX Bible, which will give you more "how to" info.  You'll find the same how to create queries, how to create a loop, how to ...etc. type info that the CF 4.0-5.0 books offered.  Of course this book includes new info (e.g. using CFC's, new functions. etc), but there's not enough of this to justify the money.  Again this book is fine if you're new to CF, but if you've got experience with at least one previous implementation of CF, save your money, and buy one of the other books I mentioned.
