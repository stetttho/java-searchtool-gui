 I  own three of Yee's DVDs (Power Yoga the complete Workout, Yoga for Athletes, and this one), and Yee has not let me down yet.  Each DVD is a little better than the last.  This one may be his best yet.  I think this DVD is a great intermediate level workout.  The level of poses is not extremely complex, but he gives you a complete body workout in about 63 minutes.  Those of you familiar with Yee's "Power Yoga the complete workout" will note that this work out goes 60+ minutes straight, versus breaking up the workout into three types (stamina, strength, and flexibility).  This workout will build endurance for sure.  I like how this DVD is a little less rushed than the first Power Yoga DVD.  The poses are held longer, and are slightly more difficult than the first DVD, but the pace is slower.  In this DVD you may feel less rushed than you did in the previous Power Yoga DVD with moving from one pose to the next.  If you are new to Yoga, this may be tough for you.  Although these poses may or may not be difficult for everyone, the sequence and the amount of time you spend doing them may be.  I would suggest this tape for anyone looking to establish an at home practice who has practiced for at least 6 months or better, and who wants to build endurance.  As I stated before Rod Yee comes through yet again with another great yoga DVD.
