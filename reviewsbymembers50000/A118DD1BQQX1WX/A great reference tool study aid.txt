 Ben Forta definitely hit a home run with this book.  I am impressed with how much information was packed into such a small book.  I have not taken the CF (ColdFusion) certification test as of yet, but I feel a lot better prepared for it now.  The chapters are loaded with good information, and are seriously condensed (no fluff, or unnecessary garbage to increase the number of pages).  The quizzes at the end of the chapters are excellent.  These questions are by far more difficult than anything else I have seen on CF certifications (i.e. the CF certification web site, and the CF_Buster test prep).  In addition, this book is a great reference guide.  If you are unsure of how to do something in CF, this book more than likely will tell you how it can be done.  This book offers a lot more than I would expect from a book that's under 400 pages.  If you want to prepare for the certification test, buy this book; or, if you just want to take your CF knowledge to the next level, buy this book.
