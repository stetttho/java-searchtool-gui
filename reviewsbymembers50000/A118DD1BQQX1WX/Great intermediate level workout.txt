 This DVD is very similar to Rodney Yee's latest Power Yoga DVD.  The big differences are inversions and slightly more difficult seated poses.  The average person with 2+ years of experience would benefit from this DVD (I suggest 2 plus years, but a person could get plenty of benfit out of this DVD by modifying a few poses with less experience too).  The inversions are performed against a wall, but can be performed out in the open if you have good proficency with forearm balance and headstand poses.  The flow is smooth and depends upon the style of yoga you come from as to whether you would consider it fast or slow.  If your background is based in ashtanga, then you would probably consider the flow as kind of slow to moderate, if you have more of an iyengar (or any yoga style where a long period of time is spent in a given pose) backgound then the pace may be a little quicker than what you may be used to.  Personally, I think the flow is good giving some time to get into poses and start to feel the stretch, but the flow keeps the heat going.  This DVD is about 65 minutes long and is good if you are working your way to hour plus yoga sessions.  Overall, this is another great Yee production, and as I've stated in previous reviews, Yee hasn't let me down yet.
