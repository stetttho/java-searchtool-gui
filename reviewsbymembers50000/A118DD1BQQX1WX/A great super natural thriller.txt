 I thought Due's book was fantastic.  This is the first work of hers that I have read, but it certainly will not be the last.  The book features Hilton James, who suffers from nightmares.  He almost drowned at age 8, but was fortunately rescued by his grandmother "Nanna", who dies in her rescuing of Hilton.  Although Hilton survives, his psyche becomes progrssively damaged with each occurence of these nightmares.  They go away for a while (5 years), but come back when his wife DeDe (a newly elected District Court Judge) starts receiving death threats from a white racist.  Hilton begins having trouble distinguishing his "dreams" from reality as the two start to meld together.  This was an eerrie, thrilling tale that kept me interested throughout the entire book.  If you enjoy super natural thrillers, then this one is a must read.
