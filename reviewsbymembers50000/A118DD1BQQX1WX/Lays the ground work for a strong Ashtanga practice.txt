 I found this book to be an excellent source on both the philosophy of Ashtanga yoga as well as a great how to of moving from one asana to the next in the Primary Series.  Do not buy this book if you are trying to learn the Primary Series from a book.  Although the level of detail in this book is great, Ashtanga is better learn watching/learning from a live person, or if you are really pressed for money and/or do not have an Ashtanga teacher near you get a good video (David Swenson, Richard Freeman, John Scott, and others have excellent tapes out).  With that said, this book is a wonderful reference tool and offers exact breath counts.  In Ashtanga,  every movement is associated with a breath, this book provides information on how to get in and out of every posture in the primary series following the breath (i.e. how many inhalations and exhalations should be accomplished moving between postures).  This book also offers great detail as it relates to living the yoga you practice.  While I may not agree with Jois' entire philosophy, it is a great deal of knowledge to be gained from this book.  This book is a must read if you are an Ashtanga practioner or teacher.  This book will help you deepen your practice both physically and spiritually.  I would also suggest this book for anyone curious about the philosophy of Ashtanga yoga.
