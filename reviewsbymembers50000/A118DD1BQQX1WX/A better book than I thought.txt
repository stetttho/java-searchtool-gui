 This is definitely NOT the book to read cover to cover.  However, there is some valuable information to be gotten from this book.  For instance Chapter 15. Stored Procedures was very valuable to me, Ch. 8 helped me prepare for a data migration, and I could go on and on about how specific chapters helped me get a clue about a given topic.   I will admit though, a lot of this book could be considered a cure for insomnia, but if you want specific information about certain aspects of Transact-SQL, then this is a great reference tool, just don't buy it if you are not really familiar with Transact-SQL.
