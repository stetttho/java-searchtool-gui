 I would not suggest this book for a novice. It glosses over quite a bit of ASP. However, it does provide nice coverage of the primary objects used in ASP (i.e. Session, Application, Response, Request, etc.).  I think the  author of the book definitely knows his stuff, but a few more examples  would not have hurt. The book reads relatively well.  I read the first 7-8  chapters during a two hour flight.  I did like the way the author outlines  the collections, methods, and events involved with each object.  Overall,  the book was not bad, but do not buy this book if you are clueless (I  suggest Wrox's beginner ASP 2.0).
