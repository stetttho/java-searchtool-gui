 This was the first work of Tom Clancy that I actually read.  I've seen some of the movies (Hunt for Red October, and the a few of the Jack Ryan movies).  I personally found the book enjoyable.  It kept my interest through most of the book.  I thought the end of the book asked me to suspend my disbelief a little too much, but overall an entertaining read.  I thought the book explained a lot of the technical stuff well without boring someone who may not be interested.  The action was pretty good, and kept the book moving, and the twists kept things interesting.  This may have been my first Clancy novel, but it certainly will not be my last.
