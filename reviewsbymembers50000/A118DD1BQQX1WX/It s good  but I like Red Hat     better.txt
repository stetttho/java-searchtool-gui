 I am new to Linux in general, and thought I'd try another distro (especially since I can by an os for $40 or less with Linux vs. M$ at several hundred a pop).  I have installed Red Hat and Mandrake on my DELL 2600 Inspiron laptop prior to trying Suse.  As a user who got very use to point and click installs from M$, I have to say that the install is painless and fairly quick (for an os install).  After clicking on a few prompts your os is on it's way to installation.  I installed Suse on it's own hardrive, I did not try to dual boot it.  Although I am a fan of the painless install and setup, I was not crazy about the layout, and themes.  I then decided to replace Suse with Red Hat.  Overall, Suse is a good os for a Linux newbie to use, the install/setup is not very difficult, but I do suggest to a user to read the manual/documentation before installing (especially if you are trying to dual boot w/ Windoze).  The desktop is similar to M$' and a person with good PC skills should be able to get up and running almost immediately.  However, I still like Red Hat's  (despite it now becoming Fedora) desktop more.  My suggestion is to try several Linux distributions, and see what suites your personal taste.
