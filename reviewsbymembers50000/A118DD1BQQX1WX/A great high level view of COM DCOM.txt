 When I purchased this book, I had no clue what COM/DCOM was, besides maybe what the initials meant.  This book did a nice job of easing one's understanding into COM.  I think this a great book whether you are a  project manager just trying to get a clue, an experienced programmer trying  something different, or a newbie.  This book is a solid high-level  beginning for learning COM.  If you want to have a better understanding of  COM, buy this book.  If you want to learn how to code COM components look  for a good VB, C++, or Java book.
