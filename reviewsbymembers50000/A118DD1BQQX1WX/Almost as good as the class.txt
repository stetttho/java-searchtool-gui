 I thought that this book did a pretty good job of teaching you a fairly straight forward markup language (CFML). By the time you finish this book, you should have a good working knowledge of ColdFusion.  I would sugget purchasing this book if you cannot afford to take the class, or want a refresher of the class.  Having taken the class and reading the book I would have to say all of the material in this book is exactly what's covered in the class.  If you want a solid start in ColdFusion, this book probably won't disappoint you.
