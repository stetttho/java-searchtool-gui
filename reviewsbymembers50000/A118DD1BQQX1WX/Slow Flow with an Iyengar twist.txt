 This DVD was great if you want a slower flowing yoga DVD.  I think this DVD is good for just about anybody familiar with yoga, and how to use yoga blocks.  Seane starts off slowly with meditation, breathing exercises, and then slowly starts going into the actual postures.  The postures themselves were not difficult for advanced beginner and up practioners.  However, Seane goes through these postures slowly enough where you will start to feel different parts of your body open up.  Seane pays a fair amount of attention to alignment (moreso than I am use to seeing in a Vinyasa Flow type DVD).  She takes her time getting into and out of the postures and this where I feel anyone can benefit from this DVD.  If you are the type of person looking for a Vinyasa Flow DVD to make you move, sweat, drop a few pounds, or want very challenging  postures, then this probably is not the DVD for you.  I would suggest Shiva Rae's Yoga Shakti DVD which has something for almost every skill level, except maybe the truly gifted and advanced yogis/yoginis out there (the arm balances she does are almost all intermediate to advanced).  However, if you want to really focus on the alignment and feeling of some of the more basic postures, and you are looking for something slower than the average flow yoga DVD, then this is a home run.
