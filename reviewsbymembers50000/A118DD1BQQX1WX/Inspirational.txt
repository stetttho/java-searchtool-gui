 This documentary does a great job in telling the story of the effects Ashtanga (both physically and psychologically) on various practioners.  Some you may recognize like William DeFoe and Gwenth Paltrow, but there are others whose stories are equally as interesting.  The DVD also provides interviews with Sri K Pattabi Jois and Sharath.  The yoga demos are awesome, and the interviews are sincere and warm.  If you are a fan of ashtanga then this is a great DVD to watch.
