 I thought that this book cuts through a lot of the formalities and gets down to what you want to do.  This book allows someone with little to no experience with ColdFusion a chance to get your hands dirty right away.  My only criticism of this book is that it could be a little more detailed on why somethings work the way they do.  However, if you want to get started coding solid ColdFusion programs, and develop your general knowledge of the basics of ColdFusion, this book is great.  On the other hand if you want more indepth explaination, buy one of those 800+ paged books written by Ben Forta, or one of the others.
