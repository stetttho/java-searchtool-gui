 This book does a good job of giving you information on every possible topic of the certification exam.  I used the original study guide to take and pass the first exam.  This book includes just about everything in the first book, and goes into topics that are relaevent for MX (i.e. CFCs, XML, Flash intergration, etc.).  If you want answers in a few pages vs. a few chapters, then buy this book.
