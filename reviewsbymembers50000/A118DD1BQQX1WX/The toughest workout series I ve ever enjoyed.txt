 Do not be fooled by the title.  Primary does not mean beginner.  There are some beginner-level poses in the primary series, but the series as a whole is quite challenging.  I have practiced yoga for 2+ years, and I found this DVD quite challenging.  If you are brand new, or fairly new to yoga, and are looking for a good sweat, I would suggest Rodney Yee's Power Yoga, or Rainbeau Mars' series of tapes/DVD.  They provide a good sweat without freaking you out with the level of difficult of poses (most of the time).  However, if you are looking for a challenge, then this is it.  I purchased this DVD along w/ Freeman's Intermediate level workout, thinking I could try this for a few weeks, and move on.  No such luck, I'll probably be working with this one for at least 3-6 months.  The Primary Series a challenging series of poses ranging from basic warrior poses, to full handstands to rooster poses, and series of other challenging arm balances.  I could go on, and on about this DVD, but I won't.  I'll just say that if you are looking for a good 90 minutes of sweat and work, and want to learn/practice semi-challenging, to very challenging poses, then you have found the right guy.  The only negative thing I could say is that there is no music accompanying the workout.  However, you'll sweat so hard doing this workout, that you probably won't need it anyway.
