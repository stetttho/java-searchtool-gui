 Suse was incredibly easy to install, but I'd suggest Red Hat 9.0.  Yes Red Hat is no longer supporting it's desktop version (9.0 support ends 4/2004), and yes after I heard this, I wanted to try another distribution, but for easy installation and a number of developer applications (Kdeveloper, QT, Apache Server, etc.), Red Hat could not be beaten.  Also because RH is one of the most widely used Linux distros out, you can go to almost any major bookstore and find books for all types of users (newbie to advanced).  In fact, I will probably upgrade to the Fedora 1.0/RH 10.0 after I learn more about RH 9.0. In addition, of the three distros I tried to install (RH 9.0, Mandrake 9.1, and Suse 9.0), RH installed the way I wanted to the first time, with minimal configuration.  With that said, Suse is a fine product with beautiful screens and cool desktop, but I felt like Red Hat gave me more bang for my buck.
