 I have no .NET background, but I have programmed in Java, C, and C++, and I can tell you that this is a good book for an introduction to C#.  I would not recommend this book for someone totally new to programming, this book references C, C++, and Java often when the situation calls for it.  The first third of the book starts out with the OOP basics (i.e. language fundamentals, classes, inheritance, arrays, polymorphism, etc).  The second third gets going with programming actual applications (both web and desktop), the final third gets into the .NET CLR (Common Language Runtime), which discusses versioning, threads, synchonozation, etc.  Overall, this book is a good way to start learning C# for the person with OOP experience
