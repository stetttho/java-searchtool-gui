 Even though I did not care for the Sams series in regards to ASP, I  thought that the two Java 2 books I have read (Teach Yourself Java 2 in 24  hrs & 21 days respectively) did a great job. All the code thus far  works (I am about 2 weeks into the book).  This book answers questions that  the 24 hr. book does not get a chance to answer.  This is pretty indepth,  and the format is pretty easy to follow.  If you like programming, and you  want to learn Java this book is exactly what you need to get a thorough  understanding of the Java language and its packages.
