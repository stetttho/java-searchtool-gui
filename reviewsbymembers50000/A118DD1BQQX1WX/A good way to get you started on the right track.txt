 This book gives you the basics on how to develop solid data models.  The only problem I can see with this book, is that you need to have some clue of what you are doing before reading this book.  If you want something that will take you step-by-step read "Database Design For Mere Mortals" by Robert Hernandez.  This book takes nothing for granted and goes through the whole database design process, from the first interview with the user(s), to the actual design of the database.  Overall, I thought this book as good, especially to be only 100+ pages or so.  However, buy the other book if you need more indepth knowledge.
