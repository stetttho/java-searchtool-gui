 Yeah, I know all of the reviews of this book thus far are great, but there is a reason why...this book touches upon almost any type of information you need to use MX.  I found the sections using CFCs especially helpful.  The authors not only tell you how to create CFCs, but provide a very useful scenario (using CFCs to hide business logic).  The book also gives some good examples of how to integrate Java, COM, XML, etc. into MX.  The number of real world type coding examples as well as the step-by-step how to approach is what differentiates this book from a lot of the MX documentation re-make books I have seen (see Mastering ColdFusion MX).  This book has a lot great information on everything from thre basics to creating Web Services.  Overall, this book lives up to the hype, and is probably the best MX book I've seen.
