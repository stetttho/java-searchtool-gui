 This is a great book for either learning PL/SQL or as a reference.  I went through a little better than half of the book word for word before I gave up.  But I still use this book as a  reference whenever I need to program  in PL/SQL.  I would suggest this book to anyone who either wants to learn  PL/SQL or just needs to check something really quickly.  If you use PL/SQL  on a regular to semi-regular basis, then this is a must have.
