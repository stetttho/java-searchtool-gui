 I tried this workout because it got some great ratings.  I can now see why.  This work out is not for the faint of heart.  In fact, I would say that the overall workout is on par or maybe a step below a primary series (ashtanga) workout.  The poses themselves are not beyond the experienced beginner level.  However, it is what she does with them that makes the workout intermediate to advanced.  She will perform a given pose repeatedly in regular speed, and then in super slow motion. It is this super slow motion that really builds strength and endurance, because you just can't know how to perform the pose, but you have to be able to hold the pose for a while.  In addition,  the abs section of this work was very challenging for me.  Just so that I don't scare off anyone new to yoga who wants to try this DVD, Tari does offer you the option of watching the pose performed first, then you can follow along with either the full or modified version of the pose.  This DVD was 60+ minutes of sweat and work.  If you are ready for a fairly intense workout then give this a try.
