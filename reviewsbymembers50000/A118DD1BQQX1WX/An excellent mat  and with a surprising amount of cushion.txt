 This is an excellent mat. I recently bought mine and could feel the difference from the first practice. It is a tremendous step up from the garden variety $20 mat. There is another mat made that has more cushion than this one (I believe this company makes it too), but you may not need to shell out the extra $20 unless you have really sensitive joints/bones. With that in mind, I think this mat would suit most people's needs. I practice on a hardwood floor using this mat and was completely comfortable. This mat is very effective for more sweat inducing forms of yoga. However, it is not fool proof. A person could still slip if he or she sweats profusely. I would then suggest the user to where a pair of socks (not the most "traditionally yogic" way of doing things but effective). Otherwise, this is a great mat for anyone who practices sweat inducing yoga regualarly.
