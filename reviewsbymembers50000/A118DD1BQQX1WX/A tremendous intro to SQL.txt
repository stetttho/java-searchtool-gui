 I found this book to be very informative.  Unlike some reviewers, I didn't find find this book to really be geared toward one type of database or another.  The authors had to use something, and Sybase SQL Anywhere was it.   I felt that the authors of this book did a good job of keeping the SQL  general, where it could be used on most databases.  I used this book in  conjunction with Personal Oracle8, and found that the basic commands are  the same.  However, after completing this book I would strongly suggest  getting a book more specific to whatever database you use. Overall, this  book gave me a solid foundation in being able to perform basic SQL  functions (i.e creating views, tables, understanding business rules,  etc.)and a great buy for someone with little to no knowledge about SQL.
