 I agree with a previous viewer in the fact that the warmup is hurried, and the positions aren't held very long, and the corpse pose is not held very long either.  However, I would not go so far as to say that this isn't yoga.  If you are the type of person who is very much into the spirtual side of yoga, and a slower pace with your yoga, don't bother. Besides did you REALLY expect spirtuality from a MTV ;-)?  I have been practising yoga a few years now, and I found the video challenging and fun.  There are some ashtanga-like aspects to the flow (kinda like an ashtanga-lite, for those who are not quite ready for the entire Primary Series :-)).  Once you get past the hurried sun-salutations, the workout gets better.  I particularly liked the balance and seated poses.  I especially liked the variation with beginner, intermediate and advanced versions of poses.  It gave me either modifications, or a way to deepen the pose. Some of the poses Kristin does can be found in the Primary Series of Ashtanga yoga (i.e. triangle, reverse-triangle, most of the seated stretching series, jumping in and out of poses, etc.).  The Pilates at the end of the tape is not bad either, a good way to work on abs after a fairly intense 45 minutes.  However, I don't think Windsor and other pilates gurus have much to worry about from Kristin as a pilates instructor.  Overall, this a solid yoga tape for a person with experience.  The level of the workout does assume you know a certain amount of yoga.  I would suggest this tape/dvd to any intermediate/advanced student looking for an Ashtanga-like workout.
