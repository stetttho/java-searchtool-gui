 Let me start by saying that this tape is really good.  Doug Swenson's practice is phenominal.  His instruction is good, he does a wonderful job of demonstrating both beginner and advance variations of poses.  Doug is a truly a master yoga practicioner/teacher.  However, I was not able to get into Sadhana Yoga (Doug's own style of yoga).   It looks like a fusion between Tai Chi and Yoga.  It keeps a person constantly in motion, which is great.  However, some of the motions seem unnecessary to me.  Perhaps my lack of knowledge of Tai Chi makes me feel this way.  I also come in with the bias of really being into the Ashtanga Yoga system.  Doug incorporates a fair amount of Ashtanga-style poses into Sadhana as well as the breathing techniques (often depicted as breathing like Darth Vader).  I also really enjoy the teachings of Doug's brother Dave.  I have written reviews on both Dave Swenson's Practice Manual for the Primary and Intermediate Series and his Primary Series DVD.  Both of which are excellent.   I also would suggest this DVD for a person with at least 6 months to a year of experience, because even the "easy" versions of some of the poses will take some work.  An example of this would be Humanasana (full split with hands together above the head), even with a block under the leg, would be a stretch for some people.  In all fairness to Doug he will tell a complete beginner to skip certain postures, so he is mindful of the fact that not everybody is super flexible and/or strong. Overall, if you are looking for something that is different, challenging and beautiful to watch and perform, then this is a great DVD.  Doug's practice is amazing and his teaching style is just as good as his brothers.
