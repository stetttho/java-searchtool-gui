 This book and the accompanying CD's were a fantastic way to get started with Linux.  I recently started using Linux 3-4 months ago.  I tried to install Mandrake 9.1 initially, but had problems with the KDE desktop.  I then installed RH on my Dell Inspiron 2600 laptop, and everythign installed the first time.  I have to admit that I did not opt for the M$/Linux dual-boot option, but the book does explain what you need to do to make it happen.  After installation the book offers chapters to first get you used to using Linux in console mode, and then chapters that teach you how to use the desktop to do the same types of things.  Overall, I thought the book provided a decent start to how to perform basic functions (via console/desktop) needed to make Linux work smoothly.  If you want something more comprehensive try "Red Hat Linux 9.0 Bible", or "Red Hat Linux 9.0 Unleashed".
