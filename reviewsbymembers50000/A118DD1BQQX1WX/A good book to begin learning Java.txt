 This book is a solid learning tool.  I have to agree with the reviewer that said the book does get tough after chapter 9.  The vast majority of the code I've tried works. This book does a good job of getting you up to  speed on Java.  I would suggest using this book as a starting point and  going else where to get really indepth information.  As far as getting a  clue about Java, this book is definite buy.
