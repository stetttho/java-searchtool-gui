 I initially did not like this video upon first viewing.  It looked slow, and boring.  However, I actually tried it, and was pleasantly surprised.  The workout is not like a lot of today's Power Yoga DVD/VHS tapes where the pace is fast and furious.  Here the positions are held for a fair amount of time, and repeated several times.   The Yoga instructor starts out by throughly warming up the right side of the body and then the left.  Most of the poses are not pass the intermediate level.  The body is given a through stretch through slow repetition versus speed (i.e. MTV's Power Yoga and Rodney Yee's Power Yoga dvds).     Overall, the workout is slow and intense.  Please note that by slow I mean that the poses are held for a while, and the pace is not as aerobic as some of the other popular Power Yoga tapes, but you will still build up a meaningful sweat.  The cool down is also pretty rewarding.  If you are the type of person who loves a slow pace, this is definitely the dvd for you.  This is a great dvd to practice yoga to, and definitely makes me believe that you cannot judge a tape until you try the work out.
