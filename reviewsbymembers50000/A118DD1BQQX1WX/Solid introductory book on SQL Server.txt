 This book is a solid intro to SQL Server 2005.  My only problem with this book is that author really focused on some topics and had almost nothing to say on others.  For instance, Ch. 3 on XML was very detailed and included plenty of examples to learn from.  On the other hand, other topics like DTS and Reporting were glossed over at best.  Overall, this is a good intro to using SQL Server 2005 new features and it does make me want to buy a more advanced book.  However, I would have liked to have seen a little more consistency in the amount of detail for the various topics.
