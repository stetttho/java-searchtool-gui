 This book kept me on the edge of my seat the entire 500+ pages.  I will not get into the details of the story so that I do not ruin it for anyone reading this review.  However, this book is especially good, if you read Due's earlier offering My Soul To Keep.  The Living Blood is the part two to My Soul To Keep.  There are several story lines that take place in this book, and it is particularly fascinating the way Due brings all of them to one brilliant climax.  If you enjoy a book with plenty of twists and turns, this book is a must have.  Due is simply the best, period.
