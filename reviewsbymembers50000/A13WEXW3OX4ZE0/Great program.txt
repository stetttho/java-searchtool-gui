 I love NAV 2005!  I have used Norton Antivirus for years and have been quite happy with it.  The virus definitions are continually being updated.  It's very easy to use and quite good at finding viruses/worms and removing them.  I upgraded from NAV 2004 and the installation process went very smoothly.
