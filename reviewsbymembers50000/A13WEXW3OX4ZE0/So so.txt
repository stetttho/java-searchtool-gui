 This movie definitely had some funny moments, but at the end of the movie I was left thinking, "So What?".  The majority of the movie is just so random and strange.  Those were 2 hours of my life I'll never get back.  However, I do admit that the scene towards the end of the movie where Napoleon does that dance on stage is hilarious.  He reminds me way too much of Poindexter from "Revenge of the Nerds".
