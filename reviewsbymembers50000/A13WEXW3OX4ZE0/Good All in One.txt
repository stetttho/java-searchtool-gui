 I have owned the HP OfficeJet K80 All-in-One for about 2 years now and I have been quite pleased with it.  First off, the price was great.  You really get a lot of bang for your buck.  The fax really works well and is quite fast.  The printer can get noisy and shake a lot during printing, but other than that, the print quality is outstanding.  The scan function is very useful and scans come out looking good.  Overall, a great product for a low price.
