 This movie does a great job in refuting and exposing a lot of the lies and distortions presented in Fahrenheit 9/11.  You hear first-hand from some of the people who were unknowingly shown or exploited by Moore in the making of his propaganda film.  Some of the people interviewed are the teacher who was with Bush when he received the news of the planes crashing into the towers, a soldier who was totally misrepresented in the movie (and had no idea that Moore included him in his film), an Oregon state trooper who sets the record straight on Oregon's borders, and several families of loved ones who lost their lives in Iraq.    Fahrenhype 9/11 includes commentary and analysis on the lies in Fahrenheit 9/11 from Dick Morris, Ann Coulter, Dave Kopel (who wrote "Fifty-nine Deceits in Fahrenheit 9/11"), Frank Gaffney, Peter King, Ed Koch (former mayor of New York), Zell Miller, Ron Silver, etc.    Anyone who insists on watching Fahrenheit 9/11, make sure that you get them to agree to watch Fahrenhype 9/11 afterwards.  It's the great equalizer!  Truth and facts are clearly missing from Moore's movie.  Get the real story from Fahrenhype 9/11.
