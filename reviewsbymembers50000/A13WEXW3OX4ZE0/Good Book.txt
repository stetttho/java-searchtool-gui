 Overall, I thought this was a really good book.  I have found that there is no quick formula to evangelism as each person is unique and different and has different hesitations about accepting the Lord. This book does offers some helpful conversational models and good things to say to encourage people to accept Christ.  A few of the replies he offers do seem a bit harsh though.  Other than that, a great evangelism tool!
