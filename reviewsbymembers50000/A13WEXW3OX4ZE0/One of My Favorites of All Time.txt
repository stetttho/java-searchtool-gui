 This movie is probably in my Top 10 all-time favorite movies.  It's an absolute classic.  I crack up so much when I watch "Better Off Dead".  Booger from "Revenge of the Nerds" plays a friend of Lane's (Cusack) and is hilarious!!  The scenes with Booger on the snowy mountain with Lane are classic.  Other characters in the movie that crack me up are the Chinese guy who talks like Howard Cosell, Lane's crazy little brother, his neighbor Ricky ("RICCKKKKYYYY!!"), and the paper boy ("Two dollars!  I want my 2 dollars!").  Lane's Mom is a horrible cook and makes up some rather nasty food (i.e. the jello-like thingie that crawls across his plate).  I often find myself quoting lines from "Better Off Dead".  A must-see movie!!
