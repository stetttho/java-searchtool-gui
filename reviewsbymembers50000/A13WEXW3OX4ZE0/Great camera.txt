 I bought this camera a few months ago and I absolutely love it!  It takes crystal clear pictures.  I don't know much about photography and the great thing about this camera is that you don't have to.  It's really quite easy to use.  I just bought a memory card for it so that I can store more photos.  The size of each photo generated by this camera is rather large.  Overall, this is a great camera for a reasonable price.
