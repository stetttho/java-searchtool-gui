 I like doing the 8-minute workout in the mornings before work (it's really a 16 minute workout).  Billy has some funny sayings that he repeats over and over and that keeps me chuckling as I work out.  It's a fun DVD to have.  Taebo helps to loosen my muscles and keep me fit.  You'll notice that Billy screws up some of the moves himself and that adds to the humor.  Most of the time instead of doing the workout moves, he's telling the people behind him to "Touch My Hand" and "Don't Bounce" and "Jab, jab, jab, jab" over and over and over.  It's a bit annoying at times, but I learn to live with it.
