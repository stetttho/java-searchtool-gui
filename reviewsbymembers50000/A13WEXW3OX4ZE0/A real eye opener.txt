 I was a bit skeptical to watch the movie at first because I thought that it would totally ignore any personal responsiblity that people must take for the foods they eat.  I feared that they would just bash McDonald's the whole movie and try to ignore the obvious fact that everyone knows that McDonald's is not good for you.    I was pleasantly surprised.  I actually thought the movie was fair and balanced and does a good job of presenting the various reasons as to why Americans are fat (you can't put all the blame on McDonald's).   I thought the movie was quite fascinating and makes some good points.  You can really see the physical toll that the fast food has on Morgan's body as the 30 days progress.  He totally wrecks his body.  It's important to note that he does take it to an extreme - it seems at times that he is unnecessarily gorging himself until he becomes sick.  Nevertheless, Spurlock does make his point and it comes across quite powerfully and effectively.   I recommend that everyone watch this movie.  It's important for people to know the junk that they are consuming when they go to McDonald's.  The number of calories and amount of fat in McDonald's food is mind-boggling - most of their food has been genetically altered in some way.    Overall, I enjoyed this movie and found it to be a real eye-opener!
