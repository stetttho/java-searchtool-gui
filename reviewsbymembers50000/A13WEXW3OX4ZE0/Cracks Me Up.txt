 This movie is awesome!!  I never get sick of it.  If you've ever played sports or been on sports teams before, you'll really appreciate the humor in this movie.    Coach Riggendorf is hilarious! (especially his halftime speech).  The interactions between Coach Riggendorf and Coach Geniero crack me up.  They have the funniest bunch of characters on their team (the fictitious Texas State Armadillos) including Andre Krimm (Sinbad), Manu-Manu the Slender, Samurai, Sgt. Wilkerson, McKenzie, the Twins, Paul Blake, Jason Bateman, Featherstone (a.k.a. Stonehands), Popkey, Charlie Banks, Lucy (Kathy Ireland), etc.  Rob Schneider is the announcer for the football games in this movie and he is hilarious!!  Some of his lines are classic!    Paul Blake (Scott Bakula) plays a former high school football star quarterback who never got the chance to play college football because he had to run the family farm.  Coach Riggendorf goes out and recruits Blake to come back from "retirement" and join the team.  After some convincing, Blake decides to come back and play quarterback for the Armadillos.  They end up having a rough season and lose pretty much every game.  The final game of the season arrives and they have to take on the #1 team in the state of Texas.  No one expects them to win, but they pull out the improbable victory at the end of the game.  This is a hilarious movie that will keep you in stiches throughout!
