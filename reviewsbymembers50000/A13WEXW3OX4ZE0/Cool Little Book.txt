 I just read this book last night and was touched.  Lucado really presents the Gospel in a tangible way and details what Christ did for us, why He died for us, and then presents the reader with the invitation to accept Christ as Lord and Savior.  It's a concise book, so it's a very quick read.  It's a powerful book little book though.
