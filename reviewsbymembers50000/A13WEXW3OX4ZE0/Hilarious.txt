 A charming, polished and original comedy featuring a great performance from Murphy and some memorable laughs.  Some of my favorite scenes are:  - when they all get up from the leather couch and there is soul glow grease all over it from where their heads were ("Just let your Soul GLLLOOOWW!!").  - when Samuel L. Jackson robs the McDowell's restaurant that Murphy and Hall are working at.  The ensuing scene between Jackson and Murphy is classic.  - when Murphy gets his hair cut off in the barbershop (Snip. "that'll be 10 dollars").  - that "She's Your Queen to Be" song.  There are so many more scenes that I love that I could mention.  A must-see!
