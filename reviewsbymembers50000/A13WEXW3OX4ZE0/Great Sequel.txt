 I loved both Spider Man 1 & 2.  I thought that Spider Man 2 may have even been a bit better than Spider Man 1.  A worthy follow-up!  I thought it had a good mix of romance, action, and comedy.  The action scenes are well-done...you can tell they put more money into the special effects this time around.
