 "Basic Christianity" was the very first book (besides the Bible) that I read when I became a Christian.  It was recommended to me by a dear friend of mine.  What a blessing this book was to me as a new believer!  It did a great job of laying out the principles and basics of Christianity and addressed a lot of the deep questions that I had at the time.  I would recommend this book to any new believer.
