 The plot was terribly convoluted and some of the characters were not developed well at all.  This was not Denzel's best performance.  Somehow, the story did keep me interested for most of the movie.  I started getting bored towards the end.  Overall, it's a pretty bizarre movie that was OK.  Some scenes were unnecessarily violent too.  I probably could have found better use of those 2 hours of my life I spent watching this movie.
