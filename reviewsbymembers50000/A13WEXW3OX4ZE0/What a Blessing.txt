 What a blessing this CD is.  I love how Jeremy Camp has such a heart for the Lord and his music is so inspiring.  It's nice to hear different kinds of Christian music and to occassionally break away from the traditional hymns that I'm used to hearing in Church all the time.  I absolutely love each and every song!  My favorites are "Walk by Faith" and "I Still Believe".  Those songs give me goose bumps.
