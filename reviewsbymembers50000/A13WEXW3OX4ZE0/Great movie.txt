 The Passion of The Christ is the most powerful and meaningful movie I've ever seen in my life.  I praise the Lord for this movie.  Yes, it's graphic, but it's what really happened.  Jesus suffered a brutal death for us...that we may have life and be restored to a right relationship with God the Father.  Talk about a loving sacrifice.
