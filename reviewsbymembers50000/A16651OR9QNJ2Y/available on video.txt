 For those of you who are interested, Marilyn Waring's thoughts on politics, environment etc. are available on video. I have a series on three video cassettes, available from the Canadian National Film Board. The NFB  can be found on the internet, if you want to know more... Perhaps it is  available in the States. It is a good introductory series for schools,  businesses...The video series consist of selected excerpts from the book. I  am not sure how it compares to the book, but her wit, humor, eloquence are  amply evident on film.
