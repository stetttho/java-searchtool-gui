 Horn Book review hit it on the head: the black and white illustrations are superior in every way to the colored-in versions. The original editions were, after all, illustrated with simple, clearly-outlined sketches. So now, finally, we have have Winne-the-Pooh as it was originally intended to be. On top of that, excellent quality paper, beautiful binding, a perfect size, this slip-cased edition is a collector's item.
