 I'll have to revise my earlier review where I complained about "onion-thin" pages. In fact, compared to other Bibles, this one is the best in terms of print clarity, font, letter size, and general attractiveness. I've bought several (expensive) Bibles, which turned out to be much less pleasing than this one. The onion-thin pages are the norm with Bibles, and so not a point of criticism. In fact, I recently dicovered that good-quality editions of classics are usually made of this paper ...if it is india-paper. Anyway--that's my correction to my last review. Enjoy this edition!
