 (...)compared to many other college History texts, this one triumphs....) I'll say this at least: It is no accident that the local university has stocked up on Greave's CIVILIZATIONS OF THE WEST. This is an outstanding volume in terms of breadth of information, coverage of social and cultural life, illustrations and organization of material. A distinguishing feature of the volume, adding to the aesthetically pleasing layout and quality of information, are inset boxes. With literary excerpts and writings from intellectuals and ordinary people of the times these boxes add vividness and immediacy to History studies, bringing one a little closer to people and events. Overall, this is an excellent book, to be used in conjunction with J.M.G ROBERTS, TRIUMPH OF THE WEST (or, HISTORY OF THE WORLD, by the same author, published by Penguin books).
