 We got this video to watch with our children at Christmas time.  My children love the first half of the performance, but after that, they ask me to turn it off.  They miss the dance of the peppermints and Mother Ginger and get bored watching Lesley Collier dance again, and again, and again.  Perhaps people came to see her dance, but it seems to me that the story gets lost in the end of this performance in such a long feature of the prima donna.
