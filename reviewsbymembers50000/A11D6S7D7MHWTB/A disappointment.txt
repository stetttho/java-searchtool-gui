 I saw the other reviews of this book,and I have to wonder if the reviewers really read this abridged version of the play.  This is one of our family's favorite plays, and I bought this book to allow us to do a living room performance of it in one evening.  I was disappointed.  First, the copy has many errors in it that make performing it confusing.  For instance, in Act I, Scene 1, when Egeus brings Hermia and Demetrius and Lysander before Theseus, there is a stage direction that says "Demetrius exit and Helena follow." although Helena has not appeared (in this or any other version of the play) until later in the scene.  Second, every person who has to make cuts in this play does it differently, but Cass Foster has cut some parts that I really miss, especially Bottom's playing the "tyrant" in Act I, Scene 2, and the rest of Thisby's death speech in Act V.  Those scenes seem wooden and hurried without those lines.  If I had known what this book was like, I would have ordered a different book with the full text and cut out lines myself.  It would be easier than going through this text and correcting typos and adding lines that I feel need to be there.
