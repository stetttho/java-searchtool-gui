 My daughters love biographies, especially those done by Diane Stanley.  This is not really a biography.  It has some historical information in it, but really it is just some facts strung together in an annoying rhyme.  My oldest (7) thought the illustrations were absurd.  The figures look like they are being viewed in a carnival mirror, wide and short with very large heads.  Sir Francis Drake is an interesting and controversial character in history and deserves a better telling of his story.
