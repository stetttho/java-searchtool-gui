 My four year old and seven year old enjoy this magazine which is published by the Smithsonian and Cricket.  Working with one theme (ie, gardens, animal homes, working animals, flight, communication, etc.) the magazine presents the material with stories, comic strips, non-fiction articles and games.  The issues are 36 pages long, not too long to read in one sitting, but thorough and satisfying.  The photographs and illustrations are attractive and informative.  The only complaint I have about it is that there are only nine issues in twelve months, a problem in my house since my older children's magazines come every month.  Otherwise, this is an excellent magazine and well worth the money.
