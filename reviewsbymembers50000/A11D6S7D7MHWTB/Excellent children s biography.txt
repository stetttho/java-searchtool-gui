 Our family has recently discovered the wonderful Peter Vennema/Diane Stanley biographies.  They are vivid, engaging, and thorough, yet short enough for younger readers to sit through (my daughters are 4 and  6).   Bard of Avon and Good Queen Bess are our favorites so far, and they go very  well together since neither Shakespeare nor Queen Elizabeth would have been  the same without the other.  Unlike other histories or biographies for  children, this book makes a destinction between what we know about  Shakespeare's life and times and what are only guesses. It is nice for  children to see that the study of history is not just memorizing facts and  dates, but piecing together clues in the context of what is known about a  time period.  As a former high school English teacher,  I wish that I had  had this book when I was teaching Shakespeare plays because it would have  been a wonderful introduction.
