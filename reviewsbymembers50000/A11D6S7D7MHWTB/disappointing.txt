 We subscribed to this magazine for a year, but I decided one year was enough.  Although the photographs were excellent and some of the articles were interesting, they tended to be very short and superficial, even for young children.  I did not like the two page "game" from Playhouse Disney which was really a two page advertisement for a television show.  I also did not like the stories and the Bonnie and Chester adventures because the animals did not behave like animals, living in houses like people, wearing clothing, and eating cake.  I was looking for a magazine that would encourage children to observe nature in their own backyards and help them understand the natural world.
