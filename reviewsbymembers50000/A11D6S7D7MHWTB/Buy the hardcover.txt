 I had to buy this book because my daughter (6) was checking it out from the library so often.  It is an unusual look at Guinevere and offers a good, empowering role model for girls.  We love the illustrations and have read it over and over.  Unfortunately, the paperback version has not stood up to those many readings. The pages have all had to be taped back in because once one came loose, the rest followed. I don't blame the binding, it is just that a paperback cannot survive that much love.
