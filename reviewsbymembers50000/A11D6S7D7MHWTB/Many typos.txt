 I got this book so that my family could do a living room performance in one night.  Although I am fairly pleased with how it was shortened, I found many typos that needed to be corrected before we could even read it.  I had to sit down with the full text to check it all the way through.  An obvious example is when Beatrice says to Benedick "You always end with a jade's trick.  O know you of old."  (It should be "I know you of old.")  If you are only buying one copy, this isn't too hard to do and is easier than buying the full text and cutting the lines yourself.  If you are buying several copies for a classroom, however, correcting the typos would be a lot of work.  If you are buying this book to read the play, buy the full text, this in one of Shakespeare's shorter plays and one of our favorites.
