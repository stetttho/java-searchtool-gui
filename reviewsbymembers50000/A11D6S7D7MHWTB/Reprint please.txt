 While so many dinosaur books for children emphasize predator and defense relationships among dinosaurs, this book shows a more realistic picture of dinosaur life for young readers.  My daughter is so excited to find a  "mother" lizard with female roles of raising and defending young.   We found this book used, but it would be wonderful if it could be  reprinted.  We really appreciate the scientific material presented in a way  that is understandable for children.
