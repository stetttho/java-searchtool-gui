 This story is a beautiful interweaving of three stories, a Native American woman who loses her husband in war, a girl's relationship with her grandfather, and an old woman who discovers how to reach a lonely child  that she has seen in the park.  It is a gentle and lovely way to introduce  to children the concept of death and a chance to discuss the value of the  people we love in our lives and to understand the feelings of others.  The  story is wonderful in itself, but the illustrations make it even more so.   They seem to glow with an inner light.
