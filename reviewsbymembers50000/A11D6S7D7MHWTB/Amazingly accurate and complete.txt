 Our family (girls ages 4 and 6) loved the CD by the same name so much that we bought the video too. We were impressed at the ability of the writers and director to rearrange the story and the music to fit a film version.  I  realized that I knew nothing of Beethoven and read his biography after  viewing the video.  Then I was really impressed to find how much accurate  information about Beethoven's life was interwoven into the story.  Although  we prefer the CD version, I think that seeing the period costume and  setting helped the girls place the story in an historical context.  We are  now all Beethoven fans and listen to his music with new appreciation.
