 This is probably one of the fine introduction books on Java. The author provides a clear explanation on a variety of Java topics. But we have to accept the fact that no book can cover everything about Java deeply. This  one is not an exception. Other advanced topics in Java, such as I/O,  threads, networking, JDBC, are not deeply covered. The author just went  through all of them. In conclusion, this book is a good and comprehensive  book for introduction to Java's major topics. Another good introduction  book is Beginning Java 2. In my opinion, this book gives many simple  examples to explain the Java concepts clearly, while "Beginning Java  2" provides  more deep explanations and examples. You can get either  one. On the other hands, I favor single-topic books for major Java  features!
