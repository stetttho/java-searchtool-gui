 I was curious about this book when I read this review page, so I decided to get one just to see how bad it is. And it's bad really. All I can say is: it's the worst one. The author says so much about unimportant topics,  while he doesn't concentrate on other more important things much. I  recommend Java Servlet Programming by Jason Hunter and Inside Serlvets by  Dustin Callaway.
