 I always enjoy reading these types of "tips" books. Generally speaking, this book offers good tips and solutions to Java's "pitfalls" by using well-written examples. And by reading this  book I understand Java more and more. Without it, we could read and read  more about the "Java Programming Language" book in order to  understand throughout where the "pitfalls" are. So this book can  save us a considerable time! Another similar book, "Practical Java  Programming Language Guide" of Peter Haggar, also offers excellent  tips and solutions. To some extends, both provide inside understanding of  Java and some problems that Java programming may encounter. This book  mentions a more variety of problems while "Practical Java Programming  Language Guide" provides more deep explanations. Get both if you can  afford! They are worth the money!
