 An excellent Java introduction book! I've found that this book is well-organized and written very clearly. The author also goes beyond the level of an introduction book to explain the fundamental object-oriented  design and programming by using Java examples and concepts. Major core Java  packages, classes, and interfaces are also covered in depth. Even though  I'm wring Java codes for living now, I still love to read this kind of  book: A combination of academia and industry. Another advanced Java book  that I've found excellent is "Object-oriented Software Development  Using Java" written by Xiaoping Jia. These authors will make you love  to learn Java!
