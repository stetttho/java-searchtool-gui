 I agree with other reviewers: This is the excellent book on MySQL so far. The author explains and covers the MySQL clearly. If you're developing applications that use MySQL as a RDBMS, then you should go for this book.  You won't be disappointed. The author also mainly covers C API, Perl API,  and PHP API for manipulating MySQL. However, you could use Java or Java  Servlets to do the same thing. And if you're using other RDBMS, then this  book will provide you all necessary information on what MySQL could do and  could not do before you decided to switch to MySQL. O'Reilly book  "mSQL and MySQL" is also a good book on MySQL because it covers  more APIs using with MySQL. Thus, it's quite useful for quick reference to  MySQL and language APIs. I would like to give this book 5 stars, and the  "mSQL and MySQL" 4 stars. I have both of them :)
