 Throughout the book, you will not find any graphical illustrations or screen shots for application interfaces.  Despite the promising title "e-Commerce Applications...", the book fell short of from what  readers will expect. The book title and its back cover promise to take you  the "promised land" where you can use Oracle8i and Java to build  an "Online Coffee Shop" and other applications. What a  combinational power technologies: Oracle8i and Java! Also the book was  claimed for user level of "Beginning-Intermediate", but how it  could be useful if the author writes a Java GUI application book without  screen shots and graphical interface illustrations? I don't think so. I  feel like the book was not prepared well and rushed to published.
