 If you are Java Servlet-based programmers and developers, you will benefit a lot from the JavaServer Pages. And this book really talks about the JSP: what JSP technology can offer and cannot offer. How best you can integrate  JSP technology with Servlet technology and JavaBeans for better Java  server-side applications. Beside the deep and throughout coverage of  JavaServer Pages are covered, I specially appreciate the designing and  architecting issues that the authors focuss on: The JSPs is best suited for  Web presentation and Servlets and JavaBeans are for logic implementation.  Other JSP books mainly illustrated the good sides of the technology  by  mainly implementing JSP codes into HTML codes,  and that created messy and  hard maintainable programs. That's not good OOD and OOP practices! With  this book, you will have a clear idea and technique of how to separate the  Web content presentation and program implementation. The results are  manageable and maintainable software and good OOD and OOP practices. Thanks  the authors for writing such a best book.
