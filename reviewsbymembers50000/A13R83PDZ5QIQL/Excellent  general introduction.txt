 If you know nothing about Grant, this is the perfect place to start.  Unlike other biographies in this series, which talk almost exclusively about each man's presidency (i.e. the Washington bio), this gives you an overview of Grant's entire life, from childhood to death.  Appropriately, most of the book centers on the Civil War and the presidency, but you get to see what led up to Grant's actions during those times.  "Faults" like his drinking are covered but also explained.  You get a well-rounded view of the man.  Like the best biographies, it makes you want to know more.  I am now moving on to Grant's own "Memoirs."
