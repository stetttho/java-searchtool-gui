 Follow me on this: Eric Kraft is a real person. He has created a fictional character called Peter Leroy. Peter Leroy narrates the Peter Leroy novels. But, as far as Peter is considered, these are works of fiction -- sort of. He is telling his life story, but he's embellishing here and there, and reworking certain elements. And he tells us what's real and what isn't. Through this conceit (though by no means solely because of it), Kraft creates what one reviewer called "serious fiction that's fun to read." If Garrison Keilor was a true genius, he'd be Eric Kraft. LEAVING SMALL'S HOTEL is the latest in Peter's saga, and -- like all the others -- it's nostalgic and wise and funny and deep.  Nobody else does what Kraft does.  Read him.
