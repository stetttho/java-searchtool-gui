 Although the film industry is primarily Hollywood-based, this book is useful in that it contains a healthy number of obits for British actors and actresses from the 1930s-60s (Felix Aylmer, Bernard Bresslaw) that most Americans have never heard of.  The book's subtitle is "A Book of Movie Obituaries", and, yes, all the big names are in here:  Monroe, Brando (a particularly lengthy article that could have been trimmed a bit:  the adventures of his pet raccoon are as long on the entry on Roy Rogers), etc.  But it's not just actors.  Directors and producers are included. Pauline Kael, the film critic, gets an entry, as does Keiko the whale from FREE WILLIE (Lassie does not, but Rin Tin Tin does).  Ronald Reagan is here, though if he had not been president, one wonders if he would have qualified.  Murder, suicide, and scandal appear quite a lot, and sometimes it seems as if any connection to film will do if it will provide a "sexy" entry.  Does John Lennon really qualify as a movie star?  And Larry Linville (from M*A*S*H) seems to have been included just so that his various personal scandals could be detailed.  Still, the author takes pains to clear Fatty Arbuckle's reputation.  Mel Blanc, who provided the voice for Bugs Bunny and a host of cartoon characters, and in doing so changed the way cartoons were recorded (among other things) gets 13 lines, while Tex Avery, who directed many cartoons, gets a page and a half (most of which merely list the cartoon's names and dates).
