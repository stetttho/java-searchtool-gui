 We have a winner for the best ST novel of 2001 (so far; I haven't read EUGENICS WARS yet): ABYSS. I don't even like the concept of SECTION 31, but what Lang and Weddle did is great.  Hey, they created SECTION 31, they should know it best.  ABYSS pits Bashir against another genetically-enhanced person who has set himself up as a new Khan.  Think HEART OF DARKNESS (or APOCALYPSE NOW for you younger folks). What makes the book so good is the subtlety of characterization.  We get shades and exploration of personality and events that rarely appear in ST novels.  And we get humor.  Both ABYSS and CLOAK did a masterful job of dropping bits of humor here and there that reminded me of what we used to see on TOS. You really can't have all that much character development with classic characters because they have to end each adventure pretty much as they began (The Reset Button tm).  But you can explore, which is what the authors do.  And I supposed the glory of having new characters like Vaughn and The Observer is that we will be able to see them develop.  ABYSS features a lot of exploration into the minds of Jem'Hadar.  Very nice.
