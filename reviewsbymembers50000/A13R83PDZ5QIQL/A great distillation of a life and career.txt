 The best biographies of artists make you want to go listen to their music/see their paintings/read their stories.  This book sent me back to my bookshelves to re-read "Fahrenheit  451" and a bunch of the short stories (many of which I skipped as a kid because they weren't SF enough - now I see that Bradbury was more than an SF writer).  I grew up in Los Angeles, so I heard Bradbury speak a dozen times while growing up.  All the great anecdotes he tells are here (meeting Mr. Electrico, John Huston and "Moby Dick").  This biography is full of detail, a little insight, a charm.  You see the evolution of many stories (this isn't just a "and then he wrote.." book, like some artistic biographies) but not really the man (maybe that's because Ray is pretty much the same today as he was at six!).
