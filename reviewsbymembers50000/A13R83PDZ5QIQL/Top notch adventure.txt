 John Vornholt is one of the best of the "Trek" writers.  His earlier TNG novel, "Rogue Saucer" would have make a killer episode.  Here he returns to the Genesis Device, the destroyer/creator from the "The Wrath of Kahn."  Try as the Federation might to erase it all, the technology exists, and someone has loosed it upon the galaxy.  It's up to Picard and Co. to stop it before it kills billions more by destroying inhabited planets.  The story plays out at a break-neck pace which makes it hard to put-down (and hard to wait until April 2001 to see how it finally ends).  Discussions of the political effects of the Genesis Device's existence are clever, and the character dialogue rings true.  And Geordi might even get a chance with his obsession, the lovely scientist Leah Brahms.
