 Unlike so many 1980s British TV shows, which have had mediocre transfers to DVD, MAPP AND LUCIA is stunning.  Someone must have taken good care of the master tapes because these are bright, sharp, and detailed.  There is the occasional spot and scratch (most noticeably during the opening credits), but these are so much better than the VHS tapes which were released a few years ago.  Most likely, these DVDs are better than what we saw when they were originally broadcast as well.
