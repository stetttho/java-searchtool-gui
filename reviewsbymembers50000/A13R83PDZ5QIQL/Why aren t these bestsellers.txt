 Kraft's Peter Leroy books are a little sweet, a little sexy, and always funny. "Infalting" is no exception. We get Peter's exploration of his possible illegitimacy through role-playing with the sexy Patti, we get his adventures in his mother's plan for meals on the waves, and we get the usual conceit of memoir that isn't memoir. Best of all, Kraft does what so few writers are capable of doing: he entertains and he keeps your interest. You never check your watch while reading an Eric Kraft book.
