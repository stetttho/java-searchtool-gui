 Comparing the original DVD with the Special Edition, we see 1) That the show was originally shot for the BBC at about 1.78, NOT the 2.35 that the box says.  As a result, those of us in the U.S. who watched it on A&E, and who bought the first DVD release (OR:  original release) saw a Pan and Scan version of it.  Not by much, grant you, but enough.  By flipping back and forth between both versions of the DVD, you can see that the frame on the OR is a little crowded, parts of people are cropped off, etc.  You get the full image, as intended to be seen, with the SE. 2)The image quality of the OR was lousy!  Artifacts everywhere ... looked like a bad video tape.  The SE produces a much higher resolution image.  Still not as good as we would like, but better than any other incarnation of P&P on home video.  But... 3) That image is a little washed out.  Luckily, all you have to do is turn up the color (on my Panasonic, the color is usually set at 18.  Doubling that brought nice, rich colors), and you get a very nice image. I love the SE.
