 This German import is a mixed bag.  Some of the numbers are live and some are studio.  BUT this is, as far as I can tell, the only way to get the novelty hit "Cheesecake" on CD.  That track is a very clear, sharp studio recording, and worth the price of this two CD set alone.  This is mostly earlier Satchmo (no "Wonderful World"), and some of the tracks still have tape hiss, but you aren't going to find "Cheesecake" or something like "Tiger Rag" on very many other Armstrong CDs.
