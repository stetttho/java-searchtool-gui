 This book was a huge seller in Sweden, and I read it hoping to enjoy a slice of life in Sweden.  No such luck.  This book wasn't just translated from Swedish, it was re-written to have it take place in America!  What's up with that?  Ok, it's a kid's book.  Do publishers think that American kids are a) only interested in things that happen in their own home country (Hey, why not publish 50 separate versions, setting the story in each of the 50 separate states?) or b) incapable of making sense of things set in another nation? Sue Townsend's ADRAIN MOLE books were not re-written to set them in the U.S., and they were a big hit.  Granted, they were in English to begin with, but a simple glossary in the back told us all about such things as GYROS.  IN NED'S HEAD (BERT'S DIARY in Swedish) could have kept more of its original flavor.  Over-all, the story is amusing.  But I every time I came across a reference to TV GUIDE or ... I was very aware that things had been changed, and I found that distracting.
