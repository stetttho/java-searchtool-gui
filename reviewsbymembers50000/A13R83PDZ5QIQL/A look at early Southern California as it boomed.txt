 As someone who grew up in Pasadena (40 years after Parsons), I found this book fascinating.  It would better subtitled, "The Life and Times of John Whiteside Parsons" because this book is as much about Southern California in the 1930s - 50s as anything else.  Yes, it's about Parsons' life, but the author also covers the start of Caltech, the Wilson observatory, science fiction fandom, rocketry, just plain old what life was like in Los Angeles and Pasadena for a variety of people during those years, and a myriad of other things.  If you are hesitating to read this because you think Parsons' life might not be interesting (it is, don't worry), read it for the entertaining social history if nothing else.  This isn't bogged down by the wacky occultism.
