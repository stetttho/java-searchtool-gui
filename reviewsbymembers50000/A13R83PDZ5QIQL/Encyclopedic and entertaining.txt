 The Editorial Review above is correct in saying "Taliaferro discusses every conceivable aspect of the monument."  The book serves as a biography of sculptor Gutzon Borglum, giving us chapters about his early life and other sculptures prior to Mt. Rushmore.  There are chapters devoted to the local Indians and President Coolidge's very brief visit as well.  If it has anything to do with the history of Mt. Rushmore, it's in this book.  Lucky for us, Taliaferro is skilful writer/historian.  This book is never dull or pedantic; it's always fascinating and entertaining.  With books like this, I sometimes find myself skipping forward over the slow parts. "Great White Fathers," like Taliaferro's biography of Edgar Rice Burroughs, "Tarzan Forever", contains no slow parts.
