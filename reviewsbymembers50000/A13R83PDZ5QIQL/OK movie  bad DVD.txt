 No matter what you thought of the movie as a movie, the DVD is very flawed.  Not the image or the sound, mind you -- they're great.  And, yes, even the extras are sort of fun.  No, what's wrong with this disc is the "Infinifilm" coding.  In order for that to operate, other features on the disc are disabled:  "fast forward", "pause", and "rewind."  That is, you can only stop the film outright (no freeze-frame pauses), and you can only jump forward and backwards by chapters (no zooming ahead or backwards).  Bummer.
