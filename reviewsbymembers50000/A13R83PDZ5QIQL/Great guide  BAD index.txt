 What makes this a great guide is the fact that the listings for attractions/ shops / etc all have map numbers, which makes them very easy to find on the book's maps.  Also, the maps have their own little mini tables of attractions.  So, it's easy find where to go (if you are looking for something in particular) or what's around you (if you're already there).  Unfortunately, the index is sorely lacking.  Suppose you want to go for a horse-drawn carriage ride in Central Park, and you want to know where to find the carriages.  You will not find out through the index.  There is no mention of them under "Central Park."  There is no listing for "carriages" nor "carriage rides" and the listing for "horse-drawn carriages" is about the ones in Philadelphia.  Luckily, there actually is an extensive paragraph telling you all you need to know about this, and it is in the book's description of Central Park (which makes sense).  But you wouldn't know by looking at the index.  So, if you're planning a trip to N.Y., and you don't see a particular attraction in the index, do some research on the web, find out where it's supposed to be, and then turn to the section on that particular neighborhood in the book.  Maybe you'll find it there.  Use a highlighter to mark the page.
