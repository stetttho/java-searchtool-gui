 Don't let the title mislead, discourage or intimidate you: the interest and importance of Felicia Miller Frank's The Mechanical Song: Women, Voice, and the Artificial in Nineteenth-Century French Narrative (Stanford:  Stanford UP, 1995) lies not merely in its brilliant revivication of  negelcted works by Balzac, du Maurier, Nerval, Sand and Villiers de  L'Isle-Adam.

Perfectly complemented by Michel Poizat's The  Angel's Cry: Beyond the Pleasure Principle in Opera (Ithaca, NY: Cornell  UP, 1992); Kaja Silverman's The Acoustic Mirror: The Female Voice in  Psychoanalysis and Cinema (Bloomington: Indiana UP, 1988); and the  collection of essays, Embodied Voices: Representing Female Vocality in  Western Culture, edited by Nancy Jones and Leslie Dunn (New York: Cambridge  UP, 1997).  The recent, long-overdue English translation of Michel Chion's  La Voix au cinema (The Voice in Cinema (NY: Columbia UP, 1999)) upon which  most recent critical work on vocality draws is a bonus; now if only The  University of Illinois Press would reprint their too-long-unavailable  translation of Villiers' Tomorrow's Eve ...
