 Eric Greene's Planet of the Apes as American Myth:  Race, Politics and Popular Culture began its publishing history in 1996 as the finest offering to date of the small but noteworthy American Studies publishers, McFarland.   Apparently, this did not escape the attention of the somewhat less small,  even more noteworthy Wesleyan University Press (which has, among other  things, an exceptional line in popular music studies going), who have  kindly made Greene's excellent study of the vicissitudes of race across the  Planet of the Apes oeuvre not only more widely available, but, in a new  paperback edition, more affordable as well, though adding only a useful  introduction by Wesleyan's own Richard Slotkin.  Greene's brilliant,  thoroughgoing analysis follows the shifting role of race in the films,  television series, and even comic books inspired by Pierre Boulle's satiric  novel, Planete de les singes, in light of their contexts in the shifting  discourses and politics of the Civil Rights and Black Nationalist movements  of the 60's and 70's.  Interestingly, perhaps only Boulle's originary novel  gets short shrift here, albeit undersatndably, as it was the American  adaptations which explicitly layered the factor of race on Boulle's  ostensibly more general social satire.
