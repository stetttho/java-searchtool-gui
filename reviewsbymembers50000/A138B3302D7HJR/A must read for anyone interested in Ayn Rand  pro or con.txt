 Jeff Walker's The Ayn Rand Cult (LaSalle, IL: Open Court, 1999) is a long overdue, much-appreciated close examination of not only Rand's own works,  but her mythography as well.  Thorough and well-documented, Walker  addresses point-by-point Rand's philosophy and fictions as well as those of  her acolytes, who do indeed appear to constitute a "cult" as  Walker's title names them.  Particularly interesting (and often hilarious)  is Walker's painstaking archaeology of the sources of Rand's texts, not  only in her idiosyncratic readings of the philosophic tradition (although,  as Walker notes, she was not much of a reader of primary sources), but,  especially, in the popular (though typically now obscure) fictions and  films of her day.  A must read for anyone interested in Rand, pro or con.   See also Mary Gaitskill's novel, Two Girls, Fat and Thin.
