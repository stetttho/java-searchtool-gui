 David Martindale's Pufnstuf and Other Stuff: The Weird and Wonderful World of Sid and Marty Krofft (Los Angeles: Renaissance Books, 1998) is, interestingly, one of two recent works on the indeed "weird and  wonderful" Krofft oeuvre.  Whether or not it is the better of the two  depends on what one's interests are.  Though both works bear unwieldly  subtitles, unlike Hal Erickson's Sid and Marty Krofft: A Critical Study of  Saturday Morning Children's Television, 1969-1993(Jefferson, NC: McFarland,  1998), Martindale's book benefits not only from, for starters,  illustrations, but also from interviews with Les Freres Krofft themselves,  as well as with their colleagues, coworkers and employees.  Which means  that, while the Kroffts continue to circumlocute around the alleged  pharamceutical influences on and references in their shows  ("Pufnstuf," for starters, and some claim the "H.R."  stood for "hand-rolled"), "Lidsville" (!) star (and  erstwhile Eddie Munster) Butch Patrick, coming off not unlike Ben Stiller's  embittered impersonation of him, apparently blows the lid off the subject  by recalling a certain scent wafting from Sid's office (Marty, apparently,  was the more rectilinear of the Krofft kids).  One suspects that Krofft  fans in general will most likely prefer Martindale's anecdotes and pop  culture prose to Erickson's analyses and academic pretensions, but,  ultimately, Erickson's not quite "critical study" is nonetheless  the more informative of the two, not only for its greater detail and  attempts at contextualization, but also for simple amenities such as  episode guides for every Krofft series aired.  Martindale or Erickson? Get  'em both, if you can, and, while you're at it, see Timothy and Kevin  Burke's Saturday Morning Fever: Growing Up with Cartoon Culture New York:  Griffin, 1999) as well ...
