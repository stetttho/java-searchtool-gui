 In his deceptively concise work on "angels, sadomasochism, and the culture of the gothic," Nightmare on Main Street (Cambridge, MA: Harvard UP, 1997), Mark Edmunson argues that, pace the late, great Carl  Sagan, we do indeed live in a "demon-haunted world," albeit one  haunted perhaps by demons of our own making.  Edmundson's seductively  convincing claim is that, two centuries down the line from the genre's  origins, we have come to narrate our world through the conventions of  gothic fiction.  Not only our literature (horror, but also such works as  Nobel laureate Tony Morrison's Beloved), our cinema (the slasher film,  legitimated by the Academy Award given The Silence of the Lambs), but even  our news is generically gothic (l'affaire O.J. Simpson).  We--individually,  socially, culturally--are haunted by psychology, ideology (cf. Terry  Castle's "Phantasmagoria" in The Female Thermometer (NY: Oxford  UP, 1995), as well as her claims for Ann Radcliffe's The Mysteries of  Udolpho as a source of modern subjectivity, e.g., her introduction to the  recent Oxford World Classics edition), and our resurgent gothicism is as  much an epiphenomenon of millenial anxiety as its emergence was of the  Terror of the French Revolution.  Interestingly, however, Edmundson's own  narrative takes typically gothic twist, doubling this evil twin with the  "facile transcendence," as he quite rightly names it, of new age  spiritualism, exemplified by the recent mania for angels and such  middlebrow feelgood productions as Forrest Gump. While such tail-biting is  somewhat problematic, Nightmare on Main Street is nonetheless an ambitious,  suggestive, and, provisionally, convincing work of cultural analysis.   Related works of interest include Harold Bloom's Omens of Millenium: The  Gnosis of Angels, Dreams, and Resurrection (NY: Riverhead, 1996); Teresa  Goddu's Gothic America: Narrative, History, and Nation (NY: Columbia UP,  1997); and the collection of essays/exhibition catalog, Gothic:  Transmutations of Horror in Late Twentieth-Century Art, edited by Christoph  Grunenberg (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1998).
