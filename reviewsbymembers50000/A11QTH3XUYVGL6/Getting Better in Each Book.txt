 While MHC's books seem to start falling into a recognizable pattern of events for plot and action, her writing style is getting better and better.   When I first starting reading MHC books, I thought the writing somewhat immaturish, but she has improved in leaps and bounds with her style, substance, and maturity of details and realistic settings.   This is definitely a great read -- recommend wholeheartedly!
