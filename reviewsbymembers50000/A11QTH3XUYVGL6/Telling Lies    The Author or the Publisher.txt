 I recently ordered and received Lawrence Block's book, 'Writing the Novel From Plot to Print.'  IF you are very serious about writing a novel, this small book provides some thoughtful, though verbose information on tips and tricks and should and shouldn't's.   In the same order package, I purchased 'Telling Lies for Fun and Profit -- A Manuel for Fiction Writers.' I was very dissapointed to find that the second book was an almost verbatim version of the 'Writing the Novel...' book.   Keeping that in mind, if/when you order either of the books, go for the cheapest used version you can get of either because Mr. Block tells the same anecdotes, the same thoughts, and information in both books--almost verbatim.   I just wish that on either of the books information, either in Amazon or Printer's Editorial/Description, it would have been noted that the first book was a rewrite of the second (or vice versa). As to the value of the information that is provided in either book--it's OK, but nothing earthshattering that will help you write a blockbuster novel.  The text itself reads easily, as if you were having a conversation with Mr. Block in the same room.  Very friendly and easy to understand--nothing you would need a college degree to comprehend.
