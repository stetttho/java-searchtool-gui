 I was looking for good, solid pointers on how to write a supsense novel, and this book did the trick. The writing in the books is concise, gets to the point without a lot pontificating by the author and samples for every point are provided that are easy to understand, and easy to recreate by any imaginative writer.  I yellow-highlighted my book throughout, then went back and typed up the point notes.  I'm going to use those point notes when I write my next suspense novel! Highly recommended reading for the aspiring writer.
