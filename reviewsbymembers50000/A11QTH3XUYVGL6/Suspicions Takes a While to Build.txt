 The novel is a typical 'hard-boiled' female (married) lawyer who has "been wronged" and has to set things right for the sake of the children.   The beginning of the novel starts rather slowly, but only until when her husband turns out to be missing does the curious reader want to plug ahead to see what happens next.  Add to the plot too many characters without any major distinguishing characterics and names that the reader can't be 'comfortable' enough to recognize throughout the books, whether they are a friend or foe, and then have the female protagonist start jumping into bed with several of them (never mind that she just supposedly lost her husband of 12-15 [?] years, the father of her children!) -- gosh, how to keep the characters straight, much less the plot!   Next, the female protagonist is darting all about Geneva, Switzerland meeting new (more but more interesting) "underground/political' characters. The only ones that stands out is the personable dressmaker and the female French underground spy.  Now, add in a little anti-semitism, Nazi revolutionalists and United States politics and by the end of the book, she walks away from a heavily guarded fortress and later the mysterious man who she's fallen in love with (I'm still asking to myself -- why?-- there wasn't even a memorable description of him, but I got the fleeting impression she was six inches taller than him.) You can get really confused trying to figure out all the characters and guessing at the plot. Since the book is selling for only a few cents used on AMAZON, it might be worth the P&H to check it out for a relaxed beach read, but unfortunately, I won't be looking for her other novels unless I can get them cheap at a yard sale.  If the author started out with a good plot and great characters, then the editor mangled this book beyond redemption.
