 I purchased this box of crafts for my daughter for a Christmas gift was was pretty disappointed in how much I paid and how little I received.  In the box was four small votive candle holders in various shapes, several bags of waxy covered sand and some small birthday candles plus instructions.  For the amount of money I paid for this 'craft kit' I could have purchased MUCH more.  I can get votive candle holders at the Dollar Store, shave wax from crayons, and bought a box of birthday candles at the grocery store for the price of $5.00 or less.  The money I spent on this kit was a complete waste in my opinion.
