 If you are looking for the best how to write 'whodunit' source book in the entire world, this is it.  Don't walk, don't dawdle, RUN and get this book. I haven't, to my knowledge, read any of Carolyn Wheat's books, but she has the best analytical mind when it comes to disecting what makes other author's books 'work.'  She breaks down each factor, gives marvelous samples in current and ancient works (myths), and then lays out the roadmap.   If you are a struggling writer trying to write that perfect murder mystery or suspense thriller, this cookbook will teach you how to lay out the story line, point out what 'holes' you may have in your story before you write the words down, then guide you down the path to doing it 'right.'   Try this book and study it from cover to cover, then sit down and write your story, then use this book to look back over your plot to see if it fits in with the recipe.  If you can't get it to work, then maybe writing isn't what you need to be doing.  I have read dozens of books on 'how to write' and after Lawrence Block's books that give great advice, I would rank this one as number one on my list.  And, I intend the book to stay on my bookshelf forever!
