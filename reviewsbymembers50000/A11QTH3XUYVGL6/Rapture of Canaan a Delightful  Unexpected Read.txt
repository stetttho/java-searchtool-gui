 Sheri Reynold's Rapture of Canaan title gave me the initial imporession it would be a 'hardship' survival, tell all book about an excape from a cult.  It was totally unexpected when I started to read a story about a young girl and her life within this 'self-developed' sect, her comfort in growing up with her immediate family, under the strict guidance of her preacher grandfather and her story-telling grandmother.  Her entire family showed that they loved her and other members of the family within the sect and even though their life-style might have been considered 'harsh' by outsiders, they felt they lived a 'good' life.   The young protagonist's 'surprise' pregnancy came about from the Church and her parents failure to communicate properly to her about the birds and bees and her misinterpretation of the "Rapture" the members of the church were constantly seeking.   There is death and sadness, happiness and love, events that occur for the better and worse, but the entire story is beautifully written.  I couldn't put the book down, the story line was so interesting and didn't want to wait to see 'what happened next.'   This book would be a very good read for anyone looking for a good story that emphasizes family love and devotion in the face of life's hardships.
