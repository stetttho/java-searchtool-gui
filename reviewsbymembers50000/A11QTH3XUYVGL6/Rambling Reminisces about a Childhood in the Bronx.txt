 Michael Pearson has the right idea, but the ideas that are gathered into the book are a little disjointed and fractured.  If he could smooth out the stories so that blend one into the other, the entire book would read better.  On the positive note, Dreaming of Columbus would definitely stir memories of the neighborhood for those growing up in that part of New York.  He does have some descriptive stories of people, places and landmarks in the book that are entertainingly delightful.  If you are a Bronx native, I would recommend this book so you can remember things you may never see again.
