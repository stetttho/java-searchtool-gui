 I have never heard of this author before I picked up the book in a local thrift store.  What I can't believe is that I've never heard of this author after I finished reading the book.  I can't wait to go out and find more of his books! This book is essentially a fictitional account of the real life of Sheriff Pat Garrett--infamous for killing Billy the Kid.  It has a secondary character who narrates and intersperses personal observations throughout the story, which adds an interesting dimension to the story.  I'm not totally sure why he's there at all, but it does add a little 'drive' throughout the book--I wanted to keep reading to see what this narrator character was going to divulge next.  Estleman is deliciously ingenious with mental images.  His passages read so brilliantly with his descriptions and metaphors that you can't help but instantly develop an image in your head as you watch your own internal moving picture.  Simple phrases such as "...the clatter of a heavy wagon built of elm delivering a load of rocks smelling of moist earth..." jolts your own memory to relive personal images that almost match this scene and let you fall into the arms of the storyteller.   Ths story itself takes place over several decades and highlights supposed 'facts' of the life of Pat Garrett, but seems to fill in details while skipping them alltogether.  You don't feel anything missing at the end of the story. If you haven't read this book, or any book by Loren D. Estleman, I highly advice you to try him out -- even if it isn't this particular book.  While I haven't read his other books yet, if his methodology and story-telling skills are equal to this slim volume, I can't wait to read the rest!
