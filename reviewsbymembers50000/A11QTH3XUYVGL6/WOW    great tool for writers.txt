 This little book is a wonder in itself.  It is a combination book of philosopy, book of poetry, and book of inspirational ideas.   It doesn't spell out a whole scene on every page that you are encouraged to write out yourself like other idea books...it gives you a tiny snippet of an idea that you can springboard off into your own writing journey.   It does have some neat little stories and poems that are less than 1 1/2 pages long, has gorgeous black and white pictures that can prompt your imagination into a story or memory of your own, and the subtle, gentle push by the author through out the book for you to go ahead and 'take the plunge, write...!" is ambiguous enough to not sound like your mother nagging at you to get a chore done.  I like the fact the book is small--five x seven inches--and easily thrown into a purse or coat pocket.   Well done, Ms. Wood!
