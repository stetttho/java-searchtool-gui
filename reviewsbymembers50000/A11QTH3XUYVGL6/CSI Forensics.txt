 Of all the Forensics books I've struggled through in the past compared to this one--this was one of the most enjoyable reads I've had in a long time.  The most interesting facet of this book is it uses anecdotes from the CSI shows to illustrate the point that is being described in the book.  There is just enought detail to give you the basics, without overwhelming you with technical jargo.   If you are a mystery writer, this book should be on your resources bookshelf for quick lookups to check and validate your facts.  It could also be a great source book for murder plot ideas.
