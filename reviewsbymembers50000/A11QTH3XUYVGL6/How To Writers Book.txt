 This book was written by one of the most prolific writers of our age-Lawrence Block.  While I haven't read many of his fiction books, I have read a few of his 'how-to write' books.   He does have a conversational tone in his 'how to write' books, so you have to plow through a lot of verbage to get to the good points.  I think that was basically to flesh out the book to bring it up to 250 pages.   If you can read fast and get through the extra verbage, this book does have some very good points to keep in mind when writing a book of Fiction, which if you use, would make your own story more interesting.
