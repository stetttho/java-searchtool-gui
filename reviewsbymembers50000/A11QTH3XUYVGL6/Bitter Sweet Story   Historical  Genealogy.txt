 I picked this book up from a popular restaurant on the middle penisula of Virginia looking for something to read from the local area with historical flavor.  What I ended up with was a bittersweet love story of a Civil War Soldier.  Lt. Robert Gaines Haile, Jr. was a good looking man, and devoted to the cause.  He joined the Esex Sharpshooters to do his duty, and was wounded in battle and died with his wife in attendance.  While you hear of thousands of husbands, brothers, fathers and sons that died in the Civil War, this small book brings home the story poignently, while simultaneously describing in great historical detail the geographic area, the people around him, and the battles he encountered.  The descendant who wrote the books with Mr. Haile's compiled letters did an excellent job of gathering many factual details, photos, and maps of what his ancestor was describing.   Highly recommended for a tour through history from someone who actually was in the middle of the action and literate enough to write about it.
