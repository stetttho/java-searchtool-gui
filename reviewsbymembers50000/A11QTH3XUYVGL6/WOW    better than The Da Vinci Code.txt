 Like other readers of the Da Vinci Code, I wanted to read other books written by Dan Brown.  What surprised me was that the Angels and Demons book wasn't the book that took him to the top of the NYT best seller's list.   I read the Da Vinci Code and probably rate it as a 4 in reading and excitement.  I rate A&D a 5.  This book clipped along in such a breathless speed of action, suspense, and drama that I was up into the wee hours of the morning, my eyelids drooping, too into the plot to put the book down. The only part of the book that I was somewhat dissapointed in was when two characters jumped out of a helicopter that was supposedly 1 - 3 miles up in the air, neither seemed to have parachutes, but both survived and landed in very convenient spots for the plot.  That tiny part of the plot was not at all believable, but I forgive Mr. Brown because the rest of the book was so absolutely delicious.   What delighted me even more -- just as I thought the climax had been reached (and for the most part, it was the major climax), there were a few more minor climaxes.  (I was wondering why there were another hundred pages or so after the best part of the book!).   I think that last scene (Chapter 137) in the book was insisted upon by market driven publishers who felt that all good books had to have a gratuitious sex scene to make the book complete.  Come on -- 'publishing industry' -- wake up!  An awesome, potentially best-seller book can be considered 'complete' and 'marketable' without a sex scene.  This scene wasn't even necessary to make me want to lean back and smoke a cigarette afterwards from the book's overall excitement. There are the first few chapters of Dan Brown's next book, "Deception Point" in the back of the paperback A&D book I had.  I can't wait to buy that next book to see what exciting plots and twists have been devilishly written by Mr. Brown.
