 I am NOT a reader of western novels, but in a Writer's Online group, one of the members noted they had written westerns under a psudenym of Wolf MacKenna.  I thought it would be cool to read one of the books to see how well the author wrote.   I was pleasantly surprised.  The characters are 'real' and have a life of their own.  The plot, while simple, moved along swiftly and dramatically.  ANd, luckily for me, their was a pivotal ending, crisis averted, and everyone lived happily ever after.   This book is definitely worth picking up and the 217 pages should be only a night or two worth of reading for speed readers. Definitely a good pick for a casual reader with (or without) western tastes in reading.
