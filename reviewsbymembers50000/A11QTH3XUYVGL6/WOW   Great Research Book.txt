 I bought this book because it was one of the recommendations by Writer's Digest to get a large resource in a compact package that gives descriptions of most of the worlds most known authors and what they have written.  I had no idea how jam-packed it is with information.  Highly recommended as a textbook for all English Majors and/or wanna-be writers!
