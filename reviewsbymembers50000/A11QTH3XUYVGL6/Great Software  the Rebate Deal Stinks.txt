 I submitted this review once before, but obviously Amazon didn't like my language used.   I was so mad when I received this package in the mail and read the 'requisites' that had to be fulfilled to use the rebate I was HOT!  You have to have purchased either MS publisher in a previous version or other MS products to qualify for sending in the $30.00 rebate.  I was totally 'ticked off' before I even opened the software package after reading the rebate requirements.   If you are looking to purchase a great program, go ahead and buy it, but you might do better buying it in a local store versus having to wait a week or more to receive the MS Publisher in the mail promising a $30.00 rebate that you have to bend over backwards in order to take advantage of.   I have used Publisher for over five years and it is one of the easiest, user-friendly packages available for those wishing to put together great newsletters, calendars, and greeting cards.  If you want to pay full price and forget the rebate and you aren't able to get to a local store to purchase, then this is a good alternative.
