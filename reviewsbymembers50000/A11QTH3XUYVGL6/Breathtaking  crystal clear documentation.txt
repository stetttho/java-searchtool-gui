 I have checked this book out at the library looking for 'GOOD' photos of some of the older homes and the resconstructed homes from the 1700's.  The photos are absolutely breathtakingly crystal, clear, show wonderful  asthetic views, and give a simple and linear time frame of ownership and  construction/demolition, reconstruction of many of the homes in the  Williamsburg area.  This book is worth every penny if you buy it for  research and historical purposes.  Of all the books on Williamsburg that I  have ever read (dozens and dozens), this one is the most excellent!
