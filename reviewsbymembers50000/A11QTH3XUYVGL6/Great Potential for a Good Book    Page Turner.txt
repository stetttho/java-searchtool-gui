 The plot is already outlined in several other reviews on this book.  My impressions of the book: The 'action' or 'hook' doesn't start until about page 28. Once it starts, the reader does have an inclination to want to know what is going to happen to the hapless protagonist, and the reader does start to feel sorry for him as the book progresses. I was absolutely dissapointed in the ending -- it was pretty lame.   I think the author could have benefited by making Mona, the helpful woman that the protagonist hooks up with, either more mysterious herself, or give more clues about her past (although when the author described how her first husband died, I had an inkling).   Other reviewers noted that Mr. Pronzini had other books out that were even better and this was not a sample of his best work -- remember, even your worst work has to be great for others to be interested in all your other writings.
