 I just finished reading Volume 25, No.1 issue of Kalliope.  After browsing through dozens of various literary magazines, this one is the first that makes me feel as if it's NOT written over my head.   I will pick up literary magazines and see them advertised in Writer's Magazines, but this one has a female slant of all female writers that write toward a female audience.  The stories are rich, the poems not NOT superfilous, and the photos are breathtakingly beautiful.   If you are writer or in the literary field, I would advise to try at least one issue of this magazine.
