 Janet Perry's book about two women from two different cultures on either side of the 'River' that divides them, culturally and physically until Lu accepts employment with Eddie is full of allusions and metaphors that are not in your face, but realized after you finish the read and sit back and think.   Lu, the protagonist wishes for a simple life where she is free from the 'want' she grew up with in her native village and for a good home for her two children.   Eddie, the secondary protagonist/antagonist, wishes for another life, but settles for what she has, and after the death of her husband lives her life pretending she lives in the life of her dreams.   Both women interact, both taking and giving in seemingly uneven lifestyles, but in the end, the proof is they both reap and receive their life's rewards.  Both realize, after major events in their lives have occurred, goals for which they were both conciously and perhaps subconciously wishing for themselves. This book reads smoothly and the events segue beautifully.  I highly recommend this book for anyone wishing to be transported to a place in another time to look over the shoulder of two women whose inner beauty glows through to the reader.
