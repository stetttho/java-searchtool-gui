 WOW is the first thing I thought of after I swiftly devoured Mr. Kress' material in this book.  As a budding writer, I am very determined to make my characters the alsolute best they can be to reduce the initial onslaught of rejections once I start marketing my book.  One of the other reviewers for this book noted writers should keep this book open while writing to get the most for your characters--I agree 110%.   I have plowed through some reslly dull 'writer's how-to' books over the past year, and this one is the cherry of the crop.  I would run, not walk, to your nearest book-seller (if you plan to write stories with realistic characters) and get this book immediately.  I can't say enough good things about it.
