 I can't remember how I stumbled across this book -- perhaps via a writing group online where I talked to the author.  Let me say, I am not a fan of western literature, but was curious about the author and what he wrote.  What a delightful tale!  The story was written in a first person viewpoint, with the narrator telling a tale about how he got into trouble while trying to stay an honest man, just for being good with a gun. The story is told in a "Western Dialect" you would expect from a "Good Old Boy" who didn't have but a few years of education, and while writer's schools proclaim this is just a terrible writing style, in this story, it works!   Kid Parmlee, often compared to "Billy The Kid," is trying to live quietly, avoiding all the relatives of some folks back home (Hatfield versus McCoy) bent on revenge, while simultaneously getting caught up when accused of robbing a bank, then later killing a few folks.  It's a case of mistaken identity.  It's not long before he gets into more trouble.   What is delightful are several of the sections of the book where humor is brought in, and you find yourself cackling and grinning with some of the solutions Kid Parmlee comes up with to get as far away from trouble as possible.   The story/book is loaded with colorful characters, the very few sex (scenes) are gracefully/subtley inserted in just the right places without any graphic details.   The story was just a delight to read and the back cover of the book noted that author, Robert J. Conley is a member of the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokees.  He is author of over 40 books, so I definitely want to explore some more of his stories -- especially about Kid Parmlee! Definitely a treat -- try it, you'll like it whether you are a Western Novel fan or not.
