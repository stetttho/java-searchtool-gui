 I read Robert Ludlum's book, The Bourne Identity, and lost a lot of sleep over late night read-a-thon's.  I can't believe how RL grabs the reader from the first page and has the reader hanging on by their fingernails at the end of every chapter.  I was so impressed by this book, when I discovered there were two sequels to the Bourne Identity, I immediately purchased them.  They were not dissapointing either--two more weeks of sleepless nights trying to reach the thrilling climax at the end of each book!  If you love high speed espionage with chases, the beautiful female love interest, and the antagonist disquised as an evil devil that 'good' has to overcome, then I highly encourage you to run to the closest bookstore or library and get your own copy!
