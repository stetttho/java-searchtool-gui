 This thin book is amazing for the amount of basic detail and information.  It was great for getting a simple start on my genealogy project for a general understanding of what the invasion was about and for a non-military  reader.  It's easy to read and highly recommend to WWII history buffs.   Only complaint I had was the high price for the size of the paperback book.
