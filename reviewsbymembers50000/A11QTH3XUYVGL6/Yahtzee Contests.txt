 My daughter received two of these hand-held games for Christmas and between her and a cousin came up with Yahtzee contests to see who could get higher scores every game play.  The game is not only easy to play, a great education for those learning adding and counting, but can entertain a pre-teen for hours.  I'm sure the inventors were thinking mostly of solitaire play, but the cousins really put the games to use in competition against each other.
