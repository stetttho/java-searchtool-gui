 Debbie Macomber is a good writer and I've read quite a few of her books.  This one has way too many characters to keep track of.  Although I didn't dislike this book, I finished it feeling vaguely unsatisfied.  It seemed like there were many loose ends to be tied up.  From reading the other reviews, I am not alone in my opinion.
