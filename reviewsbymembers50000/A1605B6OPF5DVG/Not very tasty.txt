 I'm Jewish and I'm from Texas so, I should like this book, right?  WRONG!  None of these characters is likeable and that includes Ruby, the Rabbi's wife.  Since she's the character at the center of this story, that makes it difficult.  She's nosy, pushy, snide, and sneaky.  That's just SOME of her good qualities.  Her friends are even worse.  The "mystery" is far-fetched.  The blurb on the book's cover is very appealing.  It's a shame the book isn't as good as its cover.
