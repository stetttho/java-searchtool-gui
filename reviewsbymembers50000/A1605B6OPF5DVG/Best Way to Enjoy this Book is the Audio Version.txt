 My husband and I listened to this book on the drive from Dallas to Austin, Texas.  We were on the last side of the last tape when we arrived at our daughter's house and, as much as I wanted to see my daughter and son-in-law, I wanted to hear the end of the story right then.  Chris Noth and Robert Guilliame give a compelling performance.  Noth makes the bad guys sound really spooky and scary and Guilliame makes Alex sound both smart and vulnerable.   A lot of the book's shortcomings are diminished or, at least, not so noticeable in the audio version.  Listening to this abridged version gives you the essence of Patterson in a most entertaining format.
