 I discovered the Crais books kinda by accident.  I have been a big fan of Robert B. Parker's for many years and was told that if I liked Parker, I would like Crais.  There is a similarity as both detectives have powerful sidekicks with pasts that are only alluded to.  In LA Requiem, we find out a lot about the mysterious Joe Pike, our hero Elvis Cole's sidekick.  This book is a lot grittier than the previous Cole books and at first, it was rather a turn-off.  As I read more of the book, I couldn't help but get involved in the story and felt that the more serious tone really suited this particular tale.  Elvis is still a smartass but, he really gets involved in his friend's plight and his romantic interest takes an unexpected turn.  I would recommend this book to anyone who likes modern day detective fiction.  I would suggest that anyone who hasn't read one or more of the earlier books in this series should do so before reading this one.
