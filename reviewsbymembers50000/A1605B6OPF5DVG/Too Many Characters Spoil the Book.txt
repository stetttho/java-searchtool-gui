 There are a lot of problems with this book starting with too many characters to keep track of.  I found myself having to back up every few pages just to figure out who some of these people were.  I know it's set in a small town but, we really don't need to meet everyone at once.  I'd also like to know how Hannah earns any money.  She gives away more cookies than she sells! Hannah also needs a romance.  It's hinted that there might be one in her future but, I was reading this book NOW and would have appreciated a little romance.   Another problem is that her cop brother-in-law asks her to interview and help out in a murder investigation.  Oh yeah?  Do the cops in your community ask you to investigate for them? On the plus side, the cookie recipes all sound delicious.  I haven't tried any because I was busy reading the book.
