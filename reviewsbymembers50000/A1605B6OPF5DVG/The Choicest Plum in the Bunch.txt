 I have read all the books in the Plum series and this one is the best.  Stephanie's Grandma and her antics at the funeral home are a hoot!  Stephanie and Joe (her sometime lover) are hot, hot, hot!  This book is pure fun.  I loved it so much I sent it to my Dad and got him hooked.  I bought the book-on-tape for my husband (he travels by car a lot).  He liked the story but, not the reader.  Her name is Lorry Petty.  If you are looking to get the audio version, don't get this one.  She has a high-pitched squeaky voice which can be quite annoying.
