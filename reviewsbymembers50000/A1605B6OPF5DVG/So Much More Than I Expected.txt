 First off, the title stinks.  It has absolutely nothing to do with the story.  I suspected that it might have some recipes in it.  Boy, was I ever wrong! Tory (our heroine) is a delight.  She's in a bad situation but, her sense of humor really saves the day.  There are a lot of people in this small town who have played a small part in this murder scenario but, putting all the pieces together isn't easy.  The ending really surprised me and I read a lot of murder mysteries.
