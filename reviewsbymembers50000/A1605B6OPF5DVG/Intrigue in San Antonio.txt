 I first read "The Widower's Two-Step" and was a little familiar with some of the characters.  This book got a great review in the Dallas Morning News so, I decided to give it a shot.  The writing is terrific.  Riordan does marvelous descriptions of most of the characters and the various San Antonio neighborhoods.  One gripe in the description department, what does Tres (the principal character) look like?  Tres' physical appearance, other than his injuries, are glossed over.  I want a picture of this guy, please.  The mystery behind the murders is not all that puzzling.  Riordan gives you a lot of clues before the final enlightenment.   The characters in this book are fresh and different--not at all run-of-the-mill, and that includes the bad guys.  If you are looking to escape from your everyday world and meet a decidedly cool teacher/private eye then, this is the book for you.  People from his past and present collide in rather unexpected ways.
