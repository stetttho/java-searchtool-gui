 I use mine and I would recommend it to other people but, I'd like to point out its limitations.   1. It's small.  It only holds enough food to serve one or two people.   2. It doesn't tenderize meat.  Marinades flavor foods.  Acid-based marinades will make the surface of the food mushy if left in too long but, not tender.   On the positive side, it's easy to clean and doesn't take up a lot of storage space.  It does do what's it's supposed to.
