 I first saw Kathleen on one of the morning talk shows and I was inspired by her story.  She loved food and not only cooked it professionally but, was almost obsessed with it.  She was substantially overweight as a result.  When she was hired as spa chef at a posh Hawaiian resort, she rose to the challenge of coming up with delicious, satisfying and healthful food.  She ended up losing 80 lbs. and developing a new cuisine which she shares with us in her book.   One of the things I especially like about these recipes is that they consider texture to be as key an element as taste, aroma and calories.  A lot of the diets forget that.  I think that's why liquid diets don't work.  Chewing is one of the most satisfying aspects of eating.   The baked asparagus has become one of my all-time favorites.  I make it often and have passed on the recipe to many different folks.   I hope that KD includes nutritional information in her next book so that all those whiners would shut up.
