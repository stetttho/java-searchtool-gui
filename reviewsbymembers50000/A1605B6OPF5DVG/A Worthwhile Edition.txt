 I collect cookbooks.  I probably have over 150.  I can honestly say that I have made at least one recipe from every cookbook I own.   This book has some terrific recipes for some common items like brownies and meatloaf.  I'd say Ms. Garten's could become the definitive version.  These recipes are not especially difficult & don't call for hard-to-find ingredients or difficult techniques.  This is for people who like to eat delicious food but, not for calorie-counters.
