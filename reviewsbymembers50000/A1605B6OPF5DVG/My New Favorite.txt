 I've been a Springsteen fan for a very long time but, many of his recent CDs have missed the mark for me.  "The Rising" is like the old Bruce and fits like a pair of comfy slippers.  I can listen to it over and over and over and I do.  Slip it in the changer and you're transported back to the days when Bruce was "The Boss" and you were happier, younger, or whatever.
