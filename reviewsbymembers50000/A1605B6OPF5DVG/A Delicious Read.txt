 Although we (my husband and I) have been grilling for over 30 years, we realized that our techniques could use some improvement.  This book makes good grilling easy.  If you can read and follow simple directions, you can be a grill master.  We keep our book near the grill so we can refer to it to check what heat to use, how long to cook, etc.  If you want to grill and enjoy your food, buy this book!
