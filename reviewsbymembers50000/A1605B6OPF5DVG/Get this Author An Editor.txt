 This book sounded absolutely adorable with its murder occurring in the beauty shop.  Some days when our hair doesn't come out looking so hot, I'm sure murder is on the mind of some of the patrons.  Marla (the principal character) sounded like someone we'd want to know.  I know South Florida as my folks have lived there for quite some time.  All the elements of a book I should like were in place. Let's start with the writing.  The author describes a lot of stuff that doesn't move along the action at all.  She hints at back stories for some of the characters but, doesn't give us the details then, plops them in at inappropriate spots.  Why not tell us about the girls at the salon?  The mystery is weak, too.  It doesn't take much to figure this one out at all.  Let's hope that Ms. Cohen either improves her writing skills or gets a better editor, please.
