 I am giving a very positive review of this item since it's easy to use and does a great job at zesting--exactly what I wanted it for.  I doubt if any of the people who gave negative reviews will revisit this site but, I think I ought to point out that the Microplane comes in various sizes for various uses--most particularly grating cheese or grating hard items.  This is not a "one size fits all" item.  I wish those who complained about too-fine cheese shreds would spend a litttle time in a gourmet store and check out the various versions of the Microplane.  I think they would change their mind.
