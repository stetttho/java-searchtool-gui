 I think I can save y'all from spending money on these books. Dr. Shapiro apparently thinks the answer to eating less calories and fat is NO MEAT! How can you compare a real beef hamburger to a veggie burger? Chicken nuggets vs. Lentil Soup? Is this guy nuts or what? The other calorie and fat saver is NO REAL SALAD DRESSING! Duh. Another tip is hold the cheese. Save your money and buy a Vegan Vegetarian cookbook instead of these. That's the kind of food the good doctor wants you to eat in order to lose weight. The dessert book suggests fresh fruit and is real big on frozen fudgsicles and dreamsicles. It suggests that this will satisfy your cravings for brownies or Napoleons. I don't think so but, they are a reasonable alternative when you just have to have something sweet.
