 The authors attribute recipes to each of the Southern States individually & this is kinda cute.  They also single out Shavuot & Sukkoth, I'm not sure why because last I heard, these are Jewish holidays & not  states!   I've only tried a couple of the recipes but, I must say, the  Yummy Yam Kugel is definitely a winner.  It's won rave reviews every time  it's been served.
