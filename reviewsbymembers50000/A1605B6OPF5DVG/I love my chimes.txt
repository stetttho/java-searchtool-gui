 These chimes are a quality item at a reasonable price.  They are very melodic and pleasant-sounding.  They never seem to hit the wrong note.  The ideal placement is supposed to be the Northwest corner of one's  house.  At our house, that would have them in the garage!  They seem to be doing fine on our patio and don't disturb anyone's sleep either.
