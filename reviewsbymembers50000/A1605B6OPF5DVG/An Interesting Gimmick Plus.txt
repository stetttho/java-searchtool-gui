 Claire works in the Oregon state custom license plate division so, one assumes she's familiar with a lot of the cutesy combinations people come up with for their plates.  The author capitalizes on this by giving us clues in the form of these license plates at the end of certain chapters.  She even obliges by giving us a Key to License Plate Terms near the end of the book--just in case we can't figure them out.   I'll admit I was drawn to the gimmick at first but, the story is good.  When her aunt dies, Claire inherits the contents of her trailer.  She is intrigued by a painting she finds that people keep telling her is worthless but, she pursues it anyway with intriguing results.  We find out the Claire is a smart girl with good intuitive instincts except when it comes to men.  Hopefully, she will improve her skills in the romantic department in the future.  Circles of Confusion is a very entertaining read.
