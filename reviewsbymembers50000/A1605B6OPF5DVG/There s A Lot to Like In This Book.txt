 What we have here is a well-written thriller.  Interestingly enough, it's written by a man presenting the story as a woman (photojournalist Jordan Glass)and using the first tense as the narrative form.  There is a good mystery and a love story happening here.  Like one of the previous reviewers, I think most of the book is rather well-done but, the ending and/or resolution of the mystery is rather contrived and unsatisfying.  Mr. Iles also spends a lot of time discussing locations and the mechanics of getting to and from these locations.  Things like the ride from the airport, what kind of vehicle was used and who was driving are totally unneccessary. All in all, I would recommend this book and look forward to reading some of the author's other works.
