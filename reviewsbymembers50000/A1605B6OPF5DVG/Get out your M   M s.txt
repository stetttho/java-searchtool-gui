 Our heroine, Bel, is addicted to M & M's.  After all, it's a convenient way of eating chocolate without the mess.  She needs a "fix" especially when she's involved in a stressful situation.  There's plenty of those in this book and for those of us who could really empathize with the character, there are lots of M & M moments.  Ms. Isenberg uses a lot of interesting devices to move the plot along.  Most of the chapters start with an e-mail or letter to or from Bel.  This lets you in on what's going on without hitting you over the head with it.  I like it! Teacher Bel has a lot of stuff going on in her life.  I would have liked a little more about her relationship with Sol.  It seems to be relegated to the back burner in this book.  This is a character-driven book and the author has created some great characters--most of which would be interesting to meet.  The mystery part is a little flimsy but, that can be forgiven because it's fun just reading what Bel and her cohorts are going to do next.  I read this book on the plane from Vegas to Dallas and I didn't really mind that the flight was about a half-hour late because I was really into the book.
