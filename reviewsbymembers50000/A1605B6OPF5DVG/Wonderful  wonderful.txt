 Romantic mystery is my favorite genre and that's exactly what this is.  The author puts our heroine is sometimes perilous, often funny situations--even when she's finding dead bodies.  Emily's grandmother and her Midwestern sensibilities make the most outlandish things seem plausible.  If anything, this book could use a little more romance but, that's promised in the next book in this series so, we'll see what happens.  I highly recommend this one.  You'll learn about Seniors Tours to Switzerland, the sights in Switzerland, hotel service in Switzerland, the police, and the wonderful people from Iowa and others on this tour plus, you find out who done it and why.  This is the perfect book to take on vacation--even if you're not on a Seniors Tour or going to Switzerland.  It's just great fun.  Enjoy!
