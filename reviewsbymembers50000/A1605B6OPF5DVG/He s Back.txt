 I used to like Todd Rundgren back in the old days.  Then he got too involved in electronics and computers and such.  His "music" became too New Age and I stopped listening.  I saw him do a song from this CD on one of the late night shows and, lo and behold, it was reminiscent of the old Todd Rundgren.  So I bought the whole thing.  I like it.  The orchestrations are a bit overdone  in part but, overall, this is easy to listen to and the lyrics are very clever and witty.
