 I needed to start eating healthier and since I know I like Greek and Italian cuisine, I thought the Mediterranean diet might be the way to go.  This book explains this healthful way of eating and cooking.  The emphasis is on fruits, vegetables, grains, pasta, fish, seafood and poultry.  If you're looking for red meat recipes, this is not the book for you.  Most of the recipes can be prepared in 30 minutes or less.  Complete nutritional information is provided for each recipe.   I don't believe any of the recipes included any salt so, this would be a boon for those of us who are supposed to cut down on salt.  There are a number of terrific muffin, bread, and pancake recipes.  The soups, salads, fish, seafood, poultry, and especially the veggie recipes provide a wide variety of choices.  My one gripe is that there are very few dessert recipes and the few that they've included, with the exception of the pumpkin pie, were not very appealing to me.  The pumpkin pie recipe uses a crust made with gingersnaps and graham cracker crumbs which is quite good and makes it much lower in fat and cholesterol.
