 Yes, like many of your other reviewers, I have read ALL of the books in the Stephanie Plum series.  I even read this author BEFORE she created Stephanie and I really enjoyed her work.  I think she was sleepwalking through this one.  Her descriptions of the characters and situations were what made the previous books fun to read.  This one is sorely lacking.  For instance, there is a scene where Stephanie and Lula end up in the pit at a mud wrestling bar.  I've never been to a mud wrestling bar so it's hard for me to come up with a picture of what it's like. More vivid and colorful descriptions could have made this a memorable scene.  Instead, it comes across rather flat. Also, the author assumes that the reader already knows a lot of stuff about the recurring characters without filling us in.  Poor Joe Morelli!  He's relegated to the back burner in favor of the dog.  C'mon, Janet, you can do much better.
