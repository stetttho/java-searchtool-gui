 I'm not too familiar with the terminology of hockey but, I think a "hat trick" is supposed to be a really good thing to achieve.  If that's the case, this book scored a "hat trick" with me.  Jane is smart enough to capitalize on her relationship with Luc, both personally and professionally.  Luc is smart enough to recognize the attraction to Jane, even though she doesn't appear to be his type.  The author does a really terrific of bringing these characters to life for me.  It doesn't hurt that there is extended foreplay to some steamy sex.  Also, I'm not into tattoos but, I'd sure like to get an eyeful of Luc's.
