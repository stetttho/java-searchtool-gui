 This book was a quick, enjoyable read.  Why?  I liked meeting the principal characters, the romance and sex were hot, and there was a murder mystery with psychological implications, too.  What more could you ask?  The dialogue and exhanges between Jaine, Sam, and her friends were lively and fun.  The mystery element was not as finely handled as most of the other details of the book and that's why I can't give it 5 stars.  It was kinda like the Columbo TV series.  They tell you who the murderer is and then you have to wait for the other characters to catch on.  For some, the realization comes too late.
