 I have read ALL of her books.  Scottoline is one of my favorite authors.  This book started slow and I almost gave up on it.  To be honest, a vendetta between two old Italian men is not what I want to read about.  This novel has a lot of flashbacks to the vendetta story, regarding past injuries and injustices and the current situation involving the killing of one of the protagonists.  I gave this book a chance because I wanted to read a story with Judy Carrier as the main character.  If you've read any of the author's previous works, you know who Judy is.  In this book, we learn a little more--particularly about her work ethic. Judy seems to work more hours than there are in one day.  She works almost exclusively on this one case and she's not getting paid for it although she racks up some pretty hefty expenses.  There are a lot of loose ends here and a lot of items introduced but, never explained.  For example, there is a character named Murphy in Judy's office mentioned a couple of times as a "sidebar" and then the conflict between the two characters is never mentioned again.    The only character we really learn a lot about is Pigeon Tony.  I mention that because that's what I really missed the most in this book--the strong characterizations from her previous works.  This is still an interesting read.  She's a good writer and there's lot of action here but, just not one of this author's best.
