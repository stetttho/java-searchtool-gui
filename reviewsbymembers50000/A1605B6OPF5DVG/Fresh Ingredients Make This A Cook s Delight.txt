 From start to finish, I found this a very entertaining and quick read.  California cuisine has long been known for its innovations.  In "Dim Sum Dead", we have a caterer who takes great care to appeal to the tastes of all the guests while she's actively snooping and questioning them.  What chutzpah! At first, I wanted to read this book solely to see if the Mah Jongg referred to in the description was the Mah Jongg I'm familiar with.  I play in a regular weekly game.  There are some differences between Farmer's description of how the game is played and how it's actually played but, this didn't diminish my enjoyment of the book.   Although I enjoyed the Mah Jongg references, there was so much more here.  The menu ideas were terrific.  We also have a romantic element as well as a mystery and a murder to be solved.  Madeline is sure one sharp cookie and a most persistent sleuth.
