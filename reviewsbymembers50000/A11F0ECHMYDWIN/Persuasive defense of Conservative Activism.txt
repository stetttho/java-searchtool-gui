   Ralph Reed's "Active Faith" is effective in refuting the attacks against Christian Conservative "activism" (i.e. speaking out about issuses just as all other Americans have the right to do) that seem to be on the rise recently (especially after the re-election of President Bush). For that reason, the book is timely, even though it was written about a decade ago.  Reed's critics may not like him any better after reading his book, but his fair minded critics would have to give him credit for being much more fair and thoughtful than those who demonize Reed and other "activist" Christian Conservatives would have us believe.
