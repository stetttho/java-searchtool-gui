    I haven't read all of the other reviews of "Jaws", so I don't know if there's any praise to be heaped on this movie that hasn't been covered yet, but here goes anyway.  "Jaws" is one of the true great "monster movies" ever made - it may be the best of the genre since "King Kong", and it hasn't been surpassed.  The really great thing about this film is how laughably terrible it could have been (just look at all of the ripoffs that followed - even the "Jaws" sequels after "Jaws II").  Somehow, though, everything fits together, from the strong performances from every actor involved (except for Bruce the mechanical shark,), to John Williams' score (I've heard that Spielberg laughed when Williams first played the score for him, thinking Williams was joking, but those couple of notes are as scary in their simplicity as the "Psycho" score).  I'm sure this film is constantly dissected in filmmaking classes - even as a casual viewer, I catch something new every time I watch it.  "Jaws" is a textbook example of effective moviemaking, and a great rollercoaster ride of a movie.
