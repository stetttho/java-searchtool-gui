    Ask a fan of John Hiatt's about their favorite Hiatt CD, and there's probably a 90% chance he or she will pick one of the "trilogy" - "Slow Turning", "Bring the Family", or "Stolen Moments".  These are all great albums, but the argument could be made that "Perfectly Good Guitar" is Hiatt at his best.  Hiatt always infuses his songs with a sense of fun even when singing about the pitfalls of life, but he really seem to cut loose on this album with some terrific guitar work and some of his most clever lyrics.  The title song is one of Hiatt's best - a rock anthem that would be rated with "Born to Run" and other legendary rock songs if Hiatt got the credit he deserves.  This is as good an album as any to pick for an introduction to Hiatt - his clever lyrics will captivate "newcomers" and leave them wanting more.
