      "Operatives, Spies and Saboteurs"  is most likely not the most detailed or comprehensive work describing the contributions of the OSS to the war effort, but it is valuable and entertaining.  Any record of the firsthand experiences of WWII veterans is, of course, extremely valuable.  The effort O'Donnell put into recording such experiences shows through clearly, and O'Donnell presents the stories of the OSS agents he interviewed in an entertaining, highly readable manner.  "Operatives, Spies, and Saboteurs" is a fine overview of the OSS, and a much appreciated record of the firsthand experiences of some "unsung heroes" of WWII.
