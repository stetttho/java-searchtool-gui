   John Hiatt's music has always been a little difficult to categorize, and this may be one reason he hasn't received the attention he deserves over the course of his career.  If Hiatt was overly concerned about this, he wouldn't have released "Crossing Muddy Waters", with its unusual blend of musical styles.  Fortunately, Hiatt seems to value quality work over huge commercial success, or we'd have missed out on a spectacular album.  I don't think there's a weak track on the CD, from the driving opening track "Lincoln Town" and the haunting title track, to the uplifting final track "Before I Go". The acoustic "format" isn't that far removed from some of Hiatt's other work, but it is somewhat of a switch, and Hiatt handled it masterfully.  One of the best albums from a guy who always delivers!
