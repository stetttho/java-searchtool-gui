   In a halloween episode of "The Simpsons", Lisa is reading Poe's "The Raven" to Bart.  When she gets to the part where the poet opens his door to find "...darkness there, and nothing more..."  Bart chimes in "You know what's scarier than nothing?...ANYTHING!!".  My point? I wish the creators of "The Blair Witch Project" were Simpsons fans.  I understand the idea that "less is more" can work well in horror films.  Hitchcock was a master of the concept, and even mediocre monster films don't show the creature for at least the first half of the movie.  But a corollary (sp?) to "less is more", could be "nothing is still nothing", and that's just about what "The Blair Witch Project" offers.  To be more accurate, it's hard to care whether there is somthing out there or not after 70 minutes of 3 people walking in circles swearing at each other.  There are some nighttime scenes that approach being mildly creepy, but then the sun comes up, and the foul-mouthed wanderings begin again, with no promise of any attack by a blair witch, serial killer, or hungry cougar to end the pointless trek.  In addition to these problems, one has to remember a throwaway line of dialogue from early in the film to understand the ending, if one even cares by then.  I'm hesitant to give negative reviews, and I do give the creators of the film credit for an orginal idea, and for trying something different, but in my opinion, "The Blair Witch Project" just doesn't deliver the thrills and chills promised.
