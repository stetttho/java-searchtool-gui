    M. Night Shyalaman seem to be, to use a horrible cliche, a victim of his own success.  "The Sixth Sense" was such a tremendous success, expectations are ridiculously high for Shyamalan's other efforts.  This is at least part of the explanation for the horrid reviews some give "Unbreakable", which I feel is well written and well acted, with an ending that caught me more off guard than the twist ending of "The Sixth Sense".  The idea of a whole film dedicated to a character's discovery of his extraordinary powers (as opposed to covering that ground in 10 or 15 minutes) is clever, and Shyamalan handles the premise brilliantly.  Bruce Willis again turns in a strong performance, and Samuel L. Jackson is excellent as well.  There are some powerful scenes in "Unbreakable"- the hospital scene is excellent, and the staircase scene proves that Shyamalan is a film student who took his lessons to heart.  Just as "The Sixth Sense" is a ghost story that's ultimately not about the ghosts, "Unbreakable" is a superhero story that, in the end, isn't about super powers.  Another excellent film from Shyalaman.
