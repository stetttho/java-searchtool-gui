   There seems to be a movement in the US to silence any political opinions that are informed in any way by religious faith, especially if that faith is a Conservative version of Christianity.  Those who would silence people of faith from speaking out politically may be a very small group, but their numbers may be growing, and they will certainly become more vocal as President Bush begins his second term. This is one of the key issues Reed addresses in "Politically Incorrect", a book that is timely in many regards even though it was written about a decade ago.  Reed points out that the great social movements of the last few centuries had a strong religious dimension, and in many cases were spearheaded by persons motivated by their religious faith.  Reed goes on to lay down a common sense prescription for some of the ills he sees in society, and effectively argues that the right to pursue these goals should not be denied to people simply because they are guided in part by religious faith.  Some humor inserted somehow would have been welcome in Reed's work, but his book is otherwise a solid effort worthy of the reader's time.
