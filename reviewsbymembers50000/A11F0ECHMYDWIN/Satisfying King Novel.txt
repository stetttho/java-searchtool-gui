    "Bag of Bones" is one of Stephen Kings more satisfying works. There are plenty of the frightening scenes one expects from a King novel- so many, in fact, that it just about matches "The Shining" for scary moments.  In addition to the usual scares, "Bag of Bones" offers more emotion than some of King's other works.  The main characters are more "fleshed out" than those in some other King novels, creating a real concern for the protagonists, and a genuine wish for the villains (the flesh and blood ones, at least) to meet a fitting end.  The plot of the story is simple enough at first -  a writer is drawn to an almost forgotten vacation home following the unexpected death of his wife - but again, King offers more in this novel than in some of his earlier works.  There are plenty of twists as the main character investigates unanswered questions about his wife's behavior just before her death, falls for a young single mother, and faces the dangers that confront him as he draws closer to the truth.  I believe Stephen King to be an underrated author (underrated by the critics, at least), and "Bag of Bones" clearly shows the talent that some overlook or refuse to recognize.
