      Tony Hillerman is such an accomplished writer, it's understandable that some reviewers are somewhat disappointed by this effort.  Hillerman does an excellent job of presenting details of American Indian culture without resorting to the preachy tone some "politically correct" authors would use, and these details are missed in this novel.  This novel also seems to lack some of the plot twists of some of Hillerman's earlier works-it winds up reading more like a straightforward crime story than the mysteries Hillerman has created in the past. These criticisms aside, I enjoyed the novel.  It's a quicker read than some of Hillerman's earlier works, yet it still throws in a couple of twists. The characters Hillerman has created are interesting, and it's enjoyable to read another novel involving them.  In short, the novel has its faults, but on balance I enjoyed it, and I look forward to reading Hillerman's new novel soon.
