     "The Cruelest Miles" is an excellent recounting of an incredible race to save the citizens of Nome in the mid-1920's.  The Salisbury cousins do an admirable job of covering the sled-dog relay, and relating the dangers involved in the relay.  Since the story of the relay, while compelling, is a relatively quick one to recount, the authors "fill-in" with some Alaskan history - especially that of Nome - and with descriptions of how the natives of Alaska survived in such a seemingly harsh environment.  The political machinations that went into deciding how to deliver the serum (by plane or by sled relay) are also thoroughly covered.  "The Cruelest Miles" is a fitting tribute the heroic men and dogs who helped to save Nome.   (Special thanks to the reviewer who actually met Leonhard Seppala - great review!)
