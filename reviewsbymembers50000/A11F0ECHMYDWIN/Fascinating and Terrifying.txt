      "The Hot Zone" reads very much like a Michael Crichton novel, but the horrifying events it describes are all too real.  Richard Preston graphically describes the effects of the ebola virus on the human body, traces the discovery of the different strains of the virus, and recounts a terrifying close call with the virus that took place on the outskirts of Washington D.C.  Preston's style of writing may be a bit melodramatic for some subjects, but given the horrific nature of ebola, the dramatic tone seems appropriate.  I disagree with some of the "our place in the universe" comments by Preston and some he interviewed for the book, but this doesn't detract from the effectiveness of the book.  This book is not for the squeamish, but highly recommended for those interested in the subject.
