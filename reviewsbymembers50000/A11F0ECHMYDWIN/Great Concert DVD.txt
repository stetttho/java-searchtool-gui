     Simply put, this is a great concert DVD.  The concert itself is great in terms of lighting, sound and song selection.  Most Phil Collins fans can probably name a few omitted songs they would like to have seen included, but overall the song choices are an excellent overview of Collins' solo career.  The extras alone are worth the purchase price of the collection.  The bonus features include a decent, if incomplete, collection of Collin's videos, some live footage of previous performances, a network special to promote the "But Seriously" album, and an amusing sketch in which Collins introduces the "behind the scenes" staff of the concert tour (it's neat that Collins goes to this length to salute these staffers).  These extras sold me on a concert video I wasn't sure about purchasing. All in all, this concert video is a great value that will appeal to even casual fans of Phil Collins' solo work.   One technical note, in reply to another reviewer - the pause feature doesn't work on my DVD player either (I also have a Sony player), and unless I'm missing something, neither do the "extra angles" featured on some of the songs. And like that reviewer, this is the first time I've encountered this.  A relatively minor incovenience - just thought I'd reply to the earlier comments.
