    You'd be hard pressed to find a book more packed with fascinating information that Warner Shedd's "Owls Aren't Wise And Bats Aren't Blind".  Each chapter provides a concise description of the characteristics and habits of a particular animal (or family of animals), and, as the book's subtitle suggests, debunks some common myths about North American wildlife.  Shedd's writing style is earnest and straightforward, and is perfectly suited for this type of book. Shedd deftly addresses controversial issues in a reasonable manner, and imparts a wealth of information about some common wildlife.  A chapter on snakes would have been welcome, although I'm sure a discussion of the myths surrounding snakes would fill an entire book on it's own.  This is an information packed book that has appeal for a wide age range.
