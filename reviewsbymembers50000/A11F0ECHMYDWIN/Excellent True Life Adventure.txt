    You'll have a hard time finding a work of fiction more packed with suspense and plot twists than Robert Kurson's gripping true life adventure.  Kurson masterfully relates the tale of the discovery of a WWII U-Boat off the New Jersey coast, and the obsessive quest of a group of "extreme divers" to determine it's identity.  The search claims lives early, but the quest for answers continues. As the clues lead only to more confusion, the divers take greater risks, until 2 divers take a huge gamble in a "last ditch" effort to find the answers that elude them.  Kurson's writing style is richly descriptive, whether he is describing the individuals involved in the search, or relating the sensations and perils of diving to extreme depths.  I came to feel for the divers described, even as I shook my head at the risks they took to fulfill their quest.  Kurson provides a brief but gripping history lesson regarding the U-Boat attacks off the U.S. coast during WWII, a graphic overview of the perils of deep sea diving, and a haunting story of friendships marred by tragedy but cemented by devotion to a dangerous but rewarding pasttime.  "Shadow Divers" has received excellent reviews, and it deserves every word of praise it has received.
