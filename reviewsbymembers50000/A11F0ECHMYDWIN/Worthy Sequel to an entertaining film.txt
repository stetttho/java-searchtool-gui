   "Shanghai Noon" was a surprisingly entertaining film - surprising because of many elements that should have been distracting but somehow worked.  "Shanghai Knights" follows the same formula to a large extent, and the result is a film that is at least as funny and entertaining as the original.  The chemistry between Owen Wilson and Jackie Chan is still present. Wilson is again funny as the goofy half of the team, and Chan's martial arts displays are as mesmerizing as ever.  The writing is clever (setting the sequel in London was quite creative), and the supporting cast is solid, in some cases making the most of some limited screen time.  "Shanghai Knights" is at least as entertaining as the original, and I hope the rumors of a third entry in the series (entitled "Shanghai Dawn", by some accounts) are true.
