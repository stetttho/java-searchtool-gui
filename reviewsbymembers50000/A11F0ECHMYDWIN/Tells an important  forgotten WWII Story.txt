    Michael Gannon meticulously documents an underreported element of our nation's involvement in WWII.  It's amazing that more hasn't been written about the attacks by German U-boats along the US east coast, but Gannon's book seems to be one of only a relative few that documents this aspect of the war.  The most striking fact that sticks in my mind from this book is how slow the U.S. was to react to the attacks, finally taking measures against the attacks only after constant prodding by British intelligence, which was, by Gannon's account, much more advanced in tracking U-Boat movements, and quite willing to share this information with the U.S. despite the stubborness of some in the U.S. command.  Gannon's suggestion that the U-Boat attacks were more damaging to the war effort than the Pearl Harbor attack is provocative, and seems to underestimate the emotional impact of December 7th, but Gannon clearly shows the heavy damage the U-Boat attacks had on the war effort until the U.S. command did its part to repel such attacks.  All in all, a worthy effort to document an under-reported aspect of the WWII struggle.
