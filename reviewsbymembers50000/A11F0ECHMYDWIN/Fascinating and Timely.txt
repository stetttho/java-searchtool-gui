    Gina Kolata's "Flu" is a concise book packed with information about the 1918 flu pandemic, later efforts to study the virus by finding preserved samples of the virus, and the chances of such a virus spreading again.  Kolata vividly relates the tragic toll of the virus in the midst of an already devastating World War.  Her description of the controversial decision to try to obtain preserved specimens of flu infected tissue from the arctic may be the most gripping part of the book - it's a well told real life adventure with real consequences.  Finally Kolata moves to a disturbing but timely discussion of later outbreaks of the virus, and the implications they hold for another outbreak of the magnitude of the 1918 tragedy.  This is a disturbing but important and informative work, as well as a fascinating read.
