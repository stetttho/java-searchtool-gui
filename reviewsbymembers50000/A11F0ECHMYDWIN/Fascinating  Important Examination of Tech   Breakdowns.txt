     "Inviting Disaster" contains some riveting discussions of some famous (and not so famous) technological disasters and their causes.  In many chapters, Chiles describes one "system failure" (a cold euphemism, perhaps, but fittingly broad for the range of accidents Chiles discusses), and then moves to one or more earlier incidents to draw parallels between the two disasters.  This technique is for the most part effective in showing how various persons involved with complex systems can learn from past mistakes and oversights, and in showing the consequences of, among other things, not heeding these lessons. One of Chiles' main points seems to be that complex "systems" generally fail because of several small flaws, oversights, or acts of ignorance or carelessness that "align" in just the right pattern to create a tragic situation.  It is disturbing to think about such seemingly small things as the wrong size bolt, seemingly slight imperfections in building material, or a drowsy employee contributing to some of the disasters described in Chiles' book, but it is also encouraging to consider that a bit more care and attention in the design, building, and operation of complex machines or systems can prevent such tragedies in many situations.  Most of us either work with potentially dangerous machinery in our workplace, or drive a vehicle (arguably as dangerous a machine as any in terms of lives lost to automobile accidents each year) to that workplace.  "Inviting Disaster" provides food for thought, therefore, not just for operators of "complex systems" such as airplanes or oil rigs, but for all of us as we go about our daily routines.
