     The effectiveness of the "Sixth Sense" can in part be judged by the harsh reviews M. Night Shyamalan has received for his films that followed.  All have been entertaining, and effective in some way, but all have fallen somewhat short of the expectations set by this masterpiece of a thriller.  "The Sixth Sense" is superbly written - so much so that figuring out the twist ahead of time in no way detracts from the effectiveness of the film.  Shyamalan is obviously in love with the art of filmmaking - this shows in the film, and even in the deleted scenes featured on the DVD.  The casting in the film is also excellent.  Bruce Willis nearly always turns in a solid performance, but he's excellent in this role.  Toni Collette is great, and Haley Joel Osment deserves special mention. He handles his demanding role in a way few kids could.  "The Sixth Sense" is scary without cheap gimmicks (gore and monster jumping out unexpectedly, for instance), suspenseful without a manipulative score, and ultimately touching without being sappy.  A masterpiece of storytelling!
