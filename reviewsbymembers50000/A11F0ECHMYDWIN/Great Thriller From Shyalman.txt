    In his 2 films before "Signs", M. Night Shyalaman created a ghost story that ultimately wasn't about the ghosts, and a superhero movie that wasn't about super powers.  In "Signs", Shyamalan delivers an alien movie that's, in a sense, not about aliens.  Shyamalan's storytelling techniques are brilliant, something not lost on even those ultimately left cold by the actual story.  Mel Gibson and Joaquim Phoenix turn in solid performances, and the 2 kids are excellent in fairly demanding roles.  "Signs" reminds me of a "Twilight Zone" episode - in fact Shyamalan's storytelling techniques owe more to Rod Serling than they do to Spielberg or even Hitchcock.  Like Serling, Shyamalan weaves a suspenseful and baffling story, and asks us to "suspend disbelief" (as well as overlook some plotholes) and just go along with the ride, promising there's a point worth reaching at the end.  "Signs" delivers on this promise, using a science fiction story to once again make a statement about self-discovery and redemption. (At the risk of seeming preachy, I appreciate the fact that the redemption in this case has a religious dimension - a somewhat gutsy move on Shyamalan's part). "Signs" has more plot holes than Shyamalan's previous 2 films, but overall it's another solid film from Shyamalan.
