    Sly Cooper is a game that could have easily escaped all notice- at first glance it probably looked too cartoonish to some older gamers, and the game play may have turned out to be a bit difficult for some kids.  The game evidently took off though, and its success is certainly deserved, as its a very entertaining gaming experience.  The gameplay is basically "linear" - you run straight through the missions without a lot of side missions - but the graphics are so impressive it seems a bit more complex.  The game looks great, and gameplay is challenging without being maddeningly difficult (with the possible exception of finding some of the bottles).  Overall, this game is well worth checking out, along with its more complex sequel.
