   "The Last Stand of the Tin Can Sailors" is a graphic "blow by blow" account of a WWII battle off the Philippine Coast between a U.S. fleet and a significantly larger fleet of Japanese ships, including two of Japan's largest battleships. Unable to outrun the Japanese fleet, the U.S. sailors attacked with such ferocity that the Japanese believed they were being attacked by a much more powerful fleet.  Hornfischer's account is a graphic account of the horrors of war, and a stirring tribute to the sailors who put themselves in harm's way.  Especially impressive is Hornfischer's list of sources he used in writing "Tin Can Sailors" - this list includes everything from military films from the WWII era to interviews with the survivors of the engagement.  "Tin Can Sailors" is a stirring account of heroism and honor amidst the insanity of war.
