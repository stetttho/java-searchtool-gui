   "You Did What?" is a collection of tales of decisions that were at best foolhardy and at worst disastrous.  Various authors contribute to this work, and the quality of the chapters varies as a result (there are quite a few examples of bad grammar and poor sentence structure throughout the book).  Overall, the book is entertaining.  Different subjects of varied historical significance are covered, from the Trojan Horse debacle and President Harrison's refusal to wear a coat at his frigid inaugural, to the "Heidi Bowl" and the bad career decisions of several TV actors.  This is a quirky book that's rather light on any deep historical information or insight, and the mistakes in writing can be disconcerting. Overall, though, it's worth checking out for some lighthearted reading.
