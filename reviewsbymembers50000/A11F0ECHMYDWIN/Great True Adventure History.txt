     Clive Cussler's adventures that he relates in "The Sea Hunters" are as fascinating as any of the fictional adventures in his novels - at least when one factors in that the "Sea Hunters" adventures are true.  After vignettes that speculate on the likely final moments of a ship or other item of historical interest, Cussler describes the efforts of NUMA to locate these artifacts.  These efforts are alternately dangerous, frustrating, and humorous, and Cussler's descriptions of them are consistently entertaining.  "The Sea Hunters" provides a great adventure read, and also serves as a reminder of some forgotten or underappreciated historical episodes.
