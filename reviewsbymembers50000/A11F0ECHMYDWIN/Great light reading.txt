    Bruce Felton's "What Were They Thinking?" is a breezy examination of Strange laws, bizarre beliefs, and downright crazy ideas throughout history.  There's not a lot of detail in any one description of a bad idea, and I agree with another reviewer that some context may have shed a different light on certain ideas that are presented as off-the-wall, but I feel Felton's effort, on balance, is worthwhile.  This book is intended strictly as light reading, and it fits that bill quite nicely.  A typical story is that of a fellow who proposed blowing up the moon, so that the Earth's tilt would change, resulting in constant springlike weather worldwide. I'm not sure which aspect of the story is more astounding - that someone would come up with this idea, or that others would take him seriously enough to present detailed arguments as to why his idea wasn't such a good one.  "What Were They Thinking" is full of  amusing antecdotes, and is great for some lighthearted reading.
