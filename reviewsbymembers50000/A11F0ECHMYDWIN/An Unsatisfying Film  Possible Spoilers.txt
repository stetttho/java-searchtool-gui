    I'm hesitant to write reviews that are, on balance, negative, but I think a lot of folks will be very disappointed by this film.  I've heard it compared to "Jaws", and I feel that this is an insult to a classic thriller.  The film is also frequently compared to the "Blair Witch Project", which I feel is more accurate, since, in my opinion, both films fail to deliver the thrills promised.  "The Blair Witch Project" was a clever idea for a film, that was in many ways poorly executed.  One could argue the opposite about "Open Water", since the questionable idea to show a couple floating in the ocean for about an hour was presented as well a possible - the result is the same, however.  The film also suffers from what I feel was a grossly inaccurate marketing campaign. If memory serves, the TV ads and trailers showed almost nothing but sharks, but they also show every shark scene in the film.  This was a mistake, given that the film ultimately doesn't derive its suspense or impact (what little suspense and impact there is) from shark attacks.  Again, I'm hesitant to give out negative reviews, especially given the unique challenges involved in making this film, but my opinion is that "Open Water" simply doesn't deliver what it promises.
