    In "The Bedford Boys", Alex Kershaw gives a human face to the anonymous soldiers we've seen killed in countless WWII films.  I had forgotten that the story of the Bedford soldiers was at least part of the inspiration for "Saving Private Ryan", and I agree with the implication made by some other reviewers that the true story would have made an even more powerful film.  "The Bedford Boys" is touching, upsetting, and, when Kershaw describes the tribute finally paid to Bedford's fallen heroes, ultimately uplifting.  Without suggesting that the U.S. should not have participated in WWII or the D-Day invasion, Kershaw dramatically points out the sacrifices that have been made by soldiers, their loved ones, and their entire communities to protect freedom in this country, and around the world.
