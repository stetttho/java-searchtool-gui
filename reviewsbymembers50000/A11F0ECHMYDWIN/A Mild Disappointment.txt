   "Men in Black II" is by no means a bad movie.  There are plenty of amusing moments in the film, and some creative ideas (such as the entire society living in a bus terminal locker).  Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones are two of the most watchable actors performing today - they both have versatility, and make their craft look almost effortless.  The main problem with the film is that much of it seems to consist of rejected ideas from the first film - again, some funny ideas, but ones that didn't quite make the original cut.  The cast seems to be just "going through the motions" for much of the film, and that lack of inspiration seems to extend to the writing, and even some of the "creature creation" that was done so well in the original film.  "Men in Black II" is amusing at times, but falls well short of the original.
