    Over his astounding career, Ray Bradbury has proven himself to be equally adept at creating mind-boggling and thought provoking science fiction (I dread seeing how Hollywood will ruin "A Sound of Thunder" - it's on of my favorites), and relating intimate tales of everday life and relationships.  "The Cat's Pajamas", which spans about 60 years(!) of Bradbury stories, is a quite satisfying testament to his versatility.  There may be few "stand-out" stories in this particular collection, but most of the offerings are solid and enjoyable.  Whether describing human encounters with a race of intelligent and kindly aliens who happen to be giant spiders (guess who the "real monsters" turn out to be!), or relating a debate between a man and woman over who will claim a stray cat, Bradbury proves once again he's among the best at writing compelling dialogue and weaving a fascinating narrative.  I especially  appreciate the way Bradbury tackles prejudice of all types with clever allegory or gut-wrenching irony, without being preachy. This worked for Rod Serling when he tried to deliver a message in "The Twilight Zone", and it works to even greater effect for Bradbury.  "The Cat's Pajamas" is a fitting retrospective of an amazing career.
