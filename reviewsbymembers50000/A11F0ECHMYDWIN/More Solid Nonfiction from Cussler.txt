    "The Sea Hunters II"  follows the same pattern as "The Sea Hunters".  Cussler presents a vignette that describes or speculates on the final moments of a ship or other artifact, and then describes the efforts of NUMA to locate the item in question.  This combination of forgotten history and adventure is well written, and is easily as entertaining as Cussler's excellent fiction.  Cussler approaches his subject matter with just the right touch of reverence for those souls lost in the wrecks he describes, along with a great sense of humor regarding his recovery attempts that did not go as planned.  I hope a "Sea Hunters III"  will be in the works at some time!
