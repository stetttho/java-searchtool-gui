   I was under the impression that "Sly Cooper and the Thevious Racoonus" failed to find a niche, since it was a bit difficult for kids, and a bit too cartoonish for older gamers.  Happily, I must have been wrong - "Sly 2" is as fun as the original, with some added dimensions that add to the entertainment value of the game.  The game is more "open-ended" than the original.  In each level, several missions are presented - usually a couple for each of the three controllable characters - and you can choose the order in which you tackle the missions.  The use of 3 characters, each with his own strengths and weaknesses, is of course new, and in general it's an improvement, although it can be more difficult to get Murray and Bentley to certain places than may be necessary.  The graphics are great - if anything, they're a slight improvement over the fine look of the original.      My only complaint about the game would be the repetitive nature of some missions.  At times it in necessary to do the same thing 5 or 6 times, which can make the mission rather tedious. All in all though, Sly 2 is a worthy sequel that has apppeal for gamers of all ages.
