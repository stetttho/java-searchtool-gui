    The amazing thing about "Shanghai Noon" is that nothing in this film should work, from the pairing of Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson (although both are highly entertaining performers), to the modern rock songs that seem to pop up every 10 minutes or so.  These thing do work, though, and they help to make this an excellent comedy western.  Jackie Chan's martial arts exhibitions are mesmerizing as always, and Owen Wilson is great as the goofy counterpoint to Chan's earnest character.  The plot is somewhat thin, but clever enough, and all in all, the film mines a lot of entertaining moments from the tired fish-out-of-water and "buddy movie" genres.  Surprisingly good chemistry between the leads, a solid supporting cast,and clever writing make this a highly entertaining film.
