 As a diehard Beckett user, I was hesitant to buy this guide. If you are looking for the price guide most stores will go by, subscribe to Beckett's magazine. If you want a book that will list all of the regional, food issue and oddball sets, buy this instead of Beckett. I collect Red Sox cards and had nearly 100 cards that I could not identify with the Beckett, even after combing through the book page by page. I bought this book because I needed info on minor league team sets, and to my delight was able to identify all but 3 card sets! This book was well worth the purchase! The only drawback is that the majority of minor league sets are identified by team name, manufacturer and number of cards in the set. I would like to know who was in each set so I can identify minor league cards of former Red Sox as managers, but the size of this book definitely prevents this. This book is huge compared to Beckett, a result of the additional sets and information provided. I'll stick with the Standard Catalog from now on, until someone produces a complete checklist of Red Sox cards!
