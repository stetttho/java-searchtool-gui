 Roger Zelazny has always been my favorite author, ever since I discovered the original Amber series sometime around 1977. I find most of his work to be consistently incredible, and "Italbar" is no exception. On the other hand, "A Dark Traveling" has always seemed to me to be substandard Zelazny. It's almost like he started to write what could have been a great story, then stopped after he jotted down some ideas and cleaned up a rough draft. The ending is definitely rushed. If you haven't read Roger Zelazny, you should read one of his other novels first. Once you see what the master did on a consistent basis, you'll have a better understanding of how this one story falls short.
