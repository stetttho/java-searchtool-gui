 I wasn't expecting much, but tried this out because I like John Cusack and Ray Liotta. WOW! What a surprise! This movie keeps you enthralled from the opening scene to the shocking revelations near the end. The deleted scenes actually added to the movie. This is the type of movie that justifies owning a DVD player instead of a VHS player. If you liked "The Sixth Sense", you will love this movie!
