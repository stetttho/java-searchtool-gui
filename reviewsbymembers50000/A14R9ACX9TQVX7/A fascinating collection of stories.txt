 A fantastic book! I bought this for one of my sons for Christmas, along with several other more print-oriented books. I'm not a diehard fan of books in comic format, but as I reviewed this upon arrival I was delighted to discover the depth of information provided. The wide variety of characters, the great expanse of historical periods covered and the different "genres" of loser subjects proved much more entertaining than I expected when I bought this book. Consider this one of the classier bathroom readers for the entire family!
