 I picked this up for a holiday stocking stuffer, and decided to keep this one for myself! The book is small, like the old Garfield collections, but a heck of a lot funnier! The strips cover decades of Beetle Baily and Sarge humor, and the figure draws attention from anyone who walks by my desk. Great novelty gift!!!
