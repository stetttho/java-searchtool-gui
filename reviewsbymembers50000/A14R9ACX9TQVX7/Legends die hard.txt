 I expected this book to be about four baseball legends in the twilight of their lives, reflecting on their friendship while on a road-trip to see one of their dearest friends in his final hour. (Sounds like a chick flick!) That's nearly half the book, with the other half being the author's summaries of the four Red Sox legends' lives and careers. I'm a die-hard Red Sox fan and I read everything about them I can, but after a while all of the new books become repetitive. This book offers insight into the personal lives, thoughts and even childhoods of the four legends of Beantown baseball. This makes the book an invaluable addition to anyone's collection if you love baseball, team sports in general, or male bonding. (The author even squeezes in some fishing stories!) However, it's definitely a guy book, not the sort of thing you'll find on Oprah's book list.
