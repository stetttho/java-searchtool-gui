 I really expected to enjoy this book, but I was severely disappointed. Understandably, George Lopez had a rotten childhood. In the first half or so of his autobiography, he constantly reiterates this point repeatedly, to the point where the reader stops learning anything new and, at least in my case, dreads reading the next paragraph. Toward the end of the book, Lopez switches from whining about his rotten childhood to constantly pointing out his belief that he is God's gift to Latinos. He also goes into great detail about his self-belief that he is a major talent as a golfer, as well as an infallible comedian. However, his "hard look" at his life never dwells on any of his faults or mistakes. He briefly mentions getting caught in school with pot, but says he only had it because someone gave it to him before school and he had nowhere else to put it. Lopez mentions a problem in his marriage that causes his wife to give up on him and kick him out of the house, but he softcoats the entire episode. (Reading between the lines, it appears he had at least one extra-marital fling, but he doesn't want to take a "long, hard look" at whatever the problem was.) Between his whining about his childhood and his acceptance as the greatest thing to ever happen to Latinos and comedy, I found George Lopez' book to read more like a psychiatric session for him than an open and honest revelation to his fans. If you must read this book, I strongly recommend checking it out from your local library before committing your own hard-earned money.
