 This book, and its companion volume, are great additions to anyone's library. Children are drawn to comic books, and it never hurts to encourage kids to read on their own. The stories are a bit simplified, but that's actually a plus. The stories stick to the main point, and anyone interested in the stories after reading this can go to a standard bible for further information. For those who do not "support" the bible, the stories are still captivating, filled with drama, heroes and villains, adventure and challenges. Parents may want to scan the books before letting their children read them so they can see what's inside, but these stories are harmless entertainment and the children may end up better people for reading them.
