 I share the opinion that this is one of the best fantasy series of all time, and the first storyline comprises my favorite storyline of the last few decades.  I waited months for this collection, and the story is  certainly worth the wait.  However, before buying this book you need to be  aware that the type is rather small, which in my case is a significant  point for consideration when deciding to buy a book of this size.
