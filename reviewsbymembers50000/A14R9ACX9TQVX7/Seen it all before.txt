 The "final" Lector movie focuses on Hannible living in Italy, where a greedy cop recognizes him and attempts to collect the reward for his capture. Watching this scenario play out, I got the impression I was supposed to sympathize with Hannibal Lector, not with the people trying to trap him. I would think that felons on the FBI's 10 most wanted list would be more recognizable in public, but Lector has no problem going through airport customs or mingling with Italian police. Julianne Moore's version of the Starling character was okay, but lacked the "scared rabbit" element Jodie Foster used so effectively in "Silence". Overall, this movie lacks the suspense and the tight scripting that made the first two stories to captivating.
