 Bill Bryson's account of his trip to Australia is fantastic! He travels the country, sharing fascinating tidbits of history in every location he stops in. This book was about 98 percent as entertaining as "A Walk in the Woods", although that book is still my favorite travel book of all time. Still, after reading this book, if I had the money and the time, I'd go to Australia tomorrow with this book as my guide!
