 I bought this book because the premise seemed clever. However, the concept that develops as I read this book, that of dinosaurs deciding to live disguised as men after mammals first appeared on the planet, is just too ludicrous for me to suspend my belief. As for the description of the human disguises, with all the clamps and harnesses that are needed to pull off the masquerade...it just doesn't work, especially the part about the tails.  The story itself was an okay mystery, but this is one of those books that you should check out from the library if you feel you must read it.
