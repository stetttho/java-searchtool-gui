 I had never heard of this series before I stumbled across this graphic novel collection while looking for Christmas presents for one of my sons. This is an excellent story that succeeds in drawing the reader into the lives of the characters, and leaves you wanting more at the end. The artwork is simple, but effective. A great effort all around!
