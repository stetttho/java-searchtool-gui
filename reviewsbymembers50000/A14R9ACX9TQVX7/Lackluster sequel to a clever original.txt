 Others have said it first. This sequel does not stand up to the original. I'm not a prude, but there was absolutely no need for the two graphic sex scenes between two of the main characters. They added nothing to the story, so I was left to gather this would be significant somehow in the third volume, if one is forthcoming. The other semi-graphic sex scene between two other main characters fit in well with the dominant member's character as portrayed in the graphic novels, but still did not need to be illustrated.      One of the group turns traitor, and strives to be a partner to the martian jelly-blobs attacking the earth. The martians appear to be trying to wipe out humanity. Why would anyone want to be the sole human left on the planet in this scenario? Just another example of little or no justification for adding a plot twist. I suppose the story's weakness lies in the limited amount of time the creators had to produce this sequel. Either way, I recommend to those who want to read the story, if you must buy it, wait for the softcover trade paperback. The hardcover is just not worth the money.
