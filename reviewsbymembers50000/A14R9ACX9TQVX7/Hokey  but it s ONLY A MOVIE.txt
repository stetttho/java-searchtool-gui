 The DVD caught my eye in a local video store, so I picked it up. I wasn't expecting anything more than 90 minutes of escapist entertainment, and that's just what I got! This movie had some good scenes and some dumb ones, some cheap special effects, some bad lines and some silly sexual content. So did "Return of the Jedi", if you want to get technical. This isn't really even a horror movie. It's more like the old drive-in "B" movies that Elvira built her career on. I certainly wouldn't build a library out of movies of this quality, but there definitely is a certain amount of entertainment value. Consider this what it is, a well-done low budget movie, not a major studio blockbuster. Independent studio creativity doesn't always have to mean art films, after all!
