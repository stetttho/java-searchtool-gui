 I bought this when it first came out, after realizing I hadn't actually read a new Christmas story since grade school. I'm not sure what I expected, but the book is entertaining and the characters are fairly amusing. I'm not a fan of Grisham's more well-known works, but if they aren't your preferred reading material, don't compare those with this book. This story will (hopefully) never be a holiday TV cartoon, but it's worth offering to everyone in the family for at least one read-through.
