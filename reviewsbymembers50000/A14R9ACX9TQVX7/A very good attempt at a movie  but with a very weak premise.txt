 First off, I thought this movie was okay. The acting was fine, and the pace of the story kept it from dragging too much. However, the basic idea is, well...stupid. According to the movie, Japan has a superstition that anyone who is murdered and dies in a way that involves great anger or sorrow (which should cover most deaths) ends up killing everyone who enters the house the death occurred in. If this were actually possible, I have to assume the Japanese government/police would have grown wise to this and torn down houses like the one this story focuses on. If you can accept that no one would ever catch on to this bit of the obvious in Japan, then the movie is enjoyable, to a point. This is one of those "jigsaw" movies that unfold out of chronological order, so you have to pay attention to the entire second half to understand why this particular story is the one being told. If they make a sequel, I hope they address some of the unanswered questions from this movie. (For instance, is the grudge so strong that the ghost(s) would follow someone back to America? Is there a time limit to how long you have to be in the house to justify being killed, like a plumber addressing a leaky toilet?) The mystery continues...
