 The first five-book "Amber" storyline remains my favorite story of all time. This first of three books by J.G. Betancourt attempts to serve as a prequel to the adventures of Corwin, by "introducing" readers to Oberon, Dworkin and the creation of the kingdom of Amber. The writing isn't quite up to Roger Zelazny's standards, but if that standard was easy to reach, Zelazny's work wouldn't really be all that impressive, would it? Betancourt's story suffers from the automatic predictability that comes with all prequels, just like the lack of suspense over what will happen to Anakin Skywalker in the third Star Wars movie. Although Betancourt telegraphs a lot of his plot twists, the story itself is fairly decent, and if you look at this as a regular fantasy story, it's a pretty good story. The book is certainly worth the cover price.
