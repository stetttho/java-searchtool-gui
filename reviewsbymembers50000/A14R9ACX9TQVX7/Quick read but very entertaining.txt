 A very good story that kept my attention.  I normally dislike pure fantasy books, where the author can change "the rules" whenever he or she feels like it. I decided to give this book a try because it was not a horror story, which is something I feel King produces now without any creative energy.  This story used most of the standard cliches of this sort of material, yet kept my attention throughout.  If a sequel is ever written to the last few pages, I'll definitely read that as well. If you are a fan of the never-ending gunslinger novels, you may not like this.
