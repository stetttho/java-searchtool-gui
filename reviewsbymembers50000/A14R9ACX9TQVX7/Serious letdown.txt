 First off, the second in a trilogy almost always sucks, since the director(s) lets the movie "end" in a cliffhanger instead of with an actual ending to the story. This one is no exception. Second, the DVD extras are long, boring babbles by the various people involved with the movie. I couldn't finish a single one of them. Finally, what's missing from the DVD is something that would help us better understand what is going on in the movie. Instead we hear more about what clever projects the directors are planning to get more of our money. I would have like to see bios of some of the Matrix-world characters, or maybe the scene where one of the Zion characters was liberated from the Matrix. How was Zion built? Why is Kung Fu so integral to the plot? Is it representative of some computer program/virus conflict? Sigh. No new information, just babble. There's no reason to buy the DVD if you can get the VHS cheaper.
