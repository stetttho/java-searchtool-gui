 I love Carlin's humor, but it does not translate well in print. Some of the passages in this book are hilarious, but then there are just as many bizarre bits that seem to exist just to fill space. One bit is about an uncle telling his nephew to go to sleep while reminding the boy about previous acts of violence the uncle has committed in the boy's presence. This isn't satire, nor is it humor in any way. It's just foolish. Carlin is a comedic genius, one of the few truly great minds that expose the underbelly of every aspect of America, but parts of this book read like the man has taken a serious blow to the head. I gave this book three stars because Carlin's usual hilarious barbs about American life are always worth the price of admission. However, I couldn't finish reading the book, due to the alarming amount of pabulum the reader is forced to wade through to get to the good parts.
