 I love this movie! It was the second DVD I bought when I decided to upgrade from VHS. If you've seen the movie, you know how good it is. So, why only four stars? Because the DVD format is wasted. There are no extras worth mentioning, meaning there is no true benefit to buying the DVD insteade of the VHS. I would have liked to see something extra to enhance the experience, but the studios just rushed out these pre-DVD movies to capitalize on buyers' spending sprees. Still, the music is so good, it justifies buying the movie in whatever format you own.
