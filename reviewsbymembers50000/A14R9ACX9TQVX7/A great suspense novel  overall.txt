 A great story throughout, which is usually the case with the author's work. His story of dead people walking and the creation of a witch's town is captivating and held my attention from the first page. Then ending was a bit rushed, and seemed a tad weak, but didn't take anything from the story overall. I've enjoyed two other stories from the author, and hope to read others when I get the opportunity.
