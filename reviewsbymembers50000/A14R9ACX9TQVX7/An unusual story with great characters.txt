 I've grown bored of Stephen King. I believe his creativity diminished as his guaranteed sales numbers increased. As a lark, I read two of his Bachman books to see if the creative juices had returned for these stories. I was not disappointed. The story here involves children walking across America as a national contest, with the winner being set for life, and the losers having their lives ended. A bizarre and disturbing story, but well-written with fascinating characters. Anyone above the age of 10 will know who the winner will be after the first page, but all of the characters grab your attention and the way the boys interact will keep you reading. I strongly recommend this story.
