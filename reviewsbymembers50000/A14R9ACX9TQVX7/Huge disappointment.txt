 This movie could have been so much better. The original TV show is ripe for parody, but the script writer(s) failed to make an effort. This movie is nothing but soft porn scenes held together by a minute or so of pointless dialogue. There are a few attempts at humor, but nothing to justify buying or watching this movie. Hey directors, if you're not going to attempt to get your actors to act, you might as well make a XXX film instead. This movie is DEFINITELY not worth the money.
