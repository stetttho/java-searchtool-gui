 Not a bad movie, considering the source. Since it's based off a comic book, you have to ignore the obviously bogus plot twists, like the Army being able to walk into a civilian's house and hold him prisoner, or the general not knowing how to find someone who has left his address on file in the very building the Army has seized control of. The movie is great fun for kids, and the special effects are fantastic, considering the scope of what Ang Lee was trying to accomplish. However, the 3-star rating is not for just the movie. The extras included on the DVD were all junk. I usually enjoy seeing deleted scenes. I can clearly see why these scenes were deleted. The comic book artists' interpretation of the same scene was mildly interesting, but I was bored with the whole thing in two minutes. If you have kids, buy the movie. It's worth the price. Just don't put too much stock in the rest of the DVD.
