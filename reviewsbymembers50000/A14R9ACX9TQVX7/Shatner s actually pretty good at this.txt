 William Shatner's "Captain's Blood" is actually a pretty good read. I was impressed with how he weaves various Star Trek characters in and out of the storyline. He goes out of his way not to slight the fans of any of the various TV shows, except for "Deep Space 9", I suppose. The story itself reads well, with Kirk and his multi-species son getting caught up in a pending civil war involving the two races that make up the Romulan Empire. The "bad guy" is telegraphed a mile off, and the story apparently necessitated Kirk's character making some extremely questionable decisions that, well, were obviously stupid when revealed in the book. I also have a hard time imagining Picard as a physical person, although I suppose he has to be presented this way if the character is going to try to hang at the same level as the eternally scrappy James T. Kirk. Overall, nothing in the book was any worse than what we all saw in the original TV show, and the two Enterprise captains appear practically the same as they did in the movie where Kirk died. Not a bad science fiction book, all things told.
