 This is a pretty good comic book story, but unfortunately, it's not a complete story. It's a collection of the first half of a story. If the original comic series completed the story arc in the first 12 issues, then the TPB should have included all of those issues. Also, too many Amazon reviewers make more of the story than they probably should. This comic is well written and well illustrated, but it is definitely not on the same level as "Watchmen" or the Denny O'Neil/Neal Adams "Green Lantern/Green Arrow" stories of the early 1970s. It's just another comic book story, and this collection leaves the reader hanging at the end.
