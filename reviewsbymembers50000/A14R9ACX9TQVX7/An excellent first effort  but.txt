 I came across this book as I was searching for something to read about Sacco and Vanzetti. Being from Brockton, Mass., the opening setting for the book, I was immediately intrigued. (The story opens in the Brockton V.A., where my mother worked for some years.)     Mr. Brennan does a great job of spinning his story. His depiction of growing up Irish in early 20th Century Boston created a world I could easily envision. In a rather original twist, his hero's adventures in WWI were not about blood and glory, but ducking out of work and doing whatever it takes to avoid danger. His tales of bootlegging, of family tension, and of struggling with the decision to do the right thing, regardless of the cost... This was a fantastic read and I look forward to future efforts.    The only problem I had with the book is that Mr. Brennan stated he wrote it to fan the flames of public outcry to overturn the convictions of Sacco and Vanzetti. These two people do not appear in the book until it is half over. Having read the author's intent before buying the book, it kept nagging at the back of my mind until the characters finally appeared. The story focuses on Vanzetti, and presents a rather weak case for his innocence. The main arguement seems to be that Vanzetti was too nice, too self-educated and too peaceful a man to commit murder. Mr. Brennan presents his view that almost everyone wanted these men to be found guilty and ignored evidence that would have vindicated them. While this is certainly possible, it doesn't mean that Sacco and Vanzetti didn't do the crime. The potential evidence presented in the second half makes a weak arguement for reopening the case.    As I've said, it's a great read. It was not the story I expected, but it was definitely a story worth reading.
