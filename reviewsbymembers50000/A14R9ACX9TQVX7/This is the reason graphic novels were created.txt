 This is a fantastic story! I've been reading all of DC's comics since the mid 1960s, and this story brings back so many of DC's horror and mystery characters that every time I turned the page I found myself pleasantly surprised by another old friend. Those readers who are only familiar with the spandex crowd of heroes will not be able to enjoy the full flavor of this story, but the story builds to an outstanding conclusion that puts this story in the same league as the Swamp Thing "Gothic" series about the building battle between Heaven and Hell. By all means, buy it!!!
