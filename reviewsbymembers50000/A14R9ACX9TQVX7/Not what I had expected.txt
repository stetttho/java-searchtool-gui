 After reading "A Walk in the Woods" and "In a Sunburned Country", which were absolutely fantastic, I figured this book was guaranteed to be entertaining. Boy, was I mistaken! Obviously a collection of some earlier work, Bill Bryson shares much more of his personal thoughts and less of the local color that made the other two books such wonderful works. After reading half the book, I put it away. I got the impression that Bryson couldn't accept that the America of his childhood had evolved, and that he refused to find anything worth praising about mid-America today. It's really a shame, because his crankiness is often charming in his other works, but here it just makes me want to tell him to go back to England. If smalltown, USA is your thing, go find a book by Charles Kuralt. He knows how to make the middle states seem appealing.
