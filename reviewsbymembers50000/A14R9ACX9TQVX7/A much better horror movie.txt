 This is Matt Green's second directorial effort, and it's light years ahead of "Severed". The technical work is sharper and the script is much better. Sure, it's a formulaic horror story, but aren't they all, at this point? I picked this up at a local video rental store, and it was worth the $3. I also enjoyed a few of the DVD special features. This is a low-budget horror movie, so keep that in mind when you watch it. Matt, I take my hat off to you. You've done an outstanding job.
