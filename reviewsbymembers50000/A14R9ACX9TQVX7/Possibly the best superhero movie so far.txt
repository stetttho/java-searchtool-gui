 "Spider-Man 2" is a great action movie, one which rises above the usual superhero movie. The acting, the dialog and the camera angles were all great, something that cannot be said for most movies of similar background. The ONLY flaw I found with this movie was with Spider-Man's inability to keep his mask on during the second half of the picture. At one point, I thought everyone in New York would get to see Peter Parker's face in the Spidey suit. Other than that, what more can a viewer say but, "Bring on the next sequel!"
