 Little's imagination really shines through in this book. It's highly entertaining horror. Unfortunately, the actions and the explanations of why no one does anything about them is completely unbelievable, and the ending is a typical Little wrap-up, which means it's rather rushed and hokey.  Still, if you can suspend your belief and embrace the often ridiculous plot developments, which are actually necessary to the story, you'll probably enjoy the book.
