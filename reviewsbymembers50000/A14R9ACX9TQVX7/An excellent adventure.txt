 I thoroughly enjoyed Bryson's account of his attempt to walk the aforementioned path. The telling is filled with fascinating bits of trivia that add to the enjoyment of the trip. Reading this book can inspire people to take up the task. I heartily recommend this book to anyone looking to capture a piece of American life.
