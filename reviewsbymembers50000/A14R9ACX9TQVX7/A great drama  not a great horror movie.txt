 "Saw" is a better movie than most people give it credit for, mostly, I believe, because most people judge it as a horror movie. There aren't a lot of flashy special effects and there is little which passes for gore. Fans of "Halloween" and "Friday the 13th" will definitely consider this a substandard horror movie. However, for those who enjoy watching a theatric puzzle come together, like in "Pulp Fiction" and "Reservoir Dogs", this movie should prove suspenseful enough to keep your attention for the duration. This is one of those movies where you actually have to pay attention to what is going on and what is being said. If you care about the quality of your movies, you'll enjoy this one.
