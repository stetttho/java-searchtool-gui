 I loved "Night of the Living Dead" because it was scary. I loved "Dawn of the Dead" because of the fantastic special effects and the obvious humor/parody. I hate this third movie because it is not scary, it lacks humor and it's just plain stupid. The basic premise is that the government is no longer functioning because the zombies have overrun the country. That's pretty farfetched, to begin with. Then, we learn that an obviously unbalanced doctor is trying to housebreak one of the zombies. Why in the world would anyone do that? Didn't we learn our lessons from pit bulls? This movie used up my tolerance to stupidity by the 30-minute mark. Do not buy it, do not rent it, do not get it on pay-per-view. If you must see it, wait for it to come around on cable. Better yet, go watch something else.
