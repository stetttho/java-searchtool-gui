 I bought this DVD because I lived by the writer/director while he filmed this movie. (In fact, his son and mine were inseparable.) I was curious to see how this would turn out. I still don't know! The plot was completely unimaginative, but that's not a crime these days. However, the lighting was so bad throughout the picture that I couldn't figure out what was happening on the screen. Matt, sorry I couldn't give you a better review, but this really needed some quality checks before you started production.
