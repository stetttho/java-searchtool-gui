 It's hard to give 5-stars to an album by the guy who made "Tip Toe Through the Tulips" a big hit, but this album deserves it.  Many people don't take Tiny very seriously, although if you can believe it, the official website says he took himself seriously.  This is not really a serious album, but who says music has to be serious?  It is great fun and shows what a great talent Tiny really was.  Not everyone will like his singing, as he switches from his beautiful deep baritone voice into a falsetto one and back again in some of the songs.  These songs are great fun and Tiny has his own way of making old standards sound like completely new songs.   Tiny's voice practically "vibrates" at times and while his fans like this aspect, it can irritate some listeners.  I think this album is a real classic and it is very unique; not like anything else out there.  You'll either love it or hate it.  I loved it.
