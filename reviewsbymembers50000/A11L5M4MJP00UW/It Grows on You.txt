 The first time I listened to this, I didn't think much of it.  The more times I listened to it, the better it sounded.  I would call it somewhat subtle and it doesn't just slap you up on the side of the head.  The more I listen to it, the better it sounds.  It is also one of those albums that you can listen to over and over again without really getting sick of it.
