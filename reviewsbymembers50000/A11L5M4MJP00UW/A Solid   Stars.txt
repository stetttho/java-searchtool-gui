 After reading a lot of very negative reviews on this album, I thought I should hate this album, but I love it and it's hard to say why.  Okay, so maybe Avril is sleazy and greasy and seldom bathes, as one reviewer said.  What difference does it make on a sound CD?  Madonna was very slutty and sleazy at times, but she could sing very well and was extremely popular.  Avril can also sing quite well.  Maybe these aren't great songs and maybe it does sound like she is shouting the lyrics at times or that all the songs sound alike or that the songs are somewhat negative.  It doesn't matter; it's still a very enjoyable album.  There is just something about it that makes it better than average  It has some pizazz, which a lot of albums these days don't.  Avril is fully as good or better than the other teenie booper singers like Brittany Spears or Hillary Duff.  I tried to listen to the LET GO album and it just didn't do for me what this one does. Avril has a bit of an edge or roughness to her voice, which doesn't make it as sweet as some of the other young female singers, but I think that's part of the appeal.  No one particular song stands out on this album as better than any other.  One thing that is clearly demonstrated is that Avril can handle slow and fast songs equally well.  Remarkably good effort for someone just starting out.  It will be interesting to see how Avril evolves and whether she improves or just slips into obscurity.
