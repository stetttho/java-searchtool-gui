 Of course the big difference between Volume 1 and Volume 2 is that Volume 1 was all sung in Spanish; Volume 2 is in English. Too often artists release a volume 2 that is just more of the same stuff as volume 1 and not generally as good.  Volume 2 is completely different than Volume 1 and is enjoyable.  In my mind, no particular song stands out, but it's all easy to listen to.  Shakira seems to do her best in her native tongue (Spanish) and her English singing does seem slightly more strained; not quite as natural sounding as the Spanish.  Still she does a more than admirable job in English and this album is better than 90% of the stuff out there.  There aren't a lot of artists who can be a success in music in two languages, so it is is noteworthy that she can pull it off.  It's also somewhat amazing that non-Spanish speakers enjoy her Spanish only albums a great deal, even though they may not understand a word of what she is singing.  I don't think she is any flash in the pan and may have some lasting power, depending on where she goes from here.   Her gorgeous face doesn't hurt either, but you can enjoy her albums a lot without seeing what she looks like. That's not true of some artists who look great on video, but don't hold up as well on recordings.  I haven't yet seen her on video, so I am looking forward to it.
