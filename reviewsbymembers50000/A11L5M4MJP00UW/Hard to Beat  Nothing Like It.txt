 "Ghost of Stephen Foster" is a rather strange song; very hard to describe and the lyrics don't make that much sense, but boy is it ever fun to listen to.  It's the best song on the album. A lot of the zippers lyrics don't make all that much sense if you just read them.  You wonder how they could possibly make a song out of that!  The fact is, I think the zippers could make a song out of anything and make it sound good.  The subject matter isn't all that important.  Katherine Whalen sings on several of the selections and she has a voice like no other; just a few of her vocals are well worth the price of the album. Not that I agree, but some people have been critical of SNZ for sounding, at times, like an amateur band.  Who cares, as long as they are so very, very entertaining and have such a unique sound?   No one in their right mind could call this music boring.  I also own thier "Hot" album and while you can hear some similarities in the sound, this is NOT "more of the same".  It's a different album with different, unique treats to listen to.  Given a choice between one or the other, it would be difficult to pick.  I suggest that you buy both!  The accompanying lyrics booklet is unique too.  It looks like an old flower and vegetable catalog.  Very creative.  When you are tired of hearing the same old stuff, put on a zippers album to hear something fun and different.  This is destined to be a classic if it doesn't slip into obscurity because it is difficult to classify.  That's another interesting thing about SNZ.  They just don't conveniently fit into a specific musical category.
