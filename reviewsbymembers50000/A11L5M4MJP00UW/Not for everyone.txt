 This is a really fun album with a unique bouncy sound.  Some reviewers say it's like swing and not a very good imitation of swing.  Others say it was never intended to be swing or to imitate it.  It doesn't really matter what you call it.  It's very listenable and lots of fun.  If you are stuck in a groove and only like a certain type of music, this might not be for you, but if you are like me and you like all good music, this album is a joy to listen to.  I think I agree with some of the reviewers that it is a mixing of styles and the 'zippers' have their own unique sound.  If you want an album that sounds like every other album out there, don't buy this.  If you want something a little offbeat and different, get this and don't think twice about it, as you will enjoy it.  The album moves along rapidly and it was over with before I realized it.  It sounds like the band is having an absolutely wonderful time playing and aren't worried about perfection.  That makes it much more enjoyable and it doesn't sound over-produced, like so many albums.  It's more like live music; as we all know live is almost always better than recorded.
