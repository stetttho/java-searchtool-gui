 It surprises me how many people loathe this movie.  I happened to really like it because it is a movie of hope, rather than dispair.  The main plot is the re-establishment of mail service after it has stopped, due to a disaster that has left the country split into small communities with no communication between them.  With so much other media available these days, especially the internet, our mail hasn't become as important to us as it once was.  Getting a letter used to be a huge thrill; now all the mailman brings are advertistments and bills.  Everyone uses e-mail now; even grandmothers!  Still, I suspect that if we lost our mail delivery, we would feel the pinch.  A healthy mail delivery system is truly the lifeblood of a strong country.  Does that sound corny?  This movie does get a bit corny, syrupy, sappy and silly at times.  I happen to like this sentimental corny stuff and if you do too, you'll love the movie.  This movie rates high in my book just for the message it delivers.  Okay, so maybe it doesn't "deliver" it the best way possible.  This is escapism and fantasy.  If you analyse it too closely you will find a lot of flaws.  Just sit back and relax and watch and enjoy the movie.  Whenever a movie is so roundly criticized, it is worth a look just to see if you agree or not.  Unfortunately, sometimes you will say to yourself "This was as bad as they said".  Other times you may be pleasantly surprised.  This one may surprise you and it may not.  Maybe with a few minor changes this could have been a much better movie, but I loved it anyway.  Maybe it helped that I didn't recognize Tom Petty. By the way, I liked Waterworld too, but it wasn't nearly as good as this movie.  Am no big Costner fan; sometimes he just seems very blah without much emotion or appeal.  It's hard to identify with him.
