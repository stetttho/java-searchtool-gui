 This is one of the very few Jessi Colter albums available.  Apparently she didn't last long after her quick rise to fame.  Whether it was by personal choice, not enough popularity or poor marketing, I don't know.  In any case, it would be nice if more of her recordings were available (assuming she made them).  I am not sure she made that many albums  A few months ago I only knew her from "I'm Not Lisa", which I still think is her best song.  Jessi has a clean, clear voice and could have probably been a lot bigger (and longer lasting) star under the right circumstances.  One problem I have with this album is that "I'm Not Lisa" seems to be recorded at lower volume than the other songs, so I have to turn up the volume for it and then down again on the next song.  A couple others had slight variations in volume too, causing adjustment of volume a few times between songs.  Otherwise, the recording quality is good; nothing wrong with the sound.  I don't feel that Jessi is the best female singer in country music, but certainly ranks up in the top 50; perhaps even the top 25.  "Storms Never Last" is a song you don't hear often.  It's a beautiful song and I believe Jessi wrote it.  She performs it very well.  Two or three songs on this album are almost worth the price of the album, but there is over an hour of music and it seems like it ends quickly.  I don't like every song here, but there is enough variety to please just about anyone for at least part of the hour and most fans for the full hour.  The cover with the cleavage is a little extra bonus I guess, at least for the guys, but the album would have been just as good without it.  Also have seen better pictures of Jessi and I think they could have come up with a much better picture for the cover that was less exploitive and still showcased her beauty.
