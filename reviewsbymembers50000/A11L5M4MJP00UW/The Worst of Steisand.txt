 Boring, boring, boring.  I don't like Streisand that much, but she did some nice comedies (notably "What's Up Doc?") and some of her albums are pretty good.  I recommend "Memories", which has a lot of good songs on it.  Never saw this movie and after listening to the soundtrack I am glad I didn't.  The only redeeming quality to this album is that Sreisand does a decent job on some of the songs.  Kristoferson is terrible on this album; I am sure he isn't usually as bad as he sounds here, but I have never been a fan of his, so I don't have any of his albums to compare with.  If you want a complete Streisand collection or if you loved the movie, you might want to get this; otherwise I would pass it up.
