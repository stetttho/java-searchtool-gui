 Alan Alda plays a draft dodger who marries pregnant Jenny (Marlo Thomas) to avoid being drafted.  Unfortunately he still seems to be more interested in his former friends and party lifestyle than in his new bride.  Very funny in places, especially when he meets Jenny's parents.  Jenny's father is a dentist and shows off his collection of teeth, which is extremely funny.  It's very dry humor.  Another great moment is when Jenny, feeling very alone and deserted by her new husband who is partying, goes to a bar.  In the bar she meets a geeky creep (a plumbing salesman) who is in town on a business trip and is looking for some company.  It's a great scene with the creep doing most of the talking and Jenny just listening.  The music in the movie is great; I believe Nilsson sings the title song. Too bad they never did a soundtrack album of this.  Charming period piece that never disappoints.  It's a light weight romance, which is not everyone's cup of tea.
