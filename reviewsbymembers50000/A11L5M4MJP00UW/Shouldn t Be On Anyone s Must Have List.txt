 "When They Ring the Golden Bells" is, in my opinion, the best song on the album.  It's one of the few where you can understand most of the lyrics.  My main criticism of this album is that like so many recent popular music albums, you can't understand most of the lyrics.  This whole album has a very murky sound and is in fact worse than many. Due to Merchant's beautiful voice, the album is not a total loss and hardcore fans might want to include it in their collections.  For anyone buying Merchant the first time, Tigerlily is a much better choice.  The album sounds a lot like funeral music, but very good funeral music!  That's not saying much.  I hope Merchant comes out with some better albums; something a little more upbeat next time would be nice. She had too wonderful of a voice to waste on a poor album like this.  If you are into funeral music and depression, by all means, get this album.
