 I don't remember liking the movie that much and hardly remember it, but you can't go wrong with the soundtrack.  This is so very easy to listen to and never boring.  A must for those into soundtracks and for Olivia Newton-John fans.  I never thought of John Travolta as a singer, but he does a more than passable job here.
