 Just for the historical significance alone, this album is worth owning.  The title song was extremely popular and sold over 9 million singles and albums.  It is still very listenable, even though the war it was about was over also 30 years ago. As far as the quality of the music, the Amazon review describes Sadler's voice as thin, stilted baritone. I don't know what that means exactly, as I find his voice clear and smooth and very easy to listen to.  He ennunciates very well and you don't have to read the lyrics to know what he is singing.  Okay, he is not the greatest singer who ever lived, but who cares?  He can sing and does a more than passable job of it.  Those who are anti-war may not like this album much, but mainly it's about a soldier's experiences in the war and isn't really political in nature--at least most of the songs aren't.  Very listenable and enjoyable whether you are a dove or a hawk.   The A team song is a nice bonus track.  Great sound quality.  Well worth owning.
