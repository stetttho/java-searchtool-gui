 I rated this 5 stars, but a couple of caveats.  First of all it seems like most, if not all of these are live performances, rather than done in a studio. Some people prefer pristine studio recordings, rather than hearing an audience. Sometimes I don't like live recordings because there is too much crowd noise or prolonged clapping at the end of each song or the sound quality is poorer.  Not on this album!  The laughs of the audience add to the fun and it is never overdone.  The laughter sounds real; not canned laugher inserted later.  The audience is very receptive and it makes the recording more fun when you hear how much they are enjoying themselves.  The recording is crystal clear, just like it was made yesterday.  Another caveat.  Some of the humor is dated; you would have to know what he is referring to in order to get the joke.  Anyone over 40 will probably get most of the jokes.  This is particularly noticable in one of the songs where he refers to fictious people that were in prominent ads of the day.  Some (like the Jolly Green Giant) are still around, but other gimmicks (such as a Tiger in your Tank--Exxon I believe) stopped running a long, long time ago.  Unless you were around when the advertisements ran, you wouldn't understand the references.  Even with the dated material, there is enough here and enough variety for everyone to enjoy.  This is a great family album and I can't really think of anyone who would not enjoy the humor.  I was chuckling and laughing all the way through the album.  I had never heard most of these songs before, but they are all gems.  The 12 days of Christmas has never been done as funny (or as original) as here.  Sadly Allen died at age 49 in 1973.  Camp Granada is of course his classic song that is still as fresh today as it was when it was written.
