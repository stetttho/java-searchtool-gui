 There are several Armstrong Greatest Hits albums and even an "All Time Greatest Hits", which I also own.  Apparently some of the reviewers are confused because they are mentioning songs that aren't on this album.  This one has 13 songs, which of course doesn't begin to cover all of Satchmo's hits, but compared to All Time Greatest Hits, which has 18 songs, I enjoyed this one much more.  Never was a big fan of Armstrong; his unique voice takes some getting used to.  In spite of that, I found this album very entertaining and do feel that it represents enough of his best hits to really get a feel for what he was all about.  Anyone who appreciates good music should enjoy this album very much.  I believe it was Armstrong when asked about differents kinds of music said: There are only two kinds: good and bad.  Louis Armstrong definately performed the good kind of music.  I particular enjoyed "Do You Know What It Means to Miss New Orleans".  In the thousands of tracks of music that I own, it's the only vocal I have of that song and it's a good one.
