 I can't quite put my finger on it, but this album just isn't as good or as entertaining as other Muldaur albums.  For a top Muldaur blues album, I recommend "Meet Me Where They Play the Blues" or "Richland Woman Blues".  Muldaur has explored several different styles of music, including doing some pretty good children's albums.  She rarely disappoints and this is my 8th Muldaur album.  It is the least enjoyable of all of the ones I have.  I guess every good artist has an "off" album.  I guess this one is Maria's.  In all fairness, perhaps I just don't like this type of blues as much as some of the other styles that she has explored.  For example, Richland Woman Blues is early blues (20's/30's); Meet Me Where They Play the Blues is a tribute to Charles Brown and his style.  Each period or style that Muldaur covers has a somewhat different sound and I guess it depends on your own personal tastes.  In any case, I wouldn't recommend this as a first album to explore Muldaur's talent, as it would be a disappointment to anyone not familiar with her work as a whole.  Not a bad album; just nothing very memorable or that interesting.
