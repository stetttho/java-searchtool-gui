 Cash had such a successful career it would be hard to create a definitive collection of all his best and most important songs, but I think this comes as close as possible, with a single CD.  Sure it would have been great to see a couple more songs.  I would have liked to have seen Orange Blossom Special and Ballad of Ira Hayes.  Everyone probably has their favorites; some are here and some may not be.  Most of the important songs are here (I Walk the Line, Ring of Fire, Folsum Prison Blues and Boy Named Sue to name a few).  Have always liked Johnny Cash, but not a big collector of his work, so several of the songs here were new to me.  Never heard Rusty Cage before and it seems the weakest of all the songs; too much repeating at the end.  The Wanderer (with U2) is not one of the better songs either. Highwayman with Willie Nelson & Kris Kistofferson is a great song, but there isn't much Cash in it.  The first time I listened, I wondered why Willie Nelson was singing in the middle of the Johnny Cash recording, but it was good thing to include the song, as well as the duet with his wife (Jackson).  'Hurt' is a dark and sad song to end the album with.  Something more upbeat would have been a better ending.  Overall, you would have a hard time finding a better variety album of Johnny Cash's work.
