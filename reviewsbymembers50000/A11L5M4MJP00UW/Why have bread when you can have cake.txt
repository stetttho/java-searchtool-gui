 I am reviewing this from the original LP, which I just discovered.  It only has the first 12 songs, so the CD is a nice bonus with 20 tracks.  I can find several reasons not to like this music:  1.) Soft Rock - What's the point?  Might as well listen to Carpenters; 2.) Very boring for anyone who likes good rock music. 3.) Not much excitement here; nothing truly clever,  innovative or memorable.  In spite of the shortcomings, this is mellow, soft rock at it's best.  Nice relaxing music that isn't so relaxing that you fall asleep.  It keeps you just interested enough to keep listening.  It's a smooth and comfortable sound; nothing to assault you, the way heavy metal does.  I know I have heard many of these songs before, but none was familiar by title.  Bread is comfortable and familiar but there are better things to listen to, so you might not want Bread when you can have cake!  Certainly this an album worth keeping when you are weary of hard rock, but most dedicated rockers won't enjoy it very much.  This could be titled "Rock and Roll for those who hate Rock and Roll."  It's truly more of a "Pop" album than a "Rock" album.
