 This album is my first exposure to Dr. John.  This is not really my type of music.  Someone gave me the album.  That being said, it's not too bad of album.  There is plenty of other trash out there that isn't half this good.  The title song "Television" is very listenable and has a nice beat.  "Shut D Fonk Up" repeats a lot and seems kind of stupid. "Thank You (Falletin Me Be Mice Elf Again)" has a cutsy, clever title, but that doesn't help the song, which is just an okay song.  It repeats a lot too, as does Spaceship Relationship.  My feeling in listening to the album was that the "doctor" has a good and unique voice, a good sound and good backup band.  It just seemed like he is capable of a lot better.  Perhaps this is just a poor selection of songs.  Some of the songs seem to be "talked" or "chanted" rather than sung.  That might be your thing; it's not mine.  Nothing really excited or moved me on this album.  I guess that when an artist makes a number of albums, some are going to be hits and some are misses.  This might be a near "miss" for Dr. John.  I would like to hear some of his other stuff, as he seems to have a distintive sound that is not like everyone else out there.  This is not an album that I would listen to often, but a is nice change of pace. My guess is that the good doctor is not trying to be like someone else, but just sings it the way he feels it and the way he wants to.  If you are a hardcore Dr. John fan or looking for something a little different, buy it.  Otherwise, I would pass on this one.
