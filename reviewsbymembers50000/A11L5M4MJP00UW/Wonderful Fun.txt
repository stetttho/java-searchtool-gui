 These are mostly moldy-oldies of course, but Nancy puts a lot pizazz into these songs.  This is jazzy, bouncy fun.  The band is great too, but never overpowering.  There is some humor here too in a couple of the songs.  This is just a rollicking good time and succeeds in many ways.   Probably somewhat different than most of Nancy's stuff.  Worth it alone for the hit "Sugar Town" and the bonus track of "Something Stupid", which is also a great song (duet with her father).  The pink bikini picture is another plus, but I would have bought this album even with a plain white cover.
