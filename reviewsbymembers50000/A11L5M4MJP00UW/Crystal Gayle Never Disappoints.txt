 Crystal Gayle has a great voice and while this album is quite different than her country and pop albums, she does a very good job on most of the songs.  "Stardust" is a difficult song to sing well and while Crystal does a passable job on it, maybe it could have been better.  Everything else sounds wonderful, even though a couple of songs may sound a bit different than the way you might have heard them originally.  That's probably a good thing; Crystal does her own interpretation and it's not the same old tired renditions that you may have heard many times before. For those who like these old songs, you should enjoy this album a lot.  This was unavailable for a while, so if it's back in print, I suggest you snag a copy before it is withdrawn again.
