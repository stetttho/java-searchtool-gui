 I don't think this is the best of Gordon Lightfoot.  I found the songs a bit boring and mediocre.  The performance is good, as Gordon always sings well.  If you are a big fan (I am not), you might want this one in your collection.  If you are new to Lightfoot's music, you might want to start with something else. Still better than a lot of the junk out there, but nothing really special here.
