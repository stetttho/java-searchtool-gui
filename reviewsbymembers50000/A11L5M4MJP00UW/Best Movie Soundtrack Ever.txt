 I hate to say good things about an album that Madonna might make some money from, because I think she is a filthy slut who has used any gimmick she can to make money regardless of the morals.  That being said, I think her singing in this movie is a cut above her popular albums and is highly entertaining.  I saw the movie and enjoyed the music so much that I had to have the album; it's a 2-cd album and I paid more for it than most any other album I have purchased in a long time.  Keep in mind there are a lot of songs on the album that don't have Madonna singing.  The singers may not be the best, but the music is so entertaining that it makes no difference.  The movie had so much dialog mixed with the music that this album could have been a disaster, but they did an excellent job of getting the flavor of the movie and using appropriate amounts of dialog with music.  I think this is one of the best movie soundtracks ever done.  Great editing job and all the songs from the movie seem to be here.  If any were missing, I didn't notice.  Not disappointing in any way.  Worth hearing over and over again.
