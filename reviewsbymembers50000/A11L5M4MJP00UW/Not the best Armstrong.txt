 I didn't find anything remarkable about this album.  It seems that I have heard lots better Armstrong arrangements than what is represented here.  I recommend Louis Armstrong Greatest Hits (RCA Victor) instead, even though it has fewer selections and totally different selections, except for What a Wonderful World.  Even that song is slightly different on the other album.  This is not a bad album and it may claim to have Armstrong's All Time Greatest Hits, but there are better Armstrong albums out there.  Gone Fishin' is a pleasant enough ditty but I don't know that it belongs on this album.  This album is a little disappointing because it could have been so much better.  As one reviewer pointed out a 2-CD album would have been nice and more inclusive of some of the great Armstrong songs.  Where is Basin Street Blues, St. Louis Blues, Mood Indigo and Do You Know What It Means to Miss New Orleans?
