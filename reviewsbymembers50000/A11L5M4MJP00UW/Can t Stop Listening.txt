 First off, this album gives you over 53 minutes of music and 13 songs, which is a bonus over many albums that are only 10 songs, which can run as little as 30 minutes.  This is spicy, spunky music that just sucks you in.  Some of the topics are a little racy and naughty, but is done mostly in a tasteful way (no nasty words or cuss words).  It is hard to describe this album, because it is not quite like the album titled Buster Poindexter.  That's a great album too and some people consider Buster a one hit wonder with Hot, Hot, Hot that appears on that album.  That was probably his biggest hit and there are no big hits on this album.  Nothing stands out in particular, although several of the songs are very catchy.  In spite of that, every song is enjoyable and energetic.  I think that's what makes this album so much fun; it is full of energy; you can hear it and feel it.  It sounds like Buster puts his whole being into feeling the music and sounds like he is partying hard!  The only thing I don't like about this album is that there is a bit too much repeating in a couple of songs (especially Inez).  Be warned that this doesn't really sound like "Spanish" music; some of the songs have Spanish words and some have Spanish topics.  It sounds more Cuban in some ways (like Ricky Ricardo's music).  There is somewhat of a latin beat to some of the songs.  It definately is like a rocketship ride, with a lot of excitement and speed.  Not for everyone, but if you like something spunky, funky and with a good dance beat, this is it!  Too bad this isn't currently available on Amazon, as it is well worth a listen.  Includes a 16 page color booklet with all the lyrics too.  Great accompanying band and backup singers too.  Good crisp, quality sound too; not muddy like some modern albums.
