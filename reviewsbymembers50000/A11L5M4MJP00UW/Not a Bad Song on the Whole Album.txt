 Just like Eddie Rabbit's life, this album was done too soon. My initial reaction to Eddie's music was indifference. He just wasn't interesting enough for me to rush out and buy any of his albums. My music budget was limited and there was always some other more interesting artist that I wanted to listen to. Now that I can afford to fill the holes in my music collection, I wanted this album mainly to help round out my collection, due to Rabbit's place in music history and because it had a few songs that I liked. After listening to the album, I wish I had bought it much sooner. Rabbit was an exceptionally good singer with a great voice and his talent is really showcased well on this album. He had it all; not only a wonderful singer, but also an exceptional songwriter. Kentucky Rain written for Presley by Rabbit is one of my favorite songs. Eddie seemed to have a way with "rain" songs. His "I Love a Rainy Night" on this album will always be a classic and a favorite. The weakest song on the album is "Pour Me Another Tequila", with a little too much repetition, but it still sounds good, as do all the songs. The sound quality seems quite good on this CD too; very crisp and clear. Some CDs have way too much production and over-orchestration. This one doesn't give that impression at all. The accompanying instrumentals do not overwhelm, so you really get Eddie's voice coming through clear and strong. It's clean and simple and for that reason very listenable. I'll be playing this one over and over again. Anyone who doesn't like this album doesn't know good music. It's sad that I didn't really discover Rabbit until after his death. What a great loss to the music world. This is a must have album.
