 For many years I was a classical music snob and didn't pay much attention to rock bands.  CCR was probably one of the first really "rocking" band to win me over to rock and roll.  This is undoubtedly their best album.  I agree with one reviewer that the album cover was cheesy and didn't really reveal how good the contents were.  If you can only own one CCR album, this should be the one.  This is an essential for your collection.  This is good music, even though "I Heard It Through the Grapevine" does get a little tedious before it ends.  A little shorter version might have been a good idea.
