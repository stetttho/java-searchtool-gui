 In listening to this album it seemed to me that Cass Elliot, had she lived longer, might have been even more popular than she was as part of the group the Mama's and Papa's.  It seems to me that she could have been a lot better with time.  Not to imply that this is not an outstanding album.  It is.  She has an amazing voice and the songs are very enjoyable.  More people need to discover this album and what an amazing singer Cass Elliot was.  She was taken from us too soon.
