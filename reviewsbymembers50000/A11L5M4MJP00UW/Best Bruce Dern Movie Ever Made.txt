 Bruce Dern was often cast as a bad guy; after all he was the guy who killed John Wayne (in the Cowboys, I believe).  In this movie he takes on a completely different role, which really showcases his talent and makes you realize that the man is not just great at bad-guy roles, but is an outstanding actor.  This a wonderful satire on the shallowness of beauty pageants and what they are REALLY all about.  It is also very entertaining throughout; much more so than a real beauty pageant!  The casting is absolutely outstanding with all the characters being so believable.  Nice music too with Nat King Cole singing the title song.  The movie has everything including a nice dose of comedy, plenty of drama and a message.  It's as near perfect as a movie can be.  Not disappointing on any level.  Entertaining throughout without being a piece of fluff that so many movies are.  Some nudity, so be warned about that, but it is essential to the plot, unlike some movies where it is unnecessary.  Dern should have gotten an oscar for his role in this movie, but it probably didn't score high enough on the "politically correct" meter.
