 Many groups tried to copy what Herb Alpert did with TJB, but never got it quite right.  According to Alpert, in the accompanying booklet, one reason was because no TJB songs were ever fully rehearsed before entering the studio.  He felt that it made the music sound fresher.  Alpert says he played from the heart; emulators of his played from their heads, copying every note and not putting the energy into the music that he did.  In any case, this is a classic album with a nice variety of selections; something for everyone.  It sounds a little dated, but never really out of style.  Zorba the Greek is worth the price of the album alone.  Whipped Cream and Other Delights is still my favorite TJB album, but this one has to be second.  I salute Mr. Alpert for making trumpting really cool! Sound quality is very good on the album.  Would like to hear it on a BIG stereo system instead of just my little computer speakers.  It would sound even more awesome.
