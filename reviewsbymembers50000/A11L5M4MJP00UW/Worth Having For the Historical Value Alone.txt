 Right up front let me say that I have never been a big Ray Charles fan.  There is something about his style of singing that I just don't care for.  In spite of that, the man had a huge influence on the music world and was a tremendous performer.  This album is a little odd because of the assortment of people with such varied styles, as well as a somewhat strange choice of songs.  The interesting thing is that in most cases it succeeds.  In reading the other reviews, it was apparent that not everyone always agreed on which duets were the best.  That indicates to me that it depends a lot on your own preferences which songs you'll like.  There is something here for everyone.  Ray does sound a little weak and shaky at times, but at his worst he still sounds better than some so-called artists at their best.  I think this is worth having just because it is his last album and due to the uniqueness.  I think that any last effort by Ray Charles would have been disappointing.  After all, when a legend has done it all, it's not easy to top yourself.  Given that Ray was soon to die and knew it, there is still a lot of "juice" left that comes across here.  Most of us are willing to cut him some slack.  No, this is not the spunky Ray Charles of earlier years, but I don't think anyone should or would expect that.
