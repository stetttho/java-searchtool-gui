 There are a couple of clever songs here and the band sounds okay, but frankly I just don't understand how anyone could enjoy this album that much.  In a couple of the songs, it seems that the lyrics are just being screeched or screamed out.  Who wants to hear a bunch of screeching?  Prince (or whatever he calls himself now) is too weird for me and there is so much more good rock music out there that this just isn't worth having in anyone's collection.  Maybe this was hot stuff at the time it came out; I just acquired it recently and after only one listen I am dumping it.
