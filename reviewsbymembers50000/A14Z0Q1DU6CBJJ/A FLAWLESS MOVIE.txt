 I would never dream of comparing anyone to Alfred Hitchcock.  But, David Fincher, comes damn close.  They have a lot of similarities, but the biggest one that I see is the desire to be precise and perfect.   Seven is Fincher's second movie!  His first being an underrated Alien 3.  In his second effort, Fincher crafted, what I think, to be the best suspense/thriller in thirty-years.  Unique.  Gut churning.  Awesomely acted.  Every shot compliments the next.  Every shot is perfect.  The sound track was perfectly thought out.  Like Hitchcock... the script was well-fleshed out, everything was perfect BEFORE HAND, and everything was perfect afterward. In a sess-pool of cookie-cutter "yes" men that are succeeding in the movie business, Fincher emerged and did it his way.  Thankfully, he continues to do it his way.  Following "Seven", he continued to do masterful work with well-written movies like "The Game" and "Fight Club".  "The Panic Room" is coming out soon and I can't wait. It isn't quantity that counts... it's quality.  Fincher takes his time and makes sure it's done RIGHT.   SEVEN.... I think, was and is one the most underrated movies ever.  It will be a classic and is one the best movies ever made.
