 This movie is hilarious.  But bad... hilarious. I found myself bust out laughing at some really weird stuff and I'm not sure if it was intended or not.   This movie will be a perfect candidate for MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATRE 2020.  If you love sitting around with friends and making up anecdotes to go along with the movie and laughing at your own jokes, this is a movie to pick up. I bought it, and I bought it for one reason... CHYLER LEIGH. She won me over in NOT ANOTHER TEEN MOVIE, and I think she has a bright future ahead.  She's a fearless actress who has beauty, innocence and a wild side all rolled into one.  I really just wanted to own it for the nostalgia of it, and I'm pleased with owning it, but to be fair.... THE MOVIE gets 1 star, CHYLER gets 5 stars and it equals to an overall 2 stars... okay, so I'm weird.
