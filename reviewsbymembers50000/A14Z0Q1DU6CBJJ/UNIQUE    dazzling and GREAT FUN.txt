 The second I put SECOND SIGHT in... the images won me over.  The animation is great, but the creators also have a great cinematic sense. A lot of games have really beautiful cut scenes and then it cuts to the game and those beautiful cut scenes are replaced with something lesser... not here. NOT THIS GAME. The cut scenes blend beautifully... the cut scenes are just as pristine and drawn as the images when you're in control.  This is one of... if not the, most engrossing gave I've ever played. It gets you involved. You get drawn into the character and the mystery of who he is and what happened to him. You participate in his present day situation where he is escaping from a hospital and searching for his identity and you also go back to his early military days when he trains with weapons and participates in action as a sniper as a normal military person.  You can heal yourself, make yourself invisible for a certain period of time, eradiate bursts of dangerous and deadly energy, split your body in two as you stay safe somewhere and your apparition goes forward to do tasks... and that's just the beginning.   This game is fantastic. I'm so glad I bought it and I certainly recommend it for anyone who hasn't played it.  No need to rent... for the price that AMAZON has posted here... that's a steal!!  The replay value on this game is great. You'll love it.
