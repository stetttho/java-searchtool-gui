 Wow!  The graphic and true-to-life nature of BULLY may keep it from getting the recognition that it deserves, but it's scarily affective in its delivery. The performances in the movie are oscar-caliber.  Hands down!  That won't be acknowledged, but they are.  No bones about it.  There are some excellent actors here.  Brad Renfro, Nick Stahl, Michael Pitt, Rachel Miner and Bijou Phillips all are fantastic and REAL.   Not to mention, the capable direction of a balsy director like LARRY CLARK, who isn't afraid to do anything.  And I mean anything!   The movie touches on everything you can think of.  The most prevalent being the real life murder.. Also, drugs, rape, porn, abuse, alienation. I don't know if LARRY CLARK is trying to shock people or not, In fact, I'm sure he is; but in the context of the movie, you believe that these kids are into all this stuff.  Because it happens.  It's real.  In fact, that's the scariest part of it.  I challenge everyone to watch the movie and see if they can't find someone in it that reminds them of someone they might know. The movie is disturbing.  And it's supposed to be.   As the friends all discuss the plan.  Back and forth.  Back and forth.  Arguing with each other.  Showing their immaturity.  It's gut churning.  Knowing what they're planning.  Thinking of what they want to do.  What they're gonna do.   Yet, never thinking of what might happen afterward.  How many teenagers do we know like that?
