 I usually do like asian movies for a lot of reasons and KISS OF THE DRAGON is better than most. For one, contrary to the junky junk action movies that most Hollywood Directors slap together, you actually care about the characters in asian films.  They're more character driven and real. KISS OF THE DRAGON falls right into that line.  Excellent characters.  JET LI has matured as not just an action star, but an actor.  And what could possibly be said to give justice to BRIDGET FONDA!  I've always been a big fan of BRIDGET, and she does such a great job in KISS OF THE DRAGON.  She plays a woman forced to sell her body behind promises that she will have her daughter returned to her. The scene where she plops down and helps herself to Jet's chips and rice because she's starving... talking the entire time.  Despite her appearance, you just want to give her a great big hug and take care of her woes. The action scenes are outstanding, but what makes the movie a cut above the rest is the story and the characters.
