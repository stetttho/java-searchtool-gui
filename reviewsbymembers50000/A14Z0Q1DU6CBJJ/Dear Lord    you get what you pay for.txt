 I guess with a title like Dumb and Dumberer I shouldn't have been surprised that the movie was DUMB and kept getting DUMBERER. I know...? Der? What do you expect. That's what the movie is. Well... at least Dumb and Dumber had some execution. There was setup to the jokes. There was delivery. There was a method to the madness. Dumb and Dumberer has none of that. There is only one way to describe this movie. One word. RETARDED. There are two or three funny scenes and with proper execution would have been even funnier. Bob Saget's rant about his bathroom was a stomach hurter, and that's about it. The rest are ridiculous, in the tradition of JACKASS kind of jokes. There's no story either. It's about... I... I don't remember what it's about. Something about a chest, a school mascot costume and a class for special people. Okay... I've gotta say something good. The movies deplorable and a waste of time, but Rachel Nichols, who plays Jessica, is the only bright spot in the entire poop splattered mess. She's the movies object of lust and SHE'S the only reason to hit PLAY on your DVD. I hope she gets some more movie rolls because she's sharp and one of the sexiest things to happen to the silver screen in awhile. Otherwise, walk away... no 'RUN'. No, in fact, go rent DUMB and DUMBER and watch it again. See how humor is supposed to be executed.
