 So hungry I am for originality. So hungry I am for filmmakers with a unique vision and the know-how to give us something new and MEMORABLE!!!!!  SO HUNGRY I AM FOR MORE SIN CITY!!!!!  Thank you, thank you, thank you Frank Miller, Robert Rodriquez, Quentin Tarantino and everyone else who had anything to do with this BEAUTIFUL film. Beautiful? Yes! It is. Violent. Grisly. But, beautifully shot and designed. From the rain, to the snow, to the faces, to the colors and yes... the blood.  All who were involved with Sin City earned some serious brownie points with me because you gave us what we all have been hungry for, for so long. You took us and our imaginations to a new place. You told us stories that pulled no punches and kept us on our toes.  In a slew of Non-original, cookie-cutter, same old same old films, mixed with all the lack of new idea remakes, SIN CITY proved to me that the film business still has a pulse.   Sin City, with a phenominal cast (Mickey Rourke may have saved his career here), delivered on a phenominal level. With its 60s style and Humphrey Bogartish delivery, it packed a tremendous punch of creativity, design, grit and grime.  With it's beautiful black and white colors and the occasional splash of red, it moves like a painting... with 3 intertwining stories of the inhabitants of Sin City. The low, the lower and the even lower... with an occassional splash of righteousnous.   Yet, after watching Sin City, I couldn't help thinking that there were so many more stories to be told. I want to see more, and I want to read Frank Miller's books now.  I want to see Senator Roarke get what he deserves!!  He has to!  This movie is great. It really is. If anything, even if you don't like violence, hitting the play button, YOU WILL see something new, original and CREATIVE.  Finally... I'm only giving it 4 stars because the DVD is sorta bare bones... Surely, the special edition will be coming soon! Hopefully!
