 FAST LANE TO MALIBU and FAST LANE TO VEGAS are a couple of competently put together soft core movies with a great selection of beautiful women. My favorite being Renee Rea.  But there is also, Tracy Ryan, Kelli McCarty, Kira Reed, Nikki Fritz, Susan Featherly, Flower Edwards, Tera Patrick, Ava Lake, Sarah Kalla, Dee Summers, Sasha Peralto and Kelly Alane.  The scenes are the kind of scenes you expect from a well made soft core movie. All are fun. Most are exciting. All of them women are BEAUTIFUL. The stories are fairly decent for these type of movies. The thing that surpised me about buying these DVD's and the most noteable reason that people who like these sort of movies should consider buying them is that they're INTERACTIVE. That's right! For those that have seen the VIDEO tape version of the movies... there are NEW SCENES.... depending on the decisions you make and most are pretty darn hot. There are numerous extra scenes, not in the original video releases... depending on the decisions you make. This is a fantastic idea for these type movies. I hope they make more of these in the future, but I would suggest one thing. Somebody do it RIGHT!!  I give BIG Points for the producers of these movies for doing it (novel idea), but a few of the choose your own paths in these are pretty silly and don't work. But some work REALLY REALLY WELL!!   Hopefully somebody will really explore the choose your own adventure movies when it comes to DVD, and do one really really well. Film A LOT MORE SCENES with multiple paths.  If you like these movies and have seen these movies before. Give them a shot. Kinda cool to throw in the interactive aspects.
