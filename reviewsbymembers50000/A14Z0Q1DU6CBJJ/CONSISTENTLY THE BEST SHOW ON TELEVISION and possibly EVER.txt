 NOTE TO PRODUCERS and DISTRIBUTORS OF SIMPSONS DVD'S:  Release these faster! (LOL) The Third season was 1991!! That means we're 12 years behind! At this pace, we won't get to the most recent episodes until the year 2015... I don't know if we're gonna be around that long, the way things are looking.  Not to mention whether or not we'll be using DVD's?  Anyway... The Simpsons is, consistently, by far, the best show on television and possibly ever. The humor, a few years back, I assumed would probably run out of flavor and things would get old. Never! In fact, it just gets better. The producers brilliantly create new jokes and find new ways to make fun of themselves and the world at large. Please keep up the fantastic work and release these DVD's faster!  I'm so anxious to own them and see them again over and over, I could burst!   Who knows... maybe in a couple of years people won't be interested and you'll have lost all those potential sales... aaaahhh, nevermind... just trying whatever I can.
