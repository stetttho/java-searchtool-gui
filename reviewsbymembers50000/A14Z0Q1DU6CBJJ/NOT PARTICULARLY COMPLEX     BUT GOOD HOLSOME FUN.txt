 Legally Blonde is not particularly complex, but is perfect escapism movie to get your mind off things and relax. The message here is "Don't judge a book by its cover".  And we could all use a lesson in that.  The outer shell is never the entire story when it comes to each individual person.  Not only is REESE WITHERSPOON'S character an example of that, but everyone in the movie is.  That's the best part about Legally Blonde.  Reese's character is not what she appears to be on the surface and the producers don't stop there.  Some characters are what they appear, and some surprise you. Although Legally Blonde isn't much better than average when it comes to movies, it does make its point in a fun and entertaining way.
