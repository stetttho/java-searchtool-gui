 S.W.A.T. had potential but falls short in my book.  It starts off like it's gonna be a great movie. The performances are good, the tension is good and the story is headed in an interesting direction. But then it sort of gets derailed. Not in a hugely bad way, but in bad enough of a way. First of all, the story is set aside and half of the movie is taken up with TRAINING! Sure, it's neat to see the S.W.A.T. officers at work and good research was done into the weapons and tactics, but the story suffers from this. What could have been a richer and deeper story, becomes a flash in the pan ending with not a whole lot of feeling to it.  What could have been an exciting and conflicting story between Jim Street (Farrell) and his ex-partner Brian Gamble (Renner) becomes just a handful of scenes that never got delved into and so the conclusion doesn't hold a lot of power.  So, I guess my pain problem with the movie was scripting and structure. It's an interesting movie and worth a look, but falls short of anything more than that.
