 The beauty of Grand Theft Auto is the complexity and the openness.  Explore. Find your own fun. Play the game however and whereever you want.  I haven't owned a game system in ten years. I'm a little bit of a radical and didn't care to give my money to the gaming companies who ripped us off every year.  Yet, Play Station 2 proved to me that they were the exception.  They put out a quality system and made it where it incorporated the old games too.   Anyway... GRAND THEFT AUTO 3 was the first game I bought!  You can imagine my shock at how phenominal games have become.   GTA3 is quite honestly exceptional, and takes a new step toward getting YOU involved in the game.  The first game that I've ever seen that each individual game player can transpose their own personal dark side into the characters actions. Steal police cars and the game gives you the option to be a vigilante police officer.  Steal a fire truck and the game gives you the option to go put out fires.  Steal a taxi cab and pick up fares.   The game is violent.  Adult.  And fun as hell.
