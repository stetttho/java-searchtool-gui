 All right. This movie has some good moments in it, but it had some fundamental problems, the main one being that it couldn't decide what it wanted to be and it never truly captures the emotions intended.  Was it a comedy? yes. Was it a drama about a girl who needed to be saved from the porn business? yes.   There are some great moments in similar movies like RISKY BUSINESS and THE LAST AMERICAN VIRGIN, that manage to transform from comedy to drama AND THEY WORK!!! Is it the realism? Is it the direction? Is it the actors? Probaby a combination, but something is wrong with THE GIRL NEXT DOOR.  Bottom line. THE GIRL NEXT DOOR is not all that great of a movie. The storyline is good, but not completely achieved. The comedy is okay, but never much better than that. The movie is about porn stars but not all that dirty.  On the flip side... Elisha Cuthbert is drool inspiring, but her performance is hindered because she never really did anything all that dirty... so, the only reason I thought she was a porn star was because they told us she was.  THE GIRL NEXT DOOR is just another movie in a long series of movies these days that don't really have the guts to be TRUE TO ITS SUBJECT.  Boaz Davidson pushed the envelope with THE LAST AMERICAN VIRGIN and made a cult classic that was RISKY at the time to make. Amy Heckerling made a name for herself with a pull no punches movie named FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH, and Tom Cruise became a star in the smash hit RISKY BUSINESS.  THE GIRL NEXT DOOR didn't really do anything. It missed opportunities to be poigniant and risky, and unfortunately is just another movie that will most likely be forgotten after a couple of weeks on the video store shelf.
