 Mulholland Drive is a trip into the bizarre, or a trip into a bizarre mind.  A perfect example of what movies can do, and how they can challenge us.  Brilliantly written and relayed to film with the same expertise. The first amazing point to make is that this movie started out as a television show!  Canceled by ABC before it even aired once.... dummies (no wonder they have the lowest rated big network: no guts)  And then brilliantly reshot in places and made into one of the most brilliant and challenging films in recent days by DAVID LYNCH (Twin Peaks, Blue Velvet, The Straight Story). It's a complex movie.  Every single shot.  Every single setting piece has complexity and deeper meaning.  Each scene, camera shot, character and line of dialogue has a deeper and darker meaning then what is on the surface.  Take some time.  Really pay attention.   The brilliance of the movie is that, through all the double-meanings, twists, turns and confusion.  It all works, and it all comes full circle and explains itself.   The main selling point for this movie, in my opinion, is the brilliance of the actors involved.  LAURA HARRING and more specifically NAOMI WATTS were phenominal.  Both deserved oscar nominations (which Harring did get one), and WATTS deserved to win.  Not only did they play complex characters, but they fleshed out numerous personalities from one extreme to the other. This movie was nominated for numerous oscars and deserved to win!  It deserved far more recognition than A BEAUTIFUL MIND.
