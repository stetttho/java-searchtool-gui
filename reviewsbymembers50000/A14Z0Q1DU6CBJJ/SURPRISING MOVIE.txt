 I always did think that Tom Berenger was a good actor.  He's one of those character actors that always adds spice to whatever movie he might be in. In TRUE BLUE, he gets a starring role, and he delved into his character excellently.   He plays a beaten down and warn out cop who hasn't had a break his entire life.  Then when a beautiful suspect, played by Lori Heuring, needs a shoulder to cry on, he, against better judgement, takes her in.  And quite frankly, you don't blame him. Tom Berenger gives an excellent performance.  The story is entertaining and filled with multiple twists.  So, if you're looking for one of those movies that didn't get a whole lot of publicity, and deserved it.  This is the one.
