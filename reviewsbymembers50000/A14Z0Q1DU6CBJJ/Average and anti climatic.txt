 I'm a huge Tim Burton fan!  I enjoy everything he does because he has such a unique look at things.  Yet, of all of his movies, this one lacks development and leaves you with a "so-what" feeling. The costumes were fantastic and the make-up effects of Rick Baker were oscar caliber.  Yet, the one thing that the original "Planet of the Apes" had that this version does not is realism.  In the original, you believed that they were on a strange planet.  In the new version, you can't help think that they're on a set somewhere.  Some back-lot. More importantly though, the story was poorly written, and the ending jumped too much without explaining some details.  There were just too many coincidental things that you were just supposed to believe.  The first sign of a poorly written movie that needed a way out.  Like, where did all the humans come from and how did they hear about the rebellion so fast.  Oh, it doesn't matter, it's just a movie.  They had to be there, or there couldn't be a battle scene. All in all, I bought the DVD.  I buy all of Tim's movies.  Despite the fact that the movie was a little of a disappointment, the DVD is awesome.  Excellent special features, and when it comes to the movie... don't read too much into it... it's just a movie.
