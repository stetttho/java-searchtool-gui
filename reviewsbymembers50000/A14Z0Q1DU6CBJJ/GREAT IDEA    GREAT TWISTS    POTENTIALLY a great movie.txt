 NOTE TO HOLLYWOOD STUDIOS: PLEASE STOP GIVING THESE GREAT MOVIES TO PEOPLE LIKE MICHAEL BAY AND ROLAND EMMERICH!!!!  Once again... what could have been a GREAT, memorable movie, is destroyed by a, I'm sorry, but a brainless director who thinks all the audience wants is destruction and chaos. I'm sorry, but it's true. We all love ACTION. We love it when a movie gets our adrenaline going and WE LOVE CHAOS... but THERE HAS TO BE SOME LOGIC TO IT. When you insult the audiences intelligence... you INSTANTLY LOSE THEM.  THE ISLAND has it all. In fact, I watched this movie for quite awhile, wondering WHY I WAS ACTUALLY ENJOYING A MICHAEL BAY MOVIE. It had twists and mystery and INTELLIGENCE. It had a great premise and I won't give it away, because that's just not nice.   But then, about halfway through the movie, all of the twists and mysteries were uncovered and revealed, and I thought... eewww, that's only the beginning... I wonder what other twists there will be. Well, I should have known better, because that must have been where the original script ended and Michael Bay took over.   That was about the time that the main nemesis hired the WORST HITMEN in the world. And I say that jokingly because their actually supposed to be the best.  These hitmen have choppers and outnumber the two UNARMED and SOCIALLY RETARDED targets 12 to 2, and choose to go about their business destroying everything in sight, LOUDLY and CRAZILY. Not to mention, they're driving through a busy and crowded Los Angeles firing like maniacs and yelling things like "GET THEM!" and "THERE THEY ARE FIRE!"   I think, later on, they were even told to do things quietly.  Then there was the big giant letter hanging from the side of the building. Our two main stars are clinging for their lives to this huge letter that is teetering from falling for minutes while our 'HITMEN' fire into it wildly... it slowly begins to break away from the building... and just as it's about to fall.... creaking... falling... creaking... here it goes... the helicopter pilot decides to fly right underneath it so that it can get caught up in the carnage too and tumble to the ground in a firey ball of destructive wonder.  Oh, and of course, our main stars get caught up in some harmless netting and fall to the ground with a slight scratch on one of their heads.  Our two main stars climb aboard a semi-truck loaded with GIANT BARBELS and they eventually decide to dislodge them in order to stop their attackers. As these monsterous barbels destroy car after car and fall one after the other on the L.A. freeway, I kept wondering... WHY ISN'T THIS TRUCKER PULLING OVER? He just lost his entire frickin' load!!!  I'm not gonna go on forever discussing all this junk. I love action movies, but YOU HAVE TO KEEP IT WITHIN THE REALM OF ACCEPTABILITY, STORYLINE and RIDICULOUSNESS. The action sequences in THE ISLAND seem like just what they are, THROWN IN to please the audience.   Well, they didn't please me. Were they cool? You betcha! Were they ridiculous? You betcha. Were they necessary? Not at all.  Bay actually had a good thing going. A great premise, a great idea... ruined by a Director who has this screwed up idea that audiences are stupid and just want destruction.  We like destruction, but it better be logical and necessary. A perfect example: the action sequences in DIE HARD. They were over the top... but you know what, they kept them in the realm of acceptability... and they FIT WITH THE STORY!  I reitterate, please!! Hollywood! Stop! Somehow... I'm not sure, but Michael Bay and Rolland Emmerich have been given this Willie Wonka golden ticket to make what ever movie they want in hollywood with whatever budget and they disappoint time after time... and yet... ???  Whatever happened to the sensible directors that realized that audiences actually have brains, and don't like being insulted? I hate to tell them, but not everybody in the audience is a 13-20 year old video game playing boy. Some of us are 35-year-old video game playing boys.
