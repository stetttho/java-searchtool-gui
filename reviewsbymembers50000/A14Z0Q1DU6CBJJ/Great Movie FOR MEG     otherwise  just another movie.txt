 IN THE CUT, as a movie, is just another movie. It tries to be more, with artistic camera use and dramatically quiet moments that lull you. Camera shots with focus adjustments to give you an uneasiness. Camera angles that are a little off kilter. Poems displayed on the subway that intend deeper meaning.  Not to mention, a level of erotica that probably hasn't been attempted since the 70's. The movie is very explicit and exceedingly perverted in its dialogue. THIS is the most important thing about IN THE CUT. Not the level of explicitness, but the fact that goody goody romantic comedy sweetheart Meg Ryan is the subject of this explicitness. This was a very risky and successful turn for Meg Ryan. If she is to escape her reputation and try to find a niche in some different, more meaty movies, then IN THE CUT can most certainly do this for her. As far as the movie goes though, all the artsy pretentious melodramatic moments aside, this movie has no story. Bottom line, all the creativity that went into the camera direction and its attempt to be VISUALLY and MOODLY creative, should have been put into putting together a more unique and worthy story to tell. Take all the fluff and camera tricks away, and you have just another movie with the same ending we've seen a hundred times, with unappealing characters, and an empty feeling of a movie that didn't really have a whole lot to offer.
