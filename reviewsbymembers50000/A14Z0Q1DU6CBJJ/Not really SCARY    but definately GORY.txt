 I'm gonna start off with the goods.  The movie is original and has a good feel to it. The mood is set as three Americans travel across Europe in search of drugs, sex and more sex. The feeling of when and where is it all gonna go bad is delayed nicely and it keeps you interested despite the slow pace getting down to the nitty gritty. Yet, when it all does finally go down, the shock value is strong and unexpected.  What they eventually stumble across, is more adventure than they were looking for. A sadistic game of torture, brought about by cat and mouse and they unwittingly fall into the trap.  Now the bads.  First off, in a way, it's a good, because when it finally does happen, it holds more punch, but it took a long time to get into the danger that the movie is based on. Much of the film is taken up with set up... travel, sex-capades and things that really don't have anything to do with anything that unfolds in the film. This is not a huge deal to me.  Where the film lost me, is when Paxton is finally strapped to the chair and his torturer is having his way. What unfolds is a series of ridiculous coincidences and clumsiness that leads to his getting free. He yells something at his torturer that is not subtitled, but it stops his torturer for a moment. Then his torturer starts up a chainsaw, SLIPS IN SOME BLOOD and chainsaws his own leg. Then of course... there's a gun!  I hate coincidences. While I was into this film, at this scene, which was probably the most important scene in the film... I rolled my eyes and didn't care anymore.  Don't get me wrong. This is actually a good film. Better than Cabin Fever. Certainly not THE SCARIEST MOVIE IN A DECADE, which has been promoted. Maybe the most VIOLENT. HOSTEL is a movie that, in my opinion, missed a lot of opportunities to really be special when it hit the coincidence super highway, and for me, fell into mediocre land.
