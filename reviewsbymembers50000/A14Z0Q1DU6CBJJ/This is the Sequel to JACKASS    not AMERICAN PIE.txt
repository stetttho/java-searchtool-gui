 It's not a horrible way to spend two hours but really isn't anything special and I was very very disappointed. American PIE had its share of gimmick jokes and gross out jokes, but it managed to combine them with relevance and SEXINESS!! American WEDDING doesn't even try to be sexy. Which was a huge part of the success of American Pie. It was SEXY and FUNNY! We had a handful of beautiful girls and guys in REALISTIC, funny and SEXY moments. American Wedding on the other hand, has NONE of that. Stiffler (Scott) pretends to be somebody else in order to beat out Finch (Thomas) and get into Michelle's (Alyson Hannigan) sister Cadence's (the very attractive January Jones) pants. This story line takes up about 70% of the movie and nobody actually does. It's like telling a story an entire movie and never delivering with the punchline. Instead we end up with a sex scene with Grandma. The American Pie movies have made a lot of money for their studio. You'd think that they'd have the green light to do WHATEVER they wanted... and they did! Well, they chose to use that power to do jokes typical of JACKASS like eating dog poo, dancing in gay bars, having sex with grandma, humping dogs and shaving pubic hair. Me personally, I would have rather seen the sexiness brought back. Bottom line. American Wedding ISN'T sexy. It's mostly GROSS with some laughs. In fact, on the DVD, the Director even says that the studio recommended they add something to make it sexier. Preferably with Cadence, and they didn't.  The unrated version does feature an extended bachelor party. It isn't that big of deal. Would have rather seen Cadence do something MILDLY sexy. I mean, didn't January Jones see what American Pie did for Shannon Elizabeth, Mena Suvari and Tara Reid's careers!
