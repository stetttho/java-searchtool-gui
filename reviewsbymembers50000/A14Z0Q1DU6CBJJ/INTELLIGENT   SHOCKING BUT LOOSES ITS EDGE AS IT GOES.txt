 For most of this movie, I was glued to my seat.  Intriguing and exciting.  Shocking and genuine.  And not surprising, despite the unreal circumstances, not too far from reality.   Not too long ago I witnessed a cimilar situation in Kansas City where a television station news team just happened to be in the right place at the right time and filmed a fleeing bank robbery suspect as he attempted to steal a car, pistol-whipped the car owner, fled into a building and escaped.  Without informing the police, the station ran the story on their nightly news;  exposing the identity of the criminal.  Yet, when the police saw the story on the news, realizing they would need it for prosecution and arrest purposes, they attempted to retrieve the evidence.  The station denied them;  claiming exclusive rights to the video.  They had beaten their competitors, and releasing the video made it public record, therefore allowing other stations to use it.  Proof that what 15 MINUTES is trying to say is not too far off.  Our media has become a business.  And that we've become a desensitized society.  What will it take to get our attention?  When it comes to the media, the boundaries are always pushed. What 15 MINUTES does well is manage to mix a realistic nature with a possibly realistic premise; for awhile.  Somewhere along the line, the story loses its edge.  What starts as a realistic and shocking walk into the dark side of our society, ends with three or four highly staged scenes that rob it of its realism. All in all, an intriguing and frightening film that just didn't hold onto the edge for the entire two hours.
