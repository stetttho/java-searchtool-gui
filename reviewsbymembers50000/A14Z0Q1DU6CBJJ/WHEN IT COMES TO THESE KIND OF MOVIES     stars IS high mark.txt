 The movie is camp.  Complete and utter campiness.   The writing is bad, and the acting follows suit.  Stories are cheesy.  Direction is basic.  Back-lot... re-used sets.  Yet, the true purpose of the series is captured in excellent form.  BEAUTY! I purchased the whole set, and I don't regret it, because I am a huge fan of KIMBERLY ROWE.  Every time she shows up on screen, she just looks incredible.  She's not the main character, but she plays Justine's promiscous best friend.  Despite the fact that I bought them, just for ROWE, the rest of the cast is beautifully captured too. If you love camp, you can't go wrong with the king of camp ROGER CORMAN.  And if you love beauty.  You definately can't go wrong with Kimberly Rowe, Daneen Boone, Jennifer Behr and a host of other beauties
