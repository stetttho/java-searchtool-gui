 Honestly, I purchased these titles because I'm a fan of RENEE REA.  She plays a small part in the movie (a very small part... TOO SMALL!)  That was a disappointment right off the bat. Yet, Besides that, Voyeur Confessions actually turned out to be a decent movie, saved by CATALINA LARRANAGA.  The movie and its scenes are actually very realistic.  No scenes ruined with goofy elevator music here.  Everything is very real, raw and sexy. The scenes with CATALINA are actually some of the hottest scenes I've seen, and make the purchase worth while.  Voyeur Confessions is far better than most of the ... movies that have been put out, because of its realism and the acting is better than average.   Yet, I only gave it three stars for two reasons:  One, because Renee Rea wasn't in it enough.   Two, the bonus DVD Sexual Magic was pretty weak.  Maybe that's why their giving it away?? If you're a fan of CATALINA (which I am now), this purchase is worth while.
