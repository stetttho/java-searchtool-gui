 I'm a little partial to this movie, just because I had a chance meeting with Virginia Madsen while she was filming "THE HOT SPOT".  It was a fond memory for me, because it was my first real up-close encounter with a STAR and to top it off, she was such a genuine, friendly and welcoming person.  She invited me to have dinner with her and her friends.  In the short time we talked, we became friends and I just thought she was fantastic; and still do.   Anyway, I still think it was a very well done movie. Beautifully shot and perfectly cast.  Don Johnson starred as the smooth drifter with mysterious intentions, the always stunning Jennifer Connelly and of course VIRGINIA.  Dennis Hopper directed it, and he really captured the heat of the setting and really delved into the depths of the characters involved.
