 I'm ashamed to admit in hind-sight that I was actually fired up about this movie before it was released.  We were bombarded with an upsurd advertisement campaign.  Every single cast member was invited onto at least one of the talk shows at least once a piece before the movie even hit theatres.  Fast food.  Action figures.  Magazines.  It was everywhere.  It was supposed to be the movie of the century!!! ... at least that was what we were being told.  And it looked like it probably would be. Then I went to see it ... with eyes-wide and excited; hand buried in popcorn.  Then... I realized, about forty minutes in ... I'd been conned.  Never in my life did I feel so stupid ... I had fallen for it.  I had fallen foolishly for the most hyped movie of all time. This wasn't the movie of the century... it was a two-hour commercial.  It was a scatter-brained, poorly-written, poorly-directed fiasco.  Other than the incredible special effects that went to waste on INDEPENDENCE DAY, the movie only deserved to be shown on the DISNEY CHANNEL... once. A movie that was written so poorly that it went from joking around one second, to nuking Houston the next (anyone know anybody in Houston? ... apparently no one who made this movie did, because they sure didn't care).   An alien movie that was about as scary as your local christian church's haunted house.  A movie that couldn't figure out whether it wanted to be a comedy, a thriller, or a UPN movie of the week.   And then came the ... finale ... "I'M BACK!!!"  And they all came tumbling down. Well, I won't be back.  And I learned a valuable lesson: Any movie who has to promote as heavily as INDEPENDENCE DAY had to, probably isn't worth the paper they used to write the script.  IF THERE WAS A SCRIPT????
