 I'm not sure how to explain this movie.   I actually think that Katie Holmes gives a very solid performance.  A troubled girl who holds many mysteries inside her head.  She plays it well.  I think even proves that she's a very good actress, if given a better surrounding. It's the things around her that are so bland, that you never really care.  The story has no build.  It has no muscle.  The characters around her are flat and non-dimensional.  Benjamin Bratt's character, and no fault of his own, is undeveloped. The story is even more non-dimensional.  The suspense is so flat, that you never get involved. It could have been a good movie... if you can manage to sit through the monotone delivery that plagues the movie throughout, it actually has a decent payoff in the end.
