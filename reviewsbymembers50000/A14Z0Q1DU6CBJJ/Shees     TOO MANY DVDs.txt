 I wanted to buy this series of DVDs, but 11 DISKS!!!!  $17.98 a piece with 2 episodes on each!! What marketing genius did this? Is this a ploy to get more money? Quite honestly, the show isn't good enough to spend that much money!!  Don't get me wrong... I did enjoy watching the show in its weekly run. Was it the writing? NO. Was it the creative concept? NO. Was it the effects? NO. Was it the storyline? NO. Was it the fact that Victoria Pratt is (in my opinion) the hottest girl on the planet? (embarrassed) yeah... probably.  The first season is pretty cheap and uninventive. Lacks originality. Was without question a ripoff of the Xmen. The powers the main characters enjoy were pretty dull compared to Wolverine, Cyclops, Iceman, Storm and Rogue.  Unfortunately, the fact that Victoria Pratt is flat out beautiful couldn't save this show, and I hope that she hangs onto a career and returns in something better. Lauren Lee Smith is actually a good actress and she deserves better too.  Bottom line though... if they had released these DVDs in a more sensible box set, I would have most likely, foolishly parted with my money. BUT $198 + S&H on all 11 disks, is far far far too much to spend on the first season of this show.  Not to mention, buying all 11 disks from Marketplace sellers + S&H would be a pain in the rear.  I'm a sucker for a pretty face, but NOT THAT MUCH OF A SUCKER...
