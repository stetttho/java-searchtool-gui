 I don't understand how A.I. could possibly have received so much disrespect and poor reviews.  It makes no sense?? I had heard from a friend, that the movie was a disappointment.  I didn't care.  It was a KUBRICK idea.  Kubrick confided in Spielberg.  How could it possibly go wrong?   Upon viewing it, I strongly disagreed with my friend.  The movie is beautiful.  A tremendous performance by Haley Joel Osment.  The images are unforgettable.  The story is heart-warming, yet disturbing at the same time.  The effects are fantastic, but low-key.   Odd. Yes.  But what Kubrick movie isn't?  Kubrick had a unique vision.  That was what made him a genius.  Simple stories told in extraordinary situations.  Normal and relatable characters put in extranous situations. Spielberg directed A.i. after Kubrick suddenly passed away.  Yet, Spielberg managed to capture Kubrick's style in a lot of ways. The elaborate echoing sets that seem to put off a vibe of loneliness.  The feeling of entrapment and overpowerment by the authorities and corporations of the world around us.  Not to mention, the multi-layered characters. Yet, he still managed to keep a lot of his own. I personally think it's a fantastic mix.  Which, again, makes me wonder how this movie hasn't received more respect.   Oscars or not, like all Kubrick movies, ten-years down the road, everyone will look back at A.i. and find a new respect for it.  Unlike most movies that come out these days.  Movies we forget twenty minutes after viewing.
