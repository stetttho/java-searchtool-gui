 Lucas learned a lot from the complaints he got about EPISODE 1.  You can see that.  Regardless what he says, he obviously payed attention to his detractors. Yet, in my opinion, one fatal flaw crossed over and plagues both movies and most likely the third. EMOTION!! Not that there isn't any, but the movie jumps around and moves so quickly that the moments that you should grow empathy and sympathy for the characters are lost in uncomfortable mood changes and poor scripting.   My opinion on special effects are that they should only be used when absolutely necessary.  The original Star Wars movies were done primarily with models and tedious work.  Yet, LOOKED REAL!!  CGI used in excess looks ridiculous.  As do these movies. STAR WARS, EMPIRE STRIKES BACK & RETURN OF THE JEDI were such hits because the audience cared!  And they cared because at that time, Lucas seemed to realize that you had to develop a personal relationship with the audience.  The audience has to know and care for the characters. These new movies don't have that.  Not any fault to the actors.  But, it seems that Lucas has forgotten that.  He seems to be having so much fun playing with all his High dollar gadgets, that he forgot how to tell an effective story.
