 This is just referring to the DVD: I was waiting for this DVD to come out because I loved this movie when it first came out.  I rented it from a video store a few years back and really enjoyed it.  Well acted.  Good premise.  Not to mention, Kari Wuhrer is hotter than ever. Yet, the DVD is a huge disappointment.  It's edited!  The video tape I rented was an unedited unrated version.  THIS DVD IS NOT!  It's the R-rated version. Otherwise, I would have given it 4 stars!  I'll never understand why they edit these movies?  Ruins them. Sex seems to be the only criterion for the MPAA to give out NC-17 and decline ratings.  Yet, violence has no limit.
