 This movie was confusing to say the least.   ... and I'm not talking about the odd path of the dream-like, mysterious, what's going on storyline.  I'm talking about the fact that it wasn't better than it was?? The movie had a lot of things going for it.  It was very well shot.  Cool images.  A frightening opening scene that started to flesh out as the cast of characters attended a very dark and mysterious dance club.  A club where, the audience knows they shouldn't be there, but the characters don't. The cast was excellent.  Melissa Sagemiller, Wes Bentley, Casey Affleck, Eliza Dushku and very creep Angela Featherstone, all performed well. Yet, all of a sudden, the movie jumped into this dreamlike state, forgetting the story they had started, and took us in a direction that, well...  I'm confused.  I don't know if it was supposed to be surprising?  If it was supposed to leave me guessing?  It didn't.  I knew exactly what was going on. The first part of the movie was intriguing.  But, quite frankly, The second part of the movie was an absolute yawner. In baseball terms, SOUL SURVIVORS was a foul ball.  A LONG foul ball, but a fall ball all in the same.
