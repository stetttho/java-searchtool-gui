 Wow! I have to say, this game has kept my growing by the second rearend glued to the couch ever since I got it in the mail.  SHADOW OF ROME is truley what a Gladiator game should be, with a great story to go along with it.  The opening scene leads you out into the arena and it quickly initiates you into the blood splattering, heart pumping fun.  The best thing about SHADOW OF ROME is the fact that the motion while you're fighting is surprisingly free. Your movement is not restrictive and the controls are fantasic. Dodging by rolling away at the last second as the MAUL drives into the sandy ground where you were a second ago. Numerous ways to fight, attack and kill. I keep finding more.   Holding up your bloody hands to the crowd and they throw you food, better weapons and... yes... an occasional ROSE. They really like it when you hold up a recently severed head.  SHADOW OF ROME sometimes leaves the arena, to fill in backstory and you take on another character who is trying to discover and prove to everyone that the wrong person is set to be executed for the assassination of JULIUS CAESAR.  When it does this, I won't lie, I'm slightly disappointed because I want to go back to the arena... but... all in all... the story makes the battles in the arena that much more intense and meaningful.  This is a fantastic game! Oh... did I mention the arena of Tigers?
