 Halfway though this movie, I remember everything I had heard in reviews and that it had been slammed by critics and everybody else.  Everybody said it was slow and had a great payoff.   Halfway through watching it... I remembered and they were right.  Although, the overall reviews that I remembered were wrong. The ending to this movie made the entire package worthwhile and actually worth watching twice.  I went to rent movies. My girlfriend said, "Don't get Skelton Key, I heard it was terrible." I got it anyway and strangely enough, we decided to watch it. By the end of the movie, we were glad we watched it.  I won't give away too much, but I will say that the movie is about a girl looking for a life change, looking to take on some responsibilities of her own. She begins to take care of a bed-ridden man and his wife in a mysterious house with a mysterious attic and a mysterious room.  Voodoo and mystery give this movie its life but throughout the heart of the movie, it sort of drug... where are we going here? But, once you get to the end of the movie, you'll realize that all that slow going had a reason.  This movie had the presence, confidence and dare I say BALLS to be different in a slew of run of the mill movies. It dared to be vague so that the surprise ending WOULD BE A SURPRISE and not be given away too soon.   It could have strayed into the unreal and COMMERCIAL in order to please bored audiences, but it stuck to its guns, knowing that the ending would be the payoff and they were right.  All I can say is, don't watch this movie with a critical eye, it will do no good. Watch it, absorb it, follow it and you will not be disappointed. If you do that, you will most likely gasp like my girlfriend and I did when the ending delivers its knockout blow.
