 I wasn't aware of Jennifer Hammon or anything about the soap opera PORT CHARLES before this, but based on the reviews I read here... I just had to check it out.   I was not disappointed!  Jennifer Hammon is a beautiful woman and the movie is incredibly steamy.  Yet, more importantly, unlike most erotic edged movies, it has a substance and a believablity.  The character of Allyson (Played by Hammon) is realistic and complex.  Too often, the people in these sort of movies are such push overs.  So easily convinced into... well, bed.  Allyson is realistic, conflicted and therefore creates a successful and very erotic, erotic film. I'd have to say, ALLYSON IS WATCHING, ranks as one of my top 5 sexiest movies.
