 I had never heard of this game until I was thumbing through here one day and read some of the reviews the game was receiving. I was intriqued. I was looking for a good sci-fi sort of game. The Star Wars games are always such a letdown... so, I thought I'd buy this one... COME ON... for the PRICE you can't go wrong... and I DIDN'T! There is only one downside.  The game is fantastic. The graphics are great. The game is fun and unique. It has a wide open environment in which you can race, explore, recover PEARLS, take pictures of various species of ANIMALS in order to make money, interact with everyone, rescue your friends and try to uncover the truth beyond unexplained events like a real investigative journalist. The game is challenging and hard at times, and always interesting. Not to mention, funny... side characters are lighthearted and entertaining.  There is a level of puzzle solving that is at times hard, sometimes completely impossible and sometimes relatively easy. Overall, the game takes you to this cool unique world that sometimes reminds me of Don Bluth's DRAGON'S LAIR (in its animation).  The game is very fun and a nice change of pace. The only setback I can make note of is that the game is pretty short. Otherwise... This game is worth playing. For the low low price it is being sold, buy it. If you don't want to buy it, at least rent it.
