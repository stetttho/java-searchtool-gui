 Different... yes.  Good... definately. Better than the first 2 movies... IN SOME WAYS. I figured that T3 would be an abomination. When I first heard that it may be rated PG-13, I immediately gave up on it. Then it was rated-R and my hope was redeemed. Then when I heard that James Cameron wasn't directing, I was again put off, but thankfully, I went to go see this and hungrily gathered up the DVD when it came out.  Other reviewers were saying that T3 doesn't bring anything new to the series and my response to that is... WHAT!!! The first Terminator was scary. The unknown. When that movie came out, we didn't know who the Terminator was. He was this indestructable killing machine. The second Terminator was a special effects masterpiece with a cool story. That being said, the creators of T3 knew they couldn't meet the expectation of T2 special effects or the scares of the original, so they had the common sense to tell a GOOD STORY. In my opinion, Terminator 3 is the best STORY of the three. It delves into the origin of SkyNet, holds emotional impact (thanks to two very good actors, Nick Stahl and Claire Danes) and has a conclusion that no action movie has previously had the balls to deliver. Terminator 3 was a huge win. One of the best movies of the year, crushes The Matrix and I can't wait for the fourth installment! The DVD: cool. Besides dozens of cool behind the scenes featurettes, also allows you into the SkyNet database to explore weapons and personnel and has a visual effects lab where you can build your own special effects sequences. Buy it. If you haven't seen Terminator 3. It's one of the few action movies that won't insult your intelligence.
