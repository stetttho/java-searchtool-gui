 Okay. I originally gave this movie 1 star, but changed my mind.  I'll give it 2 stars, just for the sheer fact that any movie with a cast of beauties like this can't be all bad. I was stoked about VALENTINE.  Denise Richards, Marley Shelton, Katherine Heigl, Jessica Capshaw, Jessica Cauffiel & Hedy Burress all in the same movie! How could it possibly be anything but good. Not a bad concept. A series of murders centered around a group of girls that have been friends since grade school.  I won't give anything way..(even though there isn't much to give away), but nothing is done with it.  The story is straight forward.  I've never seen a horror movie that was so void of suspense in my entire life!!  I'll just say this.  If anybody ever walks off by themselves..... kiss'em goodbye.  yawn.... Oh... and despite all the beautiful people involved in the film, it's also void of anything sexy or remotely risque. I'm a writer, and either the original writers idea was butchered by sensors and executives, or Hollywood has proven once more that it isn't what you know, or how well something is written, but who you know. If SCREAM brought horror movies back to the theatres... then VALENTINE took them right back out.
