 Ella Enchanted is a quite simply a joy to watch.  First off, it's an inventive little story with great visuals that mix the modern world with the old world and combine dozens of previous themes from other Disney or family movies to create a charming little world that just plain puts off a feel good vibe.  You take that and you throw in a dazzling and charming star like Anne Hathaway and you have a winner. Hathaway is a joy to watch. She has an amazing talent for pantomime and facial expression. It will be interesting to see where her career goes. Not to mention, she can SING and dance!  Ella is a young girl that was given the gift of obedience by a well-meaning fairy god mother, basically forcing the good natured girl to do WHATEVER she's told. This makes for a great premise and once Ella's gift begins to be misused by a mean stepsister who knows her secret, she embarks on a journey to remove the spell.  Anne Hathaway puts a smile on your face and Ella Enchanted is a delightful little movie that slides right in beside the great fairy tale movies of the past.
