 A few months ago Frankie Muniz appeared on 60 minutes. I didn't really have an opinion about him at all until I saw that story on him and his success.   As I was watching, I couldn't believe the utter arrogance of this 18 year old kid. The pride in himself was unending. He praised himself and claimed to be on the verge of being a huge star. There were no boundaries for him. Not once did he thank ANYBODY for helping him get to where he was, other than himself. Not even his family.  Well, I'll tell you what, Frankie Muniz would be absolutely nowhere if it weren't for the WRITERS of "Malcolm in the Middle". The key to Muniz's success was that he was a normal looking kid with a hint of dorkiness and whole lot of luck... then the writers and directors for the show did their magic.  Agent Cody Banks 2 is pointless and more importantly, a movie that strokes the ego of an actor that needs no more ego stroking.  The movie is poorly thought out, unfunny, and an obvious attempt at a hurry up and capitalize off of the flash in the pan success that is Frankie Muniz. No script. No thought. Ridiculous scenes that have our SUPEREGO star singing "War! What is it Good for?" at a world leaders meeting. The Queen of England dancing doing a shameful boogie.  This movie will most certainly send Muniz back to where he belongs. Mediocrity. Assuring him a career in a T.V. movie here and there and a guest spot on the Hollywood Squares.
