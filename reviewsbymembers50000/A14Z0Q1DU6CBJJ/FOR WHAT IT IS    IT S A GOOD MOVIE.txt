 No. It's no gem. Not well written.  An horribly uninteresting story line.  Could've been spiced up a little more... No, a lot more.  Absolutely no conflict, at all.   Yet, for what it is...  A beautiful movie.  The women are gorgeous (especially Kimberly Rowe) and the scenes are effective and beautiful.  All in all, because of Kimberly Rowe, I'm glad I bought the DVD.
