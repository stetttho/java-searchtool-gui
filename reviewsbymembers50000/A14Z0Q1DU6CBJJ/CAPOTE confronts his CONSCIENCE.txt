 CAPOTE explores what every writer must experience when they delve into the dark world of real crime. Guilt. Shame. Seclusion. Ridicule. Yet, it was an experience that Truman Capote had never encountered until he wrote IN COLD BLOOD. And as the movie CAPOTE portrays, his venture into this true-life Kansas Crime, may very well have been the very thing that eventually destroyed him.  Philip Seymour Hoffman embodies Truman Capote in fine fashion and deserved the Oscar, without question. He takes on the role of Truman at the point of his career before he embarked on writing the book that would define his career, IN COLD BLOOD. He's a huge celebrity, movie star, life of the party and successful writer looking for his next story.  The IN COLD BLOOD story has been told numerous times, but never from this angle. In CAPOTE, we get to see the story from Capote point of view. How he got the inside track? How he went from shunned and ignored in the little Kansas town, to friend with special insider priveledge to interview and get to know the witnesses, friends of the victims and of course, the killers.  What we truly see, isn't how it's done, but what it did to Capote. How manipulating his way into the lives of the people in his book affected his personality and how becoming friends to the killers, misleading them as to what his true intentions were and then having to explain himself as he waited for them to be put to death.  There's something incredibly deep, challenging and thought-provoking that comes across in Philip Seymour Hoffman's performance that it almost demands to be seen. This is a movie not to miss. A great movie... all around.
