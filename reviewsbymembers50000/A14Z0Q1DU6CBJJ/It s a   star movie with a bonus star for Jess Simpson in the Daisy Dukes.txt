 Seriously.  I'm not gonna waste a lot of time on this review. I'm a red-blooded male and I don't think there are too many people out there that can deny that Jessica Simpson is one of the most beautiful people on the planet. Then they put her in those Daisy Dukes and that's all she wrote.  Oh... about the movie. Typical. Typical TV show turned movie speel. Yada yada yada. Boss hog's a jerk. Up to no good. Lots of sass talkin' and whiskey and country boys and did I mention Jessica Simpson in the Daisy Dukes?  Oh, and bad language doesn't bother me AT ALL!! I have to watch myself around my kids, seriously... but have to admit, I was a little taken back when Bo Duke uttered the F-word a few times. It just seemed... WEIRD?  I'm not too sure who's calling the shots in Hollywood. Who's deciding to use 80% of their production budget on remakes, but WE THE PUBLIC ARE SICK OF IT! I'VE GOT BETTER IDEAS! I've written better scripts, but I guess you have to have a good buddy in the business to get anything done.  Creativity in Hollywood is dieing.  The Dukes of Hazzard is a rarely funny, typical movie and every once in awhile, you can look up from your newspaper, book or gameboy to catch Jessica Simpson in the Daisy Dukes.   Don't get me wrong though.... she's worth it. YOWZA!!
