 Before reading this review, realize that I've not owned a system in ten years.  Playstation's consideration to those that bought the old system was what drove me to finally purchase one. That being said, Madden 2002 was my first game and when I put it in, my jaw hit the floor!  The graphics are mind-blowing.  The games can be played in numerous styles of camera movements, all of which edit and fade like a real television crew would do. The game play is very realistic.  Other reviews have said how the passing, running and pass rush stuff is hard... and well, it is.  Yet, that's what makes it realistic.  You have to practice at it.  Unlike previous games, you can't just throw passes into double coverage on a regular basis.  You have to use pump-fakes, burn passes out of bounds, or hopefully you got Culpepper, Stewart or Vick and you can tuck and run. Just a little advice... play-calling on offense and defense... is everything. The game is awesome.  The graphics are incredible.  Even during play-calling the game never stops... it continues to show the huddle.  Quarterback talking to receivers and backs about the previous play.  Even showing the coach get [upset] about a dropped pass or a false start. The best part about the game though, graphics and realism aside, is the fact that you can redraft the entire league, create your own team and jerseys, sign players for contracts and enter franchise mode and build your team over numerous years.  Watch players retire and draft new ones. Finally, the down side.  I've played it for awhile, and their aren't many.  But, the announcing of Madden and Sommerall gets repetitious.  Fortunately, you can turn it down and just listen to crowd noise and F/X. The other downside I've found is that you can't watch games that you're not involved in.  Which kinda stinks.  I'd at least like to watch the Superbowl if I don't make it that far.  But, as of yet, I haven't figured out how?
