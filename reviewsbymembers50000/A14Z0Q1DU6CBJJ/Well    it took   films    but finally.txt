 After watching Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith last night, I realized something.  The whole problem with the entire trilogy was story and choices of story.  Revenge of the Sith is the juice of the story. It is what the other two movies were leading up to... but frankly, that's why the other two films STUNK. Because their entire reason for existence was SETUP!! They had very little story... LOTS OF FLUFF and no MEAT.   We all know the outcome. We know that Anakin will become Darth Vader. This isn't a surprise. So, basically we had to sit through 2 poor films and one awesome one to finally get to the punch line which we already knew.  I understand that the story Lucas had to tell was predestined, but I think had he condensed the first 2 films into one, shown more of the CLONE WARS and gotten to the Darth Vader punch line sooner, this would have been a much better trilogy.  I mean... there's a whole lifetime worth of Darth Vader stories left untold.  Well, Revenge of the Sith hits it out of the park. Better scripting. Faster. Darker. Wookies.   From the opening scene, we are instantly ejected into a faster moving adrenaline ride of a movie. There's a sense of dread, urgency and fear that the first 2 movies didn't have. There is a tremendous danger and it's coming to life.  The final scenes of SITH are gut-wrenching. The emotions that were lacking in the first 2 films are in the third.  Absent is the goofiness of the first two... that bad child actor, Jar Jar, the stupid cafe scene, the completely unnecessary robot factory scene... in its place is necessary, relevant scenes that are exciting, dark, dread inspiring and finally a solid lead into 3 of the best films ever made.  I think now... you can make that 4 of the best films ever made.
