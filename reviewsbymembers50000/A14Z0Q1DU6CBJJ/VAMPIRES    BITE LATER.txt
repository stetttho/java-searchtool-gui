 RENEE REA and CATALINA LARRANAGA in the same movie!  Outstanding! Embrace the Darkness 2 has some pretty intense sexy scenes that show a lot more than most of these kinds of movies.  That's a good thing.   If you're a fan of RENEE or CATALINA, this movie is worth purchasing.  The two women are prominently featured in most of the movie.   Unfortantely, there are a lot of down sides.  The directing is terrible.  Shots held too long in editing, make some of the stunts looks pretty darn silly.  The acting is pretty bad too, and again, I blame the direction and editing.  The love scenes or sex scenes (whatever you want to call them), seem to all take place in the exact same place!  A lighted table in the basement of a dance club.  Their pretty hot scenes, but a little variety would have helped. All in all, I'm glad I bought it.  But I'm a RENEE REA freak.
