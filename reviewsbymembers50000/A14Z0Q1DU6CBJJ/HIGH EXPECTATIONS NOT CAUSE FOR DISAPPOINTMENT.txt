 I'm a huge Star Wars fan, and even though I give THE PHANTOM MENACE only two stars....I do it for good reason. My opinion of PHANTOM MENACE is quite simply explained.  The original Star Wars looked real!!!  It looked real because it was real!! Models and sets. That was the beauty of it! PHANTOM MENANCE, it seemed, was written in a manner to suit the computer effects they could do.  Many of the scenes served absolutely zero purpose, other than to show off the computer CGI JUNK.  Which, quite frankly, didn't transport the audience to a GALAXY FAR FAR AWAY, but instead into George Lucas' computer. The other thing that ruined the movie for me, was the way they chopped up the final battle.  Cutting back and forth between the battle in the field and the lightsabre battle sucked the intensity, suspense and excitement right out of it.  Leaving me  going... humph, instead of WOW!! It's a bad movie.  It's a cool movie, but it's a bad one....
