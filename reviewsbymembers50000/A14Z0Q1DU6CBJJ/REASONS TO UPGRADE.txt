 The Movie?  Awesome.  But, being its first movie, I thought that it maybe didn't get into the depth of the X-men quite yet.  It was really just scratching the surface.  Introducing.  Setting up.  Not a real complicated story.  Obviously... it was setting itself up for sequels.  Fine with me.  That just tells me that X2 is gonna be over-the-top. Now... like a lot of you out there, I bought the first release of X-men, and now, after some unknown force drew me toward the DVD rack at Target and made me buy the upgrade, I'll tell you why It was a good move: 1.  17 new featurettes of behind-the-scenes footage... 17! 2.  A viewing mode that takes you behind-the-scenes as you're   watching the movie and inserts the deleted scenes. 3.  Audio commentary by Bryan Singer (Wasn't on the first)   *the above is all just disk 1 4.  4 more huge featurettes, movie premiere footage, multi-angle studies lets you see what Bryan Singer had to edit with. 5.  The best behind-the-scenes footage for both movies X & X2 that I've ever seen.     *Bryan Singer gives a personal tough to it.  Admits he's not a big fan of releasing 2 DVD's but says you won't be disappointed.  And he's right! and finally...  Why this DVD is worth the money.... I'm an X-MEN freak, but I recommend this DVD big time.
