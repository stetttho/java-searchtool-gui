 Curiosity got the best of me. There was so much hype about how bad this was but you just had to see it, so I fell for it.  You don't have to see it. Apart from an incredibly graphic oral sex scene, there really is nothing eye catching about the film. The only thing I got from the film was that the people involved had to be incredibly STONED in order to do the things on film that they did (Chloe Sevigny, what were you thinking?).  I'm not gonna waste too much time with a rambling review because enough of my time was wasted on this film about a guy who is driving across country trying to forget his girlfriend.   The second he walked into a gas station and in an INCREDIBLY CREEPY way... asked the high school age girl if she would come with him cross country... twice he says... 'please' unblinking eyes, staring... 'please'.  It gave me the willies... and the willies weren't intended. In fact, the exact opposite is intended. He's supposed to be appealling.  In fact though, he is more APPALLING than anything.  What is more appalling is that the girl GOES WITH HIM!!    In fact, the creepy looking Vincent Gallo is apprently a chick magnet... even at truck stops.  Dear lord this movie was incredibly pointless and boring and would have been better if they had extended the porn theme across the entire film and released it as XXX.  Oh... and I'm a college graduate... a huge film observer and a writer.
