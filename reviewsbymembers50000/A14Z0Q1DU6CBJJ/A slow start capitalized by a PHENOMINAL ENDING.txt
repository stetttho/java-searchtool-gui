 I purchased the Dark Angel DVD after the show was cancelled because I never got a chance to see the show while it was on television. Not to mention, I prefer watching television shows in DVD format rather than having to sit through commericals... but that's beside the point.  I think I understand why DARK ANGEL may have failed to capture and sustain an audience, but it's sort of a shame. About 2/3 of the way through the First season, I was sort of disappointed. The show was sort of slow out of the gate. It wasn't really growing at all. It was sort of soap-operishly batting around the same storylines.  But then, maybe the last 3 episodes of Season 1 were a different story, and most noteably, the season 1 FINALE was an absolute smashing homerun!! The best season finale to any show I've ever seen!! Took my breath away. Shocking! Gutsy!  Fortunatley I had already bought the 2nd season DVD and was able to jump right back into it. The 2nd season was much much better, but I think maybe by then... the slow start that Season 1 had may have run off the audience, and what looked like a promising show in the making was ended much too soon.  Episodes 2-18 get 2 stars Episodes 19 & 20 get 4 stars Episodes 1 & 21 get 5 stars!  That all averages out to be an overall 4. The second season was engrossing all the way through. That's what leads me to believe that the middle of season 1 was what inevitably doomed the show.
