 Okay hear me out before you disagree with my star ratings.  This game is beautiful! The animation is outstanding and crisp and brilliantly done.  Yet, my favorite thing to do with PS2 BASEBALL games... is manage. I like to play from time to time... sure, but in order to get true realism out of a baseball game, I like to MANAGE.  So, image my dismay when I turned it to MANAGE MODE... and that beautiful animation was GONE!!!  In manage mode, you get a generic... COMMODORE 64 looking graphic. There is no animation in MANAGE MODE.  You get a screen that looks like watching a baseball game on ESPN.COM, except you can play the game in about 3 minutes.  So, basically, I was forced to play the game myself because manage mode was as boring as watching paint dry.  When you play it... you're never gonna hit the way the player truly would. Not to mention, WALKS/BASE ON BALLS are extremely rare when you play because you friggin swing at nearly everything because... well, most everything IS GONNA BE A STRIKE... which isn't very realistic. So those very rare balls that are thrown... you just swing at them too.  I played 3 games on this... and in 27 innings... multiple pitchers... there were 3 walks and 2 of those were intentional... with nobody on base I might add??? What gives with that?  I don't see why game makers can't be more realistic with pitching. It is so easy for the pitchers to hit their spots. If you aim low and on the outside corner... you're gonna hit it nearly everytime.  That isn't very realistic.  Pitchers in the majors try to hit those spots and the ball will stray. Only the finest pitchers in the league can hit their spots on a PITCH after PITCH basis and even they slip up 40% of the time.  So... wrapping things up... without the beautiful ANIMATION in MANAGER mode. This game was TERRIBLE for me. Others may enjoy it, but I didn't.
