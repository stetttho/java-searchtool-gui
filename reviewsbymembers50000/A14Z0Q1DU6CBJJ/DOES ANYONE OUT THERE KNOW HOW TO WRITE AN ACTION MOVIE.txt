 Slow down!!  Set things up.  Introduce.  This movie was edited so tightly it ruins it!  Every scene jumps you immediately to the plot point and it garners no other reaction, but "Okay?" The action sequences are fantastic.  The effects are great.  The movements that Angelina did to mimic the video game are right on.  In fact, the performances are far better than the norm for an action movie.  Yet, the story they were given to work with is cookie cutter (...).  It's almost as if the movie was planned, cast, settings were secured, effects and computers were planned and then they went "Okay... who's writing the script?" Action movies these days [are bad]... and for no other reason than this.  THE SCRIPT SHOULD ALWAYS COMES FIRST!!  Once you have a story, then plan your special effects and computer graphics around it!  And only use them if you need them.  That isn't the way it happens, and that obviously isn't the way it happened here. If there's a sequel... and I can't imagine that there wouldn't be... more MYSTERY and more TWISTS!!!   Don't make Indiana Jones, but remember why that movie will always be a classic.  THEY WROTE A KILLER SCRIPT!
