 Pay no mind to the reviewers who haven't actually seen this movie and are criticizing because the original cast isn't in this, because it's actually a worthy addition to the series.  It has more HEART than any on the movies in the series and UNLIKE AMERICAN WEDDING (which was more of a sequel to JACKASS than AMERICAN PIE), remembered that American Pie was a popular series because of the SEX and not the gross out jokes. Although it did manage to get some of those gross out jokes in there.  Really, the only thing that keeps this movie down is the fact that they weren't given a very big budget. For the amount of money that they had to make this, I think they did a very good job and the mostly original cast managed to be funny, relatable, appealing and should be commended for delivering a worthy addition to the series.  The movie revolves around Stiffler's brother Matt, played by Tad Hilgenbrink, who is trying to live up to his brothers reputation by making a peeping Tom video while being forced to go to Band Camp as a punishment for tormenting the Band.  The Band's leader, Elyse, played by Arielle Kebbel, was also a nice addition to the American Pie women. She's fun to watch with her innocent smile and budding sexuality.  The women are attractive too. Although they had small parts, Rachel Veltri and Carla Alaponte are stunners.  The story is sort of typical, but surprisingly had a lot of nice twists that weren't typical. Some nice surprises and a nice wrinkle of an ending.  After American Wedding spent nearly its entire 103 minutes doing gross out jokes that were more typical of JACKASS than the original American Pie, it was really refreshing to see Band Camp return the series to its true form and explore the hilarious side of teen sex with all its immaturities and vulnerablilities.  Band Camp is a worthy edition to my DVD collection.
