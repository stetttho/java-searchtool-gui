 Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is in essence, a simple movie, but a movie that touches on so many relateable feelings and deep and deeper emotions, that it crosses the line into greatness.  So far, this is my favorite movie of the year and should, most certainly, be a frequently uttered movie on Oscar night.  Who are we? What makes us who we are? Would we be where we are in our lives without ALL of the experiences we have enjoyed or despised. If we took away the bad things, would we be the same people?   ETERNAL SUNSHINE is brilliantly played by JIM CARREY and KATE WINSLET. Funny. Charming. Emotional. NORMAL. And when I say 'NORMAL', I mean that for the first time in a long time, we finally have a movie that plays and sounds REAL. The dialogue is FANTASTIC!! THIS is the way people talk. THIS is the way real relationships are. When Kate and Jim talk, you believe, and you instantly feel their connection. At different times in their lives, their conversations are more entertwined.  Charlie Kaufman... OSCAR for Best screenplay!  I won't say anything more. Don't want to give anything away and ruin it for people who haven't seen.
