 21 Grams demonstrates 3 actors at the top of their game: Sean Penn (who won the Oscar for 21 Grams), Benicio Del Torro (Oscar for Traffic) and Naomi Watts (Who has now been robbed TWICE out of an Oscar). The performances in 21 GRAMS are the best you'll see. Each character has a depth rarely displayed on film. These performances are what make the movie memorable and a cut above the rest. You see the joy in their lives and in a flash, you see the dark side of their lives, the turmoil, the torn down and bared souls. The movie plays like Pulp Fiction or Memento in the sense that it isn't told in chronological order. It jumps around the timeline of their lives, showing us their good sides before the events that destroy them and in a CUT, show the turmoiled people they will eventually become when the events all tie together, and then back again. In favor of the movie, the scenes cut together nicely. The scenes make you wonder, make you question, what caused this? How do Paul Rivers (Penn) and Cristina Peck (Watts) come to know each other and become lovers? The scenes pose all the right questions and move the movie nicely. My only problem was in the fact that I'm not sure that the mixed timeline storytelling may not have been necessary. In hindsight, after viewing the entire film, I'm not sure if the jigsaw puzzle of scenes wasn't just done IN AN ATTEMPT TO be cutting edge, Pulp Fictionish and OSCARISH?? The story could have just as easily been told in chronoligical order and held the exact same amount of weight and entertainment value. Finally, for all the timeline jumping around and making you wonder this and that, 21 GRAMS was disappointing to me. When it was all said and done, I expected something more. 21 GRAMS had a ho-hum story, but acting performances that will blow you out of the water.
