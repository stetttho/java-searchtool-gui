 I love this movie. This was one of the funniest movies that has come along in years. Raunchy and no holes barred humor that reminded me of the days when humor was limitless and UNCENSORED!!   So, last night when I saw that the UNRATED DVD was available, I pounced on it and watched it alongside the original DVD (on a seperate TV) to see what they added.  Well... they added quite a bit. About 10 minutes more. Yet, NONE of it deserved to be deemed UNRATED by any means. Just a couple of added scenes (nothing dirty or risky at all), and some extended scenes (again... nothing dirty or risky at all). Fluffy kinda scenes.  Actually... most were unimportant enough that they deserved to be cut from the original version.  BONUSES for buying the DVD... there are some new SPECIAL FEATURES... like 3 brand new behind the scenes featurettes that are kinda cool. Seeing the cast talk about the movie and seeing RON LESTER THIN!!!!!  WHOA!!!  Chyler's bedroom dance and her party dance aren't even included anywhere. On the previous DVD it was in the deleted scenes... it wasn't in the movie and there are no deleted scenes on this edition.  Don't get me wrong. It's still the same movie + some. But the DVD as a package is probably one of the WEAKEST UNRATED CUTS of a movie I've ever seen... maybe it's because they left all the dirty stuff in the original cut that they didn't have anything dirty to put back in???  The movie is a 4 star movie. This DVD is only 3 stars.
