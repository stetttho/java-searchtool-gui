 Okay, I'm a male in my 30s and when this show first hit the air, I just happened to catch the first episode and I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen! The show moved with sharp wit. Fantastic, sharp and hilarious characters that blend into a collage of colorful entertainment.  I actually recorded every episode, commerical free, onto video tapes... and now I can trash them for the real thing!! DVDs!!!!  The shows are each in their own right, kooky and zany and just down right fun as heck! Each episode has a sort of flash and sass to it, it's addictive.  There is absolutely no question, each episode of POPULAR was WRITTEN with care. Picking the absolute right times to make us laugh and the absolute right times to pull our heart strings. Singing, dancing, laughing and crying... all in one show.  Like I said, I'm a male in my thirties, and I'm proof that you don't have to be a teenager to enjoy this show. This show is excellent because it has excellent WRITING!!  If you're looking for a show to pick your spirits up and see some of the best young talents of the future flesh out some wonderful characters, give POPULAR a shot.  I can't wait to get the DVDs in the mail!!  September 21st!! Hurry up and get here!   Then I'll just cross my fingers that the second season comes available sometime!! I only got to see the first 5 or 6 episodes when it aired...!!
