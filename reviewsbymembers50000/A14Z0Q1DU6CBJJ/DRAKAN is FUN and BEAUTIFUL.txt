 I'm so glad I bought this game.  I just bought my play station 2 and this was the second game I bought.  MADDEN 2002 and then DRAKAN! Drakan's animation is comparable to MADDEN 2002.  The artwork and animation are fantastic.  The story is entertaining and fun.  The humor is sharp. Yet, the best part about DRAKAN is the equipment, spells and variations.  The side adventures you can embark on and collect more money to afford better equipment.  There is a set parameter to the game, but I'm sure everybody will go about it differently. I've read other reviews that have said that fighting is uncreative and basically you just wail on the button.  That isn't true.  In fact, dodging and blocking are crucial.  You have to pary, thrust, dodge, roll, move... etc.  Fighting is very sharp and when metal meets metal... sparks fly. Finally, there is one downfall, and only one.  There is a cave in the NORTHLANDS that if you go into without AROK, you lose him forever.  The proper way to proceed is to ride him into the cave. Recommend buy.  Fantastic game.  I hope there's a sequel.
