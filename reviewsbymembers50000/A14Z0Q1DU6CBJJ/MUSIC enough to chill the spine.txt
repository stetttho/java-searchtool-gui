 I wasn't too sure about Phantom of the Opera. God. For years I've loved the music. I own the original CD. I've always wanted to see the broadway play, but never have. It's a goal of mine to someday do so.  So when I heard that they were making it into a movie that would be more true to the broadway play... I was elated. Yet, Schumaker???  The movie isn't quite a 5 star. There is something missing. Fear. Dread. Maybe? It doesn't POP like I would have liked. The Phantom isn't as frightening as I would have liked. I knew that he would have to be somewhat attractive for Christine to be attracted, but there was something missing.  Yet, the music is top notch. The settings and visuals are top notch and the movie is as enjoyable as I hoped it would be.  Emmy Rossum is phenominal and the movie is a worth addition to my collection.
