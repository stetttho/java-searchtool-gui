 Years ago when I was still in high school, I bought the entire four book set, including the magic spells book. . . It was the best game book, I have ever enjoyed.   Yet, at one point I lent the first book to a friend and I never saw it again.   BUT I HAVE THE OTHER BOOKS STILL . . . I only need the first.   I have been on a dire search ever since!!  If anyone reads this, and can help in any way . . . please tell me!!
