 I normally would reserve 5 stars for a classic, but movies are so bad these days... to see one that is this good creep out among all the cookie-cutter junk is refreshing.  Funny... sexy and moving. For awhile there I was a little worried for LOVE HEWITT.  Movies are so poorly written these days and she seemed to be doing some of the worst ones... or just not necessarily exploring how talented she can be.  Finally, a movie that shows how funny, charismatic and appealing she can be. Heartbreakers is one the most well written comedies to come along in a long time and it is was perfectly cast.  Performances were top notch and hilarious around the horn.  SIGOURNEY WEAVER  as the conniving mother, LOVE HEWITT as the conflicted daughter, GENE HACKMAN as the hacking disgusting cigarette mogul and RAY LIOTTA as the victim/ex-husband/companion. A well crafted story and great delivery on all of the humor.  Seasoned professionals showing their experience and having fun while their at it. I highly recommened buying the DVD.  The extra features are good, with special emphasis put on the gag reel, which had me laughing before I even watched the movie.
