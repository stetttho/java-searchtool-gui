 Don't get me wrong.  This is a very cool idea, and a well done DVD.  Yet, with the capabilities of DVD, I expected something a little more complex and a little more of a movie to watch. The concept of mystery DVD is exciting!  I was thrilled at the idea, but was let down upon receiving the DVD. In essence, there isn't much there.  A few short clips to watch and some evidence and reports to read.  An interrogation of 6 suspects takes place, which I thought would be really cool, but you don't participate.  You hit play, and watch.   It is a complicated mystery, but there is no audience participation at all.  Just up to you to sort out the evidence and arrest a suspect. The main thing that I would have liked would have been a set-up movie.  A back story.  Get to know the characters and see some sort of short movie.  That doesn't happen, instead you READ a report that gives you a back story. The concept is awesome.  Hopefully, somebody will take this idea and build upon it.  DVD is capable of storing at least 10 hours of information, yet STAB IN THE DARK has less than an hour of things to keep you busy.   Once you figure it out... it's a coaster.
