 Hollywood is gonna crash. It is. You wait and see.  (Well it probably won't because people are bored, stupid and keep paying to see the same old tired you already know what's gonna happen movies)  Bewitched actually had a pretty creative idea. With a twist on the original series, it's centered around the things going on behind the scenes of the RECREATION of the classic show. In modern days, the show is being remade and Jack Wyatt (Will Ferrell) has already been cast as Darren. Then the search begins for the final and most important element. Who will play Samantha?  Who can play one of the most famous witches of all time, short of the Wicked Witch of the West?  Well, how about a REAL WITCH?  The premise is actually pretty creative.  The trouble is.  That's where the creativity STOPPED dead in its tracks.  Take that premise and CUT and PASTE every single romantic comedy that has been made in the last few years on top of it, and you have your movie. Predictable. Movie scripting 101. Introduce characters/introduce premise/introduce dilemma/complicate dilemma/solve dilemma.  This is why, I wish Hollywood would just collapse. Creativity is gone. Hollywood is been degraded to a sales pitch. Once the sales pitch is over and the paperwork is signed, they move in their robotic screenwriters to tell the exact same story they told in the last romantic comedy, only with different characters, in a different place and a different premise.  I unfortunately took my girlfriend to go see this at the movie theatre. AND IT WAS MY IDEA!!!  I was just trying to be nice. I apologized to her afterword.    Bewitched is one of the movies in a long, long, long, long series of movies that remind me why you shouldn't pay to go see movies at the movie theatre anymore.  Wait for $1 rental because that's all this and most movies these days are worth.
