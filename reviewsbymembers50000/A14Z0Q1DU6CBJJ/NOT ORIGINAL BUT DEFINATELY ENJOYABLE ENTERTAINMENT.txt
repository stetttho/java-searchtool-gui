 Not unlike most of the people who've reviewed this movie, I happened to stumble across this one.  Why are the good ones always so hard to find??   Being a guy and all, I basically picked it up because of Katherine Heigl. After watching it, I think that the only thing that kept it from being promoted more was the not-so-original story of people switching bodies. Yet, the movie is just sheer charm and fun. Both Danielle Harris and Heigl are an absolute joy to watch. Perfectly cast. Well-crafted and touching.  Both stars show personalities that had previously not been shown in their other movies;  making this a highly enjoyable movie that exceeds, by far, some of the more heavily promoted theatrical releases of the same genre. Perfect movie for a rainy, boring day. Watch it multiple times and just feel good about being yourself and appreciate those around you.
