 Lousy manager mode!!  Playing in manager mode is just a full screen graphic. Quite honestly, playing on my commodore 64 was more fun. I remember Apple computer released a game in the 80s that had a manager mode that had GRAPHICS. And today's game makers can't achieve this?  Graphics average. Pitching is fairly accurate... when your pitcher gets tired or rattled, the aim gets shakey and harder to hit your mark... I like that. This also allows for pitches to be balls, which leads to the "ever so rare" BASE ON BALLS.  Hitting is done by pulling back on the R3 stick and releasing to swing. You can't aim WHERE to swing. Ultimately, it's too easy.   Also, controls, at times, are WAY TOO CONFUSING. I was batting one time, bumped something ???? and my RIGHT HANDED batter switched to a LEFTY!!??   This game is a mess.  Not to mention, after playing 4 games of a 5 game series, while loading up game 5, it locked up on me.  BOO HISS! AND GIVE US A MANAGER MODE WITH GRAPHICS!!
