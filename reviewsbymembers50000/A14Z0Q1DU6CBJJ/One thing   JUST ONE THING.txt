 I wanted to give this movie 4 stars. It WAS GOOD. I was into the movie the whole time. Jodie Foster is a reliable STAR who almost always chooses great movies... in fact... I actually can't think of a movie that she's been in that was 'BAD'. They've all been good and this was no exception.  But! As the title of my review suggests!! One THING!! Just one thing ruined it for me. It was a 4 star movie UNTIL...  The movie centers around a woman who is returning to the United States with her dead husband and her daughter aboard a very large plane that she has inside information about because she designs planes. When her daughter turns up missing, the suspense is on... very early I might add... which makes for a very fun viewing experience.  Is she crazy? Did her daughter die along with her husband and she's imagining her? Has her daughter been abducted by a group of arabs on the plane?  It is a whirlwind movie but I have to tread a very thin line with my review so as not to ruin it for anyone who hasn't seen it, but when the truth begins to unfold... when it all comes to a head and we realize what is going on... it is very VERY VERY THIN!   I don't want to ruin it for people, but the way it unfolded was such a disappointment to me, it took the fun right out of it. No, not the cliche' ending... but the cliche' explanation for EVERYTHING!! When the plot is revealed... and you'll know what I'm talking about when you see it, you too will say... that was really weak and you'll literally want to slap the PILOT for being so stupid. You mean to tell me that he fell for that ridiculous story?? That was the brilliant plan?  Although Jodie Foster is fantastic. When isn't she? She saves the movie. Although... It was a small 4 minute scene about 1:05:00 into the movie that took me right off of that plane and wished that the writers had spent another week and thought a little more about the way the movie unfolded before they went ahead with production.
