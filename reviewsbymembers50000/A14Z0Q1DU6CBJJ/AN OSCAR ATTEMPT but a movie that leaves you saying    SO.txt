 Seabiscuit looked as though it could have been a really good movie. There haven't been a whole lot of stories about horse racing. So, it seemed to be a novel idea. On the good side, The movie has marvelous production value and is obvious the makers were attempting to achieve an oscar for their studio. But, that is the only thing I can say in its favor. The story has characters and themes that you SHOULD care about and root for. Red Pollard (played by TOBEY MAGUIRE), is a consiment underdog. An ill-tempered, former bare hand boxer who has been dismissed and forgotten his entire life. Yet, the movie never truly executes this feeling, or resolves it. Seabiscuit wins race after race, showing signs of super intelligence when it comes to racing and competing. Knowing when it's losing and not liking it, and we're supposed to feel as if it were some kind of underdog. The horse is fast, a top notch racer and it never shows any sign of anything different. What the movie needed more than anything was more moments between Pollard and Seabiscuit. Bonding. The movie needed to show them becoming one, becoming a team and more importantly, becoming inseparable friends. In this, it failed. It tried. But, it failed. The biggest dramatic moment in the entire yawner of a movie is when Red Pollard is the victim of a freak accident that you see coming a mile away, (and so should have he if he'd been around horses all his life) injuring his leg and being told he'll never be able to race again. All in all, the true problem with SEABISCUIT is the story itself or the script itself. And it's biggest failure is its attempt to make the viewers believe that horse racing is something OTHER than a game for the sole purpose of making the super rich, RICHER.
