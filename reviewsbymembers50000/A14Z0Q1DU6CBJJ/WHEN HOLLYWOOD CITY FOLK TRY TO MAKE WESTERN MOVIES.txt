 Ugh... I had such high hopes for AMERICAN OUTLAWS... but they were shot down within ten minutes.  The instant that Jessee James rode through the middle of a civil war battle as if he were Walker Texas Ranger or Steven Seagal, I rolled my eyes and the movie never won me back. I'll never understand how some movies go forward into the production process without first having a story to tell??  After watching AMERICAN OUTLAWS, it made me wonder if the producers even researched the James/Younger Gang?  Did they visit their local library?  Did they interview any of the existing family members to come up with some cool antidotes?  Or did they just decide it was time for a western.  Then they sat in their carpeted Hollywood offices, threw together a cliche' riddled script in a couple of weeks, gathered up a handful of young good-looking newcomers and went to work.  I BET MY MONEY ON THE LATTER. The script was horrible!  No emotional build-up.  No sub-plots.  Absolutely zero realism.  Test-audiences probably didn't like the first viewing, so they started chopping. Oh, how HOLLYWOOD has changed. The only good thing to come from this is that the performances weren't bad.  They just had nothing to work with.  They made the best of a lousy thing.  I give high marks to Gabriel Macht.  Low key, but out of all the talent involved, I think he'll be someone to watch in the future.
