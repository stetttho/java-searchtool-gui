 I hadn't heard of "100 GIRLS" before it appeared on the shelf at my local video store.  Barely promoted.  Just as Porky's had been. It wasn't a great movie, but of all the bubble gum teens movie that keep popping up in movie theatres, this one exceeds them because it holds no punches.  They talk about anything and everything.  Sex IS frank and honest, just like this movie. A beautiful cast of women of all kinds, including: Katherine Heigl, Emmanuelle Chriqui, Larisa Oleynik, Jaime Pressly, Marissa Ribisi, Aimee Graham, Kristen Herold and Kristina Anapau.  Good comedic overtones and an intriging story that isn't all that predictable. The only thing that bothered me in the movie was the voice-over by Jonathan Tucker.  It wasn't a bad job or a bad voice-over, but at times it was kindof corny. Other than that, an enjoyable movie to watch, and if I had any suggestions to improve it, it would've been even dirtier.
