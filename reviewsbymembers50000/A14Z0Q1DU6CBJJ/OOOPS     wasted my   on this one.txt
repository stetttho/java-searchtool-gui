 Starts off like might be pretty sexy.  Yet, only about 15% of the movie involves anything remotely sexy.  In fact, the first real scene doesn't happen until about thirty minutes in. The sexiest scene in the movie involves the two main characters entering a hotel room where the woman (Jennifer Burton) has tied up a beautiful blonde (Jennifer Behr).  Without introductions, talks the man into pleasuring her.  Well... it could've been sexy, had the director not cut back and forth like a jack-rabbit sitting on a shot for no longer than three or four seconds. Well... if there isn't a lot of sex and the scenes aren't all that sexy, then you better have a well written story.  Uh... It isn't.  Picture quality is terrible and the writing is deplorable.
