 Good thing I rented it first.  One of my great loves of film comes from the desire to be taken away to another world. To be introduced to amazing new characters and creatures. To be taken away from my 40 hours a week job, my fill up the gas run of the mill life.  I had hoped that MIRRORMASK would do this for me, if just for 2 hours. From the makers of LABYRINTH and DARK CRYSTAL, I figured I couldn't go wrong. Yet, upon putting the DVD and starting to watch with bright eyes, I'm not sure how long it was, but my interest was gone.   The movie is a virtual extravaganza of beautiful imagery and animation mixed with live action. Unfortunately, none of these animated characters manage to portray a single thread of emotion in me.   MIRRORMASK is like a painting that does nothing for you. I watched the entire film and wasn't emotional moved ONE BIT. This, despite the fact that the movie is about a girl who has to find a mask in order to save the kingdom and return to her dieing mother.  Unlike Dark Crystal, labryinth and even the Muppet movie, relation and feeling for the characters in MIRRORMASK are non-existent. This, to me, is the most important thing in a film. If you can't get into the character, the movie is a complete loss. Thus, despite all the beautiful imagery and dazzling new animation, the movie to me, was a complete and total loss.  I want my 2 hours back.
