 This collection of 100% dance rhythms is one of Gloria's overall best.  Every track incorporates the Latin sounds that made Gloria a star, but each  stands apart from the previous. Tracks like 'Heaven's What I Feel', 'Oye',  'Don't Stop', and 'Don't Let This Moment End', showcase the power of the  album and why it was such a success on the dancefloors of the world. With  remixes and Spanish counterparts ('Cuba Libre' is SO much better in  Spanish) included, this disc can be played over and over and the only thing  that will get tired are your feet from all the dancing. Viva Gloria!
