 Although I much more prefer the original version of this album, this  second outing from the Corrs is still good. The remix of 'Dreams' is just  bad, but the great remix of 'So Young' more than makes up for it. The remix  of 'What Can I Do' is nice change from the original, but, again, not as  good.  If you can find the first version of the album, stick with that. If  not, keep in mind that 'So Young' is better on this version and hope that  the Corrs skip remix albums in the future. Check out "Forgiven not  Forgotten" or "Unplugged" to see why this group is so great.
