 Marta Sanchz's first, true "Greatest Hits" album is filled with just that, hits, but also has some unnecessary remixes. This 2-CD set starts off with the high-energy dance hit "Quiero Ms De Ti" and also includes such key tracks as the great "Desconocida", the super-catchy "Desesperada", "Arena Y Sol", "De Mujer A Mujer", and the feel-good "Moja Mi Corazn". There is also a decent duet with Italian Andrea Bocelli and the set also includes the hit "Dime La Verdad" (almost a replica of Madonna's 1994 "Secret") as well as the gospel-flavored "Amen". This first disc is a must for any fan of dance music. Marta's vocals are clear and crisp and ideal for anyone who is learing Spanish, although you do not need to understand the language to enjoy this album. Now for the remix CD. If not for the remixes, this album would have received 5 stars. There are 5 uselss remixes of "Desconocida" (one which is already found on her 1998 album by the same name) plus an English version, which pales in comparison to the original. There is also an English and extended remix of "Desesperada", an English version of "De Mujer A Mujer", and four remixes of "Quiero Ms De Ti", only one of which is worth listening to (the LB Classic Mix). All in all, this is an excellent Hits collection, despite the extra remix disc. This is a great way to be introduced to Marta Sanchz and you can easliy see why she is one of Spain's hottest divas.
