 This second collection of hits by Gloria Estefan shows why she is still considered one of the biggest and best divas in the business, even after 15 years. The album includes the great dance tracks like the classic "Turn The Beat Around", the catchy single remix of "Party Time", and the phenomenal "Heaven's What I Feel". Also included is the single remix of "I'm Not Giving You Up" (the 1996 original from "Destiny" is even better) and the huge club smash "Oye" which shows why Gloria is considered the Queen of Latin Music. Like most hits packages, the set also includes three new songs. "You Can't Walk Away From Love" sounds as if it should have been included on "Destiny" and does take a few spins before it starts to grow on you.  "I Got No Love" is a smooth track which touches on Gloria's R&B side and the standout of the three new tunes is the explosive, dance-floor destined "Out Of Nowhere". Here we hear some of Gloria's best vocals in years, as well as some steamy lyrics, both of which, combined with the great music, shows Gloria heading in a new direction. This will be a highly-requested song by all club-goers.  However, the album does have a few drawbacks. One is the inclusion of "If We Were Lovers", an English version of the superb "Con Los Aos Que Me Quedan". This version pales in comparison to the original and just does not flow and seems forced in English. The version of "Everlasting Love" is not the great, better dance version found on the single (even though it says 'video version' on the insert). They really should have put the remix here and not the original. Also, the exclusion of her 1999 Grammy-nominated "Don't Let This Moment End" is a bit of a let-down. However, the rest of this album more than makes up for it's few flaws. Gloria Estefan continues making incredible music and this collection of her best of the past 9 years showcases her great talent and is sure to be only the second in a many volume of hits.
