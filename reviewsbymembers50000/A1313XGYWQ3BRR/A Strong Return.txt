 I bought this CD without knowing any song from it, but I had Marcela's  first album and so I knew this was going to be as good as the first. I was  right. One of the hidden treasures from Argentina, this CD has some very  catchy songs with extremely strong vocals. Stand out tracks are "Luna  Bonita", "Para Toda La Vida" and the title track. If you are  looking for some new Latin music and are tired of the mainstream artists,  definitely check Marcela out; you won't be sorry.
