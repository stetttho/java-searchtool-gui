 Stepping out of the Boyzone spotlight, Ronan gives us one of the best pop albums in recent years. On the strength of the 1999 single "When You Say Nothing At All", the disc is packed-full of catchy tracks that won't leave your CD player for quite a while. The outstanding single "Life Is A Rollercoaster" is probably the strongest track, with its great harmonies and catchy choral hook. It is so good in fact, it is hard to get past it and let the rest of the disc play. Another key track is "Heal Me", a great dance tune that will also require mutliple spins. "Keep On Walking" with its traditional Irish opening, really showcases Ronan's vocal talent, while the lyrically strong "The Way You Make Me Feel" (co-written by Bryan Adams) is a pop ballad at its best. If you're a fan of Boyzone or not, this album deserves a listen and hopefully American audiances will give Ronan the chance at success he truly deserves.
