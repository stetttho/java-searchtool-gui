 This is one of the most complete Greatest Hits albums around. Every Taylor  Dayne hit is on this, without a single one missing. Although there are no  new recordings, the remixes of "Say A Prayer" and "Tell it  to My Heart" give a new spin on some classics. With ballads like  "Love Will Lead You Back" and dance hits like "Can't Get  Enough of Your Love", once you put this CD in your player, you won't  be taking it out for a while.
