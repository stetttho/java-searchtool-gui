 The Irish quartet started their journey with this outstanding disc. With  key tracks like 'Runaway', 'This is the Right Time', "Love to Love  You', and the title track, this album really shows why the Corrs are so  huge (outside of the US that is). The instumental tracks are usually passed  over, but when you get to one of the 9 tracks with vocals, you'll be  hooked. Also take a listen to "Talk on Coners" if you like this  one.
