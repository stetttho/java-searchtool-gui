 You probably have never heard of her, but Marcela Morelo is one of the  best Latin singers around. This debut album is so powerful with some of the  catchiest songs, it is amazing she has never caught on. The key tracks are  the outstanding "Corazon Salvaje", "Fuerza del Engano"  and "No Me Lastimes". With typical indigineous flutes and  latin/pop rhythms, it is easy to see why this CD was so huge in Spain.  Hopefully the US and Latin America with get with the program.
