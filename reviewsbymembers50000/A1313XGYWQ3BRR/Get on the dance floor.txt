 This is definitely one of Gloria Estefan's best remix singles ever. The '7" Remix' really is outstanding and shows why this song was such a huge dance hit.  The 2 'Classic Paradise' mixes are also great. I searched  for this for almost 5 years and it was well worth the wait. This is  definitely a dance-around-the-room-at midnight-with-your-friends theme!
