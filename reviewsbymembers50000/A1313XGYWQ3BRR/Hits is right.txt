 This compilation definitely belongs in every CD collection. Gloria's  catchy pop/latin rhythms shows why she is such a huge international star.  All of her big hits are here, from 'Rhythm is Gonna Get You', '1-2-3', to  'Get on Your Feet', but it does leave off key tracks like 'Bad Boy', and  'Live For Loving You'. The new ballads 'Always Tomorrow' and 'I See Your  Smile' are very good and are valid reasons for fans who already own the  other CD's to buy this set, but 'Go Away' is kind of a waste of space.  However, if you only own one Gloria CD, this is the one.
