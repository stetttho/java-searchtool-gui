 BBmak's debut really sets them apart from American trio's such as LFO with their outstanding harmonies and very catchy themes. The stand-out songs on  the disc are the first single 'Back Here', 'Again', 'Next Time', 'I Can  Tell', and "Love is Leaving'. BBmak are surely going to be compared to  the present slew of Boy Bands, but with their amazing harmonies and smooth  voices, they are one step above the others. The songs may sound similar on  the first listen and although the lyrics are not the most profound, give  the disc a deserved second play and you'll see why these three guys are not  your typical Boy Band.
