 After having had huge success in Europe, Ronan Keating looks poised to conquer the US. This first single from "Ronan" has already shot to Number 2 in the UK and is sure to reach those heights here. Written by Gregg Alexander (formerly of New Radicals) and Rick Nowels, also responsible for his "Life Is A Rollercoarster" gem, "Lovin' Each Day" shows off Ronan's stellar voice, showing he can do much more than the trademark Boyzone ballads. The song is full of energy from the first note and its catchy chorus will linger in your head for hours after. The lyrics of a total-devotion/don't-ever-leave-me love shine from the start and leave you wanting to hit the play button over and over. This is a high-energy summer song, one of those classic tracks you listen to with the windows rolled down and "lovin'" life. Also make sure you check out the B-side of "When You Say Nothing At All", the great ballad from the 1998 "Notting Hill" film. This single will give you just a taste of why Ronan has had such success in the rest of the world. Listen up, America-Ronan is about to explode!
