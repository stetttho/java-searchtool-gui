 One of the very few complete Greatest Hits CD's around, this collection  includes all of Jody's hits. It has the great radio remix of "I'm the  One You Need", plus key tracks like "Everything" and  "Don't You Want Me". It also contains some very good dance  remixes, which further add to the diversity of the disc. If you like dance  music with a twist of R & B, this is the compilation for you.
