 After a three-year hiatus, Jon returns will an album true to the style that made him a star. The great lead-off single "Stop" is one of  his most dance-oriented tracks ever and really shows how he has expanded  his repitoire. Other notable tracks include the upbeat dance "Love's  About to Change My Mind", which sounds like it could have been  recorded by the Backstreet Boys. Other good dance tracks "Better Part  of Me" and "Speak to the Wind" sound like they could have  appeared on Cher's "Believe" set. Of course there are the  signature ballads "Break the Walls", "There's No Sunshine  Anymore", and "When You're Gone" which really stand out.  Since he was gone for so long and has said he auditioned a myriad of songs,  it would have been nice to have a few more original tracks, although the  Spanish track "Dentro de ti" is pretty good. Also includes a  hidden bonus salsa remix of "Asi" (the Spanish version of  "Stop"). This is a very good album, with catchy hooks, great  vocals and decent lyrics, and will hopefully reintroduce Jon back into  mainstream pop.
