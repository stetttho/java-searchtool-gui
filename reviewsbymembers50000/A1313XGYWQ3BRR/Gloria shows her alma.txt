 Although it does lack the traditional upbeat/dance numbers that Gloria fans are used to, this album is still an outstanding collection.  The first play may leave you confused as some of the songs sound similar, but on the  second listen, themes like "Como Me Duele Perderte","Te  Tengo A Ti", "Tres Gotas De Agua Bendita", and of course the  phenomenal "No Me Dejes De Querer" really stand out.  It's no  huge party album that fans come to expect, but still an album well worth  buying. Gloria es la reina!
