 This second repackaging of Jody Watlety's hits is a fairly complete collection. With her smooth voice, Jody shoes she can still keep up with the R & B stars of today. Like her "Greatest Hits" album, it includes the key tracks, "Everything", "I'm The One You Need", and "Don't You Want Me". This disc however includes her neglected track "Off The Hook", but leaves out some of her better songs like "I Want You", and the sultry "When A Man Loves A Woman". If you are into dance/pop/R & B, this is a great album to have. If you are a Jody fan but don't have any of her stuff, stick with the more-complete "Greatest Hits".
