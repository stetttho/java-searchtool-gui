 I enjoyed the Rhapsody trilogy, at least enough to finish the trilogy. I found all of the books to be longer than they needed to be, and quite overrated. To compare the books to the work of Tolkien is just insulting. That said  I would agree that the trilogy is better than many out today in Fantasy and Science Fiction. However, I am so tired of the perfect, beautiful heroine who fights like a skilled warrior and has the compassion of a thousand saints. I guess that's my first problem with the books. Rhapsody's traveling companions are quite uninteresting to me as well; just characters I've seen before. That said, out of the three books Destiny was the most enjoyable to me. The story line and plot were more interesting and there were some surprises I enjoyed.
