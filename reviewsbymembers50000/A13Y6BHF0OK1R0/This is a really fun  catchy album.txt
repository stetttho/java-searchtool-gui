 This is a really fun, catchy and extremly enjoyable album. As one reviewer has already stated, there's something for everyone. I love her voice, the range of styles explored and everything .  A Moment like this will always have a special place in my heart, as I think it's a perfect song that suits her voice perfectly. I also really like Beautiful Disaster, though apparently everyone else thought it was a bit weak.I also like Miss Independent quite a bit, though when I first heard it I didn't like it at all. I do think the album was a bit over produced and that is the reason I'm not giving it 5 stars. I really look forward to hearing more from Kelly in the future.And to address one reviewer's criticism specifically: Kelly co-wrote 2 of the songs on the album in case that escaped your attention. Quite a few artsists never write their own material much less on their first album.
