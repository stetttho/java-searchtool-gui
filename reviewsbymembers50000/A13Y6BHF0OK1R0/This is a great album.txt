 The songs on this cd are full of regret, sorrow and bittersweet memories. And Alison pulls it off beautifully. A Ghost in This House has got to be one of my favorites of the pack. It's beautiful and it's devastating. I also love the song Maybe. The instrumentation is every bit as mournful as Alison's voice and lyrics. The title track I like also. To me there's not a bad song on the cd, and I shake my head wondering what to say to the reviewers that so thoroughly disliked this. It's Allison at her best.
