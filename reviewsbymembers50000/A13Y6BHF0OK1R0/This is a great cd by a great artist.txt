 Laura Love is great, and this is one of her best reordings to date. Sometimes Davey wins is probably my favorite cut on the album, followed closely by her cover of Lauro Nyro's classic. As one reviewer has already pointed out, Laura Love not only has an amazing voice, but is a powerhouse bass player as well. If anyone out there wants to listen to someone who has a fantastic voice, an amazing band, and a real talent when it comes to playing an instrument, this is the cd for you.
