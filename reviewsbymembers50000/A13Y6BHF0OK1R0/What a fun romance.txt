 This epic book was so much fun to dig into. Miss Woodiwiss does a great job with setting and character creation, that I wish I found in other romances. Frankly I don't, not even in the author's other books I have tried. I give this book 4 stars because it was a bit long in places, but otherwise it was a satisfying read.
