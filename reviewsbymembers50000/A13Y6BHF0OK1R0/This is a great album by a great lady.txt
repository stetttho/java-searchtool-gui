 Pam Tillis selected some wonderful songs from her Dad's collection which she sang with the emotional depth each called for. I love all the songs and each for different reasons. I ain't never, Detroit City and Mental Revenge are clear standouts, but they are all great. There's not one that I get bored with, or find myself skipping.
