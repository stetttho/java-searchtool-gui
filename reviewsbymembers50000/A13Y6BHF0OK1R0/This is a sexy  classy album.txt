 I've loved k.d. lang's sultry, beautiful voice for some time now, but I have never heard it put to better use than here. She excels on these jazzy, sexy songs. So does Tony Bennett, with his strong smooth voice, so different than k.d.'s, yet so complimentary. This album is one I listen to over and over again, and am so glad to have in my collection.
