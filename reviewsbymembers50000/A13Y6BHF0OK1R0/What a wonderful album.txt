 What a great album by such a great songwriter and performer. Thank God Rodney Crowell has enough integrity to not fall into the Nashville trap of mediocrity and manufactured hits that lack any sort of genuine emotion. Crowell definitely deserves more success than what he has achieved. I love this cd. To pick favorites is almost impossible for me, as they are all great songs, but I guess After All This Time is mine, followed closely by It's Such a Small World, followed by well, everything else.
