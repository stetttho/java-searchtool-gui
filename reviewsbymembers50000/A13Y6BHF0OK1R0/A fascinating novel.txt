 This novel is fascinating and beautifully written. Yes, you have to be read through a mid size book, but why is that such a problem for people? The writing, the mystery and the setting are all enough to be page turners for me.It is so refreshing to come across a book that doesn't fall back on cliches. I'm planning on rereading it, as well recommending it to friends.
