 Distant Camera, Dusty Springfield Again and Silver & Gold move me in a way a lot of overproduced, gorgeoulsy orchastrated cds did not. I am not a die hard fan of Neil Young. I only own a handful of his work,but this one really stands out for me. The introspection, the maturity and the simplicity in his delivery has a very real power. It amazes me that so many fans don't like this cd or find the songs to be "not very good" but to each their own I suppose. Understated, introspective music is not for everyone, but I'm glad I picked this up.
