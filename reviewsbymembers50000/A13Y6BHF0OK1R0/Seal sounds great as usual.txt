 I picked this, my second Seal cd up over the weekend, and I really enjoy it. His voice is smooth, the arrangements are great and in all but one instance (in my opinion) the songs here are great. I love his cover of Walk on By. How fantastic to breathe life into that song, which had always sounded rather flat to me. I also enjoyed hearing his song Human Being for the first time. And as many have commented, it is so nice to hear something of substance being performed by a pop musician! I hope he continues in the same vein (style wise) for a long time to come.
