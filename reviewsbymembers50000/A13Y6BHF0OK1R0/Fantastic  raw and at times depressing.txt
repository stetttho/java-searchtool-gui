 This cd is all of the above and more to me. At first listening to this cd, I was frustrated that Lynne's voice continued to trail off into an almost inaudible whisper on various songs, and I also found myself uncomfortable with the confessional tone of many of the pieces. Upon many more listens I have grown to really love this cd. Her voice sounds very bluesy to me, and the writing on such songs as "Thought it would be easier" "leaving" and "Why can't you be" are first rate. Her voice is raw and perfect for the songs chosen, though I do have to strain to hear her in places. I do love this cd, but I do not listen to it as often as some of her others, because it can be depressing. Too depressing, but her talent was finally acknowledged as a result of this cd, and I'm glad the world took note.
