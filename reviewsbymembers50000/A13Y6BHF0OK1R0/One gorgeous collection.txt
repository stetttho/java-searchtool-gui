 I first heard Beth Orton several years ago when I got her first her album Trailer Park. Though I was blown away by several of the songs, some of them did not impress me overly. This year a friend told me about the collection and how great it was. Boy, were they right! There's not a bad song on here. Her voice is so beautiful and so emotive it's hard to not get lost in it. Songs such as Thinking About Tomorrow, Dolphins and Concrete Sky are some of my favorites, followed closely by Stars all seem to weep, She cries your name and Stolen Car. This cd is the best purchase I've made recently and will be playing for quite some time.
