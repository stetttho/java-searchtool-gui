 This album has songs that keep me interested from beginning to end. That in and of itself is a feat. Each song is different and each song is done well. Her voice is great, her writing is even better. My favorite cuts are Earth to Sky, I dreamed I saw St. Augustine and track #1 ( I can't remember the title) This is a wonderful cd, and I recommend it to anyone reading these reviews.
