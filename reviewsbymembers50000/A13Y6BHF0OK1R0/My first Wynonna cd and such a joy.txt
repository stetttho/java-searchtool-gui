 This was my first Wynonna cd, and it most certainly will not be my last. Her voice is phenomenal and the styles and variations from song to song impressive. I love the title track as well as It All Comes Down to Love and You Are. That said I don't think there's a bad song on the cd. Though one or two of the songs seemed a bit overproduced, it didn't effect my sheer joy in listening to a real vocalist singing quality music from the soul. I hope this cd does well for Wynonna both commercially and emotionally, as she's had discouraging moments with the music scene in the past. As for Nashville and country music, I hope Wynonna knows that this release is better than 99% percent of schlok that's come out of that town in the past 2 years.
