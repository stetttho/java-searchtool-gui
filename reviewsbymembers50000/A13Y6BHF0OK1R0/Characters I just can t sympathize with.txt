 I found Kissy Mellors unsympathtic and impossible to relate to. I tried. I really, really tried to like her but her motivations were unclear in so many instances. I did like the way Junior was written. He could have been a real stereotype and he wasn't. He had some depth. Some complexity. I enjoyed this book enough to finish it, and I was interested in where the plot was ultimately going. But I have no lingering curiosity, no sense that if there's a sequel I'd have to get it.
