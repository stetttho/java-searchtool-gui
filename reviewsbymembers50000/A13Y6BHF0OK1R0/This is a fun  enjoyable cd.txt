 This, my first Pat Green cd is a lot of fun. I love Wave on Wave. It expresses so much so simply I have difficulty understanding how people can trash it, but lots of people do. I admit, I also like the catchy upbeat sound. Additionally, I really enjoy Poetry, quite a bit and All The Good Things Fade Away. The hidden, acoustic version of Wave on Wave was a nice surprise, as well. I fail to see how so many people claim  this album sounds like Nashville. Have you guys no idea what some of the current "stars" sound like with producer picked back up singers and bands and over produced vocals? This is not it! It's just a really good cd by an artist who isn't just writing about drinking and partying all night.
