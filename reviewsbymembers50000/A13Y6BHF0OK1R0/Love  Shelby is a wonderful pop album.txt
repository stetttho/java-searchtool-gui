 I really enjoyed this cd. Though her I am Shelby Lynne was more raw and more passionate, she chose to try something new with this cd. She tried to do catchier songs with more production and instrumentation, and she succeeded. A lot of people never gave her a chance because they were expecting I am Shelby Lynne Part 2. This is unfortunate. Jesus on a Greyhound, Killin Kind and Wall in Your Heart are excellent songs and the remaining songs are good as well.
