 Unlike many reviewers, I didn't buy this book to get a perspective on witchcraft or paganism. I picked it up hoping for a good gothic read, with some creepy plot turns for good measure. What I got was a somewhat dull, and very predictable book. I enjoyed some of the secondary characters, and the descriptions of the French Revolution. However, I did not find Herculine's "secret" to be surprising at all, or all the events afterwards. I predicted most of them, and for that I am giving it 3 stars only.
