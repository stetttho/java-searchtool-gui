 I love all three of Sara's previous albums, but not this one! I think her voice is best suited for traditional country music, but the fans were not responding to her first two, so she had to go in the direction of pop to avoid getting dropped by her label. Personally, I think Born to Fly was a coherent, fun album for her to be proud of, and I love it. I do not feel the same about Restless. If it were just the cross over factor, I could get over it, but it's not. It sounds too much like everything else coming out of Nashville: inauthentic songs that are made to get airplay and forgotten 5 minutes later. If she was going for sales with this, as she has admitted she has, I guess she succeeded. I hope she tries for quality next time around. She's got an amazing voice which just is not used to it's fullest here,
