 I am halfway through this book, and I am really impressed. The story is one I don't see often: no shrinking, beautiful virgin with a heart of gold who will be seduced by a vaguely dangerous, but brutally handsome man who needs to be tamed. The heroine is smart, unusual and happy enough with her life when her hero shows up. As a previous reviewer pointed out, there is humor in this book, as well as some passion and a lot of adventure. If you want something different, yet still enjoyable, this would be it.
