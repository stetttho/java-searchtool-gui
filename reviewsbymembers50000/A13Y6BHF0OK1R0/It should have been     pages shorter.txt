 As many reviewers have remarked, the last three hundred pages are so painful to get through. Absolutely painful,mind numbing rubbish. Watch as our perfect heroine saves the world and displays an array of talents and skills a super hero in a comic book universe wouldn't even have ! This is too bad because for the first part of the book we see Phedre develop in her training, master some of her demons, and show just how fallible she is as a human. Her interaction with Joscelin I really enjoyed. Out of all the characters I enjoyed Joscelin the most actually. The sexual content of this book is mentioned by many who have read the book. It's there in varying degrees, especially in the first part of the book. The author did a good job of making such scenes interesting, though erotic is not the word I would use to describe them. Apparently many people would. I finished this book out of determination and not much else, and I have no intention of reading the rest of the series. Where the sterling reviews come from I can't say. Though Phedre starts off as a unique and interesting character, by the end of the book she is similar to so many others: perfect, beautiful and destined for both glory and self sacrifice.
