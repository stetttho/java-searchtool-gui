 I have many excellent cds from all genres in my collection, but this is by far my favorite. Stones in the Road is a wonderful, thoughtful song reminding the listener that each action, each person makes a difference. Jubilee, Shut up and Kiss me and Pirate Days are fun songs I listen to and enjoy, while John Doe #24 is a heart wrenching song that startles me with it's beauty and heartbreak.  MCC has gone on to do at least 3 more cds since this was released (maybe more, I'm tired and not counting)and though they are all outstanding, this is my favorite. On Stones in the Road she mixes uptempo songs with slow, thought provoking and introspective ones, and she does it brilliantly.
