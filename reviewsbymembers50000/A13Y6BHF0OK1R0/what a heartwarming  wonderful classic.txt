 I had been aware of Peter Beagle before actually getting around to reading him. This summer, I came across two of his books, a fine and private place and Tamsin. Tamsin was filled with such warmth, such an understanding of what it is to be young and at times overwhelmed. I love Jenny, her cat Mister Cat and her friend Meena, not to mention the inhabitants of their farm. Few books in recent memory have touched me the way this one did, and I would reccommend it to anyone.
