 This cd is wonderful. As a reviewer already said, but is really true there isn't a bad song on this collection. Laura's bass playing is incredible, her vocal style unique and wonderful, and her songs are well thought out, catchy and iintelligent I would recommend to anyone considering this cd to get it. I could be here all day and still not say enough about Laura's music, and this cd in particular.
