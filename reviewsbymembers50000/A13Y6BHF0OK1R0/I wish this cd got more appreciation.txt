 I really wish this cd had gotten the appreciation it deserved. Her cover of Mandolin Rain is exquisite and the River and the Highway, as well as Tequila Mockingbird are superb as well. I thought Betty Got A Bass Boat to be completely out of place, and is why I'm not giving the cd five stars. That said, Pam's voice shines on this album and it is well worth her talent and anyone's time to check out.
