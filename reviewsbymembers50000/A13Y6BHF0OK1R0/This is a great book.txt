 This book has a little bit of everything: history, a look at two cultures at war with one another, great characterization, and a scathing description of imperialism and why it rarely works. I have read countless books in my life from "the classics" to romance, science fiction and everything in between. Rarely have I been so deeply satsified by a book as I was with this one.
