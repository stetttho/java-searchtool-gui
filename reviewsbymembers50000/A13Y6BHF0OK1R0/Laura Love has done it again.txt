 Laura Love has done it again! With each album she gets better and better and this is no exception! This audio narrative allows listeners a clear picture of Laura's past challenges through songs such as the title track, You Ain't Got No Easter Clothes, Behind The Door and We Are Not. Songs such as Freak Flag and Ain't No Power demonstrate Laura's determination to find strength and hope, and Satisfied and Hard Times are rock the house declarations of hope and beauty.   These songs are enjoyable not just lyrically, but because of the amazing instrumentation and variatons of style. No two songs sound exactly alike, with the last song being the stand alone melody wise, performed in the style and chorus of a spiritual.
