 This cd is great! I loved their first one, which many people compelled to label as "too commercial" and I love this one. Pages is a fantastic song, Safe in My Lover's Arms and Choose Your Partner are really dynamic well written songs. But as reviewers before me have said the real standouts of the albums are the instrumentals, and boy can all of these people play their instruments. Absolute virtuosos every single one and I am so glad they are making music!
