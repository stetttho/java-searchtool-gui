 In especially the first of this double-CD set, Ben Harper's gotten back to his roots where folk meets blues. In a reverse from his "Live from Mars" live compilation with the Innocent Criminals, the first (rather than second) disc is softer, more reflective, and lovelorn set of tracks; whereas the second is angrier, louder, and more politically-charged.  Having been a fan of Harper's more energetic side for a long time, I personally enjoyed the 2nd disc more. On this disc is the title track, which is a commentary of the current self-indulgence of national jingoism, dogmatic religiosity, and the war in Iraq. Also notable are "Better Way," a call to activism with Far-East Indian and reggae influences, the driving rock number "Engraved Invitation," and the '70s rhythm-and-blues-infused "Black Rain," which discusses the very current topic of Hurricane Katrina and the victims who were left behind in her wake. "Gather 'Round the Stone" is a beautiful elegy to those lost in war, and "Please Don't Talk About Murder While I'm Eating" is a bitterly tongue-in-cheek ode to annoying objects of love--or endearing objects of hate--but that paradoxical love-hate relationship has always been something Harper has explored well, and he doesn't disappoint here.  All in all, I recommend this latest offering; but as I did with the 1st disc from "Live from Mars," I'm finding that I'm wearing out the 2nd one on "Both Sides of the Gun."
