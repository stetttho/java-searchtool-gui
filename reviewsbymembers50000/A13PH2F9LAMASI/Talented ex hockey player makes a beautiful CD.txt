 Sam Roberts is a standout songwriter/guitarist whose first full-length CD is a rare gem in a bleak landscape of too-packaged, too-plastic pop tripe dominating the airwaves these days. I've read other reviewers' comparisons to other musicians; but he makes me think of Ben Harper without the reggae and all of the passion. His lyrics are full of soul and realism but still manage to resonate as deeply poetic: "We were born in a flame/we need a cool breeze and a summer rain/we are stealing from ourselves/we are feeding off ourselves." (from "Where Have All the Good People Gone?")  His style is mostly grass-roots rock with some folk and punk mixed in--with "Don't Walk Away Eileen" and "On the Run," he gives a tip of the hat to the post-garage bands that have been infiltrating the underground for the past few years. "Brother Down" and "Higher Learning" are standout songs, as is "Rareified" with its masterful integration of a rhythmic bassline and complementary guitar along with well-paced vocals.   Some of the songs are throwaway filler bits ("No Sleep" and the drudgerous "Dead End"); but overall, Sam Roberts proves himself to be a soulful and sincere voice that is refreshing and much-needed in today's overcommercialized music world. If you have to take a chance on one CD for which you haven't yet heard the songs on the radio, I definitely recommend it as a good purchase.  For anyone who's never heard of Sam Roberts and wants to take a chance on a promising new artist, this Bud's for you.
