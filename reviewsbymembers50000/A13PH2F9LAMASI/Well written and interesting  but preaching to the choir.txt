 Al Franken is a good writer and he makes his case against Bush & Co. well, but a lot of what he reveals re: Bill O'Rielly, Ann Coulter, Rush Limbaugh, and other right-wing nuts is just more preaching to the choir. People who buy this book (like myself) are likely to lean to the left politically, and thus won't learn anything new. It is a good read, though, particularly if you were like me and stuck on an airplane for a few hours with little else to read besides the SkyMall catalogue. :)
