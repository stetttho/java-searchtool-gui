 I really found this to be an excellent book and well worth a read for anyone interested in learning more about the specific types of circumstances and physical/mental pain that addicted people go through. Dr. Drew wrote this with a lot of compassion and insight, and rare spiritual perceptions, that listeners regular to Loveline rarely get to hear in my opinion. I not only listen to Loveline nightly, but I've also recently completed a Substance Abuse class in college; reading this book helped me put a lot of the clinical and statistical information I learned into a real-world, real-life perspective. Dr. Drew describes the life circumstances and struggles of numerous addicted patients, some for whom he came to feel passionately responsible and protective. Through his retelling, I learned their stories--mostly horrible and filled with sadness and abuse--and was thus able to associate the nameless, faceless addictions I'd learned about in college with some real living, breathing people I came to really feel for. If Dr. Drew is reading these reviews (which he admits to sometimes doing on Loveline), I hope he realizes what a wonderful impact he's having on his readers (including me), and how much many of us appreciate what he's shared in his excellent memoir. Kudos Dr. Drew!
