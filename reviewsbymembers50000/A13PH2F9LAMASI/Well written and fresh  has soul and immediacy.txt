 No doubt Rich Cohen felt the spirit of his late cousin moving through him as he related the story of her and her two close friends' experiences as Jewish partisans during World War II. In a world where Jewish people were antagonized, persecuted, and slaughtered in mass numbers by a dominant force of Nazi supporters who wanted to see all Jews dead, the three partisans endure seemingly insurmountable obstacles in their struggle for survival and fight for ultimate dignity and perseverance against their oppressors. Cohen captures all of this with the stung but valiant voice of a generation that was nearly lost to fascism and genocide, but held out and thrived. The partisans' story begins like that of so many Holocaust victims who find that their rights are gradually being dismantled by the Nazi order that has overtaken their countries; and ends in Palestine immediately following the war, where, having lost families and friends, the three partisans rebuild their lives from scratch on the hot sands of what is to become Israel. Their story is painful at times, victorious at others, but always wrought with the tension of being one frantic step ahead of the Nazi enemy. Cohen relates his cousin's story honestly--although he clearly regards his cousin and her friends as courageous and admirable, he does not portray the partisans as being perfect. In The Avengers, the partisans' world is filled with infighting, corruption, and another type of politics in which executions take place for partisans who don't toe the line of the commander in charge. His suggestions that his cousin and her two friends might have been a "love triangle" are a little salacious and tedious, but overall, the book is excellent and shouldn't be missed for anyone wanting to learn more about this much-ignored part of Jewish history during World War II.
