 The theme of this book that Western Civilization is abandoning reason really resonated for me. However, I think it would of worked better as a loose collection of essays instead of trying to hammer everything into one main thesis.  The main thesis as stated, that 1979 with the Iran revolution and the election of Marget Thatcher, is never really supported. Many of the chapters have nothing to do with 1979 being the turning point.  My favorite part was the last quarter of the book, in which Mr. Wheen attacks the left defending the terrorist attacks as something that America "deserved". He draws great comparisions with the lefts defence of Stalinist russa. As someone who tends to be liberal on many issues, I also find that the left wing trying to justify, and in ways supporting, terrorist actions completely unacceptable.
