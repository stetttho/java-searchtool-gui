 I realize this CD has been reviewed to death already, but I have to add my 2 cents. This is one of my favorite CDs of all time. I think much of it is nostalgia, when I listen to it it reminds me of early college and all the feelings associated with it. But the music itself was something so exciting and new to me at the time. It propelled me in to the world of industrial and techno music and I never turned back.  I loved this album so much I made a friend of mine listen to it and with today's critical ear it did seem a bit strange and musically primitive (it was a child of the late 80s) but for its time it was very progressive. And what an amazing musician Trent Reznor was and continues to be with all of his subsequent releases to this album. He always grows and amazes me as the listener. But this was a great album from which to build upon. For NIN fans (or fans of industrial/techno for that matter) this album is a must have in all collections.
