 This is a must read for anyone. Its written simply for anyone to understand yet the underlying principles can inspire thought and contemplation on the ideas of relativity and perspective. On the surface this book explores dimensions but it provokes thought about perspective and encourages you to evaluate your own perspectives. You can get anywhere from mild amusement from this book to philosophical life changing perspectives. In detail, Flatland is a classic story about a two dimensional square that discovers the world of a line, a point, a sphere and beyond. The square contemplates his role in society as a square and realizes that there is something else out there when a sphere comes to visit.
