 I grew in a Christian home but have recently begun the journey to convert to Judaism. I bought this book expecting an objective description of the differences between the two religions. Instead I found a very biased account of the differences in favor of Judaism. Now, this in and of itself, is not a bad thing. It is written from a Jewish authors perspective, but I found that the arguments were not well founded. For example, the author used arguments to try and disprove a point in chistianity that is a point of Judaism, one example is how the author tries to prove how Christians worship people while jewish people only worship God. The author uses the point that although many protestant denominations only worship Jesus they still worship humans, since in Judaism Jesus was not God. I think in order to make a point about Christianity one must come at it from the point of view of a Christian. Try and disprove it that way, and therefore the argument could be much more valid. Also, on a number of occasions the author would point out 'obvious' inconsistencies in biblical reference in the New Testament and even quote the passage, but then neglect to point out why and leave it up to the reader to determine why. This is why I am reading the book, to get the author's perspective of why!  I would encourange a person wanting to discover the true differences between these two religions to look elsewhere.
