 I loved her in Sister Soleil. I was listening to the radio one day and I heard "Kiss Kiss" and I knew it must be her, then I found out she made an album on her own called Dirty Little Secret. This album is amazing for someone that wants something a little different from the norm and someone that gets tired of the same old pop music. She has a unique and varied vocal style combined with interesting lyrics and music. I say if you're open to something new and exciting try this one out. Be sure to also check her out in Sister Soleil.
