 I love this cardio workout from the Firm. Its great to use on cardio only days. Everytime I finish this workout I feel like I have really worked hard because its an hour of exciting and fast paced aerobic work. Its challenging and the steps are interesting but not too complicated to pick up and do it the first time through. It is challenging enough that you don't get bored with it.  This is great to rotate with any of the firm sculpting or sculpting with cardio videos, especially super sculpt, the cross training video made with super cardio. Once you start working out with firm videos you'll want to collect them all.
