 I am not in school for Interior Design but I am very interested in learning more about it. This book was great for me because it provided a very complete overview of many areas of interior design. It addresses many issues at a high level such as color theory, the psychological impact of design on people, information about interior design for different types of spaces  (home, office etc...). This book is very much a text book. If you are in design school or serious about wanting to know more about interior design in general this is a great book to start with and use as a reference.
