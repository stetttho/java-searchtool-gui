 I discovered sex and the city only about a year ago. But since then i have managed to purchase all of the episodes on DVD and borrowed some from a friend on her copies of VHS. I have seen and loved every single episode. The first season is great. It is where we get to know the characters and begin to follow along in their journey of evolution. Its exciting to see where they began with their ideas about the show and the characters, if you haven't seen season 1 then you have to get this and watch it right away. This is a must own for all women and even my fiance seems to love this show! Although he doesn't want to admit it to his friends. But he couldn't stop watching episode after episode when I first got the DVD set.
