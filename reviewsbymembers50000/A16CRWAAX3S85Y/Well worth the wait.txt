 The Thomas Covenant series is by far my favorite fantasy series, having read it completely three times. In this first book of the concluding chronicles, Donaldson takes some time to wrap up some questions that were left hanging from the 2nd chronicles. With the new influx of 'evils' that have entered the land since last we checked in, there are many new questions to answer and mysteries to solve. I was concerned that another set of books would merely rehash some of the same plots with new names and slight changes, but Donaldson has managed to give new birth to familiar faces while adding interest with unexpected new plots and characters.   For Donaldson fans this is a must read, and for those of you considering starting this series, while Donaldson does do a good job explaining details and not assuming you remember much from past reads. I would recommend starting from the beginning if only to have the complete experience.
