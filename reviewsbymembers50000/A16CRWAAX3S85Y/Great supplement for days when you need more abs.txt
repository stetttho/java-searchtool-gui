 This video is a collection of 5 days of short ab work outs. They are ab sections taken from the classics of the Firm (Vol 1 - 6) This is a great supplement to any workout that doesn't include ab work or doesn't include enough of it. This is especially good to use with some of the firm videos that came out in 2002 that do not include any ab work.  I only wish there were more workouts on this one tape, but I guess you can get The Firms - More 5 day abs if you need variety.
