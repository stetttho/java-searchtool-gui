 I was required to use this text book in my Human Resource Management class for my MBA requirements. I do not have an HR background so a lot of the information presented in this book is new to me. The authors do a great job of presenting the material in an easy to understand manner. There are a lot of real life examples and case studies that are interesting to read and help to put the concepts in to perspective. This book will be a great reference in my professional life. It has employment laws, recruitment strategies, training and placement strategies to name a few. This is a must read for any HR professional and it really brings to focus the need for a stronger HR presence in companies to help them stay competitive.
