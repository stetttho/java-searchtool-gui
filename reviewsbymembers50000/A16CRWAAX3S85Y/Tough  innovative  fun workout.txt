 This workout is great if your looking for something new. Kelsie is dynamic in front of the camera and the time flew by very fast. This work out encorporates kick boxing and other innovative aerobic moves to maximize the fun factor. Light weights are used to help create shapely muscles but still light enough to use on cardio days as a cross trainer to a heavy weight workout. A tall step is used to effectively shape the lower body.  This workout is challenging and definitely fun for the advanced exerciser. But it can be modified for the beginner.
