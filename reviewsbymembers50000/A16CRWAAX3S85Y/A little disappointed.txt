 As an avid fan of Star Trek the Next Generation I was really looking forward to the release of this film. It had all the elements of a really good Star Trek film but it was lacking something. The plot was sub par and it took me a long time to really get in to what was happening. The movie dragged and I couldn't wait for it to be over. If it wasn't for the fact that it is a next generation movie I probably wouldn't have even given it 3 stars. The problem is that the storyline was one that could have been handled in a normal episode. In order for a story to be worthy of a movie it needs to have the complexity and drama of Star Trek First Contact (my favorite movie of all time). First Contact succeeded where Nemesis failed. Nemesis did not draw you in to the characters; I really didn't care what happened to anyone, including those that were regular next generation characters. The marriage scene was premature; I think that something like that would have been more effective at the end of the film. Perhaps have some tension leading up to it. The entrance of the characters could have been more dramatic if it had not happened all at the beginning. All in all, as a star trek fan you still must see this film but don't expect greatness. Its sad to think there probably won't be another next generation film to redeem this one and it will have to go out in such a dismal fashion.
