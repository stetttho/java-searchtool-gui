 Davies does an excellent job of taking us through on a journey through the life of a disturbed (yet probably realistic) New York man. The main character seems to stumble around in a haze of drinking and womanizing, all the while realizing he has the woman he wants but can't quite bring himself to be faithful and say those three dreaded words, "I love you". The main female character, or the girlfriend of the New York man seems unrealistically tolerant of his discretions, I don't know many woman that would be quite so amenable to that. However the book is entertaining and it provides an interesting look at a man I hope never to have to date.
