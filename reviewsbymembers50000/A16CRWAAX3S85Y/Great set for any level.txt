 I recently got this set of DVDs. I have been doing workouts on video like the Firm, Cathe, Pilates and Yoga for some time and I was looking for something different. These workouts are along the same lines as yoga or pilates in that they are lower impact and rely on the weight of the body for muscle shaping. Stretching is also an important factor in all of the workouts. Some of the workouts use weights to enhance the results and they all use a bar but the bar is not necessary and can be replaced by a piece of furniture or even a body shaping stick or other weighted balancing bar. The DVDs include a special Blast section which is actually a separate workout (not just a compilation) and it is a higher intensity short piece that is great to use to compliment your workouts or to do on their own. These workouts are great to do on their own or do combine with other activities that you may already be doing. They will enhance almost any exercise routine by adding some variety and extra challenges for the muscles.
