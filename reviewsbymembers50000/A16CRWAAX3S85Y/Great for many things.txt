 I've used these stamps to help document my trip to Israel. I created a scrapbook with all the pictures and other paper souveniers and this stamp kit was the perfect way to add hebrew text to my pages. The stamps are a nice quality and the box stores and saves them perfectly.  Also, during this time I was in the process of learning hebrew, these stamps were a great tool to help me memorize the letters and learn their meaning.
