 Strong bear made working out fun again. When I was doing it I was having fun and I wasn't watching the clock to see when it would be over. The moves are innovative and exciting and there is no hint of the hum drum here. This workout challenges each part of the body, it doesn't forget anything, even the feet get their moment to work. Inner thighs are emphasized in these videos and mine were sore for a day or two the first time I did this video. I would definitely recommend this for the advanced exerciser. Although a beginner could use light weights if they want a VERY good challenge.
