 This book outlines series of very simple yet effective means to learn and retain information. None of the concepts are particularly earth shattering but they are presented in such a way as to make you say Ah ha! Of course, why didn't I think of that? Buzan includes points on how to help you read faster, how to use mnemonics to remember simple to complex information and he explains mind maps and their role in learning. He points outs the flaws in traditional learning styles and note taking and encourages you to evaluate your learning style to best utilize the time and resources available. This book is great for students and professionals alike and I found it especially useful while studying for my MBA classes.
