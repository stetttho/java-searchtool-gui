 As a regular reader of sci-fi and fantasy, I have come across numerous variations on the time travel concept, Tim Powers, does it with originality and creativity that few others offer. If you're in the market for sci-fi/fantasy that is original and not just a retelling of the same old story with a new cover than this book is for you. From the moment I picked it up, I could not put it down.
