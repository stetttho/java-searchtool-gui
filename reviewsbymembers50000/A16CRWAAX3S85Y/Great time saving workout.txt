 This workout features the superb instruction of Suzan Harris. She led the first firm video and is still one of my favorites. This workout is only 45 minutes long but still very effective and complete. Every area of the body is worked with both aerobic and sculpting moves. The step work is fun and each time I do it I realize I have forgotten just how hard it is for a 45 minute video.  This is an older workout video but still very relevant and effective. The aerobics are low impact so good for most exercisers.
