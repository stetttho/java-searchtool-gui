 I have been dying to see this movie ever since I heard that The Lord of the Rings was going to be made into a movie. My brother in law saw them filming in New Zealand and was able to offer me some early tidbits to help me make it through the waiting period. I was a little nervous that all the waiting would make the movie seem a bit anti climatic. But I was quite pleased with the outcome. It is just the right mix of developing the characters, action and drama to appropriately portray on screen the story of such a classic novel as this one. I was quite satisfied with the accuracy to the real storyline. Although I realize a few changes had to be made, it seemed clear to me as to why the filmmakers choose to mix it up a bit.  To avoid ruining the movie for anyone, I won't go in to details on this point. Overall this movie was better than I had hoped for and I will definitely be buying this on DVD.
