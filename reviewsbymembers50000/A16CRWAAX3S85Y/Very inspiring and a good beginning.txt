 As a recent convert to Judaism I have been interested in learning about Kabbalah. A few of the previous books I have picked up have been hard to get in to and I ended up never making it much father than the back cover. This is the first book I've read that has made it accessible to the lay person.  Also, I wish I had read this book years ago. This is not a book that should be read only by Jewish people, this is something that could transform everyone. The idea is that the original Kabbalah author is Abraham who is the father (at least in theory) of just about every major religion today.  Even if you don't initially understand/believe/agree with some of the sources for the core concepts, all the concepts are quite fascinating and useful and I think if everyone practiced Kabbalah this world would realize its full potential.
