 As a recent convert to judaism I was trying to plan a jewish wedding that would encompass all truly jewish rituals and ceremonies, appease all in law etiquette requirements and at the same time encorporate some things I was familiar with while not offending any jewish sensibilities.  To help with this, this was a perfect addition to my resources. Trying to please the mother of my fiance who is very particular about etiquette while maintaining some sense of my own identity with the wedding was a challenge to say the least. This book helped by bringing in another perspective on all of the so called etiquette issues. No it is not a place for great details about the ceremony, for that I looked to Anita Diamantes - The New Jewish Wedding, but it did provide some insight on the head table, invitations and thank you cards which in my wedding became very important points for debate. While I do not think you will pick up this book and plan your wedding exactly by what it says, I do feel that it offers another perspective for anyone dealing with similar issues.
