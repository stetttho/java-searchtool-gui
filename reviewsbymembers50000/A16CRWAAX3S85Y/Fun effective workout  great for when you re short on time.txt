 This 48 minute workout delivers fun and weight training in one neat package, Heidi is back to lead us in this exciting new workout. A tall step is used to effectively shape the lower body. This step has been seen many times before but the exercises Heidi is doing is giving an entirely new twist to the routine. Never before have leg presses been so fun and challenging. Heidi also encorporates some kick boxing in the the routine to add some variety and its NOT the basic Aerobic Weight Training moves we are all used to seeing. This workout is great to use as a cross trainer, it emphasizes the weight training side and should not be used on dayys adjacent to other heavy weight workouts unless you substitute the weights with lighter weights.
