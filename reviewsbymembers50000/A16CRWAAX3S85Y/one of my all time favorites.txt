 This was one of the first fantasy novels (series) that I read so my review may be biased by my excitement for something new. But this has since remained one of my favorites that I have read time and time again. While some of Donaldson's plots in this book do tend to parallel some of the greats such as Tolkien, he does have some unique and interesting ideas.  The characters do develop quite strong and unique personalities, the strongest difference probably is that the main character, Thomas Covenant, at times is hateable. How often are authors brave enough to allow their main character to be so full of flaws. Throughout this novel and series, you get very attached to all characters while Donaldson does a nice job of preserving the mystery of if its all a dream by keeping all writing in Covenant's perspective. All fantasy readers must at some point pick up a Donaldson book and I hope they all choose the Chronicles of Thomas Covenant Series.
