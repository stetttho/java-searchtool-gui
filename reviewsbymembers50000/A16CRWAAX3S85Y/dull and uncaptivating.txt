 I would not call this book a work of fantasy art by any means. The storyline is rather unimaginative and follows the same paths as many fantasy stories written before. It's barely entertaining enough to compel you to read to the end. I finished it out of sheer strength of will.  What I want to know is what other works have these other reviewers been reading to find this book such a work of great fantasy fiction? And to even suggest this comes close to a league with Tolkien is blasphemy!
