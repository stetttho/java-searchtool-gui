 O.K. I've attended several seminars of Burgett's, so you could consider me a fan. I own several of his books--most of them baught from the back of the room--and this is my favorite one. His writing style, like his speaking style is to the point and personable. This book is a little rough around the edges--some typos, less flowing writing style--but the information (and I hope that is why you are considering this book) is sound, useful and inspiring. He followed this plan and it has worked very well for him.
