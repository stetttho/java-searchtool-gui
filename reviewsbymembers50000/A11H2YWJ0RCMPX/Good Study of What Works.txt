 Although I don't agree that every story analyzed in this book is great, I did find the commentary to be helpful. It has been said many times over that if you want to write good fiction, you need to read good fiction. However, this won't work if you don't analyze what you read as well. This book walks you through the process, providing sage advice from and excellent writer (Asimov) and world-class editor (Greenberg).
