 O.K. the book may not be that little, but is an excellent resource for beginning PR students and professionals. It covers all the basicis from a definition of PR to how to do PR well to how to perform the nuts & bolts tasks of PR. It is also very readable. It may not be a cuddle-up-in-bed book, but it does the job in a much less painful way than most textbooks! (P.S. Grunig is an excellent teacher and explains PR concepts in an approachable manner.)
