 I got the skinny on this project from Grunig himself--he was my advisor in graduate school. This is the opening introduction publication of a large research project he and his colleagues were conducting for the International Association of Business Communicators (IABC). Taking their inspiration from Peters and Waterman's "In Search of Excellence", this book provides a comprehensive look at public relations, giving readers an idea of where the field is and where it is heading. I'd consider this a must-have resource for anyone wanting to move up the ranks as a public relations professional.
