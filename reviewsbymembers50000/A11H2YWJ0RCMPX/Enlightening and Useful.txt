 Although my copy from the first printing of this book had a lot of typos--which I know she fixed--I found this book to be enlightening and helpful. This book not only covers tips for writing in online media, but advice on other aspects of online writing that a typical writer might not think of or even know exist. Rachel's writing is approachable--I highly recommend this book to those who are thinking of venturing forth into this writing frotier (and it is still that after "all these years") and especially for those whose jobs depend on these kinds of skills.
