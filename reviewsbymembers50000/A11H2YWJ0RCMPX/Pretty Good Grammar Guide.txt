 This is an easy to use grammar guide and style book that is easily accessible. Be aware, however, that this book follows journalistic writing style, and therefore will have some different rules than you would find in the Chicago Manual of Style or would use for English composition writing. Since it includes an index, finding the rule you're looking for is easy.
