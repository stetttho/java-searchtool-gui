 It's interesting reading a James Bond book after being raised on the James Bond movies. The James Bond on the books is sharper, edgier and a little bit meaner. The books are a little more graphic. But beyond that, James Bond is still a character you can love. ;-) This isn't my favorite James Bond story, but it was a fun read. I found the suspense scenes quite invigorating--I literally was at the edge of my seat! Especially near the end. Oh, and if you want to read this because you liked the movie, don't bother. The book is quite different!
