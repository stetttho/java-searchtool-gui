 This is a fun little book that covers several topics: UFOs (including MIBs), Bigfoot, the abominable snowman and more. If you find this kind of stuff interesting, this is an easy and fun read. I first read this in the 5th grade and went out to buy it several years later. I've never regretted the purchase.
