 This video is beautifully produced, and therefore lovely to watch. If you are new to belly dance, you might find following Dolphina to be a challenge--she isn't very good at describing transitions from one move to the next. If you have had some introduction to bellydance (I danced for 3 years, myself), this video is fun to follow and watch. If you are looking for a good cardiovascular workout, I suggest you look elsewhere, though. You just don't get a good sweat with this. However, it is a good workout for building some muscle tone and coordination.
