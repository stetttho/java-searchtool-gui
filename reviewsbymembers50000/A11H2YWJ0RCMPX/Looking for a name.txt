 Although this is an excellent and comprehensive source of names of Western culture, I was dissapointed to find that it lacked names that were Asian in origin--specically Chinese and Japanese. I'm not knocking the book--it is still a very good name resource--I'm just warning you if you were hoping to find names from all cultures.
