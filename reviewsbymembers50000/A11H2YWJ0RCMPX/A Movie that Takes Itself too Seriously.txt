 O.K. I don't know what planet these other reviewers are from, but it seems they were watching a different movie. I agree that The Unholy is worth watching-I've seen it several times because it is so funny. I mean we've got priests calling from the dead-ON THE TELEPHONE, no less. My friend and I saw this back when we were in college and have been calling each other as Father Dennis ever since. This movie takes itself way to seriously-this is a great B flick, but certainly not all the raves I've read in these other reviews. If you're expecting an excellent film, the likes of Rosemary's Baby, don't bother. However, if you're looking for a fun, scary laugh, the likes of Carnosaur, then, by all means, check this one out!
