 At times, I found this book lacked freshness--it said what so many others had said before. At others, I was drawn in and found Seidman's suggestions exciting and interesting. My favorite chapters were 7--an outline of the hero's journey--and 4--an overview of fiction genres. If you don't mind wading through the old-had advice, you will find your self rewarded with plenty of fresh and savory guidelines and tips. This book is most appropriate for the beginner or novice writer.
