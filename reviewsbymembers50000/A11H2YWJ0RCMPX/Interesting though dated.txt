 In this book, Stableford presents and interesting theory of the sociology of science fiction fandom. It was well researched and written, however I think he tries to apply what he learned from an audience limited by source and time and tried to apply it to a broader setting moving forward in time. I don't think it works for all fandom, but does say something about the sociology of the fans he studied. Good read for those interested in SF and sociology of fandom.
