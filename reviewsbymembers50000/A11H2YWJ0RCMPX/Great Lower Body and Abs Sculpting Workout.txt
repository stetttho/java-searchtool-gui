 In just 30 minutes you can have a great lower body and abs workout that is gentle on your body and still challenging. However, there are a few of things you should be aware of before getting this video: 1) you must have the right sized shaper ball. You should be able to position yourself on your hands and knees with the ball between your torso and the floor. My shaper ball is too big, so I am unable to do any of the "beginner" versions of the exercises. 2) Definitely wear shoes while doing this video-Kathy recommends it, but I tried barefoot anyway. It was way too challenging without the traction shoes provide. 3) Also, it helps if you have a wall within visual range of your television. One exercise puts the ball between you and the wall. Once you have all this in order, it is a great workout! The air cushion the ball provides makes many traditional exercises more comfortable to perform, while actually giving them greater effectiveness.
