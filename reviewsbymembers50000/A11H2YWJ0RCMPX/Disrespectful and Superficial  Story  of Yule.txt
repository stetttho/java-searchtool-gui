 This book does have some good information, however light and superficial, but don't read it if you are a thin-skinned (or even a moderately-skinned) Christian. It seems obvious to me that the author of this book is anti-Christian, despite being raised as a Christian. Winter holidays are celebrated by many different faiths, as this book illustrates, however, the author takes every opportunity to let you know what a bunch of hipocritic morons the Christians are. I don't know about you, but I believe there are many paths to God and no one has the "Right" path. I'm not a Wiccan, but I respect their right to practice that faith. The author doesn't respect other faiths and it became clear after only the first chapter that this book was a vehicle for her to vent her scorn. I do not deny that many (if not all) Christian holidays piggy backed on older pagan celebrations -- this is a known fact. However, the way Ms. Morrison states these facts is very disrespectful.
