 If you want to sell your writing--be it fiction or nonfiction--you are going to have to write a query and/or cover letter eventually. This book is an excellent resource/desk reference for crafting these kinds of letters so they grab an editors attention and convince her/him to hire you or buy your story. Written in the same style that Burgett speaks--to the point and personable--this book also introduces you to his concept of "selling 75 percent of your freelance writing."
