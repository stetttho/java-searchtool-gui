 I love this workout DVD concept. You can mix and match nine 10-minute segments in any order you choose. The only thing I wish is that there were a little more variety. You get three abs workouts; three buns work outs, one upper body, one lower body and one both. This basically means you have 4.5 lower body workouts. I would have liked a more even balance between upper and lower body. That aside, this is one of my favorite workout DVDs.
