 In his usual witty, blunt and almost arrogant style, Asimov ponders such things as math, physics and the stuff of life. This little book provides an interesting overview of several sciences while attempting to challenge your mind to think logically and clearly (a hallmark of much of Asimov's writing). I love my copy and have earmarked several pages for re-reading. Warning, if you don't love science as a process, this book may not be for you.
