 Once again Mr. Brooks delivers a strong tale and of course in his normal style left you hanging for more.  The thing that I will give celebration to on Anthrax, is that this story moves (action) a lot more than other Shannara tales.  We have new characters and a new place to develop new adventures around.  Good job Terry.  Waiting for the sequel.
