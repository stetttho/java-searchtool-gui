 I've been reading Terry Brooks novelles for a long time and though I've read all of the original Shannara series and Ran with the Demon all the way to Angel Fire East (excuse the puns) I find this book his best.  Generally, throughout all of the Sahnnara books the character development was slow and many times I have wanted to leave the books, the same with John Ross and Nest.  Where the previous stories held your breathe in the last 3-5 chapters, this books gets going and doesn't stop. It's adventurous, humorous, and the reference to the orginal series is good/helpful but not laborious.  Thanks Mr. B for coming back to the girl that brung ya.
