 Ok, here's my 2-cents.  I've recently indoctrinated an outlook on seminars, how-to and personal development books.  The new outlook is...if it spurs a thought, even a single thought, or induces a call to action then it has value.  Well this book has nothing new in it but, it has introduced me to one new thing and directed a call to action for my wife and I.  The ideas discussed in this books are great, but you gotta get pass the evangelizing.  I am very happy to have read this book and am actually implementing some of the ideas that are discussed in it.  But don't buy this book if you expect all of the answers.  To get a better understanding of the concepts that Mr. Allen discusses in this book, we have purchased at least 3 other books and a reread 2 others that we own.  The visuals that he uses in the first part of the book (mountains streams of income) are interesting but I quickly tired and became irritated with the constant evangelizing throughout the book. Again buy it for the nuggets, not the context.   Additionally, as I sit here in mid-2001 documenting this review if you are one of the many people who, like myself, are in the telecom industry or, like myself, received a seperation package from a telecom or are otherwise unemployed and looking for something different, this book is a great call to action for you in your new life.
