 After reading this book in its entirity I find many of Ms. Shlaes historical etudes interesting and revisionist.  The historical lessons cited in this book are sometime entertaining and sometimes down right  insulting to some of us who lived through the history.  Thanks for the  history book but try telling us something we don't know.  Given the title  of this book, I was expecting a discussion of the state of our tax  situation and some new thinking on "fair" taxation to the masses.   I just didn't get it!  I hope the proceeds from this book yield Ms. Shlaes  a tax problem and then maybe we'll get some interesting ideas on how to  handle the tax issues faced by US citizens.
