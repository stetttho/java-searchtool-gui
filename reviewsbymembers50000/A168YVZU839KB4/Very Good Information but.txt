 I really enjoyed reading about the history of the Middle East,  the Islamic influence in the region and its propagation, as well as Mr. Lewis' view of how Islam ultilmatly took Middle Easterners down a path that lagged them behind the rest of the world.  The problem is, it's tough to stay interested in a book when it presents a question and answers it in the first couple of chapters.  Additionally, as I learned upon conclusion of the book, this book is simply a compilation of Mr. Lewis' speaking engagements on this subject.  The editor should have done a better job with organization it would keep the readers' interest higher.
