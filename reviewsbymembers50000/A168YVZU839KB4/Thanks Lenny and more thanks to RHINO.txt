 I bought this "album" back when it was orignally released.  I was completely blow away by Chaka Khan.  Back in the 1980's no one; ok obviously Lenny White did, but other than him who would have expected this type of peformance from Chaka (Yvette).  Thanks Rhino for bringing this album to CD.  My album is locked up for prosperity.  Few of my generation would beleive Chaka had the capabilities she demonstrates on this album.  Thanks Lenny White for having the confidence in her and the other accomplished musicians for giving her the opportunity to strut her stuff with such talent.
