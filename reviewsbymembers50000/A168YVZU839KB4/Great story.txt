 If you're normally a Terry Brooks devoutee..... Try this book/author for a change of pace... and what a change of pace it is. I love the stories spun by Mr. Brooks.  This lady seperates herself by quickly introducing you to characters and building the story in the current book.  Mr. Brooks' books tend to want to take you back to the salient points of characters lives from previous reading.  As a result his books generally are good reads but slow for the first 9 of 12 chapters and bang chapters 10, 11 and 12 come and your blown away.  Not this book. THIS BOOK MOVES!!!!!!!!!!!!  FROM BEGINNING TO END I feel as though if I say anything about the story I'll give something away.  I will say one thing.... Robin nice job with the sex scene ;).  One other thing, my wife is generally a grocery store book of the week reader and she steps into the cerebral stuff with her historical masterpieces (800 - 900 page training weights) covering some famous figure or event.  She read one chapter of this book and had to have her own.  I hope you enjoy it too.
