 I read this book some years ago on the recommendation of some online friends.  I must say if you are a mutual fund investor and want to get better at it, this is a great book to learn from.  Some of the benchmarks are dated but the general ideas are not.  Additionally, the section on appropriate investment selections based on economic cycles is itself worth the purchase of the book. Happy investing.
