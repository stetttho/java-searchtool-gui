 The review space says to keep it under 1,000 words.  I'll do better than that.  Many of the reviewers are very windy with their reviews.  If you consider yourself a student of the science of economics this is a good book for debate.  It has an interesting perspectives on world currency policy and an interesting solution for the obvious currency crisis that the world faces. Interestly enough, no one's listening to his solutions today, but 2003 delivered a relatively sharp change in US currency valuation.  Like with most things from an economic prespective, interesting but have you considered.... (blah, blah, blah). Buy it.  The book is definitely worth your time and money.
