 I will admit that much of the information presented in this book is rather neophyte, but the book is very well written and as a neophyte real estate investor I found it quite helpful.  In fact, I especially want to highlight the fact that the recommendation on the banks was well worth the cost of the book.  Additionally, I found the criteria that Suzanne presented in selecting properties was very helpful in bringing closure to actually selecting properties.  Lastly, has an individual that has high skill in math, the tools presented in the book were quite good and presented with care for the non-math folks.  Thanks again.
