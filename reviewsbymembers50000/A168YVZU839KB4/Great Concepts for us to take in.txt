 I have often read and reread Prof. Pfeffer's books.  I give this one 3-stars because I found less than half the book of value.  I find the examples quite colorful, interesting, and thought provoking.  It's just too bad that the book didn't have a lot of value for the money (unlike his other books).  I read this book the last time about 2 years ago, each time I pick it up I read less and less.  The first time I read it, I read 5 chapters and now I'm down to 2.  I wish I could say that it's because I see many of the concepts being implemented within corporate America and as such I have less need for the information.
