 This sequel should have been first.  The prof's book: Competitive Advantage through People gave tactical initiatives to create a motivated and productive workforce.  But like so many people in industry who want to  implement the type of intiatives discussed in that book, I found myself  needing substantive validation on why should our firm engage in these  behaviors.  THIS BOOK SAYS WHY!!  We all know instinctively that many of  the tactics outlined in Competive Advantage are the right things to do, yet  we are all faced with needing tangible explanations for why we should  engage in these behaviors.  The Human Equation can help develop the  business case for that explanation. Thanks Dr. Pfeffer
