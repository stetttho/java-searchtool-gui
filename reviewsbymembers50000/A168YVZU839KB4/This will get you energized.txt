 I tore through this book in a few hours.  It's well written, yet not rich in content.  I thank Mr. Kiyosaki for sharing and Ms. Lechter for her editorial/writing skills.  I found many of the concepts that Mr. Kiyosaki delivers in the book brought back old thoughts that I had when I first enetered the work force almost 20 years ago.  After years of success and set backs I wish I had kept my focus on the thoughts that I had then and Mr. Kiyosaki reinforces in this book.  If you are looking for a reson to kick start yourself towards independence from the rat race this is a very good reminder of why you need to do it and may give you the push you need to go for it.
