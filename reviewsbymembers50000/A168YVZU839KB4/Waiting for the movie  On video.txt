 This book is not the standard E. Leonard novel, relative to its level of violence (not much, yea!!).  It is full of humor and as usual he paints a great literary picture.  I would love to see what a screen writer could do with this Leonard book but the right character actors are required.  Without the right actors I'd still watch just for the thrill of humanizing Chil and Elliot, but that would be a video rental.  The title is exactly the theme and with a name like Chili, the main character that is "cool" and hot at the same time.  Really good read.
