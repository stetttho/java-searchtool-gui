 Brooks, although not a professional historian, did throuough research and offered a balanced view of the massacre even though she was a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints as well.  The book's  conclusions are well argued and the documents are used in a fair and  balanced way.  Brooks also does an effective job of discussing the  background of the massacre with clear chapters on the "Mormon  War" of 1857 that was coming.  Unlike many authors, Brooks overcomes  the tendancy to become emotional or polemical about the massacre.  Instead  of using the book to further her own agenda, (either to be an apologist or  what is called an "Anti-Mormon" and tear down the church), Brooks  attempts to bring to light not only the massacre itself but the motivations  behind it and the cover-up that happened afterwards.  Anyone studying the  Mountain Meadows Massacre need to read this book first or at least second  or their research is woefully incomplete!
