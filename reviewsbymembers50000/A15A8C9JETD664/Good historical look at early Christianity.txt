 Although long and somewhat daunting the book is well written, and flows easily making the huge book manageable.  It's arguments are persuasive and logical, but as with almost any work, it is certainly not the last word on  the topic. I hope a person thinking about getting the book is not scared  away by the lenght of the book, it really is a good book, and you may find  yourself not wanting to put it down.
