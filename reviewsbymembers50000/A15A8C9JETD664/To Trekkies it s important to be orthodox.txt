 Trekkies demand orthodoxy.  New intpretations or ignoring the generally held view of how characters are supposed to act is really bad.  Spock is real, McCoy is real. Therefore you have to stick to what is "normal" for them.  Also Klingons are more complex than this book presents.  They are warlike but they don't go solely on bloodlust. Give more of a reason for Klingons to act.  This author did a better job in his other book, Mutiny on the Enterprise.  Sinners repent.
