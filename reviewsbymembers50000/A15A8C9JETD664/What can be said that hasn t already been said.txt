 All I can do is echo the other 269 people that have reviewed this wonderful collection of books by C.S. Lewis. The Chronicles of Narnia are an excellent way to get children interested in reading and helps them develop imagination. I read this collection over and over again as a child  and young adult, and I hope my son gets the same enjoyment out of them as I  did. This is a must read for any person's library especially  if you love fantasy and Christian symbolism told in a fantasy/adventure  sort of way.
