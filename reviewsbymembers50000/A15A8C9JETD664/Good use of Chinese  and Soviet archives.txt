 This book is an example of how the end of the Cold War has helped American history be less "Americancentric". We think one thing, but along comes Chinese and Soviet sources that help us have a more balanced view of  the past. The book traces the relationship between the U.S., U.S.S.R. and  China from 1945-1972. It is well researched and well argued and for the  most part balanced.  I felt there could have been a little clearer  discussion of what lead up to the Nixon visit to China in 1972, It still  seemed to just happen. A must for those interested in the cold war, China  and Soviet communism and the such.
