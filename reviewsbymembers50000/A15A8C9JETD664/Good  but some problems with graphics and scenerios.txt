 I love the concept, I am addicted to any Sid Meier game. Test of time is  not as good as Civ2, Call to power or Alpha Centauri but its a nice  variation on the theme. The graphics can be kind of muddled, especially  when you get to building railroads and in forests, It can be hard to make  pieces out. Some of the scenerios are wierd and the graphics are difficult  to get use to.
