 The author does a wonderful job of first determining which women were actually, strongly documented wives of Joseph Smith, then those that there is some evidence for, then some where it is just heresay. He then organizes  the book by bascially writing biographical sketches of each wife, including  as much of there own story as possible. These women are portrayed without  either praising or condeming them. This book is recommend for anyone who  really wants to know about the Prophet Joseph Smith's polygamous activites.
