 Is Gonick biased? Yes, every historian, actually every person on the planet has an opinion and that is called bias. Gonick is at least honest and makes it clear how he feels about things and that is a strength. To one  who is solid in American History this book is a light look at one person's  perspective on history without all the pretention of ivory tower academia.   For a child or young student it is a good strategy to get him/her  interested in American History, You can give them a more balanced view of  History later, right now have fun and get them interested or they'll be  idiots.
