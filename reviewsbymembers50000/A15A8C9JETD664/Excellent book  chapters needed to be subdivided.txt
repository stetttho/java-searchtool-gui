 I don't know that one could write a comprehensive book on one topic, but this comes very close.  Although at times plodding Johnson covers Jewish history from beginning to current.  I learned a ton about the Jewish faith  and people and I felt that I was getting a balanced fair discussion without  propaganda.  Other than the at times plodding narrative the only other  problem with this book is that the chapters go for 100 pages without any  subdividing. Johnson needed to break these long chapters down to make them  easier to digest, and to make it easier to stop reading and rest. It was  very easy to get lost in the chapter that is why it needed some subdividing  of topics. Anyway, the book is wonderful and a must read!
