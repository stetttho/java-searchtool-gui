 This book is wonderfully written, and clearly argued.  The author did an excellent review of major currently used high school texts to tell us what's wrong with how we view our history.  This is a book for everyone who  wants to know what history is and how its done.  High School teachers must  read this and implement it into thier teaching--history teachers that is! I  couldn't put it down and will use it in my own classes when I teach U.S.  History.
