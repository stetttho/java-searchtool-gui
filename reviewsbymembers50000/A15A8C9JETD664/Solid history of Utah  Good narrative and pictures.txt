 Alexander's "official" centennial Utah history is a strong  overview of the history of Utah. Their are many pictures to make the work  interesting, and the narrative is flowing and enjoyable. It's only flaw its  that it does focus on Mormons, but that is the majority religious group in  the state so he can be forgiven. The book celebrates the people of Utah  past and present and glosses over some not so pretty events. A must read  for anyone interested in Utah history.
