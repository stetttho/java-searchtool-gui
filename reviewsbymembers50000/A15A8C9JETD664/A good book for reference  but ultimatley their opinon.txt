 The authors are very capable men. The book is at least an attempt to objectivly explain one's own religon without attacking another's religion.  I've found that often Christians think that the only way to share their own  religion is to attack others. For Mormons it is a good course in  understanding other christians. For evangelicals it is a good way for them  to learn that Christ intended his Gospel to be shared with love, not by  tearing others down, but building them up.  However Ultimatley this book is  only these two men's opinon. Robinson can in no way speak for 10 million  Mormons living today, not to mention the millions that have lived since  1830. As A Mormon I sometimes found Robinson more interested in trying to  ignore real differences in the religions. There are differences between  Mormons and evangelicals, otherwise God would not have saw fit to inspire  Joseph Smith to restore the true gospel of Jesus Christ.  And I'm sure  Blomberg doesn't speak for the who know's how many Evangelical Christians,  or Christians in general there are. Overall its a good book, it probably  glosses over differences in order to make the thesis of the book fit, but  an intelligent reader can easily see where they are straining to find  common ground where there is probably none.
