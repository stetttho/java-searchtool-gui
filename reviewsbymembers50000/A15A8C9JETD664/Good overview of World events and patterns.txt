 This book was fun to read. The narrative flowed nicely and was easy to get through. It covered all of the major events of the World however I felt there should have been a deeper discussion of Africa and Latin America.   The book goes beyond a mere recitation of facts but successfully conveys  the character and essence of the 20th century. The author captures the  spirit and patterns of change that rocked the century and made an exciting  and violent one.
