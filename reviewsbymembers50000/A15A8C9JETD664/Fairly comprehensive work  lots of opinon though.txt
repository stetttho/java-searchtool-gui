 Bruce R. Mckonkie was an Apostle in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints from 1973 (I think) to his death in 1985.  This book is a  good resource and standard for beginning a study of what members of the LDS  church generally believe.  It is very organized like an encylopedia and is  cross referenced with similiar topics found in the book.  There is some  opinion in the book is Elder Mckonkie's own and not neccesarily what is  truth as revealed form Heaven, but nevertheless the book is a prime  starting point into learning about the church.
