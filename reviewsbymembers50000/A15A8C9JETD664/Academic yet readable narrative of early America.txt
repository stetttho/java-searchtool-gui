 This book focuses on the diplomatic history of the United States from 1801-1815. There is very little social history, and "the people" are usually only reffered to in their reaction to larger political and  diplomatic events. However, the author's style is readable and catching.  Diplomatic history can be very boring, but Smelser has melded academic  scholarship with writing that can interest almost anyone.
