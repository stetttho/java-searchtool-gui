 This book detailes the corruption of not only the Clintons but Arkansas and Washington D.C. as well. The book paints a picture of the idealistic  and somewhat tortured personal lives of two people who get caught up in the  corruption of not only Arkansas, but Washington D.C.  The book does get  kind of bogged down in discussing tangents to the main theme of the book,  the Clintons, but its meant to show what kind of Arkansas and Washington  D.C. they came into politically.  The book, although defintely not  pro-Clintons, avoids purely polemical and emotional language and writing.   It is a sad commentary on politics in general and our country when corrupt  people can get into high places.
