 I read the first edition of this book (published 1979).  This is an excellent introduction into the Vietnam War.  The book does focus on the politics and policies of the United States rather than more palatable  topics such as the human stories of the war. The book gives a firm  background into the years preceding American involvment in Vietnam.  The  first edition needed the perspective of communist sources to make it a more  well rounded work, but of course at the time that was near impossible. A  good book for anyone interested in a general history of the Vietnam war.
