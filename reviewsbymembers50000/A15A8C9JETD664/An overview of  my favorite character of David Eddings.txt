 David and Leigh Eddings have done it again.  This book was wonderful.  It let you see the stuggle of the light and dark thru the daughter of Belgarath the Sorcerer.  It takes you on a journey to place that Belgarath  briefly touched on.  I really enjoyed seeing the world and history thru her  eyes.  I also enjoyed the female perspective.  It helps you understand even  more the character Polgara in the series.  After I read Polgara the  Sorceress I reread the series to look for things I may have missed but now  understand.  I enjoyed seeing her raise Belgarion's family by hiding and  protecting them.  I enjoyed reading about her time with the Arendish  people.  You learn in this book where she learned her love of cooking, the  beginning of her close relationship with her Uncle Beldin and why she  detested her father so much at times.  You also learn what drove her to  become a physician. I would highly recommend it to anyone who loves fantasy  or who loves David Eddings books.
