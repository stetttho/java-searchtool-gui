 The book starts out promising and has great potential. However, the authors seemed to have gotten stuck telling one side of the story.  They started out very balanced especially through the first few chapter but you  can see a slow downward spiral into conclusions that are based on one-sided  arguements. By the end of the book they are clearly siding with those who  think the Mormon church is non-Christian, and evil. They do have a point  though, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is different from  the Apostate "mainline" christian churches out there because it  teaches doctrines that were lost for centuries and that should be  celebrated.  The authors need to go back and tell more of the other side of  the story in order to be what they claim to be--disinterested observers.
