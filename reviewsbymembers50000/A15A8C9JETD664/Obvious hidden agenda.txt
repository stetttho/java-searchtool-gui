 The book is well researched and the writing for once isn't tedious, (good job Dr. Quinn). However, Quinn really strains it at times to prove his ideas. This is Quinn's hidden agenda: The Mormon church during the 19th  century was not as homophopic as it is now, therefore the Mormon church  should not be so severe in its attacks and excommunications of Gay members  of the church like myself.  Quinn's whole purpose in writing this book is  to try to say that the current LDS leaders are hypocrites because earlier  leaders had more lenient attidutes towards homosexuality. The book is a  good history of same-sex relations but the reader needs to be aware of the  hidden agenda and the bias in Quinn's historical research and writing.
