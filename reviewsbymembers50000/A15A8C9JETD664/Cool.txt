 The premise of this book is: The authors have taken various characters  from various science fiction works and have visualy recreated them and  write about some of their culture from what is in the books. This is one of  the best Science Fiction art books I've ever read!!! and if you've read  some of the books that these aliens are recreated from it's even better!!!!  Colorful pictures, explanations, and even a couple of pages showing the  comparative sizes of each of the aliens!!!!
