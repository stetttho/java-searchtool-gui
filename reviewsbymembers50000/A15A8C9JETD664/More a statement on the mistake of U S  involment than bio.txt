 This book was less about Ho Chi Minh, and more about why the United States should not fight him.  This reader was hoping for a more detailed discussion of Ho's life, his philosophy, etc. This book does over some  insights into Ho Chi Minh's character and life, but I was left with the  feeling that the book was written for other purposes. The book was  originally published in 1970, a year after Ho's death so the book also  smacks of the eulogy, glorification of the dead variety.
