 The book is an interesting one. I found it somewhat persuasive in its arguments, however some of the primary sources that he uses could be interpreted differently. I've read a couple of reviews that said after  reading Quinn's work they left the LDS church, that is unfortunate because  Quinn is not the final word on the topics he treats. One should always look  at author's who offer a different picture using the same primary sources  that Quinn uses.  Also, one could argue that Quinn is a biased historian  since he was excommunicated from the church he is writing about.  It's like  writing a book about the IRS just after they've audited you and took  everything you had. Would your book be considered objective? Apply that  logic to Quinn's work and enjoy.
