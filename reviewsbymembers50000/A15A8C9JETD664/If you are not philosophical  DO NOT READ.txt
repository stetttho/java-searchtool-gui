 I read this book for a philosophy of history class as a student at college.  If you do not like philosophy and are easily distracted when reading mind-numbing abstractions then do not pick up this book.  The  thesis, or point, of the chapters are convoluted and seem to meander  everywhere.  I could read a chapter twice and still not have a clue what  the author was saying. I can't comment on how persuasive his arguements are  because I'm still not sure what he is saying. If you like philosophy then  this book is for you becuase the author launches off into a universe of  abstractions and shades that make one go insane, thus the title of his  book.
