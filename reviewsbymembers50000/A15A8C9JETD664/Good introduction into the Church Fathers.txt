 This book has very good introductions before each selection of a Church Father.  For those not knowing much about the author or his writings these intros were informative and aided in understanding the text. There is also  some commentary about the text which again is very helpful. This book  attempts to capture a representative sampling of the Early Christian  literature and it does so well. A must read for any student of Early  Christian history.
