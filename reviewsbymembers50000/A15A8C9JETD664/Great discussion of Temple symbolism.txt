 The authors take a detailed look at the Kirland, Nauvoo and Salt Lake City temples and discuss the architecture of each building and the symbolism of various designs in each of the temples. The book is well organized and easy  to read. There are good illustrations to help the reader visualize what the  authors are discussing.  The book has good footnotes and a bibliography for  further study. A great plus for the book is that it avoids wierd  interpretations of various things like the Saturn stones that were supposed  to be put on the Salt Lake Temple but weren't.
