 The movie was action packed and despite the somewhat troubling idea that you could kill someone and get away with it, this movie is well acted, well  written and a wonderful use of Tommy Lee Jones, and Ashley Judd.  You do  need to pay attention or you might get lost in the plot.  Some parts of the  movie don't make sense logically, but why do you watch movies? To be  entertained, and this movie does just that.
