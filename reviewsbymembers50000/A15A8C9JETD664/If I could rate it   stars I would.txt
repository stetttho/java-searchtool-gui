 I LOVE THIS GAME!!! I have spent hours playing it and never get tired of  it.  I find it fascinating to learn about the different things in Egyptian  culture.  I also like how you have missions that you must complete to  advance.  The graphics are awesome and I love the fact that you can click  on the people walking around in your city and hear comments from them about  what they think of the city.  This feature has helped me greatly to fix  problems before they got out of hand.  It can be very challenging at times  to meet the demands of your city but I enjoyed running the city and trying  to complete the mission.  I highly recommend this game to anyone who like  city planning games or strategy games.  You will have hours of fun with it.
