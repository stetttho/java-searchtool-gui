 This book has several major problems.  One, It's way too long and tedious. Second,Quinn's conclusions can be debated especially in regards to how acceptable folk magic was in the United States during the early 19th  century.  Third, as with all of his books since his excommunication Quinn's  "hidden agenda" is to show that Joseph Smith wasn't really an  inspired prophet but was deeply learned about magic and used that to start  Mormonism. This leads to another debateable point. First, how learned was  Joseph Smith? Quinn seems to think that a young teenaged Joseph Smith who  lived on a farm in rural New York had all day to sit around and read magic  books from local bookstores. Come on! Second, Quinn logic seems weak at  points, i.e. "There was a bookstore with magic books only five miles  from Joseph Smith's home, so he must have read the book." or  "Some early members of the church believed in Astrology so that must  mean the Mormon church during the 19th century believed in Astrology."  These are not direct quotes but the essence of some of his logic. Quinn's  footnotes are to long and tedious to investigate. In fact he goes to so  much length to footnote that one wonders: 1-does Quinn have any original  thoughts and 2-Is he burying us with footnotes to make up for weak evidence  and poor conclusions?  Another problem with this book is Quinn spends way  to much time fighting his critics in the book. Is this book about Early  Mormonism or Why my critics are wrong? Like some of his other works Quinn  again seems to have a "hidden" desire to fight against the church  that excommunicated him.  Advice: Quinn stop whining and fighting your  critics and work on your research and writing skills.  This book has some  good thought provoking sections.
