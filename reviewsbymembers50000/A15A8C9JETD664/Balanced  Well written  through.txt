 This book is an example of how good history is written.  The book is balanced in its treatment of the Mormon religion in every way.  The research is very thorough. Any student of Mormon polygamy or the History of  Utah should read this book.  It discusses every aspect of Mormon polygamy  from its earliest days to the present, and perhaps the book's greatest  highlight is that it does not shy away from controversial topics. A MUST  read!
