 Bolton's work on people's skills has some good ideas and should be used. I was dismayed though that the other reviews I read all thought this was worthy of 5 stars.  Some of Bolton's arguments are flawed and using some of  his techniques may lead to greater conflict. On one part of his work he  seems to be saying that compromise is bad, and you are weak if you  compromise.  Not compromising has led to many of the armed conflicts that  we have seen, (I will concede that compromising TOO much is weak), but some  compromise especially in a marriage faciliates greater harmony, and opens  up the possibility for greater communication between spouses.  I feel the  reader needs to "read between the lines" to really see what  Bolton's philosophy is.  The reader should take what is good out of this  book and use it.
