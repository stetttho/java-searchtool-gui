 Breathed is down right the best!  these strips are funny, cynical, and timeless!  They follow a chronological order so you can follow the story which gets funnier at every page. I cried for weeks when I heard that Bloom  County was to be no more.  The comic pages are a wasteland now, except for  maybe Dilbert, that Breathed is gone.
