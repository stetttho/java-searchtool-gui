 The authors take ten Asian leaders from five countries (China, Indonesia, India, Cambodia and Vietnam)and studies their lives and their leadership qualities. After a wonderful introduction of each country the authors  attempt to answer such questions as: What motivates people? Is their an  "Asian" way to lead? What makes a leader good or bad? Often in  each country they take leaders of opposite viewpoints such as Diem and Ho  Chi Minh in Vietnam. Diem was the Anti-Communist leader of South Vietnam  and Minh was the communist leader of North Vietnam.  The book also looks  into why people follow certain brutal leaders such as Mao and Pol Pot. It  looks at the establishing of personality cults and how the leader used that  to his advantage.
