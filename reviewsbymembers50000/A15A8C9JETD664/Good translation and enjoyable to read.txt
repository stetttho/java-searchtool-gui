 The book is a translation of the Aprocphya. It is a nice beginning into the study of early Christian texts. Its only flaw was that I thought it could have used a little more introduction into the work itself and its  history. It isn't set up in chapter and verse like the KJV or other Bible  translations so it may seem a little bit unfamiliar, but don't let that  deter you as a reader.
