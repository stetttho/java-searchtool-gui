 The authors did a good job of research and excellent writing to give us a sense of life in Nauvoo.  Of course, some controversial subjects are broached, polygamy, masonry, etc. but these were a part of life in Nauvoo  so to shrink away from discussing them would have been to completley  distort Nauvoo during the 1840's. The footnotes were easy to find and  follow and the bibliography was excellent. This book is reccomened to  anyone interested in Mormon Church history, and is indispensable if you  want to learn about or write about Nauvoo, Illinois.
