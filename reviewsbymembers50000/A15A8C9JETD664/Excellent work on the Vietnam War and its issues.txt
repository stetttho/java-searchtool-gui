 The authors incorporate the persepectives of all sides of the war in their work.  Not only is the war itself discussed, but the antiwar movement, North Vietnam's strategies and policy decisions.  The book although full of  details, the writing moves the book along avoiding the weight of tedium, (I  was able to read the book in a few days).  At the end is an admirable  attempt at assesing not only the historiography of the Vietnam War but also  the evolution of popular depictions of the war and American/Vietnamese  relations during the intervening 25 years. This last section could have  been a little more clearly written. It kind of felt like the authors were  jumping all over the place in dealing with post-1975 relations,  historiography, and popular perceptions of the war. Overall, a must read to  any student of the Vietnam War.
