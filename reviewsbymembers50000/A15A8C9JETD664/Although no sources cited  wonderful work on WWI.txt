 The Guns of August covers the first six weeks of World War I by telling the story of the leaders and generals of Germany, France and Great Britain. The book catches the human side of the beginning of the war through vivid  and powerful writing.  Emotion and power flow from the pages as we follow  the German march into France and the French and British halting of their  advance.  It is not a mere recitation of facts about the war but it weaves  facts into a narrative that grips you, it makes you ask, "what will  happen next", even if you know what happened next.
