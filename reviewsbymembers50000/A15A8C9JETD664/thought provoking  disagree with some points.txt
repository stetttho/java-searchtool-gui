 This book is a thought provoking account on how various groups and enitites sought to bring down President Clinton.  The book covers just  about every scandal that has dogged Clinton for his entire political  career. One large omission which should have been discussed however are the  campaign finance and China connection that the DNC and Clinton engaged in.   The selling of the Lincoln bedroom, tea parties in the White House, and how  China was able to donate to the DNC, and Clinton's very amorous attidutes  towards China needed a deeper discussion that what was given.        This  book details the over zealous efforts by Clinton's enemies to bring him  down. It is a well documented work, and persuasivley argued.  I am not a  Clinton supporter, I do not like Clinton and think he is one of our worst  presidents however I must admit this book is a good one to read.      In  thier "Aferword" section the authors suggest that Clinton's  shenanigans did not hurt America or the Presidency. I strongly disagree. I  think Clinton lowered the moral standard needed for public office, he  damaged the credibility of his office, he was/and still is a poor role  model for our children.
