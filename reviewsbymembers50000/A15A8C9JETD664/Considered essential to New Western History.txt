 Limerick's book is thoughtful and enjoyable to read. It covers in broad detail many aspects of Western History and seeks to give the Old West a more inclusive and broad face.  There are parts that may be uncomfortable  to some, but her analysis is thoughtprovoking and well reasoned. Almost  everything about Western history is discussed here.
