 The book is a good compliation of issues and events leading up to the Civil War, and during and after. However, if you are a Civil War buff or are a student of History, or a professional historian you might find the  book dull, because you probably already know it.  I would reccomend this  book to high school students, college freshman or anyone who feels their  knowledge of U.S. History lacking, (which unfortunatley is common in our  society.) I found my self skimming alot, already knowing the information.   The author gives a nice touch of primary source material by quoting some  appropriate words from someone from the era a chapter is discussing.  The  book is also nicely organized into questions that he answers, like  "What does the Constitution say about Slavery?"  I found some of  his conclusions strained however, for example "if there had been no  Lousiana Purchase there might not have been a Civil War."  It's that  kind of strained conclusions and sloppy logic that gives History a bad name  in our society.  Anyways, good book, informative, and well done.
