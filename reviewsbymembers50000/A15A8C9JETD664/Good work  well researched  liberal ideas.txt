 This book is generally good, unfortunatley the class I took that used this book was not good. So I'm having trouble separating the book from the class. Taken by itself the book is informative and I feel does a good job  of covering the various expiriences of women.  The book, of course, does  take a liberal slant but the attempt to be balanced is there and should be  appreciated by readers of a more conservative slant. The authors do have an  agenda, as do most liberal feminists, and they make no apologies for their  ideas. The best sections are the ones dealing with women and sexuality. The  authors are sensitive and try to go beyond mere male-bashing. The authors  also stick to significant issues, (something the class didn't do), and to  keep the book from getting to boring they insert cartoons, usually  Doonsberry, to illustrate their case. The cartoons are appropriate and add  to the work.
