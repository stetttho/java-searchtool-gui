 This book is long and plodding! It parades itself as investigatory but  there are inaccuries and mistakes throughout the book.  Even if its an  expose book, it's not a very good one becuase its not dramatic nor eye  catching. The writing is plodding and becomes boring, you start wondering  where the sensational material is. Not a good book on the Clinton scandals,  its not informative. See, The Hunting of a President: The Ten Year Campaign  to Destroy Bill and Hillary Clinton, for an excellent critique of this  book.
