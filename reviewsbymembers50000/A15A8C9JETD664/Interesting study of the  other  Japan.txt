 This book is a well written, although sometimes meandering, account of the author's interviews with people in Japan who prove that Japan is not as homogenous as we might think. The only problem with the book is that it at  times strays from the interviews into philosophical musings that are  tedious. but the book as a whole is worth while and a must for anyone  studying Japan.
