 This game is the Civilization concept set on another planet.  The graphics  are cooler, and their is flexiblity in creating weapons and the such.  I  like the United Nations concept, but some of the dialog, especially when  you discover something new is kind of irritating. It's usually something  pretentious. It's a little harder to master and learn than Civ2, so it will  take longer to get bored with it than Civ2. I like the constant graphics  that tell you who is winning, and who is the strongest, it helps out a lot  with strategy.
