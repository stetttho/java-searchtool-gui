 This would be a good book in a historiograpy class because it traces the development of how studying the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints has gone and also treats current trends as well. The book is a good book,  and is one of the good works by D. Michael Quinn.  One should be warned  however.  The title says "Revisionist" meaning it is probably  going to say some things that someone is not going to like, so keep the  title in mind when you read this book. Also since the authors make it plain  that this is a "Revisionist" work it would behoove the honest  researcher to go find out what the authors are attempting to revise,  meaning don't take this book as gospel, but find out both sides of the  story before you come to conculsions about the Church of Jesus Christ of  Latter-Day Saints.
