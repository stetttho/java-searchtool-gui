 This book is an example of good exhaustive historical research and balanced conclusions. Although long, it is gripping and academic, (a sometimes rare combination, as I've found out in my graduate studies).  One  should read this book and also read the book by Henry C. Clausen, since he  was an actual investigator into the tragedy.  Prange should be  congradulated for using Clausen's perspective something many other authors  of Pearl Harbor didn't use.  Read this book!
