 Backus is a distant relative of Phillip Klingensmith a participant in the Mountain Meadows Massacre. The author seeks to tell Klingensmith's life story by weaving her narrative with the testimony he gave in the first  trial of John D. Lee.  It is a unique way to carry her story and her  writing is engaging, and favorable towards Klingensmith.  She does tend to  take Klingensmith at his word, and doesn't deal with the few times he was  misleading or lied during his testimony, especially when he was talking  about the massacre. On the whole a good book, and well worth the reading.
