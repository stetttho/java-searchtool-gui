 I wasn't sure about this book when I first picked it up.  Was it going to be blasphemous about our Lord's life and works? I found the book to be a funny look at how silly, and stupid being "politically correct"  is.  It is somewhat irrevent about sacred things of God, but I think unless  you are a extreme Christian Fundamentalist you will find the book well  within the boundaries of not taking sacred things too lightly.
