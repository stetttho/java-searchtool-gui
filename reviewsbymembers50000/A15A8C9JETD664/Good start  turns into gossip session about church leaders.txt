 The book starts out well written, and somewhat convincing, but the book ends with Quinn just passing along gossip about Church Leaders from anonymous employees in the Church Office Building in Salt Lake City.  By  the end of the book Quinn comes across as bitter about his excommunication  and just wants to bad mouth those who got him excommunicated especially  Elder Boyd K. Packer.
