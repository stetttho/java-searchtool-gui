 Lewis gives us excellent insight and perspective on the nature of temptation and how Satan works. The work is set up as correspondances between a beaucrat in hell and his nephew Wormwood.  The letters are advice  and training for Wormwood who is given charge of luring certain people down  to Hell. The book is entertaining, humorous, but also deep and should  strike a chord with those expiriencing strong temptation in their life  towards some form of evil.  The best way to fight your enemy is to know  him, and this book is an theory on how the devil and his angels might work  to take souls away from God. The book is also very easy to read, and  without the pretentious philosophical jargon that theologians use. It's  down to earth, common sense theology taught in story form. An excellent  work!
