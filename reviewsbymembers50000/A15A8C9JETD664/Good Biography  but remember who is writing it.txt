      Overall the book is interesting and written in a very readable style, much like the man himself. I was a teenager in Arizona when Evan Mecham was governor then not governor. I went to High School with one of his granddaughters.       Gov. Mecham portrays himself in a very pure and holy light, which may or may not be true.  He does lay a very convincing populist arguement that he as man of the people was ousted by the powers that be.  Populism in American History has a long and storied tradition from Jefferson to Jackson and onward.        Ronald Watkins'  High Crimes and Misdeamors offers an opposing and exact opposite view of Mecham's account so reading both is a very interesting excercise. Reality is probably some where in the middle.      From my perspective Gov. Mecham did some things that while not illegal or neccesarily unethical they looked bad politically or at least were made to look bad politically therefore he was taken out.  One problem was that Mecham portrayed himself in a high minded way. Well, you do that and anything you do that is not PERFECT (like forgetting to include a loan from someone) can be made to look bad, even if it in reality wasn't.      That's the reason that currently the idiot hate-Bush crowd is so mad about Bush and domestic spying. Bush portrays himself as very high minded, so when he does something that doesn't look above board it's GOTCHA TIME.  Clinton enacted domestic spying as well. Why no press or societal discussion of it??  We all expect dirty, low down, criminal behavior from Clinton so we don't talk about it.  Mecham is the same way. A high minded well intentioned indiviudal who didn't play the game, and was was unable to be PERFECT, because he's a human being, so the GOTCHA GAME was played and he lost.
