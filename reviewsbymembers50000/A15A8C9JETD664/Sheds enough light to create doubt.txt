 My wife has told me about this McDonald case and I finally read "Fatal Justice".  From just reading this one book on the subject it appears that McDonald is innocent. It is persuasivley argued and I  believed well written. I enjoyed reading it, and found myself asking  "How does the other side respond to this author's arguments" and  that is what a good book is supposed to do. It's supposed to get you to  have an emotional reaction to the subject, to make you interested, to  create a desire to find out more about the subject. This book does all  that.  Those who find him guilty should consider this book before coming to  a final judgement, just as I'm going to read other books on the case before  I come to a final judgement.
