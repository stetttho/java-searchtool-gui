 This book is a collection of essays that cover many aspects of Utah history from the Mormons to Miners to Native Americans to the Depression  and World War II.  The essayists write clearly and make possibly dry topics  at least palatable, such as the ones on the economy in Utah.  It is  organized mostly chronilogically and the main idea of all the essays is how  the people of Utah expirienced life in the state, and sometimes it wasn't  what was expected, thus the title, "A World We Thought We Knew."  The title could also be a commentary on the reader as well. Someone who is  not familiar with Utah history or has a stereotypical view of Utah history  will be surprised at the depth and breadth of the Utah expirience.  The  essays were certainly thought provoking and painted a picture of diversity  and struggle throughout the history of Utah.
