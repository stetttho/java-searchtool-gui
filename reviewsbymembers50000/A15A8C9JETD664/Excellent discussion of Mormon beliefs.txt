 Le Grand Richards was an Apostle (the second highest ranking church council in the LDS church) in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. He died in the Early 1980's. This is his defintive work. It is one  of the only books Mormon Missionaries are allowed to read while they are  serving their 1.5 or 2 year missions.  The book discusses Mormon beliefs  from marriage to temples to what Mormons believe about Heaven and Hell.  Anyone investigating the church has not really investigated until they read  this book, (other than the Book of Mormon, of course). It is easy to read  and powerfully written.
