 Ann Eliza Young was President Brigham Young's 19th wife.  This book is a reproduction of her own autobiography.  It is obvious in the book that Young expected much more from her marriage with President Young than he  did.  She apparantly expected Young to be much more attentive,  affectionate, and caring for her.  Young for whatever reasons, (running a  church, a territory and having 20 other wives might have something to do  with it), was not able to offer Ann Eliza the marriage she wanted.  Ann's  problem is more with Brigham Young as a husband and father than the Mormon  church itself.  One reading her tale should sympathize with her but should  be wary about her bias in telling about Mormon beliefs.
