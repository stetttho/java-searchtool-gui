 I couldn't put the book down.  It was a surreal, awe-inspiring adventure. The imagery was such that I could visulaize it in my mind as I was reading.  I felt like I was there.  A wonderful masterpiece of science fiction that  doesn't degrade itself by including sex, slave girls, etc. that a lot of  other 3rd rate science trash puts out.  This is a classic forever!!!
