 This book takes different topics such as faith, dealing with adversity etc. and quotes various sacred text that discuss that topic. This book is a wonderful testament to the fact that we all believe in the same God even  though we may call him by a different name and that we are all brothers and  sisters. This book opened my eyes and introduced me to some sacred texts  that I had never heard of and would like to learn more about.
