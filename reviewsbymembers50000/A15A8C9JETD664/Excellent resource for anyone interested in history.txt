 This book is organized alphabetically by topic. It covers general topics like the Revolutionary War to specialized topics like the New Deal or Watergate. Under the topic is a small historiography of the best works on  the topic under discussion, and at the end is a bibliography of the books  discussed. The book is indispensable. I used it to find sources for a  couple of research papers, and to find a good book on a topic I wasn't  familiar with but wanted to learn more about. Name the topic and it is  probably covered within these pages.
