 I really enjoyed this volume of work.  David Eddings takes you thru the process of how to write fantasy.  He tells you how it difficult it can be and informs you of the basic building blocks of good fantasy.  I also  enjoyed his different religious books for the different people of The  Belgariad and the Malloreon.  Anyone who has the desire to write this genre  needs to read this book.  Also if you are a fan of David Eddings it is very  informative of how he came up with the characters and the extent of the  background history of the series.  I really enjoyed his commentary thru out  the book.  I also enjoyed hearing about his own history and background on  becoming a fantasy writer.  He helps you realize that it is very hard work  to become a really good writer.
