 From a secular academic point of view this book is well written and well researched and offers some interesting insights into Mormon temple worship. The book has two main problems however. First, the book ignores why the  temple is so important to faithful Mormons. It downplays the spritiual  importance of temple worship to a faithful member of the church. Second, at  the end is an appendix of works where you can find the Endowment ceremony  discussed. Most of the books are polemical works which are vindictive and  inacurrate. The books in this appendix mock things that are sacred to  Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. It's like the  Ancient Romans mocking the first Christians for believing that their God  died and rose again the third day.  It's sad that people can't respect  other people's religious faith.
