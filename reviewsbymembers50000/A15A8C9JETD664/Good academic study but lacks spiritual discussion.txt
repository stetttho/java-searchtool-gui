 The book is well researched and well written. As an academic book it is very good, however the author's discussion ignores the deep spiritual attachment that many members of the church have towards the temple, his  book focuses on why members might not like the temple ceremony rather than  why a vast majority draw strenght from temple worship. The list of books in  the appendix that describe what goes on in the temple are mostly polemical  works that mock, and denigrate things that are sacred to a large group of  people.
