 This work traces Early Christian History from Christ through to the formation of the Catholic Church and eventually to the Restoration of the  gospel to Joseph Smith. Explains why the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter  day Saints professes to be the "only true and living church on the  face of the earth". Wonderfully written and well reasoned.
