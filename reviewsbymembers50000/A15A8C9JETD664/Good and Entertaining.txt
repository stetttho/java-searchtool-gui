 I read this book when it was published under the title "Fool's Gold" (published 1983). I found his narrative gripping. I felt like I was there. I grew up in the Phoenix area, so It was even more of a intense  feeling because I have been in the Supersititon mountains and can say that  he is right. Those mountains are rugged, harsh, and you get a sense of it  being a little creepy.  The book is well written and well researched. I  reccomend it strongly to anyone who is interested in the legends and tales  of the West.
