 The first pages of Pawn of Prophecy grabs you and won't let you go.  I remember the first time I read Pawn of Prophecy. It's so riveting that you can't put it down.  It takes you on a magical journey with many twists and  turns.  I love this series so much that I have read it at least half a  dozen times and I catch myself reading it over and over again.  There are  times you are so caught up in the excitement that you forget you know how  it ends.  I love the ways you see Garion grow up and starting to realize  that things aren't really as they seem.  I also love the characters Aunt  Pol, Durnik, the old storyteller, Silk and Barak.  You get so involved with  the books you want them to continue forever.  I will probably read the  series so many times that my books will get worn out.  I think if you get  Pawn of Prophecy you need to get the rest of the series so you can keep  reading without having to wait to get the next book.
