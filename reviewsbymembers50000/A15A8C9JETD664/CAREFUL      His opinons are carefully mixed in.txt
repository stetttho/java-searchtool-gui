 This book has one serious flaw. It is this man's opinon. He is not a prophet. His authority is "20 years of teaching sunday school".  Some of his assertions border on fantasy. The true test of this man's  opinons is found in the scripture, where the prophets say that the way to  know if a man is a true prophet is if the things he says come to pass. We  DO need to be prepared but Mr. Young instills a false sense of hysteria and  paranoia. He uses many scriptures, but in the end Mr. Young merely  speculates on them. Probably the most true part of this book is his  discussion of a prophecy by George Albert Smith. We should listen to the  prophets and heed their counsels, especially if they go against what Mr.  Young has here stated in his book. Be prepared, but not paranoid!
