 Limerick's writing is vivid and engaging. The organization of her chapters is excellent. She critiques every aspect of the Turner thesis.  Her book is/was the opening salvo in the New Western History that looks at the  American West as a region instead of a process of frontiers. Limerick seeks  to include everyone in her story of the American West, not just white,  Anglo-American cowboys and Native Americans. A wonderful book.  There is  NEW stuff in this book, in that before her few historians of the west  looked at women, Asians, Indians from their perspective, blacks, etc.  A  must read for any student of the American West!
