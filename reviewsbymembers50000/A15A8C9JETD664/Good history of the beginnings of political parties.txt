 This book focuses on the domestic political scene in the United States during the period covered. Foreign affairs, and social affairs are discussed in context of how it affected the development of the Federalist  party and the Democratic-Republican party.  The book is well written and I  found it enjoyable to read. It is well organized although there are a  couple of times he discusses the same event in two widely separate parts of  the book without a clear transition, so it makes it look like he's going  off on to a tangent, then back to his original topic. Good academic  history.
