 This book is wonderful! To non-fans, (like my wife), this book is completley trivial and worthless, But this is wonderful.  True it is skimpy on the 19th century but what there is is great!  It goes year by year  discussing major events, and some minor ones in baseball history for that  year.  It attempts to trace the beginnings of baseball, all the way back to  1776, this book claims.  For Baseball Historians this is a priceless work,  although it would have been helpful to footnote all of the sources, and the  other reviewer is correct the author should have used the Official  Encyclopedia, as well as others. It's kind of like he ignored the source.
