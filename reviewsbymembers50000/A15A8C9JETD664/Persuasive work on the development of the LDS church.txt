 The book focuses on the development of the Mormon church from its small beginnings to the 10.5 million members it has today.  Her arugement is that Mormonism is a new religious tradition in the sense that it grew outside of  the mainstream Protestantism of America in the 1830's.  She argues that  although it has aspects of Old Testament Judaism and New Testament  Christianity the Mormon church should be considered another Religious  tradition that is developing into a world religion. Overall the book is  persuasive, but I found some of the logic or proofs strained and hard to  follow. It is favorable towards the church and does tend to gloss over the  controversial parts of the LDS faith.
