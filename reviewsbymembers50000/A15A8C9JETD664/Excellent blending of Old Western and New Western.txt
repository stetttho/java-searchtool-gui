 This movie is a wonderful blending of tradtional style Old Western history with a more realistic intrpretation of New Western history.  The acting is wonderful although I wanted to see more of Jeff Goldblum and Rosanne  Arquette. The music and scenerey is dramatic and draws you into the movie.  At the end when they go riding off into the sunset you almost want to get  on your horse and go with them. This movie is light on the hokey stuff of  classic westerns which makes it even more palatable to a non-western fan.
