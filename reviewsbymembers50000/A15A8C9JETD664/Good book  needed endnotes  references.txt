 This book is good simply because it does not read like a boring academic textbook. You feel like you are on a guided tour through history from the earliest days to the present. The organization and flow of the book is  excellent which helps the reader not get lost.  I would have like some  endnotes, or a better bibliography so that I could learn more because this  book motivated me to learn about things I didn't know about. Isn't that the  sign of a great book? It moves you to learn beyond what the author is  telling you.
