 This biography of the author's family history back to China is enjoyable and complex. She traces her large family from one of her ancestors who came to America during the 1860's.  She handles the numerous story lines well  and the pedigree chart at the beginning is very valuable in helping the  reader keep track of her family. The author also does a good job of  incorporating her family into the times they lived in. We see her family  not in isolation from the world, but as part of world and local events.  This adds humaness and closeness to the people in her story. She is  non-judgemental and attempts to handle "family skeletons" with  tact, although you get the feeling that her version of some events isn't  what some family members believe, And she seems to have the "I'm  grandpa's favorite grandchild" attitude which doesn't neccesarily hurt  the book, but you wonder how her relatives felt about the book. Although  the book is long, the story keeps you interested. Defintley a must read.
