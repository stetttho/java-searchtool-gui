 Guitar Slinger is the second installment from the Brian Setzer Orchestra, and like the previous self-titled album, this one rocks as well. Setzer continues with his sound of rockabilly mixed with big band and intense energy. This album is a tour de force of Setzer's talent, from his writing three-quarters of the songs, arranging the orchestration of all the songs, and incredible guitar work. Setzer is one of the most underrated guitarists around, maybe because he's stuck in the past, but he is definitely a master of his instrument. This album starts off on the right foot with a cover of the late, great Stevie Ray Vaughan's "The House Is Rockin'". I'm sure Stevie smiled on this jazzed up rendition full of horns. Only two more covers appear on this album, "Town Without Pity" and "(Every Time I Hear) That Mellow Saxophone". Both frame Setzer's musical ability and that great big band sound. He rocks out with "Hoodoo Voodoo Doll," "Rumble In Brighton" and "Johnny Kool". This is another album that mixes up-tempo rocking tunes with smooth, mellow songs.  If you've been following Setzer for a while, or just enjoy the BSO's rocking big band sound, this is definitely another album to add to your collection.
