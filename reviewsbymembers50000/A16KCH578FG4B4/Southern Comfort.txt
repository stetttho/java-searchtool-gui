 Eric Essix takes his love for the southern sound and puts a touch of smooth jazz finger-work on it to create "Southbound". A mixture of covers and originals serve up nearly an hour of easy-listening enjoyment. According to Essix, this is the first in a series of explorations into the origin of the southern music that he grew up with. A good guitar player, Essix plays very simply, letting the spaces between the notes speak volumes. There is a lazy sound to him that reminds me of the South that he has dedicated this album to. He can rock out when he needs to, like on the cover of Stevie Wonder's "Have a Talk with God". He lays down a funky rhythm and good solos on Bobbie Gentry's "Ode to Billy Joe", and does a wonderful cover of one of my favorite songs, "People Get Ready," by Curtis Mayfield.  The surprise on this album comes from saxophonist Melvin Butler. Butler's work is good, but he really stands out on the upbeat "Creole Strut" (one of Essix's five originals on the album) with a great solo that complements Essix's own.  This is a great album for lazin' around on a Sunday afternoon when it's just too hot to do much of anything else. Essix's experiment of combining his jazz styling with the southern blues sound is a success.
