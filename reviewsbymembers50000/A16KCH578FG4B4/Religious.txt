 Listening to Adrian Legg one can easily see how he regards guitars as cathedrals. His playing is spiritual, passionate, and amazing. The majority of this album is Legg alone on his guitar playing his unique brand of finger picking style. He is fast, yet melodic; complicated, yet relaxing. Hypnotizing. A joy for the ear.  Legg is superb on mixing different styles of music together. From these styles he has developed his own sound. There are many great cuts on this album that display this musician's ability at playing and composing. He is able to change playing styles to help create tension in addition to note choice, moving fluidly from arpeggios to strumming as in "Tracy's Big Moment" and the title track. "Divorcee's Waltz" is a waltz that has a bit of Irish and Country flare to it, while "Nail Talk" is simply peaceful. "Cajun Interlude", "Pass the Valium (with Knobs On)" and "Reckless Love" have his trademark "out" sound and are probably the most rocking tunes on the disk. His thirteenth track is a mere four seconds of blank space labeling him as a possible triskaidekaphobic. Legg give us thirteen great musical tracks that leave you dazzled and peaceful at the same time. This is a great place to start listening to Legg as this was his first release on the Relativity label, and is probably the earliest album of his that you can easily find. If you like guitars, musicianship, and laid-back music (not quite jazz yet not quite new age) this is an excellent album.
