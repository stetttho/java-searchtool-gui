 The band from East L.A. does it again with "Colossal Head", a slight departure from their standard stuff, but still very good altogether. This album is more raw, and much louder. Again, Los Lobos mixes great music with a flare of Latin to create another powerful album.  "Mas Y Mas" gives us a taste of this new flavor that the band is trying out, in Spanish. The louder horns and guitar provide a pounding beat and a fancy solo. "Colossal Head" and "This Bird's Gonna Fly" are the other songs that follow this suit. A mixture of poetry and song is found on "Everybody Loves a Train". The acoustic solo in the middle of the song is good, and the rhythm gives the idea as if you were on a train. One of my favorites on this album is "Life Is Good". The lyrics are pretty simple, the music isn't complex, but it's just a happy song. The Spanish flavored "Maricela" is another great cut. One of the more laid back pieces of the album, it shows that they continue to stick to their roots. "Little Japan" is another of the laid back songs as well. This song also ranks as a highlight of the album, and sounds a lot like old Los Lobos. The boys get bluesy with "Buddy Ebsen Loves the Night Time". This is like older guitar blues with the melody loud and whiney, and the rhythm soft and quiet in stark counterpoint.  There's a lot of different types of music on this album. I think it was neat to see Los Lobos try a new sound, to see where it could take them. This album is different, but it is well done and worth a listen if you enjoy these guys.
