 Unless you have lived in a dark cave, feeding off moss for the last thirty years, you know who Pink Floyd is and their most notable album, "Dark Side of the Moon". I'm sure everyone on the planet, and maybe even some who are not on the planet, have heard "Time", "Money" and "Us and Them". This was a very transitional album for the Floyd, separating their career into before the Dark Side and after. Their pre-Dark Side music was more raw, more psychedelic. Where with the release of Dark Side they became refined, masters of the overdub, and gave attention to every little detail. Dark Side was really the first album of its kind, which may explain its popularity causing it to soar the charts for so very long. Dark Side was the boost to push rock to the next level, opening a whole new sound to musicians and listeners alike. For being more than thirty years old, Dark Side still sounds fresh and new to this day. A timeless classic indeed.
