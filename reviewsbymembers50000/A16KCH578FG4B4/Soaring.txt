 My first experience with Al DiMeola was through his association with John McLaughlin and Paco De Lucia on the "Friday Night Live in San Francisco". If you're looking for the same type of music here, you'll have to look hard. DiMeola uses his flamenco sound in songs like "Capoeira", but it is only a single rhythm track. There is a Latin presence on most of these tracks. Instead, this is more of an exploration of sounds, ideas and emotions. I can see the comparison to Pat Metheny with the style and voice-like synths on the guitars and pianos.  DiMeola is definitely a master of the guitar, and he spends the six tracks on this album showing you that he is exactly that. His lines are fluid and astral, aided with synth-sounds. "Traces (Of a Tear)" is a good example of his solo playing. Actually, it's a good example of everyone's solo playing, as Phil Markowitz takes a spin on the 88s, and Chip Jackson adds to the mix on the bass. "Broken Heart" is more of an acoustical piece. Gentle soloing on the acoustic guitar from DiMeola trading with the piano. A beautiful song, the sounds almost sad, but ends with the feeling of hope. "Capoeira" is a mixture of playing styles, and the upbeat nature of the tune makes it a good choice to open the album with. Airto Moreira's vocals add flavor to the song. "July" is the only song that doesn't seem to hold to the trend of the album. It's almost as if it is used to give the listener a break and step up the tempo and sound. The solo in "Marina" is excellent.  You won't find a "Mediterranean Sundance" on this album, but if you like Metheny's laid-back stuff, then this is a good complement to add to your collection. The guitar work is excellent, and smooth, almost fluid. The tone of the album is nearly a floating, ethereal feel to it (except for "July"). This might be worth finding for those that like quiet, nearly new age style jazz.
