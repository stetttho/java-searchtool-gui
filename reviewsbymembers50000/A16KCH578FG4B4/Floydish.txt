 You can take a guy out of Floyd, but you can't take the Floyd out of the guy. That's probably an unfair statement since Floyd is, in part, what David Gilmour brings to the band. Gilmour's sound is unique and easy to recognize. Clear phrasing and astral sound are his trademarks. His solos are perfect, works of art that elicit images and emotions. "About Face" is different from a Floyd album, and at the same time very similar to one. This was he first release after the demise of the band, allowing him to experiment and do his own thing without having to clash with others. It is this freedom that separates this album from the true Floyd sound. "Murder" is a good resume for Gilmour's talent. The song begins with acoustic strumming before a fretless bass solo marks the transition to a heavier feel. The solo is powerfully Gilmour. As the solo progresses it turns more into something that sounds like it was cut from "The Wall", a bit "Young Lust"-ish. The surprising song on the album is "Love On the Air", one of two on this album penned by Pete Townsend. Again, Gilmour takes center stage with his guitar, but there is some pretty good Hammond organ going on in the background. "All Lovers Are Deranged" is the other Townsend song. This one is quit heavier, and Gilmour's playing a bit on the dirty side. "Out of the Blue" borrows heavily from the Floyd arsenal. Gilmour gets a lick back on Waters with "You Know I'm Right".  Overall, this is a decent solo release from Gilmour, which is a precursor to revitalizing most of Floyd for "Momentary Lapse of Reason". It's a good showing, but not his best work. He proved that he could work without Waters on his first solo release (self-titled), and did again with the subsequent releases from Floyd.
