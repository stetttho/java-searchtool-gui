 This greatest hits album from the U.K. is the perfect compilation of Queen's latter day career. On this 1991 release finds songs from "The Works" through "Innuendo" with a throwback from the 1981 release of "Hot Space" with the song "Under Pressure". As with many of the super-groups of the 70's and 80's there is definitely an evolution that takes place as time goes on. Many of these bands became more refined, better lyricists, better players, and immensely more popular. Queen is no exception ending with the masterpiece, "Innuendo".  As it turns out, I was pretty unfortunate in acquiring this CD. The only domestic CD that competed against it at the time was "Classic Queen", but it had a different song listing. A few years later, Hollywood finally released this album stateside in conjunction with Greatest Hits I making a double album. I felt burned, but I couldn't wait to get the album.  Without doubt, Queen is one of the best groups ever to play in an arena. Freddie Mercury had one of the best male voices ever to sing, and a stage personality that could get any audience involved. Mixed with the great playing and hit songwriting from guitarist Brian May, bassist John Deacon, and Roger Taylor on skins they reached the status of legends. With Queen's ultra-successful career it would take you quite a bit of money to collect everything they've done. This album is a good place to start to get some of their greatest songs of the late 80's and early 90's. Mixed with "Greatest Hits I", you'll have a very solid start all for the same price I paid to have mine come from the U.K.
