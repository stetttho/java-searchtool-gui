 Robben Ford is still one of the unsung great guitarists of this day. "Supernatural" is a reminder of his guitar prows. A blues guitarist that is not afraid to get funky and go outside with some jazz scales. When it comes to phrasing, Ford knows exactly what he's trying to say and does so with a minimum number of notes and spacing. He's not going to blow you away by sticking five hundred notes in a measure. Instead, he plays with feeling, letting the rests speak as loud as his notes.  There are some cool licks on this album. The title track has a good funk to it and a cool solo. "Nothing to Nobody" has that great blues feel with his guitar responding in the silence of his lyrics. "Deaf, Dumb and Blind (for O.T)" continues with that wah-wah funk and Ford's voice fits well. Another heavy blues song on the album is "When I Cry Today." He finishes with a good cover of Paul Butterfield's "Lovin' Cup." Songs like "If" and "Hey Brother" are a departure from his earlier days. Soft ballads that have a smooth feel to them.  As a guitar player, Ford is one of the best, but as a complete musician he's not my favorite. His voice is too weak for the type of music that he plays. As for the lyrics, they are not outstanding. Besides a couple of songs, you'll be hard pressed to remember the lyrics an hour after you've listened to the song. Still, his guitar work makes it all worthwhile.
