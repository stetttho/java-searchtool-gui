 There are two giants that keep on promoting the lifestyle of the blues. The first is B.B. King. The other? Buddy Guy. Here is a man that knows the meaning of the blues. At times he was too poor to afford guitar strings, and used wire instead. How he has any pads left on his fingertips to play, I'll never know. But, he does play here, and it is very good.  There is no doubt that this is an excellent album with the first notes of the title track. Guy makes his guitar cry throughout his solos, and his voice is full of soul and pain. It doesn't slow down after that. He then turns around and does the John Hiatt cover of "Where Is the Next One Coming From" with Mark Knopfler and the Memphis Horns backing him up. Again, an A effort from the blues master. Jeff Beck appears on "Mustang Sally", and then teams up with Eric Clapton to provide additional licks on Louis Jordan's "Early In the Morning". This whole album is nothing but high-powered blues. The album culminates with the powerful "Rememberin' Stevie", a tribute to the late great guitar master, and Guy's dear friend. The tune is hauntingly beautiful and Guy bears his soul for all to hear. This album is what the blues are about, solid guitar playing, strong vocals, and feeling. If you're a big blues guitar fan, this is a must have for your collection. You can't go wrong with it.
