 "The Guitar Trio" of Paco De Lucia, Al DiMeola, and John McLaughlin join together again to perform their magic again with this stunning album. Although it has the same premise as their "Friday Night Live In San Francisco", there are some big differences. One, it's not live, and two, twenty years have passed. Although it is missing a bit of that live energy, this is an incredible album. The Trio work well together taking turns soloing over the tune. The liner notes are kind enough to tell which of the guitar virtuosos is taking the solo. On most of the tunes, they each take one solo. Not only do they share the solo work, the share the composition work each taking the pen to write several songs each. The playing moves from fast and furious, to slow and peaceful. The rhythms are almost all Latin with a flamenco feel to them. "Le Monastere Dans Les Montagnes" is a good representation of both of these feels. The song is sometimes quiet, and nearly passive, and then with a burst of finger, the notes leap out at you in a rapid fire pace. The album opens with a very flamenco sounding "La Estiba". Add in highlights like "Midsummer Night", "Manha De Carnaval" and "Espiritu" you can't go wrong with this album. Once again, these three show the unique chemistry they have between them. It would have been interesting to see how this album faired if it was recorded live. These guys get better with each passing year, and I look forward to their next collaboration. This should definitely be added to your Trio collection.
