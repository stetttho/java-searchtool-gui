 I'm not a big racing fan, but "RalliSport Challenge" changed all of that. This is one of the premier off-road racing games, full of racecourses and 4WD off-road cars. There are three different types of circuits to choose from: Rally, Rally Cross, and Hill Climb. Rally consists of six African Safari courses, six Pacific Northwest courses, and six Mediterranean courses. Each has it's own unique characteristics, from sand, to dirt and mud to curvy tarmac. There are three different circuits for the Hill Climb, including ice, sand and mud. The Rally Crosses are the least interesting because they are a closed loop race. Then you have the cars. Dozens of them. Each more powerful and better handling than the previous. There are SAAB'ss (go wild on the 93 Vegan), Audi's, Mitsubishi's, Ford's, and even a VW Bug.  There are numerous types of games you can play, but the best is going head-to-head with a friend. The replays at the end of each race can be hysterical, especially if you or your buddies are prone to flipping their car off embankments, rocks or cliffs. Plus, up to four of you can play at once giving a new meaning to friendly competition. The Career mode is fun too. Everything is based on points, and the more points you score the more Circuits and Cars are available. Race until the end and unlock that SAAB 93 Vegan, it's the bomb.  Overall, the game is fun, and challenging to a point. Once you learn how to make the turns without losing time or spinning out, you'll pretty much clean up all the computer racers. The last set of races are actually competitive with the computer, but once you conquer the new supped up cars you'll bet them as well. The best is going up against your friends.
