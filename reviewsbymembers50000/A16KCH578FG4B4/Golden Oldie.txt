 My mother probably will have something to say about me calling her music "oldie". As a young child my parents would play a lot of the Kingston Trio. They had most of the Trio's albums, if not all of them, on vinyl. As soon as I learned how to work the record player, it was the Kingston Trio (along with my dad's Herb Alpert albums) that I played. Fortunately, as I grew older, my love for the Trio never stopped.  My favorites have always been the Trio's live albums. Their live albums are part music, and part standup comedy act. "An Evening with the Kingston Trio" keeps with the form. The space between songs is almost always segued with a joke or two. The Trio has fun for the entire night as you can hear in their voices.  The recording is not top quality, and can be recognized even more so on cd, and...it's in mono. Ugly, to say the least, but then again it was recorded live in 1962. Trio fans that used to listen to their albums on vinyl won't even notice the noise, and my even find it a bit nostalgic.  Most of their classics appear on this album. "MTA", the comical "The Shape of Things", "Coplas", and, yes, even "Tom Dooley". The only thing I find missing from this album are "Bandua" and "Greenback Dollar" (probably because they hadn't recorded it yet). Nick Reynolds, Bob Shane, and John Stewart (replacing Dave Guard) put together a great show that any Trio fan should own and love. They take liberties with their songs, which makes listening to the live versions different and fun.
