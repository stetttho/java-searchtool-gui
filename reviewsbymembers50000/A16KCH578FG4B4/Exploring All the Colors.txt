 Ian Moore continues to follow his own sound with his fifth release, "And All the Colors..." on a new label. Moore returns to a slightly more mainstream feel from his "Ian Moore's Got the Green Grass" release, and although this remains a departure from the blues of his self-titled debut, he still is a great singing, guitarist and song-writer.  I was excited to see the appearance of "Leary's Gate" which I had first heard during a show shortly after the release of "Modernday Folklore". The acoustic beginning is slow, almost to the point of stopping, and then he kicks it up with a fast, loud rhythm pulling you into the song. Blues? Not really, but he rocks out before giving us a break in the middle. The adrenalin picks back up with his solo, almost Hendrix style with a lot of whammy and dive-bombs. "Magdelena" is begins as a soft song where Moore's voice takes the center stage through the first chorus with very little backing, and then he adds acoustic guitar filling out the song. The slide solo is cool, and has a bluesy feel to it. Moore picks it up with "Johnny Cash and His Electric Bible". Another song of great rhythm and feel. "Rollercoster" has a great sound. Another best of the songs is "Angelyne," which begins simply and becomes more complex with each layer of sound Moore adds (even a singing saw) building until it reaches a crescendo.  Moore has definitely departed from his roots of a third-generation Texas Blues guitarist, running away from the title of the next SRV. The guitar doesn't take front billing on this album, and he even doesn't take long solos on most of the songs. Instead, he has created cuts relying on his other talents, letting them come to the forefront. The music is good, a departure from his past, but definitely headed towards a bright future.
