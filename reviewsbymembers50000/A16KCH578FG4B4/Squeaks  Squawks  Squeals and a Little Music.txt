 Big Train is the inspiration of traveling by locomotive across the country. Each jazz-laden track is influenced by different parts of the train. The rhythm of clickitty-clack permeates throughout as well as many sounds that one would associate with a big 4-8-8-4 Big Boy.  I first heard Big Train on PBS-TV. It was very interesting to watch the orchestra perform this concept. They used different mutes and techniques to get the squeal and squeaks of the train's breaks, its engines, its whistles and steam being let off. I bought the album later remembering how much I was impressed by the video. Upon listening to the album, I found the sound effects to become annoying after awhile. They could have left the squeals to the beginning and end of the album, and had more time to actually play.  When they do play, the orchestra plays quite well. It is amazing to listen to so many instruments working together to produce music and not just plain old noise (although they do make a lot of noise on several occasions). There are some very good songs here like "Station Call", a great guitar solo on "Observation Car" and "Engine" with an amazing drum solo. This is where I was first introduced to trumpeter Ryan Kisor. Unfortunately, in an orchestra setting, it is nearly impossible to tell who is playing unless you can actually see them.  Overall, I really like this album. I could do without the sound effects though. I don't need to hear squealing breaks to know that I'm on a train. They could have focused entirely on the rhythm and accomplished the same musical image and had a great album. If you're a fan of the Lincoln Center Orchestra and a big brassy sound, don't hesitate getting aboard the Big Train.
