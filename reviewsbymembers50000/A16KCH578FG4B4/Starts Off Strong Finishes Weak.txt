 The premise of this book sounded very interesting, and having read Greg Bear before, I was excited to give "Darwin's Radio" a try. The idea behind the book is that evolution does not occur in gradual changes over many eons of life. Instead, when the human race feels a pressured it evolves in a giant leap. This is an exciting idea because it gives a good explanation to missing links in man's evolution. A dormant virus, called SHEVA, is buried within our genome passed on down from generation to generation. Suddenly, the virus becomes active and expresses itself, which infects both men and women, but causes flu like symptoms and spontaneous abortions in females.  Enter our hero, Kaye Lang, a researcher who hypothesized the existence of such viruses in our genome. It turns out that she is correct, and becomes the leading expert on the disease. The novel starts off as a deep bio-thriller, but it never follows through in delivering the goods. About halfway through the book, the science takes a back seat to politics, and it becomes a book about the government trying to control this strange new outbreak. There were several times that Bear brought up something that could have led to an interesting conclusion, but chose not to follow it. I felt that his characters started to take the path of least resistance and disappointed me for the last third of the book.  I'll probably read the sequel to finish the story. I do like the way Bear writes, and when I was involved with the reading at the beginning of the book, the story was great. I don't see this book as science fiction or a bio-thriller, and was disappointed when he finally came to the conclusion that it wasn't going to be either.
