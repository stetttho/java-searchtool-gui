 This 1987 release by the Ventures puts the guitar team of Wilson, Bogle, and Edwards back together again. Here they spend all of the disc covering tunes that were popular in the `50s and `60s. The songs are strictly instrumental with the guitar taking the vocal portions of the songs. Unfortunately, there isn't anything new from The Ventures on this album, and although entertaining, it lacks in wowing.  Their first cut, "Stars On Guitars"  is a medley of all the songs they have done at one time or another throughout the years, with some licks from other popular songs thrown in for good measure. The only other surf music on the album is towards the end with "Penetration" and "Surfin' & Spyin'". Everything else is pretty much like the original song, just sung by a guitar. This album is fun, but tires quickly. It rarely gets any airplay from my collection as it seems more fit to be played in a grocery store or retail outlet.
