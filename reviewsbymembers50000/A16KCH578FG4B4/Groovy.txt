 John Scofield is a phenomenal player. He's one of those players that makes you want to slam your fingers in a door and run your guitars through a wood chipper. A tendency for guitar players is to let their guitars "talk" too much, but not Scofield. His phrasing only contains the right number of notes and they are never rushed. He's also not afraid of letting his guitar be silent either, letting his pauses build tension in the music as rhythm keeps moving forward. Don't be mistaken that this is a guitar album, because it is not. This album might have Scofield's name on it, but it is definitely a group effort. Larry Goldings adds to the magic with counterpoint on the organ and piano, the walking bass of Dennis Irwin, and drummer Idris Muhammad drums the way jazz should be played.  All of the songs on this album are keepers, and were written by Scofield. Each song is inherently different, and provides a great listening experience. From his soft tones in "Soft Shoe" to the opening groove in "Lazy", Scofield writes and plays beautifully. Scofield also brings horns into the mix with songs like "Bigtop", "Lazy", and "Kool". This is a fun album to listen to as the band interacts as one. Each member builds off of the other. Even though the soloist stands out, you can still hear each individual member as if they were playing alone. Very rarely do you hear such talent mix so well that one is not playing on top of another. If you're into jazz, admire great musicians, and like music that has something to say, look no further.
