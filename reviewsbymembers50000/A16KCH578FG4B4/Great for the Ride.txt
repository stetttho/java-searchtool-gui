 Some call Chris Rea the Mark Knopfler of the slide guitar, either as a put down or a compliment. Whichever way you choose it is true...like Knopfler you either like him or you don't. Rea fills the category of smooth British rock with strong beats and catchy lyrics. Images of cars and women fill his songs covering thirteen albums from 1978 to 1993 on this compilation. Rea's deep and gravely voice is perfect for delivering his lyrics over the bluesy-rock feel of his songs. Add in his ability to play slide-guitar without making it feel country-ish while mixing in solos and rhythms with ease.  There's a lot of good music on this album with a variety of sounds. From the very first notes of "Road to Hell" it's easy to hear the mix of music and voice that makes Rea. The slide solo in the middle is pretty good, and the lyrics are poignant. One of my favorites is "Auberge" opening with a repeating blues theme that runs the course of the song. The guitar work is shared between an electric and acoustic slide giving it a contrasting feeling in the song itself. The outro solo is pretty cool slides on the electric. The perfect song to begin a long drive with. Rea pairs up with Sir Elton John on "If You Were Me" allowing his voice to make a perfect contrast with John's. Drums open up "Julia", and the acoustic rhythm is bright as he sings of the girl separating the verses with a good slide solo. Other greats fill this album like "Stainsby Girls," "Looking for the Summer," and "Fool".  Rea's music is good. If you like Dire Straits or Knopfler's solo stuff, you might find this fairly similar. Rea's guitar work isn't over the top, but he holds his own. I think his real talent is his writing, and his voice has a soothing quality to it even though it sounds pretty rough. Even though this album doesn't contain all of his greatest hits, the ones included here are pretty good too.
