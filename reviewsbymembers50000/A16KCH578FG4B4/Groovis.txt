 Rick Braun is probably one of the best smooth jazz trumpeters out there, and it can definitely be heard on "Beat Street". This album focuses around the trumpet, and is perfect for those who enjoy those crystal clear notes ringing from the bell. Braun has quite a range on the horn and is able to pick notes out of both registers with ease. His solos are well formed and don't lose sight of the song. He plays with such an elegant ease, yet is able to attack with force. "I'll Be There for You" is a great track that symbolizes everything about this musician.  The album opens with "Groovis" where Braun and guest sax-man, Boney James, trade licks back and forth over a funky wah guitar rhythm. For "Papa Dee" Braun pops a mute into the bell and takes up double-duty on the keys. He plays with an idea, and then expands on that idea, but always returning to that original idea. His solos don't lose the melody, and even though he's blowing his brains out to reach high notes, it all fits together. The bluesy "Club Harlem" opens with the deep frequencies of a double bass, and guitarist Peter White's beautiful acoustic work backed by Braun's mournful wails. Braun's solo is smooth and perfect as he trades measures with White. White and Braun has always been a good collaboration and is worth checking out on White's "Caravan of Dreams".  Another great guitarist, Jeff Golub, appears on three tracks "Philadelphia", "Cadillac Slim", and "Marty's Party". He's another one that can roll solos off the fretboard without trying. His phrasing is clear and meaningful, even when he's rattling off sixteenth notes and faster. It's fun to listen to them play off each other on these cuts.
