 This release isn't up to par with the rest of the BSO albums. It may be why Brian Setzer took a break from the Orchestra and go back to the three-piece band for "Ignition". It is probably easier to write for a small group instead of a nineteen-piece orchestra. Setzer moves away from the heart of swing that the BSO had been playing for their first couple of albums. Here, he turns it up a notch, and up a channel.  All of the songs here are alright, but nothing really grabs at me. "Drive Like Lightning" is a hard driving piece that brings in flavors of what the Blood Pharaohs, Setzer's punk rock band from his teenage years, might have played. I did like the take off of Glenn Miller with "Getting' In the Mood", except for the bit of rapping in the middle of the song. The cover of "Mack the Knife" was good as well. "Caravan" starts with a cool drum roll, before Setzer's guitar comes in all twangy. A little bit Arabic and country sounding at the same time, with a lot of fancy guitar work.  Overall, if you're a Setzer fan, this is one to get, but I'd get it last after all of his other stuff (including Stray Cats). It's not bad, but the other stuff is just a lot better.
