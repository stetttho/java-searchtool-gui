 Few can put on a high-energy show as Queen could. With Freddy Mercury dancing about the stage involving the audience with vocal acrobatics it is easy to see how Queen's shows were such colossal events. This two-disc set, originally named "We Will Rock You", is the pre-Freddy mustache from 1979 and is a perfect compilation to the Live Magic/Live at Wembley album showing the growth of the band and how they matured in the decade that followed "Live Killers". The best part of a live Queen album is you can actually hear the fun the quartet his having on stage, as well as the fans. This album is no different. It starts off with an alternate, more rocked-up version of "We Will Rock You", a must have for any fan who has grown tired of the original. Roger Taylor takes center stage for "I'm In Love With My Car" mixing up his high, gravely voice for a song. Of course, such classics as "Love Of My Life", "Bohemian Rhapsody", "Tie Your Mother Down", and the original "We Will Rock You" paired with "We Are the Champions" is here. The fun part of this album is the Freddy led audience participation in "Now I'm Here" also giving into the crowd's demand for "Mustapha", and Brian May's eight minute Ecoplex solo in "Brighton Rock" . Don't miss Roger Taylor's timpani drum solo smack in the middle of "Brighton Rock", you'll never think of those giant drums in the same way again. Another cut to watch for is the folky " `39".  All the greatest early hits are here, performed during an energy packed night. Add in Freddy's ability to connect with the crowd and get them involved in the show and you can just feel the power of these live nights. Freddy, May, Taylor, and John Deacon formed one of the most prolific bands of the rock and roll era, and their live albums are a great place to hear that. A must have for any live concert enthusiast.
