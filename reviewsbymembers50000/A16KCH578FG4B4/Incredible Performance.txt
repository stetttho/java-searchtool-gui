 The cast recording of the musical "Jekyll and Hyde" is nothing more than amazing. Based on the Robert Louis Stevenson book, this musical takes a few liberties to make it more entertaining. Doctor Henry Jekyll is trying to develop a serum to eliminate evil. To finish his testing, he requires a human subject. The hospital board of governors rejects his request, and instead of ending the project he turns to test the serum upon himself. Of course, many know what happens here, but to give it wide appeal, there is a love interest or two. Jekyll is engaged to Lisa, and Hyde takes an interest in a dancer Lucy.  Tension builds as Jekyll fights Hyde for possession of his body.  This adaptation is quite good. Leslie Bricusse's lyrics are well chosen and tells the story in such a way that it works with Frank Wildhorn's music. The best lyrics can fall to pieces if the cast cannot sing them. This is definitely not a problem here. The cast is simply incredible. Carolee Carmello plays Lisa, her crystal voice is all that is innocent. The surprise here is the voice of Lucy, Linda Eder. Her sultry sound stirs up the heat. The best performance of all comes from the lead, Anthony Warlow. This man is simply amazing, playing both Jekyll and Hyde, turning from one to the other in a single moment. Both characters are quite unique, and Warlow makes you believe that there are two separate people singing these parts.  The music is incredible as well. Songs like "This Is the Moment" have reached mainstream airplay, and is one of the best songs off the album. Lucy's sultry dance routine, "Bring On the Men", is flirtatious and randy. "Alive" shows us into Hyde's psyche as he fights a pub full of men, and we get a good hint at Warlow's ability in this play. There are some pretty songs in here as well, like "The Girls of the Night". Even the cast songs, like "Faade" and "Murder! Murder!" are well done.  Definitely worth owning if you enjoy musicals.
