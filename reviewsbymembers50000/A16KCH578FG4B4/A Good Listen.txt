 There are a few bands that provide a good representation of the generation that I grew up in. Simple Minds is one of those bands. Anyone who was around in the `80s has heard this band at one time or another whether they know it or not, probably from the "Breakfast Club" theme.  "Glittering Prize" is a compilation of twelve of their hits from 1981 to 1992. The heart of the band stayed the same for this time as several bassists and drummers came and went. Jim Kerr fronts the band with a smooth, hypnotic voice that helps give Simple Minds its unique sound. Charlie Burchill on guitars and Michael McNeil on the keys round out the band.  Simple Minds composed all of the songs that appears on this album, except for "Don't You (Forget About Me)", which was actually written by Keith Forsey with a few changes by the Minds. After listening to this album (or just knowing the Minds) you can tell that it wasn't written by the band.  This is a definitely hit filled album. With great songs like "Someone, Somewhere In Summertime" "Promised You a Miracle" and "All the Things She Said". "Waterfront" is the classic Minds sound with Kerr's powerful voice, and the band's much bigger sound than its size that would dominate their sound into the next millennium. The album opens with "Alive and Kicking" setting the tone for the album of just plain good song-writing and musicianship. "Sanctify Yourself" shows that the Minds can turn up the heat and sound a little more raw when they want to. My favorite track is the hypnotic "See the Lights".  Since the Minds have been around for so long, starting with "Glittering Prize" is not a bad idea. It is a well assembled album and flows well. If you prefer live albums, definitely start with the excellent "Live In the City of Light".
