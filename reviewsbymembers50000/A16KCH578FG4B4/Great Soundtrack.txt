 This soundtrack was from the movie, "Frankie's House" about photojournalists in the Viet Nam war. The movie was a made for cable feature that followed the life of Tim Page during his stay in the war. Errol Flynn's son, Sean also saw action in Nam behind a camera, and he is the supporting character in the film. I remember the movie being good, but it must have not received a large audience as the movie doesn't appear to have been release to the video market. While watching the movie, I thought that the sound track was pretty awesome, and it should be with Jeff Beck playing.  Many of the songs on this album are for background music for a seen in the movie, and although they may up the tension as you watch, listening without the visual cues is another story. Don't get me wrong, there are some great songs here. "Hi-Heel Sneakers" is a great tune with Beck and Jed Leiber on keys trading solos. It has a sort of country feel to it. The album opens with "The Jungle", which has some pretty amazing guitar work on it, especially in the opening stanza with steep bends and taps. "Cathouse" rocks out pretty good, and "Sniper Patrol" starts out soft and airy before exploding in a cacophony of sounds.  Overall, this album has a ting of Oriental sounding music to it that provides the feeling of being in the middle of the story. The music is good, and the effort by Beck and Leiber should be applauded. If you're fans of either, this is an album to add to your collection. It's a little different, but well worth it.
