 If there is one thing to say about John Hiatt is his ability to write good songs. Even if you've never heard Hiatt before, you will recognize quite a few of his songs. Everyone seems to cover Hiatt. It's hard not to. His lyrics are almost poetical and the music complements well. The Guilty Dogs put on a great live show, and are brimming with raw energy. Good rock with a twang of the South to it.  If this is your first listening of Hiatt, it will take a little while to get used to his voice. His voice is a cross between grating, gravely and whiny. If you can get passed his voice, you are in for a treat (plus, his voice will eventually grow on you). The rest of the Guilty Dogs are Michael Ward, who plays some pretty amazing licks throughout this album complementing Hiatt's acoustical rhythm playing, Davey Faragher on bass and a solid Michael Urbano on the skins.  This 1994 tour provides a wide sampling of Hiatt's All-American music. "Drive South" is a rocking tune that will get your feet a'tapin', and has a flashy intro from Ward. Hiatt quiets it down with only piano on the tear-jerkin' "Have a Little Faith In Me". Check out the upbeat "Memphis in the Meantime" and the slower "Lipstick Sunset". There are so many great tunes on this album, all of them in fact.
