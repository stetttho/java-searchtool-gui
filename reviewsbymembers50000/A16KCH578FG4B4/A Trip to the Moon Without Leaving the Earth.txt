 In the decade of psychedelic music, there were two bands from Britain who would become giants, Pink Floyd and The Moody Blues. Both took the psychedelic movement to great heights and in different directions. Both bands liked to use themes or stories to link an entire album together, and although not the inventor of the concept album, they were pioneers in the creation of them. The inspiration behind this album is the journey to the moon at the end of the 60s, and you know with a title of "To Our Children's Children's Children" there is a story here.  From the opening rumble of "Higher and Higher" we feel the power of Saturn V rockets firing and propelling us in the direction of the heavens. The wordless chorus gives us the feeling of holiness and awe. Justin Hayward's galloping acoustic guitar rhythm lead into Gramme Edge's poetry of escaping earth. Hayward plays a great solo pulling us higher and higher. "Eyes of a Child, Part 2" is a heavier follow up to the longer and softer Part 1. Again the wordless chorus and Hayward's galloping acoustic guitar with blues electric riffs up the tempo of the album after slowing down for "Floating". "Beyond" is an instrumental in the classical Moody Blues arrangement, upbeat and fast followed by slow moments of a different tempo and sound. The upbeat guitar and drums give way to a low drone at the first break, and to strings and a flute at the second. One of the best songs is "Gypsy", full of great lyrics and a great sound. The song continues to grow on me each time I hear it.  This is still one of my favorite Moody Blues albums. A good listening, with enough changes in the music to prevent you from getting bored. The Blues had such a great sound, which they were able to carry out through most of their career. Still, nothing really beats these first seven albums. A must have for any fan of the sixties British sound.
