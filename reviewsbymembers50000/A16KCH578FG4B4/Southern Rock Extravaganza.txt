 You can't get any further south than "Goin' South". Seventeen tracks of classic hits from the greatest Southern Rockers found anywhere. The gang is all here, Marshall Tucker, Molly Hatchet, Georgia Satellites, Little Feet, The Allman Brothers, Lynard Skynyrd, and the Charlie Daniels Band. This is one of the better Southern Rock collections that I've seen. The music is good, even though I would have picked a few different songs to represent the bands on this album. Overall, I like the songs, and the bands. This is one of those CDs you plug in and let it rip for a good ol' time. This is a good compilation, no doubt. You'll be in the south in no time.
