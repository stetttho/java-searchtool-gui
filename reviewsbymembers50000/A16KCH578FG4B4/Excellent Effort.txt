 Bad Habits shows that Colin James has come a long way since his self-titled album seven years earlier (1988). The playing on this album has a definite edge to it. This album is full of some of his own tunes mixed with a strong respect for the blues and its masters.  The music on this album is very powerful. Throughout this album, he is able to mix in horns with his funky blues sound. "Saviour" heavy rhythm introduces us to this album with a large support from the horn section as well as some great slide-playing. The groove is pretty catchy, and you'll have a tough time getting it out of your head. My favorite track from the album is James' own "Freedom". Again, the horns add depth, and his solos are soulful without being overwhelming. Less than half of the songs on this album are James' own, but he steps up to the challenge and plays exceptionally on Howlin' Wolf's "Forty-Four" and Elmore James' "I Can't Hold Out". He even does a heavy slide version of Robert Johnson's "Walkin' Blues", different but tasteful.  James is an exceptional guitar player. Listening to this album one can see why he opened for SRV. In fact, sometimes I can close my eyes and almost see SRV playing, like on the album's title cut. If you're looking for a good guitar blues album be sure to stop here and check out "Bad Habits". I do, again and again.
