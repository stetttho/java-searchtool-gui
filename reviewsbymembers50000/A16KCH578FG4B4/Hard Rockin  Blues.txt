 Could you imagine if your dad's best friend was Stevie Ray Vaughan? Now, could you imagine playing with Double Trouble? Well, Doyle Bramhall experienced both. Son of Stevie's good friend and author of many of Stevie's songs, Bramhall is the product of the blues. Along with Charlie Sexton and Double Trouble's Tommy Shannon and Chris Layton they form ARC Angel. This one time shot produced a very enjoyable album.  Although influenced by SRV, Bramhall has a voice of his own. An energetic guitar player in his own right, he shares the axe duties with Sexton. The two guitarists play off of each other beautifully providing a very full sound. And, the solos are excellent. The two also pen all the songs that appear on this album.  There are too many good tracks here to name one as a favorite. The harder driving songs like "Living In a Dream" and "Sweet Nadine" have a great sound to them. But there is more flavors than just one here. "Sent By Angels" and the nearly tearful tribute to SRV, "See What Tomorrow Brings" are more ballad-like and soulful. Then there's the just plain fun "Good Time". This is album is just a pleasure to listen to. The music is great, with two very accomplished guitarists, and, of course, Double Trouble. It would have been nice to see more material come from this group and to see what direction this group would have taken. This is also a good place to hear some of the younger Bramhall's first work.
