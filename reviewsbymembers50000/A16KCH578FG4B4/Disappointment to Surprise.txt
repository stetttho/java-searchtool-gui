 When I came across this album in the record store, I figured it was a rare SRV album. I mean, there was the legend right on the cover in a hat and soul-point leaning on an axe. I didn't even look at the title, just the songs on the back. "Lenny" was there, so I bought it thinking it I was getting nine tracks of SRV that I've never heard before. I was quite disappointed when I was home and realized my error. For kicks I played it anyway, and was surprised with the opening lick of "Gone Too Long". Stevens might try to emulate Stevie in look and sound, but that doesn't make this album any less great. "Blue Drops of Rain" is one of my favorite guitar-blues albums that I own. He may have copied from the greats of SRV, Albert King, Clapton, and others, but he proves that he can take a style and make it his own. Half of the album he penned himself, and these songs are not lacking compared to the covers he performs. "Gone Too Long" starts the album off and sets the stage for the amazing blues to come. The tune is catchy and Stevens' guitar work will catch you by surprise. His music is varied, and he is able to play more traditional sounding blues like "Rich Man's Woman" and King's "Crosscut Saw", yet still be able to funk it up on "Headshrinker".  The man really knows how to play guitar. He doesn't try to fill up every available space with notes. Instead, he catches the rhythm in his melody so without his backing band, you can still hear the song in his solos - a very difficult thing to do. He gets monster tones on his guitar that will make you drool. His voice fits the genre quite well too. His low gravely growls amplify the pain in his lyrics, like "It's Over".   I thought I was getting some new SRV, but instead I found a new breath of fresh air on the blues scene. Stevens is incredibly talented and should be proud of this album. He might look it, but he is definitely not another knockoff. If you can find this album, don't hesitate in buying it.
