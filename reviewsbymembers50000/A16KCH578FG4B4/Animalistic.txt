 I'll be serious and say that the reason I purchased this album was for the cover of Focus' "Hocus Pocus". It did introduce me to Gary Hoey, albeit at a younger age when I thought great guitar was playing as loud and fast as possible. As time has moved on, I continue to listen to Hoey through works like "Endless Summer II", and I listen to this album less and less. I still believe that the cut of "Hocus Pocus" is the highlight of this album, the rest of it is a young musician trying to find his groove. I feel that he tried to fill every available space with notes.  There are several other tracks that make this album worthwhile. "Bert's Lounge" starts off with a funky rhythm. The melody is appropriate and well done for this song. Again, he overplays the solo by trying to be too flashy, but then he makes room for a cool bass solo from Tony Franklin before turning up the heat again. "Deep South Caf" is one of those monster slide blues tunes. It is one of the better albums on the track because he takes his time and phrases well with his bottleneck. When he drops the slide to take his solo, he just speeds up again. My favorite track of the album is "Motown Fever". Another blues song with a funky rhythm, but instead of trying to show us how limber his fingers are, he takes his time and plays it sweet. No soulless dribble here.  For the most part, the album is a bust. If you're into flashy guitar work full of speed but short of someone like Satriani or Vai, then this is worth checking out because he does fly. Also if you're a big fan of Hoey, and would like to see where he came from, this is kind of cool to hear because there are some really cool parts.
