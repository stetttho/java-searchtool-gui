 The Blue Man Group is one of the more unique acts in theater today. Taking the stage in New York, Boston, Chicago and Las Vegas are the three Blue Men who communicate only with facial expressions, action and music. Their shows are part music and part vaudeville, but the amazing aspect is all the instruments the Blue Men play are homemade. From xylophone looking PVC drums, to Drumbones, to chewing Captain Crunch in time, these men make noise from anything they can get their hands on, except for this noise is musical.  Hence the album "Audio", which is an audio excursion through the sounds of the Blue Man Group and their sounds from a strange assortment of rhythm instruments. The album covers many of the songs played during their performance, plus more. The rhythms are strong and dominate the album as they use their instruments even though you cannot see them. Backed by drums, a guitar and bass, this album is an experiment of sound. The sound can only be classified as a rock orchestra. All the songs are instrumental, and the sound might leave you thinking along the lines of Joe Satriani (if the drum took center stage rather than the guitar). Quiet at times, and loud and explosive at others, the music travels from one extreme to the next and back with never a dull moment.  If you have seen the Blue Man Group before, this is a must to have the music played. If you haven't seen the music before, the album is a must just to see the instruments they have created using PVC tubes long enough to fill warehouses. A unique group that must be seen, but only heard to be appreciated.
