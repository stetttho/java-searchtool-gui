 There is some good information in Dwight Swain's book for building characters, but you'll have to dig to find it. Personally, I felt that Swain's book lacked organization and tended to ramble about character traits never really getting down to the meat and potatoes of the subject. The examples seemed to have been put together in a rushed way without much thought. It's almost as if Swain wanted us to know that anything was possible.  It's true that anything is possible in writing. That is the reason that many of us become writers, but our unlimited possibilities need to be tempered with believability. I was hoping that Swain would spend more time on discussing what makes a character believable, and what makes a character more real and less like a cardboard cutout. Swain does hit this mark on occasion, but it is nothing more than accidental as the information I was looking for was few and far between.  I also found Swain difficult to read because of his rambling. He starts to explain his idea in a new way before finishing the previous explanation. The book seems like he wrote it from the top of his head in one sitting. I was disappointed in this book, and I don't feel that my characters gained anything significant for the time that I spent reading it. There are better books out there that get more involved with characterization without taking up the space.
