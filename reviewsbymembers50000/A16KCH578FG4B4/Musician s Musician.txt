 There are few musicians who can actually make my jaw drop, but Charlie Hunter is definitely one of them. You'll notice that the only instruments in the band are saxophone (John Ellis), percussion (Chris Lovejoy) and drums (Stephen Chopek), and Hunter on guitar. There's no organist and no real bassist, even though you can hear all these instruments on this album. Hunter's 8-string guitar is a meld between the first three strings of a bass and the five top strings of a guitar, and he plays everything else you hear. Hunter's sound mostly consists of Latin jazz. This album is a mix of both slow and up-tempo songs with both instrumentals and singing. The album opens to a percussion piece with a bossa nova feel. Hunter displays his guitar talent starting with "Rhythm Music Rides Again" backed with some great sax from Ellis. "Mitch Better Have My Bunny" returns to the bossa nova rhythm again. Listen to how Hunter mixes a walking bass line with the guitar rhythm. Hunter has several guest along to add to the mix with their voices. "More Than This" is a slow piece allowing focus to be given to the beautiful voice of Norah Jones. Hunter also does a cover of the classic "Spoonful" with the gravelly voice of Theryl De Clouet. An excellent job. Mos Def and Kurt Elling also appear on this album. Each singer lends their talent on two songs each.  The rest of the band are excellent musicians themselves. Both Lovejoy and Chopek provide an entertaining beat to the music. These two are a joy to listen to, and even more fun to see live. It's amazing what these gentlemen do. If you're a fan of guitar, jazz, or even music, check out Charlie Hunter. If you can see him live, he's well worth the price of admission.
