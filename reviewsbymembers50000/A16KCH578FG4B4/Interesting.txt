 Any album that has a track named "She Was Waitin' For Her Mother at the Station In Torino And You Know I Love You Baby But It's Getting Too Heavy to Laugh" has to be interesting. This is the first track of a four-track suite with "Keep On", "Sleepwalker" and "Song for Mr. C". This sets the tone for the entire album.  Phillips has that late sixties folk sound to him with a twist, kind of on the same level as Mason Williams. Like Williams, Phillips is strong in orchestration, mixing horns and strings eloquently and seamlessly as is showcased on "Schmaltz Waltz". But, he is simply amazing when it comes to his lyrics. Simply put, they're poetic. He also has a great voice. He rings on soft ballads like "Steel Eyes" and "The Ballad of Casey Deiss", he performs a melodic type of scat on "Remedial Interruption", and his rapid staccato bursts on "Keep On" and "Whaz' Zat" emphasize his lyrics.  This is a good album from a great musician. The only complaint that I have is that the lyrics do not appear in the liner notes as they did on the vinyl cover years ago.
