 If you like jazz and/or guitar you will love Stanley Jordan. He is one of the most unique players out there. Playing nearly everything in touch-tap technique and sometimes playing as many as three guitars at once. You can hear Jordan playing both the rhythm and the melody at the same time. His speed and precision are amazing.  Stolen Moments is recorded live at the Blue Not in Tokyo in 1990. He opens with a cover of the Led Zeppelin classic, "Stairway to Heaven". This instrumental version provides a new twist, which brings life into a very overplayed song. He follows with a very moving rendition of Coltrane's "Impressions". A very fast tempo piece in which each of the band mates gets to take a chance in the spotlight with a solo. The only original score of his that appears on this album is "Return Expedition" which explores an opportunity for each member to solo, and they do for more than four minutes each. He ends this flawless album with his version of "Over the Rainbow." It's all great music from beginning to end. Giants Kenwood Dennard on drums and Charnett Moffett on acoustic bass (he only picks up an electric bass for "Lady In My Life") complete this very small, very tight band. This album has more of a jazz feeling than some of his other studio albums. Like so many talented artists, when Jordan takes to the stage he turns it up. His studio albums are great, but this is somethin' else.  If you're a Bruce Willis fan, you can catch a glimpse of Jordan in Blake Edwards' 1987 movie "Bind Date" with Kim Basinger.
