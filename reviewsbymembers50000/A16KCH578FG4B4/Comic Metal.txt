 Spinal Tap makes a triumphant return with "Break Like the Wind." Again, David St. Hubbins (Michael McKean), Nigel Tufnel (Christopher Guest), and Derek Smalls (Harry Shearer) pick up their instruments and bring us a tongue-in-cheek look at hard rock. Anybody who knows who this band is has seen the movie, "This Is Spinal Tap," a hilarious look at the ups and downs of touring. Although there are no in-depth interviews of the band members, this album is actually pretty good, and these guys can rock pretty well.  The music is good, but definitely not wowing. It's not the music that makes this album, or the band, worthwhile. We are here for the lyrics. Nothing is sacred, and the Tap attacks within the opening bars of the album with the opening track, begging the question whether this is double-entendre or if it really is about sending a dog to obedience school. The Beatles even fall under their spoofing with "Rainy Day Sun." They get some help from guitar greats Jeff Beck, Satch, Slash and Steve Lukather for the title track, Dweezil Zappa on "Diva Fever," and Cher lends her voice for "Just Begin Again."  This album is quite the production, and all the songs are keepers, some of the lyrics are absolutely great. A fun time had by all, the listeners, the band and the guests.
