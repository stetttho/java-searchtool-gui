 If there is one word to describe Seal it is: talent. This man does everything. He sings, writes, composes and plays on this album. Add in that he has one of the best male voices in the music industry, and you have winner. Seal doesn't waste any time proving this on his self-titled album. Every song on here is incredibly rich in sound and taste. The music flows as if the whole thing was done effortlessly.  "Crazy" received a lot of airplay, and is the easiest song to recognize with Seal's powerful vocals, strong beat, and wah-wah rhythm guitar. If it is the highpoint of the album, you don't have to go down very far to reach the other great songs. "Deep Water" is another strong performance. Seal sings over an acoustic guitar rhythm, with some slide soloing. "Whirlpool" is another acoustic bit with guitar and piano that focuses mostly on his voice. "The Beginning" and "Killer" have a dance flavor to them with the driving beat. All very good cuts.  This album is nothing more than a showcase for Seal's talent, especially his voice. His voice is smooth, yet powerful, and he is able to use it well.
