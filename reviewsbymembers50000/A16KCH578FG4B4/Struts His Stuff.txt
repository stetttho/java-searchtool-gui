 This collection follows Brian Setzer from the old Stray Cats days through his solo, pre-BSO, career. It doesn't matter if Setzer was playing with Lee Rocker and Jim Phantom to form the Stray Cats, or whether he was out on his own, the guy is incredible. This album covers his maturing years, focusing mostly on the time between the Stray Cats and BSO. These are the songs that helped propel him into super-stardom.  Great music is what this album is about. From the popular Stray Cats cuts "(She's) Sexy + 17" and "Rock This Town" to his own powerful solo work "The Knife Feels Like Justice" and "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" it proves Setzer's great talent as a musician and song-writer. His guitar playing and singing are often overlooked, but he is incredible at both. Listen to his voice croon on "The Knife Feels Like Justice" and you just know there was no doubt Setzer would make it. An excellent cover of Eddie Cochran's "Summertime Blues" appears here too. His guitar work is framed with "Echo Park" and "Thing About You". Setzer can rock it out, sing an emotional love song, or just get in a pickin' mood.  Collections like this are great in showing how a musician has evolved during their career, and this album shows how a good musician evolved into a great one. The music is wide and varied, but all of it is classic Setzer. This album is even better because it contains six previously unreleased tracks, making it a necessity for any Setzer fan's collection.
