 Mark Knopfler has always been a great rocker and blues man during his days fronting Dire Straits. When he steps away from the Straits though, he takes a calmer, more laid-back attitude towards his music. Playing with Chet Atkins on "Neck and Neck", and the Noting Hillbillies exposed us to his country and folk flair. "On Every Street" from the Straits was a combination of all these forms of music, and now he takes it one step further with the release of "Sailing to Philadelphia".  Knopfler starts off the album with a rocking tune with a large country-ish twist to it, complete with fiddles on "What It Is". This upbeat feel is continued on "Who's Your Baby Now." "Do America" is tongue-in-cheek rendition of touring the States with a great solo in the middle that shows Knopfler still has his chops. Although the majority of these songs are much slower, they are not any less good. "Speedway of Nazareth" begins slow and picks up as Knopfler solos over the last half, increasing the intensity several times. Van Morrison stops by to do a beautiful duet on "The Last Laugh", and James Taylor lends his voice on "Sailing to Philadelphia".  There is a lot of different material here, but its all good. Knopfler shows that he is still a robust guitarist with his rhythms and solos. His talent does not stop on the strings though. He is also a great lyricist and storyteller. If you like Knopfler's post Dire Straits stuff, this is definitely worth picking up, because it's his best.
