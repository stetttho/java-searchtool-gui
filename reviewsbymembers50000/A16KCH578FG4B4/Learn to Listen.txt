 Dialogue is the hardest thing to write. A story shines when it is done well. When the dialogue is bad, no one can wait to put the book down. Many of us never realize that dialogue happens all around us every day. The number one lesson that Tom Chiarella teaches in this book is learn to listen to this dialogue. Listen to how people talk. Write down what people say. Write down what you say. Listen.  This book was the best that I have read on dialogue yet. Chiarella writes with a simple style that feels like you're actually talking to him about dialogue while sitting over a cup of coffee. At the end of each chapter he provides a few exercises to practice the ideas that he talked about.  Pay particular attention to his first chapter on learning how to listen, and his "Nuts and Bolts" chapter. His chapter on "Writing for Radio, TV and Movies," provides some good ideas even if you are not writing for that medium. This is one of the better texts on writing, and I will hold on to this one for some time.
