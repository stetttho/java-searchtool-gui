 Right Brain Patrol is an experience in fusion jazz. The album is filled with wordless vocal harmonies, and the playing takes on the same airy quality. Led by Marc Johnson on bass with Ben Monder on guitar and Arto Tancboyaciyan on percussion this band sounds very good together. The album takes on a very spatial feeling. The tracks are not filled with massive amounts of notes. Often times, the music is so quiet that you might find yourself checking that the disc is still playing. Too quiet sometimes.  There are a few standout tracks on this album. My favorite is the blues sounding "Netcong On My Mind". The title track, "They Love Me From Fifteen Feet Away",  "Heru Nazel" and "After You" are the tracks I really pay attention to.  Johnson takes to the spotlight with the song "Batuki Burundi" which is just shy of four-minutes of solo bass work. An interesting track is "You" where Arto substitutes his drums for what sounds like water-filled pots, which carries over into "After You" where Johnson joins in with a great bass melody. On "Log O' Rhythm" we find Arto banging on a...well, a log with Johnson's quiet bass on top. "Heru Nazel" has a very Al DiMeola sound to it.  Overall, this is a decent album. The sound quality is a little too quiet for me, and I end up either turning up the stereo too high only to get blasted out by the louder parts, or I'm straining to hear the quieter portions of the music (the majority of it is quiet). There are not enough songs that capture my attention to listen to this album very often. It is good for quiet and relaxed moods.
