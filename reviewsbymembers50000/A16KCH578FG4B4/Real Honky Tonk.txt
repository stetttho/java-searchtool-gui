 Before he was famous, before he married Faith Hill, Tim McGraw was just a young up and coming country singer. This is still my favorite of all of his albums, maybe it's because it has more of a raw-Country sound, at least to me. These ten songs give good insight into McGraw's roots.  All of these songs are keepers. "Memory Lane" is probably his greatest known song from this album as it received some airplay. No less a hit is the honky-tonk sounding "Two Steppin' Mind", and soulful "Ain't No Angels". McGraw shows his humorous side with "You Can Take It With You (When You Go)" about his woman taking everything that wasn't nailed down when she leaves (even leaving a hole where the mailbox used to be). He also can pull up emotions with the sorrowful sounds of "I Keep It Under My Hat", and "Tears In the Rain".  If you're a McGraw fan, it will be different than expected. But, if you're a true Country fan, this is a must buy album. This is Country.
