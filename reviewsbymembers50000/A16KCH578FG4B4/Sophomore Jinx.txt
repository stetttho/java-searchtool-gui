 When I learned that Scott Holt was playing with Buddy Guy I had to check him out. I bought Messing with the Kid, the follow up album to Dark of the Night, on a recommendation. Although the album was decent, I wasn't terribly impressed.  Holt has a unique voice with a little bit of a twang to it. He sounds good on this album. "I Still Love You" is a ballad that really showcases his singing ability (and is, quite frankly, the best song on the album). On "He Stopped Loving Her Today" he sounds very country-ish. I was impressed with his funky blues rhythm playing. The rhythm on the title track, "How Do We Sleep", and with wah on "Black Cat Bone" all have a great foot- taping feel to them.  Unfortunately, his solo work is lacking for me. The man has an amazing talent and skill with the guitar, but the solos feel bland, rushed, and overloaded with too many notes. The Hendrix-like distortion cacophony on "He Stopped Loving Her Today" is simply annoying, and his Hendrix cover of "Who Knows" was the most disappointing song on the album. Don't get me wrong, his solo on "Your Memory Won't Let Me Be" and the title track are good. This makes me think that he tried too hard to match up to Dark of the Night (although I haven't heard this album) falling prey to the sophomore jinx.
