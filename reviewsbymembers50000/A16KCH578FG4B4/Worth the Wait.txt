 It took all six weeks for this album to show up at my door, and believe me, it was well worth the wait. Brian Lynch is an amazing trumpet player with the ability to successfully mix strong technique with true feeling. Brian possesses lightning speed, dexterity, and the ability to play in either register with elegant ease. He plays each song from his toes, giving it his all for the simple joy of the music. When I first heard his cover of Thad Jones' Elusive while driving, and had to pullover to give my whole attention to this song.  But, the quartet is not just about showcasing Brian's chops. With Mulgrew Miller on piano, Essiet Essiet on bass and Carl Allen on drums, this is a complete band. Many times, Brian steps back to let his band mates shine through, and they do. Everyone in the quartet is a complete musician, and their love of the music can be heard in each note they play.  "Tribute to the Trumpet Masters" is a mix of covers and original compositions in the style of some of Brian's favorite trumpeters that have influenced him over his career of thirty years. The album is mixed with upbeat tempo like "Woody Shaw" and slow, soulful songs like Freddie Hubbard's "Eclipse" and Lee Morgan's "Search for the New Land". This album has the most power and soul of any in my extensive collection, and is my favorite to date.
