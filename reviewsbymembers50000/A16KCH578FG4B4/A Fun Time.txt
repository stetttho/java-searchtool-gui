 This is, ex-Georgia Satellite front man, Dan Baird's first solo attempt. He succeeds very well at it too. His country/rock songs are well-written, foot-taping fun. Baird's strength is in his lyrics. Although the music has good rhythm, it is nothing that really stands out. The music is really the medium in which Baird gets his lyrics across. He writes from a light-hearted standpoint as can be determined from the title of the album. This is a great sing-along album, as the words are catchy and simple. It's obvious that Baird had fun making this album, and you can hear it come across in his music. Baird's "I Love You Period" is probably the most famous from this album, but there are quite a few gems in here as well. Other winners are "Pick Up the Knife", "The One I Am", and the crass "Knocked Up".  "Love Songs for the Hearing Impaired" is great to pop in the cd player of your car, put the top down (or at least the windows), and take a drive along a winding two-lane country highway. It's not a work of art, but it's good enough you won't even notice.
