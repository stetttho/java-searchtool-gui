 In the late `70s and early `80s the next generation of blues greats were starting to bloom in Austin, Texas. One of the first bands to explode onto the scene was The Fabulous Thunderbirds. An all-star band comprised of guitarist Jimmie Vaughan, singer and harp player Kim Wilson, bassist Preston Hubbard, and drummer Fran Christina they would begin paving the way for more Texas blues bands to follow.  This album covers five years of music, covering four studio releases.  This is just an all around good album. The songs all have a good rhythm to them with catchy lyrics. "Tuff Enough" and "Powerful Stuff" are the overly popular selections on the album. "Rock this Place" and "Wrap It Up" are two of the best cuts off the album. The only track that I didn't care for was "Why Get Up". In 1990, Jimmie left the band after the untimely death of his brother. "Twist of the Knife" is the only Jimmie-less cut that appears on this album, and his replacement does a very good job of impersonating him. Jimmie doesn't get the credit for being the great guitarist that he so well deserves. Playing in the shadow of his brother (although Stevie felt that it was the other way around), he has been thought of as simplistic and dull. Carefully listen to the ten tracks that he does on this album. His less-is-more approach to playing fits the music, and doesn't distract from the song. He can be fast and flashy when he wants to, but has found a voice of his own. Listen to his "Powerful Stuff" solo and tell me that he's simple and boring. A solid guitarist indeed.  This eleven-track greatest hits album provides a healthy sampling of the three real Fabulous Thunderbirds albums (the ones with Jimmie). Definitely worth listening to if you're a fan of the Texas sound.
