 You can't complain when you put Lee Ritenour on guitar, Nathan East on Bass, Bob James on keys and Harvey Mason on drums. The kings of smooth jazz all joining together to form Fourplay, and release another incredible album in "Elixir". The musicians have been successful on their own, and when mixed together, it is hard not to put out something of this caliber.  The album is packed with good smooth jazz, mostly written by the guys in the band. There are some exceptional gems here like "Magic Carpet Ride" with some great solos from Ritenour and James. Phil Collins lends his voice and his lyrics to "Why Can't It Wait Till Morning", which is well done by the band and Collins' voice is very fitting. The title track is very jazzy, and what a great sound from Ritenour. "Play Lady Play" is a little more funky and allows East to step forward and slap his bass around a bit. "Licorice" also has a good sound.  I was pleased with this release from Fourplay, and it gets a lot of airplay from my smooth jazz collection. Fourplay is definitely a band worth pursuing, as well are each of the guys in the band. I have been a large fan of Ritenour and came across his work with Fourplay in pursuing him. His solo stuff is exceptional, and I recommend his Wes Montgomery tribute, "Wes Bound".
