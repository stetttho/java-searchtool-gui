 The "Selected Writings and Speeches of Abraham Lincoln" is an anthology of speeches, letters and telegrams that he wrote from his reputed first political speech in March of 1832 to his last public address on April 11, 1865 just four days before his death. Over the thirty-three years of writing, we are able to see the Great Emancipator's writings change.  Lincoln had one of the toughest presidencies to date. He ran for office when the Union was at odds, and would soon see his country divided just before he became president. His stands on slavery took a back seat to reuniting the Union. As time went on, you can see in his writings how his job of bringing a country back together, and peace to the land, wore on him. Lincoln was obviously physically and mentally tired by the close of the war.  Editor T. Harry Williams provides a great introduction that covers the course of Lincoln's career and the special issues he had to face during that time. He also begins each of the seventy-six pieces of Lincoln's work with a short note that gives enough information as to the context and history of the writing. Of the writings, I found the response to Senator Douglas (1854) very interesting and intriguing as well as his communiqus with his generals during the war. Of course, this anthology also contains the Gettysburg Address and his inaugural addresses.  Lincoln was a powerful writer that focused on the issues that the public was concerned about. His writings were almost poetical, and, at times, full of passion. There is no doubt from reading his speeches and letters that Lincoln loved his country. This man could say more in a ten-minute speech than today's politicians can say during a whole term. The speechwriters of today should revisit the speeches of this great writer.
