 Many of us had our first exposure to Dire Straits when MTV did nothing but air "Money for Nothing" from the "Brothers In Arms" album. It is unfortunate that that album became their defining moment because every album that proceeded it was exceptional. Of those exceptional albums, the album that was the greatest is their self-titled debut album. A mixture of blues, rock, Country and Mark Knopfler's unique guitar method fill the nine tracks of this album.  There is not a track on this album that you will want to skip. The opening track, "Down to the Waterline" sets the tone for the album. As the tune opens, you can almost picture yourself walking down the docks at night through a fog, and then a few well-placed notes on the guitar lead us into this upbeat song. The solo is killer as is all the guitar work throughout this song. "Water of Love" continues the magic with Pick Withers laying down a great rhythm track, and Knopfler playing slide on his Dobro. One of the best songs on the album is "Six Blade Knife", a very strong blues piece. This sound has been imitated many times, which is understandable because it is a great song. Knopfler's solos are slow and meaningful. He doesn't have to use a lot of notes to get his point across. Probably, the most popular song to come off this album is "Sultans of Swing", and it is easy to see why. The rhythm is catchy, the riffs between verses are powerful, and the solo is amazing.  There are not many powerful albums out there that can match this debut effort. If I had to keep but ten albums in my collection, this would definitely be one of them. If you're looking to get some Dire Straits, this album and the live "Alchemy" are the only ones you truly need. The others are quite good, but this one is simply the best.
