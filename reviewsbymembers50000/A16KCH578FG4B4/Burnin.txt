 From the opening notes of this album the Jimmy Bruno Trio really burns. If you are a jazz guitar fan, this is an artist - as well as an album - that belongs in your collection. Bruno always seems to be in control of his music, and he knows exactly where he is going. His solos are brilliantly harmonized playing connecting chords while never losing the rhythm or the feel of the song. Even when the band drops out completely, you are not lost in just a dazzling display of notes, there is structure here.  The second half of the album, Scott Hamilton joins the trio on sax. Bruno plays off of Hamilton very well as he turns up his performance. Unfortunately, I don't believe that Hamilton's playing is up to the level that he is capable of as demonstrated by some of his other albums. Instead, it becomes a frame to really showcase Bruno's talent at the more. Picking a favorite song off this album is like picking a favorite finger - you wouldn't get rid of any of them. The music is varied enough that you never feel like Bruno is in a rut. The band is rounded out with Craig Thomas on bass and Vince Ector on drums. Both are fine musicians, and support Bruno well.  Bruno was on fire this night, and played with every ounce of his soul. Each note he plays is dripping with it. Enjoy this one, it's worth it.
