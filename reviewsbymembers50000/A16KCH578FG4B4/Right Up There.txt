 This is the latest release from Marc Cohn, and "Burning the Daze" ranks right up there with his other albums. Cohn proves again that he's a triple-threat with his lyricism, vocal, and musical talents. His voice hasn't lost any qualities since his previous release, and the music is good. There seems to be more pain in both his voice and lyrics than in the past.  The album opens with "Already Home", another great opener that'll catch your interest like "The Rainy Season" or "Walking In Memphis". He mixes guitar, horns and his voice so very well on this track, and it sets the tone for the album. He adds a slightly overdriven guitar for "Lost You In the Canyon" for a little harder sound.  "Olana" focuses on Cohn's melodic voice, and the many layers of this song sound so simple under Cohn's magic. He picks up the pace again for "Valley of the Kings", giving it just a touch of Arabian flare, and giving his voice a workout. One of the best songs off this album is "Turn On Your Radio", a soft bluesy feel. The lyrics just flow right, like all of Cohn's songs, making this a powerful song.  Cohn's musical ability is simply amazing. If you liked the first two albums he did, then don't hesitate to get this one. It's a little different, slightly heavier in meaning, but great music all the same.
