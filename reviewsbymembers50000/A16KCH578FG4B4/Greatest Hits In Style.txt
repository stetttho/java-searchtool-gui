 Leave it to Satch to release a greatest hits with style. This two-disc set contains most of his popular stuff from past albums, but there is a twist: one disc are studio version, the other are live. The whole album is great, but I lean towards the live disc for more of my play. Satch plays with such energy even in the studio, but when he's in front of an audience, he can kick it up to an eleven. All of his rockers and ballads are here, from "Always with Me, Always With You" and "Rubina" to "Satch Boogie" and "Big Bad Moon" covering everything from the EP "Dreaming #11" to "The Extremist" and everything in between. The only song on this twenty-eight-song set is "Woodstock Jam." It sounds pretty cool to start, but becomes extremely boring after sixteen minutes of it.  When it comes to hard-rock guitar instrumental, nobody plays like Satch. A must have for everyone.
