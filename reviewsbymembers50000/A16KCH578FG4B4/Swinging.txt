 Brian Setzer might not have been the person to revitalize big band and swing, but he sure gave it his best. This is the first installment of the Brian Setzer Orchestra showcasing a 19-piece big band. If you miss the big band sound, or just like to hear a lot of horns in your music, you will not go wrong in getting this album.  Setzer wrote nearly half the music that appears on this album, and he's nearly as good with a pen as he is with a guitar. There are some great tunes to be found here, in fact there isn't a single dud, and they all swing. The BSO tears it up with "Brand New Cadillac", a great cover of "Route 66", and "Sitting On It All the Time". He also slows it down with "September Skies", "There's a Rainbow `Round My Shoulder", and "A Nightingale Sand In Berkeley Square".  If you're looking for an album that can fit any mood you're in, this is it. Setzer is a pro at mixing up his songs so you don't feel like you're getting an hour of the same stuff over and over again. He melds well with his orchestra, and these guys shine when they step forward to take their solos. This is one fun album to listen to.
