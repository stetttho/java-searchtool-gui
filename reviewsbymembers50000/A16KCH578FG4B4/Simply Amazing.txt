 There's nothing simple about Brian Lynch except that he's amazing. "Keep Your Circle Small" is the first of two quartet albums he has released under his name (the second being "Tribute to the Trumpet Masters"), and hopefully these will not be the last. The quartet really focuses on trumpet, a pressure that Brian more than steps up to.  Brian surrounds himself with great musicians yet again. David Hazeltine on piano, Peter Washington on bass, and Louis Hayes on drums rounds out the quartet. As a quartet, they are tight and play off of one another well. Each takes a turn in the spot light and each shines. My favorite cut off this album is the slow, Latin sounding "Bolero de Sata." Each effortless note that Brian plays is dripping with soul. Washington's and Hazeltine's solos are also very moving. If this piece doesn't tap your emotions, then nothing will. "The Trifle" is a very upbeat piece that showcases Brian's chops, and Hayes takes a lively drum solo.  I've said it before, "Brian is a complete musician." He is a technical master of the trumpet. Any note is readily attainable for him. It's not Brian's ability to play the trumpet that's so impressive, but his ability to create music. I believe Brian could create music if all he could play was one note. His ideas flow so easily it's as if he had planned each note before even picking up his trumpet. He lives for the music and plays for the music, and surrounds himself with those that believe the same as he does.
