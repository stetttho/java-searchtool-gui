 "Body of Secrets" is the history of the ultra-secret National Security Agency in all of its iterations from World War II until the sinking of the Kursk in 2001. The stories that James Bamford tells throughout the sixty years he covers are sometimes amazing, sometimes reveling, sometimes scary, and, unfortunately, sometimes boring. Instead of giving a year-by-year account of the NSA's doings, the book is based around a handful of major events that Bamford describes in great detail.  Although I found the methods of intelligence gathering interesting, I found that the overall feeling I received from the book was that of either fear or anger. ... For the most part I thought that "Body of Secrets" was pretty good. If nothing else, it promoted a lot of thinking and digesting of the stories Bamford tells. His writing is of a style that is easy to read, although he is quite a bit wordy. He also has a tendency to slip of onto tangents occasionally, but some of these secondary stories and facts I found interesting. The only complaint I have with "Body of Secrets" is the second to last chapter. He goes through, in detail, the different people that currently work for NSA, and where their offices are located, and the EEO and affirmative action problems the NSA has faced. I thought I was reading a book on the signal intelligence of the NSA, not its hiring practices. Overall, it's worth the read, especially if the NSA intrigues you.
