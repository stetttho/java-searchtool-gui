 Rare is it to find an artist that defies all the comparisons and genre typecasting, but Johnny A. does just that with his release "Sometime Tuesday Morning". It is obvious that Johnny A. has an eclectic taste of music, as this album samples across the boards. He plays what he wants to play. His style is slow and soulful, without wasting notes. And his sound! Nothing sounds a sweet as a clean guitar. Johnny A. doesn't hide behind a wall of distortion, delays or massive overdrives. When he does use effects to crunch it up a bit, it is with style and taste that compliments the music.  The thing that disappoints me the most about this album is the fact that it took me so long to discover it. Thanks to my local radio stations "Studio C" program of bringing touring musicians in and recording live cuts, I first heard "Oh Yeah" live (and if you think that the album version is great, try finding this live version). After hearing that, I had to have this album. The only other disappointment is the fact that it's so short, just over 48 minutes of music, but you'll enjoy all of it. This album is full of gems, and you won't be skipping over any tracks. Each song has a slightly different flavor. From the soulful and slow "Wichita Lineman" to the more upbeat "Up In the Attic" Johnny A. knows exactly how to play to stir emotions and feeling. His cover of "Walk Don't Run" is a slowed down swing version of the original surf tune that shows how he can take a song and make it his own. Johnny A. doesn't fill his solos with notes, but says more in between the notes, and although he can play fast, he prefers to keep it slow giving his notes more power.  If you love guitar, swing, jazz, country, or just plain old rock, then look no further than this excellent album. Johnny A. is a master of guitar and tone, and proves it to us all on this well-done album.
