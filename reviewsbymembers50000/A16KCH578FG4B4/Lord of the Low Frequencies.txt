 Not many people can step out and make the bass the front instrument, but Stanley Clarke sure can. Clarke composes most of his songs with a smooth jazz feel that builds around the bass like many musicians build their music around a guitar, trumpet or sax. His unique style of snapping the strings against the fretboard gives him his signature sound. Although there is no "School Days" track on this album, it is a good listen, smooth.  "East River Drive" shows off Clarke's smooth jazz composing abilities. His bass leads us through the song with a good solo by George Howard on sax. The other extreme is "Funk Is Its Own Reward" where Clarke gets, well, funky. His long time collaborator, George Duke, sits in for this upbeat tune. This should get your feet taping with a cool groove, and some impressive string snapping, slapping and sliding. "I'm Home Africa" is another upbeat tune, with a great solo from saxophonist Doug Webb. Clarke can really romance it up with slow tunes as well like, "What If I Forget the Champagne". And the tunes "Illegal" and "Lords of the Low Frequencies" are a base workout.  Ever since I saw Clarke perform "School Days" with Larry Coryell on guitar, he has been one of my favorites. He has helped move me over into the Jazz world with his incredible musicianship. This album, like "Hideaway", is smoother than his stuff from the seventies. It's still a great album, with great playing, just a little different. It still doesn't top my favorite album by him, "Stanley Clarke and Friends, Live at the Greek" with Larry Carlton, Billy Cobham, Deron Johnson, and Najee.
