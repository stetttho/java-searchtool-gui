 I believe that Jeff Healey got caught up in the rap movement that started to explode across the music scene in the early 90's. "Feel This" is an example of trying to meld music, experimenting with new sounds. Definitely, less bluesy sounding, while rock dominates this album he also tries to give several songs the short staccato sound of rap. Overall, this is a pretty decent album.  Jr. John appears on "If You Can't Feel Anything Else" a horrible attempt at a rap that melds in Healey's dive-bombs and squealing guitar. We can't blame Healey though, everyone had to try it (Aerosmith succeeded and Billy Joel didn't). Fortunately, that's the worst song of the album. "Lost In Your Eyes" is a great ballad that expresses Healey's voice, as does "Heart of an Angel". "My Kinda Lover" and "Baby's Lookin' Hot" are a couple of up-beat rocking tunes. I also enjoy "Dreams of Love" and "You're Coming Home".  Healey is able to put some good licks on each song. He is definitely a good guitarist, but it is not enough to save some of the songs off of this album.
