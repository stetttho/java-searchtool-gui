 When you plug your guitar through a handful of effects and monster amps, it becomes very easy to hide behind your music. Going acoustic changes all of that. It puts the musician on the spot and exposes his weaknesses. But, it also gives that musician the opportunity to explore their music more deeply. It also changes the music, giving it a different, new feeling. Just ask VH1 about the reason for creating the show "Unplugged".  Songs of a Circling Spirit is a wonderful example of a musician exploring the deeper workings of his music. Tom Cochrane takes twelve cuts from his solo and Red Rider days and covers them all acoustically. With Bill Bell helping out on guitars and mandolin, and Gregor Beresford on stripped down drums (playing African Drums and Djembe on many tracks) make this a complete change from the Cochrane/Red Rider music of norm.  You can hear the difference right away with "Lunatic Fringe". The acoustic flare adds power to the song bringing out the lyrics, and a mandolin solo. Tara MacLean provides her sweet twang of a voice to the backing vocals of "All the King's Men", one of my favorite songs from this album. Cochrane and Bell provide some great guitar work the track as well as "Brave and Crazy", "White Hot" and "Good Man, Feeling Bad".  This album has a much more intimate feeling than anything Cochrane has ever done before. Cochrane takes it a step further by making this an interactive disc. Providing an interview describing what his music means to him, especially in the acoustic style of this album. There are also video clips and a complete discography including sample tracks.
