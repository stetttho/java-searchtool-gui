 Willie Nelson is a unique individual who plays to his own beat, sometimes several different ones in a single song. He is a great guitarist who happens to feel the rhythm of a song a little more freely than others, and thus is difficult to play with, but his guitar playing is sweet and the tone of his guitar is full for this purely instrumental work. Ten cuts fill this album covering soft jazzy tunes to more upbeat blue-grass-ish/country style. Overall, the tracks are good, played in Nelson's own style. The cover of Django's "Nuages" is excellent, and his cover of "Sweet Georgia Brown" is upbeat with good solo work. Nothing stands out as amazing, but Nelson provides a good mix of jazz and country. A fun listen, but fairly short.
