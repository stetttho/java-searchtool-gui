 The Vandals of old put together two albums on one CD, "Peace Through Vandalism" and "When In Rome Do As the Vandals". Seventeen tracks of psycho-punk with a touch of rockabilly. This is one of the rare bands that are together because there is nothing more fun to do then to play their music. Politically incorrect, facetious, satirical and having a good time describes the band perfectly.  There are plenty of gems on this album. From "H.B. Hotel" a take on the old Elvis standby with some really nasty lyrics about the girl that dumped Stevo, to the punked-out version of a cowboy skinhead sheriff going to a town full of mowhawks to catch a murderer in "Mowhawk Town". They even cover Focus' "Hocus Pocus", and end with the laid-back, Latin sounding "Rico". The album is all high-energy driving beats that will thrill even those with just a little punk in their roots. The classics are all here as well, including, "Anarchy Burger", "Urban Struggle", and "Slap of Love". The best part of this album is to see how this band of 80's fame influenced a slew of bands in the 90's. From Nirvana to No Doubt to Johnny Sako, you can hear the Vandals in their music. If you like to have fun, and don't take things too seriously, and like the vicious speed of a punk sound, then this is a good place to start. Good luck in finding it.
