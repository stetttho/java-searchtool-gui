 Being a sucker for great female vocalists, it's no surprise to see Mindy McCready's debut album in my collection. She has the perfect drawl and tremolo for Country music, and she can belt out tunes with the best of them. There is an amazing amount of strength in her voice, yet her sound is crystal clear, and it drips with pure emotion. All of the songs on this album are great. From the opening, "Ten Thousand Angels" until the very last note of "Breakin' It" fades away, McCready's beautiful voice will astound you. Start with the ballad "Maybe He'll Notice Her Now" to get the full effect of this siren's passionate voice. You can almost feel the pain of the woman having to leave her man for him to realize how important she is. Richie McDonald's voice provides excellent counterpoint to McCready's. McCready's other ballads are good. Her voice really shines on "Ten Thousand Angels", and "Have a Nice Day" but doesn't compare. But, McCready isn't all about ballads. She turns around every man's excuse in the rocking "Guys Do It All the Time". "It Ain't a Party" and "A Girl's Gotta Do (What a Girl's Gotta Do)" is another of upbeat tune. You can almost hear the smile on her face as she sings these songs.  Her backing band is good, and carries a good Country rhythm with a lot of slide guitar. Overall, this is an excellent vehicle to debut McCready's stunning voice. It's well worth it to have this one in your collection.
