 This is simply an amazing live album from Miles and the gang. Tempers flared before the show, which translated into an emotional, power-packed effort. I doubt that you will find a more energy intense live album around. These boys show what music is all about with their superb playing. George Coleman on sax, Ron Carter on bass, Herbie Hancock on piano, and the Tony Williams on drums.  There is such power on this album that you'll welcome the brief breaks for Mort Fega's announcements. My favorite cut of the night is "Walkin'", which is nothing more than a playground for these talented musicians to make themselves be heard. Everyone gets to carry a solo, and they are all amazing. Hancock sounds like he has fifteen fingers as he flies across the ivory keys, and Coleman's and Davis' solos are amazing too, but Williams pounding on the skins is unbelievable. Most of the album is this way. "All Blues" is another of my favorite tunes here. The second disc is highly upbeat with "So What", "Four" and "Joshua".  All the boys put in such performances throughout the show. Everyone is definitely on top, and the band was tight. If you are a fan of Miles, this is one that you have to have. This show was definitely mind blowing, and it still amazes me every time I listen to it.
