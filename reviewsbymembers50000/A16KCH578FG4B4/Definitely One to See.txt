 Junior Brown is a guitar enigma. He's a little bit country, a little bit western, a little bit rock and roll, a little bit blues, a little bit surf.... In a live show, you never are quite sure what he'll be throwing your way. One thing is for certain, you will definitely be amazed. Although "Guit With It" isn't at the same intensity as his live shows, it is still a masterpiece of dazzling finger-work on the fretboard and slide. His hybrid guitar that's half Telecaster and half pedal steel (without the pedals - he does all the string bends with his ring finger behind the slide) is a sight to behold. It's even a greater treat to watch him play it.  "Guit With It" is a playground to show off Brown's talents, and he has many. My favorite track on the album is the instrumental, "Sugarfoot Rag". A brilliant display of his flat-picking ability and fingers faster than light. He moves seamlessly between the Tele and the steel. He makes it trickier by adding vocals for the remaining songs. His voice is a low rumble that's very fitting to his playing. When Brown sings, you can't help but smile, especially with lyrics like "You're wanted by the police, and my wife thinks you're dead", which guest stars Jimmie Vaughan on guitar. His songs are full of humor and irony like "Party Lights" and "Highway Patrol", and he can even get a little romantic like the duet with his wife "So Close Yet So Far Away" and "The Gal from Oklahoma".  Brown is definitely what country should be about. Everything he plays, no matter how far he strays, still has a twinge of country to it. Even if it is Jimi Hendrix's "Red House" underneath all that "Guit-Steel Blues" or "Foxy Lady" (sorry, you'll have to catch this one live) Brown is country at heart. If you're a guitar fan, you'll have to catch Brown live just to revel in his high-energy performances and amazing guitar work. He's easily worth twice the cost of admission, and you don't even have to like country to enjoy the show...or album.
