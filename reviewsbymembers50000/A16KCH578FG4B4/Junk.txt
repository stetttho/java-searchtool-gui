 Save money and time by manually moving your programs over to your new computer. The idea of having everything moved over to my new computer automatically sounded like a good idea. Installing the Relocation software was fairly easy, and it only took a little finagling for the computers to recognize each other through the USB. I started the transfer, and after 20 minutes it got stuck on a file. It would transfer half the file, announce that it lost the USB connection, announce that it found the connection, and would start to re-transfer the file again only to have the same scenario repeat itself at the exact same point in the file transfer. I'd have to [stop] the transfer, find the file, delete it, and start over from the beginning. The next time, it took only 30 minutes to find another file to repeat this process on. The program told me it would only take about 3 hours to transfer everything, but I gave up after nearly four hours of using the Relocation software with only the My Documents folder moved. I could have installed all the programs, and transferred all my desired files in less time than that, and I would have saved seventy dollars.  Sometimes, too good to be true simply is. This software is junk, and should be avoided if you want to retain your sanity.
