 There are a few albums that totally define the 80s, and this is one of them. Phil Collins spent his time alternating between his solo career and playing with Genesis, until the solo career won out. Of course, during this time, a lot of Genesis sounded like Collins' solo stuff as well. Hired for his drumming, and not his singing, although now he's known mostly for his singing.  All of the songs on this album are good. Collins is a good songwriter, and has a very fitting voice. He's just fun. Great hits came off this album like the nonsense word title "Sussudio", which gave way to many little girls being named such. ""Don't Lose My Number", "Take Me Home", and "One More Night" received tons of airplay, and still do. His lesser popular stuff on this album is good too, like "We Said Hello Goodbye", which turns out to be my favorite song on the album.  This is a classic album, and anyone who grew up in the 80s probably already owns this album.
