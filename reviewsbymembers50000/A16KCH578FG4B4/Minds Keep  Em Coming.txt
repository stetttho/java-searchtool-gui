 "Good News From the Next World" is another great album from Simple Minds. The Mind's continue to grow with the release of this album, while the minds of the band are Jim Kerr and Charlie Burchill. This album seems to have a lot more edge to it than to previous releases. Kerr and Burchill pen nine songs that continue in the style of the Mind's from the past while taking them to new heights of sound.   The album opens with a crescendo of sounds, drums and guitar before Kerr's voice cuts through the mix with "She's a River". The song is a powerful wall of sound with Kerr's voice sounding rich and full. Kerr has always had a great voice, but it has aged to near perfection, and this single becomes a playground for his vocal acrobatics. This fist cut makes the album worthwhile in it's self. "Night Music" sounds a little more like Mind's past material, yet with an edge to it giving it separation from that 80's sound. Burchill's guitar work is prominent, taking a few short riffs to add color to the song. He opens "Great Leap Forward" with another great riff. The song sounds like vintage Mind's. The growl in Kerr's voice for "And the Band Played On" makes the song.   I've always been a big fan of the Mind's, and like to see bands experiment with new sounds and material without leaving their fan base behind scratching their heads. Mind's does exactly that. "Good News" is new, yet has enough of the stuff that made us enjoy the Mind's of old. An excellent album for any Mind's fan, or anyone who enjoys good rockin' music.
