 There is nothing quite as sweet as the sound of a nylon-string guitar. It's refreshing to see more and more artists playing such a lovely instrument, like Marc Antoine, Peter White and even Sting. Although Antoine doesn't stick strictly to the classical guitar, it is featured prominently on this album lending to the smooth sounds of "Universal Language". As a player, Antoine flavors his music with the sweet sounds of Spain and smooth Jazz.  The album opens with the upbeat "Palm Strings", with a touch of horn, keyboards and voices to back his playing. In the middle of the song he shares the solo with flutist Dave Valentin before jumping back into the chorus of the song. "El Camino" brings us to a nouveau flamenco sound with a scratch board flamenco strums. The melody has a strong Latin feel, and a touch of electric guitar to add depth. This is a highlight of the album. More of a South American feel can be found in his "Bossa Nouveau" where he lays down a bossa nova rhythm and then solos over it. Add in the sythed strings and the keyboard makes the song full and elegant. Moving to the old country, "Celta" gives the feel of a Celtic or Irish ditty with the opening sounds of the song. The melody carries us over a traditional sounding rhythm as Antoine stretches out his fingers. The outro solo is the shining moment of the songs as Jeff Golub doubles on Mandolin. "Elkya (Hope)" sounds a little bit African with a heavy drum beat which the guitars surround and the wonderful voice of Lokua Kanza.  Antoine takes us on a world tour of music with "Universal Language." One thing is for certain that no matter where you are from, this album is good. The flavors of the music add variety to the album, but Antoine's playing remains great on every track. His soloing is a good fit for the music, usually providing good counterpoint to the rhythm. A very good smooth Jazz album with a variety of colors.
