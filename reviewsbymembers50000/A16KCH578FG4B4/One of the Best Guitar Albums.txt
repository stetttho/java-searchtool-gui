 I never knew what I was missing until this album was released back in 1990. This is definitely one of the best guitar albums, and one of the best guitarists. Eric Johnson has amazing tone, technique, blinding speed, and a good sense of how to mix it all together. If you like the guitar, blues, or just good music, then this album definitely needs to be in your collection.  "Ah Via Musicom" is a mix of instrumental guitar work and songs, yet the album is mostly focused on Johnson's guitar. Johnson blazes through a pentatonic workout in the opening of "Cliffs of Dover" with fingers a blur. His tone is crystal even when distorted, which gives a great sound to the melody of this tune. "Righteous" is a masterpiece and the heaviest tune on the album. He builds his solos directly from the rhythm in a seamless manner that keeps the feel of the song even when deep in his solo. "Trademark" follows this same formula, yet is much more laid back - my favorite song off the album. His "East Wes" is in the style of the great Wes Montgomery's octave playing. Johnson grabs his acoustic guitar for a quick solo in dropped D tuning on "Song for George" that is absolutely beautiful.  Johnson's weakest point is his voice. It is not the deep, gravely voice you would expect from someone who's from Austin, but it seems to fit with his playing. "Forty Mile Town" is a perfect example of this mix of guitar and voice.  The great Roscoe Beck and Kyle Brock share the bass duties, while Tommy Taylor fills in on drums and Steve Barber plays keys. Together with Johnson, this band is tight and plays well. The music is very good, and the guitar work is amazing. This was the album that made me decide that I too wanted to play guitar, and it is still one of my favorite albums to this day.
