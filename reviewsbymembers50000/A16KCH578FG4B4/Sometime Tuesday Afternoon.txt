 "Get Inside" is the sophomore release for Johnny A. If you were a fan of "Sometime Tuesday Morning," you'll enjoy this follow-up album. Johnny A. keeps to what worked for his first album, a myriad of musical styles ranging from blues to jazz to country. There are some similarities between songs from the two albums, most notably "Sing Singin'" mirrors "Oh Yeah" quite a bit. Even with these resemblances, this is still a pretty good album full of great guitar work and variety of styles.   The highlight for me is the cover of Hendrix's "The Wind Cries Mary", but as Johnny A. covered the surf classic "Walk, Don't Run" previously, he has taken some liberties here as well. The song is jazzed up, and sped up as well with staccato chords, sweet playing and a trumpet in the middle provided by Garret Savluk. This is a very cool rendition of one of my favorite Hendrix's tunes. "Hip Bone" is rocked out jazz that opens the album well before touching a little country with "I Had to Laugh." He slows it way down with the bluesy "Krea Gata," where each note is slow and meaningful as Ron Stewart uses brushes on the drums. They kick it up into high gear, and Johnny A. rips on the guitar and Stewart bangs on the skins before bringing it back down for the finish. I think he has a little more of a country flare on this album than the previous, but is stellar on the guitar just the same.   For a second album, I believe Johnny A. dodged the sophomore jinx, and put out a very nice effort. I'm still big on "Sometime Tuesday Morning," but as I listen to this more and more, it's climbing up there with the first one. Johnny A. fans will appreciate this new release.
