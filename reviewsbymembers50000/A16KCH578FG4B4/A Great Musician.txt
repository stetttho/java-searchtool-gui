 There probably are only a handful of guitarists that can truly be considered great. Robben is definitely on my short list of those guitarists. Creator of the Yellowjackets back in the late seventies, he's also toured as the guitarist for Miles Davis, Michael McDonald, and even Kiss (for twice scale). Robben has done a lot of studio work for other musicians as well.  "Handful of Blues" is a great album that displays his blues chops. Great foot-taping rhythms with complex soloing makes this album a must have. "Rugged Road" opens the album with a hard driving rhythm that sets the stage for the fifty minutes of music. Most of the songs are Robben originals with three covers, and one song written by Roscoe Beck. The only weakness to be found is in Robben's voice. It's not the deep, gravely voice one expects of the blues, but it doesn't distract from his music.  Robben is not the only musician of incredible talent on this album. He is backed by Roscoe Beck on bass and Tom Brechtlein on drums. His own brother, Mark Ford appears on several songs belting out notes on harmonica. If you like harmonica, check out "Running Out On Me". "The Miller's Son" is an instrumental where Robben and brother Mark pass the soloing off to one another. And don't miss the Willie Dixon cover of "I Just Want to Make Love to You."  If you love guitar, especially the blues, this is definitely a must have for your collection.
