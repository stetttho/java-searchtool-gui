 There is nothing to puzzle over for the second installment from Enigma, "The Cross of Changes". It is simply a great album. This is an album that flows from beginning to end without a single dead spot, or a single wrong note. The music is airy with, at times, a bit of an edge. The lyrics are perfect and the voice is used as an instrument whether it is just singing notes, Gregorian or Native American chants. This is a perfect album to turn off all the lights, turn up the stereo and just get lost in the music.  There are many great songs on this album. "Return to Innocence" has a strong Native American feel to it with the chant that is interspersed with soft lyrics. The music is so good that it has been pieces of it have been used in movies. Most notable is the ending portion of "The Eyes of Truth" in the file "The Matrix". The guitar screams through a solo in "I Love You...I'll Kill You" giving the song one of the more heavier edges on the album. "Silent Warrior" uses chants throughout in the background. In the middle of the song, tribal drums come forward providing support to the lyrics.  Enigma's songs are almost like stories. The song may grow and change as it progresses and many have several different movements to them. There is a beautiful blend of the different types of instruments in perfect proportions making the sum more than its parts. This is one band where you'll want to collect all their albums, and "The Cross of Changes" is a must have to any collection.
