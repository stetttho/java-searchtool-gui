 This prolific rock band from the Great White North was never really recognized in the States for anything more than the hit "Lunatic Fringe". A great song, to say the least, but Red Rider was so much more than this one song. This compilation covers the first five years of the 80s from four albums. The creative pen work of Tom Cochrane gave the band its material as Ken Greer gave it weight with his slide guitar sound. These two would remain the mainstay of the band throughout their career together.  These songs are great anthems of the 80s, and there are few that appear here that are not worthwhile, but most may be unknown to the American population. If nothing else, Cochrane's poetic ability is the lifeblood of these songs. "Napoleon Sheds His Skin" is a perfect example where his words paint a picture of a story just as colorful as the music. The quiet "Avenue A" rings with solo arpeggio guitar and Cochrane's soulful voice introducing the song before the rest of the band comes in. Again, a song that is a story. Other great cuts are "White Hot", "Cowboys in Hong Kong" and "Power".  Any fan of 80s mainstream music will like Red Rider. It was unfortunate that they could not break through the boarders and receive some more airplay in America, but they did leave their mark upon the music world. A great band well worth the listen.
