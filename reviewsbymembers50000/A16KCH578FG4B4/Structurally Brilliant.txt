 Steve Morse takes us on a forty-minute tour of tone with Structural Damage. This purely instrumental album is a lesson in great guitar work. Morse plays with fast runs that flow, rhythmically pleasing lines, and just good sound. Drummer Van Romaine and bassist Dave LaRue round out the band's sound.  There isn't a dud on this album. From the first track to the last, it's all amazing guitar work. My favorites are the astral sounding "Good To Go", the acoustic "Foreign Exchange" and the blue-grassy "Smokey Mtn. Drive". Morse does a good job of mixing up the sounds throughout the album. The songs change pace throughout as the faster, upbeat tempo songs are interspersed with slower ones.  If you like the instrumental work of Eric Johnson, Joe Satriani and Gregg Wright, do yourself a favor and check this album out. If you're already a Steve Morse fan, I'm sure this one is already in your collection.
