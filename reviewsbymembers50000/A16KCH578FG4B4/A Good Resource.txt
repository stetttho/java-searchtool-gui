 As I'm just entering the sport of radio-controlled helicopters, Nick Papillon's book has been a very nice resource to have. He begins with choosing a helicopter and goes right through introductions to aerobatics, and covers a large amount in between.  Although being English, Papillon has a few different names for things than we are used to in the States. Besides these occasional words, he is very easy to read, and he does a good job of explaining complex topics. I found his chapters on setting up the helicopter to be very useful, and his explanation of setting the gyro correctly were better than the instructions that I received with the component. He is thorough in his explanations, and covers enough material that you could go from kit to flying all on his book alone. And, should you crash your heli, he even tells you what to look for in diagnosing damage, and how to fix it.  After each flight, I consult Papillon to see what I can do to correct slight problems in flying. I was hovering by my third tank of gas, and I think Papillon is a large reason for it.
