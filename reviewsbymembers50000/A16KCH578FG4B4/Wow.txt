 I think the only word to describe this album is, �Wow!�. This man is simply amazing.... It�s been hit and miss, but this one was definitely a keeper.  Anthony Gomes is quite the funk/jump-blues player. His guitar rhythms will keep you bouncing around as you listen to him, and his solos will blow you away. A little more flashy (almost every song has a really big finish) than I normally like, but his playing is tasteful all the way. From his opening groove on the title track he�ll hook you, and then spend the rest of the album playing with you before he reels you in. Gomes doesn�t let the music build to excitement; he just starts it off that way. The intro solo to �Gonna Have a Party� will hook you with the first measure. You�ll be energized after the first two songs on this album, and Gomes just keeps going. Don�t think that everything is fast paced here. He slows it down for his tribute to fallen blues musicians with a slow acoustical �Hard Year for the Blues�, and �Monday Kinda Tuesday�. As a musician, Gomes excels. He knows his guitar inside and out, and plays some very catchy rhythms. His soloing is tasteful yet simple. He doesn�t try to overload you with notes; instead, he only plays the right ones working to make his sound full and rich. His voice is very fitting to the type of music he plays. His song writing is incredible as well. Listen to the lyrics on �Love�s Got the Power� and the images he conjures in �Bad Luck Child�.  If you like the new generation of blues, then you owe it to yourself to find a copy of this great album. It�ll be one of your favorites too.
