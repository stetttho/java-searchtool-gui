 I must admit that I purchased this album because of the red PRS guitar on the cover. I lucked out as old Bugs isn't too bad of an axe player. His voice and sound is a tad countryish, and he's a far better player than a singer. I find his vocals a little on the weak side, and emotionless, but his playing can be very powerful at times.  My favorite tunes on the album are the instrumentals. Any guitar-head flips for the Ventures or someone who can cover them well. Bugs does just that with a great representation of five classic Ventures rolled into the "Ventures Medley". The title track is a flashy instrumental with a good groove and some fast hammers on the guitar neck. His fifteen-year-old son takes a turn behind the skins. Probably should keep an eye out for the younger Henderson. Bugs pays tributes to his hero's again by covering the great Duane Eddy's "Rebel Rouser", and does a great job of it as well. "Rawhide" rounds out the great instrumentals on this album.  There are some great licks and solos on this album. If you like your guitar-work a little bit country, a little bit blues, and a little rock and roll, then this is worth checking out.
