 Robben Ford is probably one of the best guitarists to ever grace CD plastic. Unfortunately, under recognized as well. His guitar work sounds effortless and right, like he knows the exact notes that need to be played. Notes just seem to flow together when he picks those strings. Very few guitarist have that ability, SRV was the best, but Ford is definitely up there. "Talk to Your Daughter" is one of the guitar classic that everyone who loves guitar must own. It's also one of Ford's crowning achievements.  It's hard to pick a place to begin in discussing this album, it's all so very good. The instrumental "Revelation" is a perfect example of what I was explaining. Sweet notes, good tone, and a sound that is easy on the ear. Ford's cover of Albert King's classic "Born Under a Bad Sign" is simply incredible. He also does great covers of "Ain't Got Nothing But the Blues" from Duke Ellington and "Help the Poor".  For as good as Ford's guitar playing is on this album, his voice isn't. The music on this album cries for a nice deep and gravely voice, and Ford's is thin and in stark counterpoint. In fact, on "Can't Let Her Go" he almost sounds like Kenny Loggins. Fortunately, his voice is decent on "Born Under a Bad Sign" and several other cuts. The incredible guitar work easily makes up for where he lacks in voice. This is a great album to start with if you've never heard Ford before.
