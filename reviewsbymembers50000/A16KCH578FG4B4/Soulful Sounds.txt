 Smooth Jazz trumpeter, Rick Braun, scores another hit with the release of "Body and Soul." Braun's phrasing comes across naturally as if there is no effort to his playing the horn. It is easy to forget that it is a trumpet at center stage; it just leads the music so well. As with other Braun albums, he gets his friends to fill in behind him, excellent musicians each of them. Guitarist Mark Antoine, Jeff Golub and saxophonist Boney James appear on this album.  Braun's muted sound is one of my favorites, and he stuffs the bell with one for "Missing In Venice." The mute gives the song a laid-back feel almost as if he were strolling the streets of Venice without a place to be. "Coolsville" gets funky beginning with a walking bassline from Cliff Hugo. Add in staccato chords from a piano and a jazzy guitar from Vinnie D'Onofrio to round out this excellent track. Jeff Golub gets a chance to stand out with "Long Tall Judy" bringing his jazzy guitar into play with some great opening licks. He sets up Braun with some cool comping sneaking in quick and tasteful licks between Braun's phrases plus a solo. Both musicians play off each other very well. Braun even adds his voice to "Love Will Find a Way" as well as his muted trumpet. His voice fits his genre and this song perfectly. Starting off softly, this song picks up becoming quite powerful. This is an excellent release from the smooth jazz trumpet master. The tracks cross over several different sounds from quiet and romantic, to a tad funky. Overall, another great performance, a must have for fans of the fraternity of Braun and his friends.
