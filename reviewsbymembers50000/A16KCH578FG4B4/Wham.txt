 Fourteen years before the release of "In Session" (but, it was two years after the "In Session" recording took place), SRV sat in with another one of his heroes, Lonnie Mack. Stevie co-produced Mack's come back album as well as providing guitar work for half the tracks. If you're thinking this is an SRV album under a different name don't get too excited. Stevie had great respect for his heroes and he would never step on their toes. This is definitely Mack's album and when SRV's not playing, Mack's younger brother, Bill McIntosh, steps up to the plate (a fine guitarist in his own right).  Mack is most noted for his ability to play melody and rhythm simultaneously. His powerful country-blues sound has a good feel to it, and he is flawless at giving us good-old music. "Double Whammy" is a remake of "Wham!" with Stevie on the second guitar (this was SRV's first record that he owned as a kid and he played it so much his father broke it - it's understandable why he played so much). Mack duets vocally with SRV on "If You Have to Know". All of the songs on this album are keepers.   Overall, this is a great album. You can hear from these tracks how Mack has been such a commodity to guitar music and the blues. The Allman Brothers, Bugs Henderson, The Vaughan brothers, Eric Clapton and countless others have been influenced by this man. If you like the blues, especially Southern blues, then you owe it to yourself to check out Lonnie Mack.
