 Brian Setzer just might be stuck in the past, but there is nothing wrong with that at all. His "Ignition" album doesn't deviate from the rockabilly sounds of the late `50s and `60s, except this time he's dropped the orchestra and gone back to the three-piece Stray Cats sound. His tried and true sound is a hit on this album.  The album starts off with the upbeat and fiery guitar work on the title track, "Ignition". He slows things down on the next track, "5 Years, 4 Months, 3 Days", more of a country-isk sounding tune. He shows off his guitar ability by playing a solo that ranges down the bass neck of his double-neck Danelectro. Setzer scores a hat trick in the middle of the album with my favorite songs "'59", "Rooster Rock" and "Santa Rosa Rita". "'59" is Setzer's confession that he's just a little "behind the times". This ballad showcases his singing ability. The very upbeat "Rooster Rock" was penned and sung by the bassist, Mark Winchester, that will make your foot start taping. Setzer uses time changes with great effect in "Santa Rosa Rita" by beginning the song with slow Spanish-like guitar and ballad-like singing just to rev it up into high gear for a rockin' chorus. Setzer proves that he's not lacking in guitar skills by closing the album with a rocked up version of "Malaguena".  As Setzer proved with his orchestra, he is not afraid to surround himself with excellent musicians. "Ignition" is no different. His two backers are highly talented. Just listen to Winchester on the double-bass and imagine his fingers a blur over the strings. Bernie Dresel on drums can lay down one of the best locomotive rhythms around. I doubt you will find a tighter trio. If you're a Setzer fan, don't shy away from this one because the orchestra is not there. You won't know what you're missing.
