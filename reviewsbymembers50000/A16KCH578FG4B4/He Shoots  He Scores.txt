 Brett Hull is one of the fiercest scorers in the NHL today, so it is appropriate that he's brother puts out an instructional tape on shooting and scoring using Brett for examples. Bobby Hull, Jr. actually does pretty well in front of the camera in his explanations of the shooting techniques so this video doesn't come across as cheesy.  This video deals in teaching the wrist-shot, backhand, snap-shot and slap shot, and how each shot basically builds on the one before it. Bobby does well explaining the position of the body and puck for each shot. He stresses the importance of the drive off the back leg and the follow through of the stick towards the target. One of the hints that Bobby gives is not to look to see where the goalie is, but where he isn't. In essence, shoot for the empty part of the net instead of trying to shoot around the goalie. Finally, the Hulls' end with on-ice drills to improve your shooting technique. The reason that I purchased the video was to learn how to transfer my weight through the stick to give more power to my shot. Bobby goes over this very briefly during the slap-shot segment and only shows this as a still shot of Brett's stick bending in a large arc. Unfortunately, this wasn't helpful to me, and I could have used a little more explanation to get this very important technique correct.  The only way to get better at shooting is to shoot as much as you can. This tape will help make sure that you have the right form and are performing all the components of a shot the correct way. The Hulls' close by stating that you should be taking 200 shots a week to improve. With limited ice time for adult recreational leagues, 200 is a tough number unless you're shooting off the ice.
