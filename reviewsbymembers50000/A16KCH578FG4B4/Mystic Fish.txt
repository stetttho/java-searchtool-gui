 No one can tell a story in music like Roger Waters. To him the lyrics are everything, and the music is there to support those lyrics. This can be heard throughout the "The Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking" as Waters' voice take precedence over everything else. This album was originally brought before Pink Floyd with another project to vote upon which to do. They picked "The Wall" instead, which was probably a smart choice. Although not quite Floyd quality, the album is actually surprising good, although it was outranked by David Gilmour's "About Face", which probably added to the strain on their relationship. I won't even pretend to understand the story Waters' is trying to tell on this album, but I assume it follows some Hunter S. Thompson vision of wacked-out reality through dreams. What I do understand is that Waters' pulled out the stops to make this album successful by hiring Eric Clapton to handle the guitar work, and David Sanborn for sax. It is without doubt that Clapton carried this album further into mainstream acceptance than merit alone. Likewise, when Waters' allows Clapton free rein, the songs are good. "Running Shoes" rocks heavily, and "For the First Time Today, Part 2" (the first one) Clapton plays with a bluesy feel, which carries into "Sexual Revolution". The title track is the highlight of the album.  Although this album pales compared to Waters' "Radio K.A.O.S." it is still better than his other studio albums. Clapton has some great licks throughout the album, and Waters' has some great lyrics in here as well. Waters' ability to compose music around his story is amazing, and none can match his talent. I may not understand the story, and the music alone may not be overly noteworthy, but when combined it is a formula that works. A must have for Floyd fans.
