 Larry Carlton is on the short list of my favorite guitarists. It wasn't surprising that I purchased "Fingerprints" shortly after it was first released, and have enjoyed it immensely over the years. Carlton's phrasing is simple, yet powerful as he knows exactly what to play. Since recovering from a bullet in the neck, Carlton's playing has become amazing. "Fingerprints" is no different. Carlton takes us through a jazz-laden exploration of the guitar.   The smooth "Slave Song" is beautifully done. His soloing is crisp, yet not overloaded with too many notes. He steps back to let Kirk Whalum share in the soloing. For "The Storyteller" Carlton is able to take a theme and change it a little each time to make it interesting. His guitar stands out with slow, meaningful lines taking the solo to astral heights picking up the picking before falling back and letting Whalum have a go at it. Carlton and Whalum work well together, their sounds very complementary. Michael McDonald lends his voice for "'Til I Hurt You" while Carlton makes his guitar cry in the background. "Gracias" pairs Carlton with Vince Gill for a Latin-flavored jazz piece. Both guitarist play off each other well, and is a fun song with lots of octave slides - a little Wes Montgomery flare. Carlton's sound and style come together on "Crying Hands," the perfect song to end the album on.   Carlton has come a long way over the years, playing a variety of genres. Although he is rooted in smooth jazz now, his playing is at the top of his game. If you like smooth jazz, this is definitely one to add to your collection, and if you're a guitar player, this is something worth listening to.
