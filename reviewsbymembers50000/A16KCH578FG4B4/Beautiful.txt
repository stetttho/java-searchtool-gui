 Enya has one of the most beautiful voices of this day. Her voice is fitting for the style of music she sings. Clear as a bell, her voice is airy and light, as she sings in English, Latin, or Gaelic. There is a lot of power in her voice. The music she chooses supports her voice appropriately, and adds to her sound. She has the ability to conjure up images with each note she sings. Like all of her previous albums, this one is again excellent. There are a many great songs on this album. "China Roses" has that airy sound that Enya is well known for. She sings the backing vocal as an arpeggio of three long notes of just her voice. Over it, she sings the lyrics of the song in her crisp tone, almost like a crystal bell ringing. The Latin sounding "Pax Deorum" has a medieval sound to it. Again, she utilizes her voice singing in the background, to add counterpoint to the lyrics.  "Anywhere Is" sounds like the perfect single for the album. Much more upbeat than the other songs, it has a very staccato feel making it a very energetic song. On the opposite end of the spectrum is "Hope Has a Place". Here her voice has a very haunting quality to it, made even more so with the organ playing behind her. It is a very beautiful song.  I'm amazed at how Enya can keep making new albums that sound similar to her previous ones, yet be totally new for the listener as well. Her voice is aging well, and she seems to improve with each passing album. I hope to hear much more from her in the future, as there is always room in my collection for her beautiful voice.
