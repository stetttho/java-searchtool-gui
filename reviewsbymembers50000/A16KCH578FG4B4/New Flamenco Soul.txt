 This is not traditional flamenco, but rather a mixture of flamenco, Latin and jazz wrapped together to make for seventy-minutes of pure listening joy. The flamenco style is definitely the overlying theme of the album filled with tremolos, rasgueos, glopes and lightning-fast runs. Everyone that appears on this album is a master of the guitar, from those you'd expect like Paco de Lucia and Al Di Meola to those who will surprise you, namely Slash. Fourteen tracks and sixteen amazing pickers provide a varied flavor for this album.  Jesse Cook starts the album with "Rattle and Burn" and sets the tone with this rumba-sounding piece. His melody comes off effortless with elegant ease. A very nice sounding piece. There is something special about two or more guitars playing at the same time, which makes "Heat of the Sun" from Strunz and Farah a joy to listen to. Each guitarist has their own voice and they counterbalance each other well. Plus, the speed of these guys is unbelievable. A more classic sounding piece comes from Oscar Lopez from his piece "Fire and Fury". Lopez is a master of the guitar and music as can be seen from the way he changes speeds throughout this piece with fingers a blur. Ruben Romero turns in the star performance of this album with his rendition of "Malaguena". His slow intro gives way to increasing speed, and his techniques will leave your jaw dropped.  Compilations like "Gypsy Soul" are great in exposing you to many artists at one time each with their own sound and nuances. This allows you to follow up with the artists that you enjoy the most. There isn't a dud on this album, and the talent and sound will leave you begging for more.
