 I bought this album being a big Floyd fan ten years ago, and I spin it occasionally but not often. "When the Wind Blows" is a solid album, but not amazing by any stretch of the means. David Bowie's title track is decent and sung in his signature voice. The drum sound is pretty cool, almost tinny. I agree with everyone here that the Hugh Cornwell song is...well, corny. "The Brazilian" is a pretty cool instrumental found on Genesis' "Invisible Touch" album. The drum fills are pretty cool, and when the song comes together it's a powerful orchestration. Squeeze's contribution is okay, and Paul Hardcastle's funky smooth jazz instrumental sounds out of place on this album.  Now, for Roger Waters' contribution to this album. Still having not lived down nuclear holocaust scares from "Final Cut" and "Radio K.A.O.S." he continues here waiting for the button to be pushed. This makes him a great match for this project. Waters' provides half of the material for this soundtrack, but most of it is filler and samples. Nothing to really complement the man on. Again, I agree with everyone here that his best two tracks are "Russian Missile" and "Folded Flags." These cuts sound as if they belong on "Radio K.A.O.S.", but didn't make the final cut.  This is a hard album to find, and probably isn't worth finding unless you're a big Waters fan. His sound is still very Floydish, but for the amount of Waters on this album it may just be better to skip the effort of finding this disc. I mean, there is a reason they aren't pressing it anymore, and that it was never released in the US on anything but vinyl.
