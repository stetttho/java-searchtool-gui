 William Topley could probably sing the alphabet and people would buy his albums. When it comes to voices, his is powerful and soulful, almost hypnotic. He conveys a lot of emotion through his deep baritone. Add in the great music that backs his voice and strong lyrics, and you have another good album from Topley and crew.  "Spanish Wells" has such a good feel to it, you'll get caught up in the images that Topley paints. "Ten Ten" begins this journey with a good beat and Topley's unique voice. Throw in the Jamaican dialect to create a mosaic of sound and images. Then, he's right there to bring tears to your eyes with his ballad "Nothing Else Matters" with his stunning voice over an acoustic solo-arpeggio guitar. His voice is mournful throughout the whole song, even when the drums and slide-guitar step in. "Kingston Morning" makes you feel that you're watching the sun rise in that Caribbean town. Add "I Am the Man" with it's Reggae back-beat, and the vision is complete. "Cowpoke" closes the album with an almost Native-American sounding tune that focuses mostly on his vocal range. The drums and flute give it a bit of a haunting sound, providing the perfect backdrop for his crooning.  I'm impressed with this offering from Topley. There are very few lyricists who can top his sound, and his albums are just fun to listen to. If you have heard Topley before, this is another one to pick up. If you don't know who he is, pick this one up, and be ready for a vocal experience.
