 Last Look was my first look at Latin smooth jazz guitarist Torcuato Mariano. Mariano is a great guitarist, songwriter and composer that is well documented on this album. His melodies are catchy, upbeat, and you'll be humming them even after the cd stops playing.  His music is colored with Brazilian and Bossa Nova rhythms. "A Very Special Place" mixes his guitar talent with that of pianist Glauton Campello who performs a brilliant solo. Occasionally, Mariano picks up an electric guitar to add a new flavor to his music, like in his soulful "Secrets" and his funky "Rio Stomp". "In the Rhythm of My Heart" brings a sax into the fold of his art. There's not a track on this album that has failed to capture my attention.  If you like the sounds of smooth jazz guitar with a Latin flavor, this is a great place to start. Mariano has done an excellent job with this album, and is one of my favorite smooth jazz albums that I own. I highly recommend him and Last Look.
