 This box set is a must have for anyone who enjoys summer music. Nothing says summer quite like Jimmy Buffett, and this one set will keep you in parrot heaven from Spring to Fall. This four-disc set is full, a bit on every square inch of plastic, of Buffett's great, unique music. Just about every hit that hears the radio waves to some lesser-known tunes appear here. Close to 80 in all. Famous ones like "Come Monday," "Volcano," "Changes In Latitudes, Changes In Attitudes," and even "Let's Get Drunk," are interspersed with many more songs that will become your favorites. It is nearly impossible to categorize Buffett, as he fits no genre, and I have yet to meet a person who does not like him. I would be wary of someone who didn't like his music. If there is but one box set to buy, this would be it. Worth every penny, and then some. A must have for any Parrot-Head or breathing person.
