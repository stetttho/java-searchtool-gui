 Edwin McCain stepped up the acoustic rock formula for his "Misguided Roses" album, provide a soul-filled album that stands out. His songs are more than just lyrics, but are more stories set to music. The band provides a great vehicle to carry the songs. With Larry Chaney playing lead, Dave Harrison on drums, Craig Shields picking up everything else from horns to keyboards, and Scott Bannevich on the bottom provide the upbeat music on this release.  The album begins in a great groove with "See the Sky Again" with a great opening riff from Chaney shortly followed by McCain's gruff voice. Chaney and McCain play off of each other well with vocals and guitar, and acoustic and electric guitars, building to a powerful end. Another great tune is "Cleveland Park" a much more laid back song relying on arpeggio chords from the acoustic guitar double with a strummed rhythm. "I'll Be" is the ballad of the album, and McCain croons well. "How Strange It Seems" has a good baseline from Bannevich, and a bluesy feel from Chaney. The same formula works again on "Darwin's Children", but I like McCain's voice better here, plus there's a good sax work from Shields here as well. Add in the cover of James Taylor's "(I've Got to) Stop Thinkin' `Bout That" and you have a pretty good album here.  McCain and crew have a lot of talent, and lay down some great music. I think McCain is one of the better bands in this genre of music, and they are fun to listen to. Definitely worth the price of the disk, and worth a listen.
