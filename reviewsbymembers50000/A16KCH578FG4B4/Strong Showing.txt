 Doyle Bramhall is most notably recognized as the author of many of Stevie Ray Vaughan's songs, but as a blues singer and drummer, he proves he can stand on his own with the release of "Bird Nest On the Ground." Roughly more than half of the album is covers and the rest are from his own pen. Bramhall's voice is a classic blues voice, deep and throaty, and fitting to the tunes he sings. He surrounds himself with excellent musicians and the blues spill forth. The tracks from the album were recorded from the early `80s through the early `90s.   For Stevie fans, this album contains the track "Too Sorry" with the axe-master on guitar along with Double Trouble. The cut was recorded in the early `80s before "Texas Flood" album, and makes this release worth having. But even without Stevie, the album is solid. "She's Gone" is a Hound Dog Taylor cover with Bramhall's son of the same name sharing guitar duties with Robin Syler. Traditional blues all the way with buzzing guitars and whisky and cigarette voice. Double-stops abound in the solo. Bramhall's own "Change It" appears here with Robin Syler on guitar. Although the same song Stevie made famous, it has a very different sound under Bramhall's lead. The cover of Johnny Nash's "I Can See Clearly Now" is excellent, and Bramhall's voice is powerful. "(Marie's the Name) His Latest Flame" is another great cover. Some of the best work appears in the instrumental "Take Your Time, Son" with father and son jamming with a little help from long-time friend Jimmie Vaughan. The guitar work is excellent from both axe-men, and each has a unique sound allowing you to tell who is playing. Jimmie appears on the title track as well.  Any fan of the Texas Blues will enjoy this album. There probably isn't a better voice from Texas that Bramhall, and he can get low and dirty, and the guitar work is pretty spectacular in places. And, if you're a fan of Stevie and his older brother, it is pretty much a must have.
