 There are very few jazz guitarists that have crossed over into mainstream popularity. Pat Metheny is one of them. There are many great guitarists in the jazz world, as the jazz world breeds them pretty regularly, but most live their careers only being noticed by that jazz world. For a jazz player to break through into the mainstream side, and still hold on to his roots, is a feat indeed. Listening to "Secret Story" it is easy to see how this guitarist has been able to open the mainstream world to jazz.  Metheny guitar skill is astounding. Using a synthesizer for his guitar, he brings many sounds into play using his beautiful phasing, and unique hybrid chords. Metheny doesn't like to play straight up jazz voicings. Instead, he combines chords, or plays rare voicings and open chords to give him his unique sound. His solo work is well spaced and at points are utterly jaw dropping. For most of the time, Metheny is a very much in player, but on occasion he is known to go outside. The times he does, it can be a little tough for the listener if you are not prepared for it. All of the songs on this album are great. Metheny composes these songs like a great artist, painting with many colors, sounds and ideas.  Metheny is a crossing point into the jazz world. If you really get into him, you may find yourself exploring the jazz, and opening up your tastes to some very incredible musicians. Metheny has been a hero and an inspiration to me. He has helped to open up my ears to many new artists that I would never have discovered on my own.
