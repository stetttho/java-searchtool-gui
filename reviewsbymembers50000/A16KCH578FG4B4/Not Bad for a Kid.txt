 Kid Jonny Lang makes it big time with the release of "Lie to Me". Along with Kenny Wayne Shepherd and Shannon Curfman, Lang makes up the next next generation of blues players. Lang is surprisingly talented considering his age at the time of this album's release. He plays the lead guitar and vocals throughout the album. His playing is exceptional, although his voice sounds a little thin and young. Give him a few more years dealing with record labels, and his voice will fill with the pain that is the blues (after all, Eric Clapton was well more than twice Lang's age before his voice sounded good).  There are some great gems on this album. "Good Morning Little School Girl" is an excellent cover of Sonny Boy Williams' tune. The guitar solo is well played, and the song carries well. The title track definitely rocks. One of the best tunes is "Still Wonder", a well-written slow blues, with some good guitar work in the background. Lang explodes with passion when he reaches the solo, and reigns it in to provide a call and response with his lyrics for the rest of the song. Some of his best guitar work is on "A Quitter Never Wins" and "Matchbox".  If Lang can keep it going, as he matures he'll be an incredible player. Eventually, he'll grow into his voice, adding power to it. His chops are already good, but I can see them improving a whole lot more. As long as the recording industry doesn't destroy him, in ten years Lang will be a force to reckon with.
