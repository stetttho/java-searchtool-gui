 There's something about acoustic blues, the idea of playing on a street corner deep in the Delta, running a bottle over a National Steel. Keb' Mo' is one of the best acoustic blues players today. Sometimes it's just him and his guitar, other times he's backed by drums and keyboards. Moore's playing is full and you rarely notice that there is no one else playing but him. His solo guitar work brings visions of Robert Johnson, and he pays tribute to the Master with two of his cuts. The rest of the tracks are penned by Moore with some collaboration from others.  Every tune on this album is good. Moore's playing adjusts between strumming, fingerpicking and slide. He also adds in banjo and harmonica, but his great asset is his voice. Smooth and sweat, it lacks the gravel sound we've become accustomed to for the blues, but his voice is perfect for solo guitar, almost as if it matches the sound of the guitar. "Victims of Comfort" is my favorite off the album with his strumming and voice interaction. The song is just him and his guitar, almost slow and sad sounding. "Angelina" throws in drums to keep the beat and Moore's fingers pluck the strings with an upbeat tempo. "Come On In My Kitchen" is the first of the Johnson covers, and he plays with a slide, and belts out some on the harmonica, with a little help from an organ and drums. Another great cut. More of the straight blues shuffle is heard on "Love Blues" again a solo guitar bit.  Each track is good on this album, and proves that Keb' Mo' is a name to be recognized with his unique sound of yesterday. Anyone who likes the original blues players like Johnson, will love this album, as will many people who don't love the blues. Moore's voice is soothing, and his playing has a relaxed feel to it. A pure joy to listen to.
