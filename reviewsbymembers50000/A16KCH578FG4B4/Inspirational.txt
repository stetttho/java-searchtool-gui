 Jimi Hendrix is reported to say that Phil Keaggy was the best guitarist around. Listen to this solo-acoustical album and you just might have to agree. Purely instrumental, this is every finger-picker's dream. If this is your type of music, than this is one album that is definitely worth tracking down.  Keaggy has been blessed with lightning fast arpeggios, a command of alternate tunings, and right hand slap/harmonic technique that all adds flavor to his music. "County Down" is a playground for him to use his repertoire of skills. The song is brilliant in it's own right. "Fair Thee Well" is built around a theme comprised of both right and left and tapping, add in some fast runs, and you have another great tune. There isn't a bad cut on this album. Another neat item about this album is that Keaggy provides the alternate tunings that he uses for each song in the liner notes. For you finger-pickers who would like to emulate him, you at least have a place to begin. If you like guitar, especially solo-acoustic, then this is a must have. The majority of the album is soft and quiet, but it will have you listening intently.
