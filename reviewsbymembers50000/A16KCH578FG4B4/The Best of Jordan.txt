 Stanley Jordan is one of the most unique guitarist out there. His two-handed tap technique is the secret behind his playing. This allows him to play rhythm and melody at the same time, something that requires two guitarists in most bands. He plays this difficult technique with a soothing ease.  Eleven jazz flavored tracks fill this album, a sampling of his other albums, and you won't skip over a single one of them. Only four of the songs are penned by Jordan himself, but that does not mean they're not his. He turns each song into something of his own when he plays them. His covers of "Stairway to Heaven" and "Eleanor Rigby" are full of new life as he gives them a new flare full of jazz riffs and his elegant sound. He also tackles John Coltrane's "Impressions" adding his own improvisational feeling to a classic. With the wonderful rendition of "The Lady In My Life", a hectic version of Rodgers and Hammerstein's "My Favorite Things" and "Georgia On My Mind" you can't go wrong with this album. Even Jordan's "Flying Home" and "Still Got the Blues" are masterpieces in their own right.  If you don't own any of Jordan's albums, this is a great place to start. It provides a sampling from "Magic Touch", "Cornucopia", "Standards", "Flying Home" as well as two others. This is a great introduction to Jordan. My only complaint is the lack of previously unreleased tracks that are becoming standard on greatest hits albums. If you love guitar and jazz, then this is a definite buy for you. You won't be disappointed.
