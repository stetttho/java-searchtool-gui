 This Broadway musical is a tribute to Louis Jordan and the music he created. �Five Guys Named Moe� follows the blue soul of Nomax, a [person] who was just dumped by his girl. Help to get his life on the right track, and his girl back, comes in the form of five guys who appear out of his radio. No-Moe, Eat-Moe, Big-Moe, Little-Moe and Four-Eyed-Moe are the �soulful serfs of song� who take Nomax under their wing.  All six of these performers are great singers with incredible talent, and are backed by wonderful sixtet led by Reggie (Reginald Royal) on piano. Although there are some serious songs on this album like, �What�s the Use of Getting Sober (When You�re Gonna Get Drunk Again�, �Azure-Te (Blues In Paris)�, and �Don�t Let the Sun Catch You Crying� this show is mostly fun songs performed with high-energy. The cast interacts with the audience throughout the show calling upon them to sing along, pulling audience members out, and even forming a conga line through the house. This is an hour of good music, catchy lyrics and a plan old good time. The only thing that detracts from this recording is the fact there is no visual aspect of what is happening during the show. You can hear the gags, but cannot see them. During �Ain�t Nobody Here But Us Chickens� you miss one of the characters wearing a giant chicken suit while dancing on a table, and you miss a great tap routine during �Reet, Petite and Gone�. Although the dancing and sight gags go unseen, this is still a great album that will chase the blues away.
