 "The Rainy Season" is Marc Cohn's sophomore effort, and you would never know it by listening to it. This album picks up where his self-titled album leaves off. Cohn's lyrics go together like puzzle pieces: perfectly. His music is full, but it still allows you to focus on his words. His songs are bluesy, and there is so much emotion in his voice. There is no disappointment here.  The album opens with the catchy "Walk Through the World", like "Walking In Memphis" on the first album, and sets the tone for what's to come. The song is upbeat, driven by the notes of his piano, and the words just flow. The title track uses the same formula, a strong voice, great lyrics and well-placed notes. "From the Station" is a beautiful song about a woman's love and his own lost feelings. Most of his songs are high in emotion, like the poetic "She's Becoming Gold" and "Rest for the Weary".  Cohn's music is very meaningful. He succeeds at being a musician, a songwriter and poet. The lyrics read well without the music, and doing so you can really see what Cohn is singing about. Some of the songs are actually quite heavy, none very light, but every one of them is a rare gem. Cohn has a great talent, and this album shouldn't be missed.
