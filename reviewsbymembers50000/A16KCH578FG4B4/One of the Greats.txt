 Country music owes a lot to songwriting genius of Eddie Rabbitt. His syncopated rhythms, catchy lyrics and toe-tapping songs helped Country move in a new direction in the 70s. He even wrote songs for Elvis. It's a shame to have lost such a great writer and singer.  If you're looking for a disc where every song on the album is a keeper, this is sure one of them. There is a good mix of country ballads, and rocking tunes to be found here. The album opens with the classic "I Love a Rainy Night" will have you waking to a sunny day. The upbeat "Drivin' My Life Away" will have you longing for the road, and if your foot is not moving to "Rocky Mountain Music" you're probably dead anyway. Rabbitt's ability to write slow songs is shown in the samples here. "Pour Me Another Tequila", "Hearts On Fire", and "Suspicions" will pull at your emotions.  The title of this album is a bit misleading as not of his "All Time" greatest hits appear here, but what is here is definitely a sampling of his many greatest hits. As Billy Joel and a great many other musicians with a long career have proven to us, there is nothing wrong with releasing multiple volumes of greatest hits. Hopefully, the future will bring a box-set in memory of such a great man.
