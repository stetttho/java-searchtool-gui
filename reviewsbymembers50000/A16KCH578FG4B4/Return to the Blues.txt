 Eric Clapton returns to his roots on this album, dropping the seven-minute solos for a more traditional blues standards. Instead, he covers sixteen great blues tunes from the likes of Willie Dixon, Elmore James, Eddie Boyd, Sonny Thompson, and Freddy King. Clapton's voice is ragged and bluesy, something he could not have done early in his career. His guitar playing in dripping with stereotypical blues phrasing and turnarounds. There's nothing but the blues here.  Every song on this album is a great song, and each has appeared on many different albums throughout the years. These are classic blues tunes that should be in any guitar blues enthusiast's collection. Clapton starts the album off with the great Leroy Carr's "Blues Before Sunrise". Slide guitar blues ensue, and Clapton's newly discovered gravely voice is fitting. "Third Degree" is beautifully done slow blues full of pain, and one of the best songs of the album. Other greats are "Reconsider Baby", "Five Long Years", and "It Hurts Me Too".  This is like the greatest hits of blues as performed by Clapton. He shows class and respect by playing these tunes the way they were written. There are no extended solos here, or a studio quality sounds. These songs were recorded live with a full blues feeling of the musicians. It's different from what mainstream Clapton fans might expect, but for those that are fans of the blues, this is a stellar hit.
