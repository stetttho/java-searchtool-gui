 I was really impressed when Alan Jackson came out with "A Lot About Livin'...". Being a fan of the more Honky Tonk sounding bands, this one was right up my alley. Jackson has a great voice, and a good backing band. Sweet and short solos, well-written lyrics, and just plain good ole Country makes up this album.  The album opens with the upbeat song about growing up on the river. "Chattahoochee" is one of the more upbeat songs on the album, and has a little catchy riff and staccato style lyrics. "Mercury Blues" bookends the album with another upbeat song. Like the stereotype of Country, a lot of the songs on this album are about being left by a woman. Songs like "She's Got the Rhythm (and I Got the Blues)" and "(Who Says) You Can't Have It All" are true ballads of the broken heart. "Up To My Ears In Tears" is more of a comical and upbeat version of being dumped, filled with some good guitar work. The song that stands out the best of the album is "Tropical Depression". Again, it's a being dumped song, but everyone was on for this song.  Jackson is good, new Country. He's changed his style some since this album first came out, but it is good nonetheless.
