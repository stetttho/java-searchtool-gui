 I have been a big fan of Stanley Clarke since the '92 PPV broadcast of the Seville, Spain Guitar Legends concert. He only played "School Days", but it was enough to plant the seed of jazz in me. From there I discovered John McLaughlin, Al DiMeola, Stanley Jordan, Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Louis Jordan, Brian Lynch and many others. Each new player I found introduced me to a handful more jazz greats, but it was Clarke that introduced me to jazz.  Clarke brings along guitarist Larry Carlton, drummer extraordinaire Billy Cobham, Deron Johnson on keyboards, and the multitalented Najee playing anything he can get his mouth on. Then, the fun begins. The quintet knows exactly what they are doing on stage together. The music they produce is an incredible whirlwind of straight jazz, funk, and great playing.  The twenty-one minute version of "School Days" is a tour-de-force of power. Beginning with a duet between Cobham and Clarke they trade lines of percussion back and forth. As the piece moves, it evolves to include the rest of the band. Everyone takes turns soloing. "School Days" is still a playground for Clarke's funky slap bass playing, and he (as well of the rest of them) will leave you with your jaw on the floor. The group does a stunning cover of Miles Davis' "All Blues". Najee begins on the flute giving over to Johnson's piano before Carlton steps up to solo, and Clarke takes a solo of his own. They are not only players, but writers too as they cover a song written by each member group, (except Johnson).   This is, hands-down, my favorite Clarke album that I own. You can feel the soul and power that permeates the air as these five play. They play off of each other well, and they are really enjoying themselves. With friends like this, who would have an enemy?
