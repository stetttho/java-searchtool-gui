 Martika's self-titled album is a good representation of the mainstream 80's, lots of flash and sounds of good times that could only be from the 80's. Martika has that siren sound from that area, like so many others. A touch of child innocence, a touch of girls having fun, and a dash of sultriness complete the voice. Her voice is powerful, and sweet, taking some questionable songs and making them worthwhile.  This is a good album to relive the 80's through. The album's gem is "Toy Soldiers", a song that showcases Martika's voice. It's a ballad that she sings beautifully, at the chorus, she turns up the power with a female growl. Good counterpoint. She takes on Carol King's "I Feel the Earth Move" in a great cover. Her voice is powerful enough to carry it off well. "Water" is another good song, with a cool acoustic guitar solo in there.  Martika has a great voice, and this album is a good vehicle for displaying that. If you're hopelessly retro, still stuck in the 80's, or just enjoy visiting on occasion, this album does the trick.
