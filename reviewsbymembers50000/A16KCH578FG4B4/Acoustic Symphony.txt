 I first picked up this cd after seeing Billy McLaughlin live. He opened for another fingerstyle great, Adrian Legg. I was absolutely blown away by the style of his play. Most of his playing is done using the two-handed touch tap technique al la Stanley Jordan, but that's were the similarity ends. McLaughlin plays an entirely acoustic set with a bluesy, hip-hop feel. This isn't just all solo guitar though. On several tracks, McLaughlin adds drums, keyboards, some trumpet, and a touch of electric guitar to support him. It never detracts from McLaughlin's guitar as that remains firmly the main presence and force of this album.  The album opens with the title track and sets the mood of what is to occur over the next 47 minutes. It's an upbeat tune with guitar melody and rhythm playing at the same time with different hands. "Clockshop" is my favorite of the album, and it composed of a beautiful melody countered with a nice baseline all done on one guitar. The solo work doesn't stop there as can be heard on the passionate slow playing on "Hold On to Forever". McLaughlin doesn't lose anything by having musician's (organic or digital) backing him as on the funky "11", and the more laid back "Candleman". McLaughlin is definitely someone to see live if you can get the chance. If you can't, pick up one of his albums. This one is quite a good representation of his ability and playing style. If you like fingerstyle guitar, or just good music you'll love this.
