 Chris has come a long way from "Texas Sugar..." as can be attested in "Love Is Greater Than Me." The current trend of Austin musicians seems to be reaching more of an experimental blues sound. Like Ian Moore's "And All the Colors..." this is definitely a departure from the blues that Chris and Ian first cut their teeth on. The blues are still in there, you just have to listen a little harder for it. Although I thought that "Texas Sugar..." was a great album, it sounded like SRV mixed with Red Hot Chili Peppers in a blender. With "Love > Me" Chris has established his own sound that is colored by -not a reproduction of- SRV, Hendrix, Led Zeppelin, RHCP, and even the Santana sounding piece in "Azul Ezell", (after all, SRV's sound was colored by the King's, Hendrix, Waters and Wolf).  The greatest part of this album is that it is about something. The songs on this album are about Chris overcoming the evils in his life that had beaten him down. The songs are very inspirational and mostly upbeat. His poetry is backed by good rhythm playing from himself and his band, and his solo work is strong a catchy. There isn't a song that won't keep your foot from tapping. This is one of my favorite albums of the post-SRV generation of "blues" men.
