 There are few that have an ability to play guitar at the level that Jimmy Bruno does. He has become a force in the Jazz world playing with such grace and taste. His influences are numerous, but his sound is distinctly his own. A definite master of the guitar, he plays seven strings as easily as six, and plays six here as if it were thirty-six. "Slight of Hand" is his debut album as the front man for his trio.  The album opens with the bluesy "Egg Plant Pizza". It starts with a quiet intro solo before the band jumps in. His playing is quick and furious, but smooth. With the number of notes he plays, you never feel like he's overdoing it. Another fun tune is "Wheat Thins" where Bruno and his bassist, Pete Colangelo, double-up on the melody playing a couple of octaves apart. Again, the guitar work is amazing. The Samba sounding "Manha de Carnaval" has a great Latin-Jazz flavor to it. The rhythm is carried by the Edgardo Cintron Orchestra, and gives Bruno a lot of area to play over. His phrasing is amazing, and he moves from in to out and back in without standing your ear on end. There is a lot of fancy work in this piece that will make your jaw drop. This is probably my favorite cut from the album. The orchestra sticks around for "Tenderly", which pairs Bruno up with a piano.  Everything on this album is great. Bruno's own tunes are fun, and he makes his covers his own with his touch. With a debut album such as this, you wonder how he could have stayed in obscurity for so long. If you like more traditional sounding guitar jazz where everything isn't played through a synth, or just like good guitar work, then this is an artist for you, and what better place to start than his first. Bruno is one of my all time favorites, I hope you enjoy him too.
