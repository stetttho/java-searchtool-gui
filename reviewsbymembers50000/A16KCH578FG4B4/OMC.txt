 This is a different genre of music, at least very eclectic. If nothing else, it is a fun listen. There seems to be a little of everything here, a little hip-hop, touch of rap, blues, Latin, Country, and some poetic lyrics. This is a sleeper album and will sneak up on you when you least expect it. Nearly everyone has heard the single "How Bizarre" off of this album. Nothing else sounds like it, and if you're hoping for a whole album of the title track, stick to the single.  Most of the songs here are actually very good. "Breaking My Heart" has a country-ish sound to the solo slide guitar, but more of a hip-hop feel with the percussion, and a jazzy sounding horn blaring a killer solo. It makes for an interesting combination for the song. Most of the songs follow the same formula using different components. The opening track, "On the Run" has a good groove to it, with hybrid-rap lyrics with an acoustic guitar backing. He opens "Angel In Disguise" with violins. A very ballad-like song. "Land of Plenty" is similar with more horns. The trumpets on "Right On" have a beautiful Latin sound, then he throws in slide guitar.  It is nearly impossible to classify OMC as his songs are bits and pieces of so many different types of music. This New Zealander is worth it though, and since this album can be found rather inexpensively, it may be worth checking out. This sleeper may wake up on you too.
