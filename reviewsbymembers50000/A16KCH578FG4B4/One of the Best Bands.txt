 There is little that Los Lobos hasn't played in the years they've been around. And, with "Just Another Band from East L.A." you can experience this growth from the beginning all the way through "Kiko". This compilation contains more than forty tracks of traditional Spanish music, Tex-Mex, blues and rock.  Few bands honor their roots like Los Lobos does. The beginning of disc one has several Spanish folk songs, including the beautiful ballad, "Sabor a Mi" flavored with Latin guitar runs. The flavor turns a little more rock in the middle of disc one and holds onto it for the remainder of the album. The power of Los Lobos' songs is heard in "River of Fools", "Will the Wolf Survive?" and "On Time One Night". Covers of Ritchie Valens' "Come On Let's Go" and his arrangement of the traditional "La Bamba" helped bring Los Lobos national acclaim.  Things are great on the first disc, but things get better on the second disc. Again the second disc is a mix of rock and blues and songs sung in Spanish. With songs like "Down On the Riverbed", "Angel Dance", the incredible "Kiko and the Lavender Moon" and a live cover of Cream's "Politician" make this album a keeper. The best song on this compilation is the live cover of Marvin Gaye's "What's Going On". The guys do a great job on one of the best songs ever written.  Besides getting nearly two and a half hours of Los Lobos, and a great sampling from all their albums pre-"Colossal Head", there are also four previously unreleased tracks and nearly a dozen live cuts. An albums worth of live cuts and never before heard material makes this compilation definitely something to look into even if you already have all of Los Lobos' albums.
