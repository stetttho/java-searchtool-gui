 I thought that writing was more romantic in a writer struggling to get characters, plot and conflict interacting with each other just right, but I suppose that in this day and age there are very few things that cannot be reduced to a formula. Evan Marshall does just that in his "The Marshall Plan for Novel Writing".  Marshall breaks down a novel into two types of scenes: An Action scene and a Reaction scene. He provides charts to create each type of scene. In addition, he provides fill in the blank lists for constructing characters. He even goes so far as to tell you that certain characters must be present like the main character's confidant, and a love interest. At first, I was really disappointed in Marshall's giving formulas on how to write a story. The more I thought about it, I realized that you still have to have a creative mind to make this work. The Marshall Plan is just a way of organizing ones thoughts to create a more cohesive story.  Marshall covers a lot of topics in this one book. He begins the book by giving ideas on what to look for in creating your story, and how to create the characters that populate that story. Secondary story plots are explained and he talks about how to interweave these plots in with your main plot. He discusses using dialogue, summaries and flashbacks, and then finishes the book with getting published.  Whether you believe in using formulas or not, there is a lot of information that Marshall gives that is very helpful. I think anyone who has a good idea for a story and a creative mind can follow this book and come up with a good novel. It won't write your book for you, but it will help to make it more organized.
