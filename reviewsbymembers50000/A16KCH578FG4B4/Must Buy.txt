 I first saw Conrad Herwig when he shared the stage with, my favorite jazz player, Brian Lynch at the local Jazz Festival. I was amazed by this man's ability to play trombone. I had never really thought of the trombone as a solo instrument until I actually watched Herwig play. The songs they played with a jazz orchestra backing them had me hunting down an album by Herwig.  This ranks as one of my favorite albums of my collection. The Latin beat that permeates through all of these songs really gives the album flavor. With the upbeat songs of "Blue Train" and "Satellite" it is hard not to get excited and let your foot-tapping turn into full blown dancing. This album has a wonderful version of "Impressions", and "A Love Supreme" just pulls at your emotions. Herwig's solos are passionate and soulful. He doesn't seem to think about his music, he just feels it.  This album is chalked full of great musicians. Brian Lynch and Ray Vega on trumpet, Eddie Palmieri on piano, Gary Smulyan on sax, and thirteen other musicians round out this work of art. They all have a love for playing music, and they all sound as if they are having the time of their lives. If you love a Latin beat, jazz and John Coltrane don't hesitate to get this album.
