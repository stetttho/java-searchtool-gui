 I first found out about Adrian Legg when he opened for the first go around of the G3 tour. Satch, Johnson and Vai rocked, but the most amazing guitarist was Legg. No band. Just him and his guitar on stage. And, the sounds coming from him all by himself. I stared in disbelief as he played, and the reached over and gave several of his tuning machines a twist changing the pitch of the strings as they rang out. We've all see a guitarist do this with the low-E, but Legg seemed to play with his tuners more than fretting the guitar. It was simply amazing. The next day I went out and purchased "Waiting for a Dancer".  The album is a great representation of the live show. Besides one track, "Son of Kiss Curl", it's just Legg and his guitar. His runs are of blinding speed, yet entertaining and filling. He sounds much larger than just one guitar, and you'll be surprised that you are not missing the other instruments. The guitar mastery is present on "Bayou Bells" that starts off almost astral and then picks up speed.  If you love the sound of the guitar, then this is the perfect album for you. There is nothing else to get in the way of just the guitar, and Legg is a dazzling player. You'll be captivated by his sound, the fact that he's an electrical soloist, and his fast runs. If you get a chance to see Legg live, don't miss it. It is definitely a jaw-dropping experience.
