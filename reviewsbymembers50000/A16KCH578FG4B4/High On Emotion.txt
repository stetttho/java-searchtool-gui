 As my ten-year reunion approached last year, I began rummaging through the nostalgia of the late eighties. One of my favorite songs from that era was "Don't Pay the Ferryman". Looking it back up, I dusted off my "High On Emotion" tour tape of Chris de Burgh. This high-energy concert had me updating to cd in no time.  De Burgh was quite high on emotion the night that this album was recorded. He plays right up to the audience putting them in a frenzy giving them what they want. The music is classic eighties flare and will bring back memories. The mixing on this album is spectacular. The band sounds like they are actually playing in your living room, and the crowd can be heard between songs, but is largely absent while the band plays (overly loud crowd noise is an annoyance). The audience only can be heard singing on a couple of tracks.  This live album has a lot of the great songs of de Burghs repertoire. The highlights to this album are "The Revolution", "Last Night", "Spanish Train," "High On Emotion" and my favorite. The immensely popular "Lady In Red" appears here as well, although I never really appreciated it. If you're a fan of eighties music, or would just like a trip down memory lane (or want to see what all the fuss is about), then you would do yourself good taking a listen to this one.
