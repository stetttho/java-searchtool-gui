 From his first vocal demo, "Ooh-Wee Marie" in 1959 to the "In-Liner (Surf Beat '97)" theme from a video game in 1996, this anthology covers the long career of Dick Dale. With the aid of Leo Fender, Dick Dale would change how people listened to live music...ear bleedin' loud. You can hear how Dale's sound changes throughout the album becoming heavier, more Beast-ly. He plays with a pick destroying, lightning fast tremolo style with his guitar strung upside-down. His songs are packed with adrenaline pumping rhythm and speed of cutting a curl on a long board.  The first disc covers most of Dick Dale's surf guitar classics, such as: "Misirlou", "Shake-N-Stomp" and "Let's Go Trippin'". Don't miss "Spanish Kiss" a Spanish flavored instrumental, with a hint of flamenco, showing off his acoustic flare, (one of my favorites). The second disc attacks some of his more recent songs, including live versions of "King of the Surf Guitar" and "Jessie Pearl". Dick Dale pairs up with the late, great Stevie Ray Vaughan for a cover of "Pipeline", and also performs a tribute to Jimi Hendrix with a powerful version of "Third Stone from the Sun".  This is a great way to get the best of Dick Dale without purchasing all of his albums. His playing is loud and fast, and he has influenced many guitarists over his career (including Hendrix, and is considered to be the godfather of shred metal). The only thing that could make this album better would be seeing it live.  Dick Dale plays before an audience with such an intensity, energy, and real enjoyment for the music. Not to mention loud. His bassist/guitarist, Ron Eglit, is an amazing musician in his own right. The two play off of each other well, and have fun on stage. Not only does Dick Dale play to the audience, he plays with the audience. Throwing picks into the audience, roaming through the house, and staying after the show to write autographs for his fans. He truly is the king of the surf guitar.
