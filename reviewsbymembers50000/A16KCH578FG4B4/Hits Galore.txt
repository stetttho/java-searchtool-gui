 Lenny Kravitz is quite the musician. Not quite hard rock, not quite alternative, not quite pop, just good solid music. His sound is all over the place, from heavy riffs to almost to almost a 70s feel including reggae, blues, and house. Kravitz has a good ear for rhythm that leads to some cool grooves. He is a master at punctuating those grooves with mutes and accents and hammered chords.  There are numerous hits on this album. The rhythm guitar from "Fly Away" is simple, yet infectious. The bass line gives it a unique feel, and the slight echo on his voice makes the chorus all the more powerful. "Black Velveteen" has an industrialized rhythm, and more effects on his voice. He kicks it up a notch during the song, coming forward with the rhythm guitar with excellent punctuation making for a powerful song. The album opens with his theme song of "Are You Gonna Go My Way", with its cool opening groove. The cover of the Guess Who classic, "American Woman" appears here as well as a dozen other good cuts from Kravitz's repertoire.  This album has a lot of his best cuts, and saves the trouble of finding his most popular songs on all of his discs.
