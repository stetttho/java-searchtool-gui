 Mark Knopfler and boys know how to put together a great show. This energy-packed ninety minutes of raw music is how live shows should be done. If you are one that is looking for the songs straight off the studio albums, better look someplace else. Music is a living entity that changes each time it's played. Knopfler doesn't keep within the restraints of the original format of the song and uses his guitar as a medium to explore the possibilities in longer, more intricate pieces.  Knopfler is a great guitar player, but he is even more so when he is standing under the lights before an audience. His perfectionist attitude and desire to play to his fans allows him to rise to the occasion of superb showmanship. Don't listen to a Dire Straits studio album immediately after listening to this live album - it will sound lifeless and flat in comparison.  "Sultans of Swing" closes the first of the two discs in this set. Listen how Knopfler's end solo is used to build and relieve tension by changing his volume and intensity, even providing a space for the crowd to become involved. Check out his solo work on "Two Young Lovers" and "Tunnel of Love" and hear notes played with a feeling that no studio album has been able to capture.
