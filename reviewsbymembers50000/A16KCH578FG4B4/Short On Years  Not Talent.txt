 Jason Marsalis was only 22 years old when he recorded Music In Motion, but you would never be able to tell by listening to it. Maybe it comes from being a part of such a musically inclined family, maybe some people just have it and others don't. Whatever the reason, this is a great jazz album built around Marsalis' drum kit.  Marsalis pens all eleven songs (there's an extra "hidden" track here) on Music In Motion. To help him carry out the performance are the solid John Ellis on tenor sax, Derek Douget on alto and soprano sax, Jonathan Lefcoski on piano and Peter Harris on bass. The band is tight, and plays these compositions with great feeling. Even though Marsalis is the bandleader, he is not always in the spotlight. Rather, he steps back to perform his primary duties of keeping time for the band.  "Discipline Strikes Again" is all Marsalis though, as he beats his skins all by his lonesome for more than five minutes. It is quite the solo that is full of ideas, and does not tire. There is some great soloing from the boys on "Marakatu de Modernizar" and "There's a Thing Called Rhythm". "The Steepistician" is another great tune.  I am quite happy with the younger Marsalis' effort with his sophomore album. It is of a maturity that is much beyond his years, and his passion for his music is quite noticeable. Keep an eye on this lad, as I believe that he will make his mark on the jazz world, one way or another.
