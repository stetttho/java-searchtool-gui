 This album was recorded when Robben Ford was in his early twenties in a club in L.A. He knew what he was doing even at that young age. His guitar work is a mixture of jazz and blues that will leave you mouth gaping and drooling.  Ford starts off the album with "Oh Gee" a great piece that sets the mood for the entire album. Ford doesn't dominate the entire song, and steps back to let his piano and bass men take solos of their own. Next, he covers "Red Rooster" with a heavy blues feel. There is more to Ford than just great guitar licks. He started out playing the sax three years before he picked up the guitar. He shows us his chops on the horn on Miles Davis' "Eighty One". "Miss Miss" is another of the instrumentals on the album. A great tune. Jimmy Witherspoon jumps in to provide his bluesy voice for "Ain't Nobody's Business" and "Everyday I Have the Blues" trading vocals with Ford and getting great support from the band. .  Rhino records should be congratulated for releasing this great sample of the young Ford. If you're a fan of Ford, guitar, or the blues don't hesitate to check this one out. You won't be disappointed.
