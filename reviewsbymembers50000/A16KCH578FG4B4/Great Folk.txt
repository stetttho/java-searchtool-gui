 No matter where Cat Stevens is today, there is no doubt he was one of the great folk-singers/song-writers of the seventies. Even today, his music continues to receive airplay.  His melodious voice, great guitar, and catchy lyrics has made him quite popular through the years, even though he left the world of music behind. This greatest hits album provides twelve great tunes.   The two tracks to get the most radio-play are "Peace Train" and "Moonshadow," ("Moonshadow" is proof that truly great music does not have to make sense). But, there is more here than these two very popular songs. The album opens with "Wild World" full of perfect lyrics that will have you singing with the radio. Then, there is the upbeat, hard-driving "Can't Keep It In," and the cover of "Another Saturday Night." Also included here is the spiritual "Morning Has Broken."  There isn't a track on this album I don't like, and not a single lyric I don't know. While listening to this at work, I have to resist the temptation to break into song along with the CD. This one is catchy and foot-tapping good music. A must for any folk-music lover, or if you just like good music.
