 "Jars of Clay" is an incredible effort from the quartet with the same name. A mixture of acoustic and Christian rock with a splash of Gregorian Chant provides their sound. It is a good mix, and the songs are great. This album is a testament unto itself, as it has been able to escape the circle of Christian music and make the mainstream in a big way. There have been some good Christian bands that haven't been able to accomplish this feat.  The album starts off with one of the two songs produced by Adrian Belew, (one of the geniuses with King Crimson), "Liquid". A powerful opening it is only outdone by the other song produced by Belew, "Flood". Both use Gregorian Chant to help set the mood, and have a good rhythm and sound to them. "Liquid" opens with a little mandolin. "Flood" has a good sound to it. The lyrics are quiet over a muted guitar, then it explodes into a crescendo of voices and strumming for the chorus. The counterpoint, as well as the string solo in the middle of the song, makes the song very unique. The other songs do not have the same caliber of sound that these two do, but there are still good nonetheless. "Sinking" is another great song, as well as "Love Song for a Savior". The first hidden track after the song "Blind" ends is a great surprise (around minute 6:00). I don't think that this song should have been hidden like this, as it is up there with the two Belew songs, but it does provide a nice finish to the album.  My only complaint about the album is twenty minutes of rehearsal with the strings for the "Flood" solo. I still cannot figure out why this much of the studio session made it into the album. At least it is at the very end of the album and you can either listen to the album again, or pop it out of the CD player. Otherwise, this is an excellent piece of work.
