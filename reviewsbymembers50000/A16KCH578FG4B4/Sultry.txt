 That is the best way to describe the self-titled release from the Divinyls. With Christina Amphlett's sultry, powerful voice, and Mark McEntee's guitar work, this album really isn't that bad. We've all heard the song and seen the video that left little to the imagination, but the album is actually more than just that. I applaud the Divinyls for "I Touch Myself" because there is a tendency in this country to be too uptight. At the same time though, I like music, and don't want to waste my money on shock. There are several pretty good songs on here that will make it worth your money. Personally, I like a female singer who can belt out tunes with raw tenderness, and Amphlett fits that bill. Her voice is a bit deeper, with a hint of her native Australian accent to flavor it. She's has a great growling tremolo that can be heard in the acappella opening of "Bless My Soul (It's Rock-N-Roll)". Amphlett alone doesn't make this band any good.  She has a well-rounded guitarist in McEntee behind her. He's a very solid guitarist that focuses mostly on rhythm with some brief exploits into soloing. Within each song he is good a varying the rhythm just a bit, sticking in an extra strum here and there, to keep it interesting. He lays down some cool grooves on "Lay Your Body Down", "Bullet", "Bless My Soul" and "Follow Through". This album is good rock and roll from the pre-Seattle explosion. It is worth more than their infamous song, and is a good listen.
