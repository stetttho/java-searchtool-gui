 In the style of Chester and Lester the great partnering of Chet Atkins and Les Paul, comes Atkins and Mark Knopfler. It is always great to see to excellent guitarists with different styles sit in with each other and jam, and "Neck and Neck" is no different. But, it does not quite have the same magic as the old Chester and Lester albums. Here, Knopfler pulls on his Country roots and plays more to the music style of Atkins. It may be hard to recognize Knopfler's playing as it is a departure from his rock, but is in line with his Notting Hillbillies days.  The album opens with a country-blues tune, "Poor Boy Blues" with both men doubling on guitar and vocals. Each takes a turn at soloing, the master and the student, both quick and excellent. The tune is an upbeat toe-taper. The days of Chester and Lester are revisited with "There'll Be Some Changes Made" where Atkins and Knopfler go back and forth about their playing style...Atkins to start playing rock and roll and wearing leather and makeup like "Jackson and Prince" while Knopfler tries to keep him where he belongs. The barbs they give each other while they trade solos are fun. "Yakety Axe" is kinda fun Country ditty. "Tahitian Skies" sounds like a mix of their versions of "Why Worry", airy and jazzy.  This is a good album from two guitar greats. Nothing to amazing comes out of this, just good songs with some solid guitar work. You'll get a couple of laughs out of this album, and if you like Atkins and Country, this is a good album to have.
