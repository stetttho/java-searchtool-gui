 There is probably none who has done more for jazz guitar than Wes Montgomery, except maybe Charlie Christian. Listening to this album you can hear why this man has influenced nearly every guitarist that has ever picked up an axe. Montgomery's style of play came about from playing late at night when his family was in bed. He used his fingers to keep the guitar quiet, and his trademark sound was born.  This album showcases some great songs from the master of the jazz guitar. The album opens with "Airegin", an upbeat tune that shows off some great chord comping and powerful melodic runs. "D-Natural Blues" intros with "Heartbreak Hotel", but turns into run after run of powerful soloing from Montgomery. The quietly soulful "Polka Dots and Moonbeams" is nothing but beautiful. His solos are full of the octave-doubled notes that give his sound such a rich color.  Even though Montgomery is gone, he still lives on not only through his own music, but through the music of others that have been touched by him. His soulful and innovative way of playing the guitar has earned him much respect in the guitar and jazz world. If you're a guitar fan, you owe it to yourself to check out Wes Montgomery, and this album is a good place to start.
