 Gontiti has the feel of a Japanese version of Acoustic Alchemy. Two guitar masters sitting next to each other, picking their hearts out, making great music. Gontiti is the self-proclaimed "The most comfortable music on earth". I don't know how true that is, especially with the first cut "Tiny Lips", which sets me at unease with the synth crashes. But "Devonian Boys" is definitely worth owning if you like acoustic guitar with a jazz and new age feel to it.   The guitar playing is exceptional on this album. A great example is from the duo taking center stage on "Your Sister Knows", with only a little percussion and help from a flute, otherwise, it's just the duo playing. Full band scenarios are brought out with "Windy Land". The slower melody is in perfect counterpoint to the quicker rhythm. "Asterisk*" takes on a jazzy feel with smooth guitar lines. "Admirable Exhibitionism" is another upbeat song bringing in horn-sounding synths for more of Latin-isk sound. Along the same lines, but slower is "Home Song" with the trumpet in the middle.  The most comfortable? Maybe not, but it is good music that almost borders on smooth jazz, with a slightly different feel to it. Both Matsumura and Mikami have a good feel for each other, and sound good together. Definitely a tight duo. A perfect album for lazin' on a Sunday afternoon.
