 I don't know how this music is classified, dance? techno? as it is not my genre, but I do know that I like it. After Robert Miles came out with this album, all the clubs seemed to be playing music with the same drum track, (it could have been there before, but I didn't pay attention to it until Miles came along). Likewise, it is the same beat throughout the entire album. I'm surprised that with that kind of limitation Miles could make something that I enjoy, but he did. The songs on "Dreamland" have enough variation to keep them entertaining, yet have a common thread to tie them all together. I see this album as a single, large work done in many small parts. The songs belong together to achieve the whole.  The music isn't too complicated, filled with piano, synths, a female vocalist, the occasional guitar, and sound effects. Miles is able to effectively blend these components into vehicle of emotion, creating atmosphere, creating a dreamland. To me it sounds like new age techno. Although this is not a genre of music I frequent, I do enjoy Miles' work, and listen to this album often.
