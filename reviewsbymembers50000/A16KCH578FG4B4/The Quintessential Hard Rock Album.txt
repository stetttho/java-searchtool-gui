 Ozzy has always been a leader in his genre of music, from having new bands open for him throughout his career and Ozzfest. But his largest effect has been from his own music. Even from the days as the front man for Black Sabbith he was bound to leave his mark on the industry in more than just tattoos and word bleeps. "Blizzard of Ozz" was his first album leaving the Black Sabbath boys behind. Ozzy made the leap into super-stardom, where Sabbath could not.  What luck Ozzy had in finding the young Randy Rhodes on guitar. Until his unfortunate death, he was well on his way to become a premier guitarist. A flare for his classical side is seen in the brief instrumental "Dee". The album is packed with great tracks, nearly all of them are considered classics, and a must have for all hard rock lovers. "Crazy Train", "Goodbye to Romance" and "I Don't Know" proved to all Sabbath fans that Ozzy would easily make it on his own. The now infamous "Suicide Solution" in all of its hemisynch glory appears on this album.  In the history of music, this album is one that marks the spot where hard rock crossed over into mainstream radio play. Metal bands exploded onto the seen after this album, and neglected greats, like Alice Cooper, found themselves suddenly in the spotlight. Ozzy changed the face of music, and has continued to do so to this day.
