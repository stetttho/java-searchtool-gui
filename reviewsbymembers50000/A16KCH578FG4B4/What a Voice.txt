 I first heard William Topley when I borrowed this cd from a friend. After I returned it I found that I could not live without it. I had to buy my own copy. I listened to it for three straight months before I was willing to let other cds share the airtime. Three years later this album still gets more than its fair share of airtime in my house, car, and job. Since then, my Topley collection has grown and now includes The Blessing as well.  The first thing you notice when you play this album is the deep, throaty voice of Topley. It's half hypnotic and half addicting. You can hear passion dripping from each word that he sings. It turns the song's lyrics into something more than words --it turns them into feelings. It's more than the way he sings the words but how he sings them as well. In the same song he'll sing a phrase really fast and staccato like, and then slows down the next phase by holding each note. This keeps things interesting, and turns his voice into a real living instrument.  The style of the album ranges from the reggae feel of "Soul Love" to the bluesy "Sycamore Street". My favorite songs of the album are "Song of a Seabird" and "Highway 5", but don't ask me which one I'd like to drop because these are all keepers. Very rarely does one find an album that you love most of the songs on it, but I love every single note of this album. If you like a gravelly voice that can sing with feeling, a good supporting band, and just plain good music, then check out Topley. You won't be disappointed.
