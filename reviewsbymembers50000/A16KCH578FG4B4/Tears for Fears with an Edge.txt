 Roland Orzabal decides to go with out the "Tears for Fears" moniker for his latest release, "Tomcats Screaming Outside". Although this appears to be his first solo effort, the last two Tears for Fears albums, "Elemental" and "Raoul and the Kings of Spain", were just that. Once again he collaborates with Alan Griffiths on this album, penning more than half of the songs together. The songs just keep getting better with each passing album created by this partnership. You can hear the chemistry between these two on this album.  For those that still enjoy Tears for Fears and continue to follow them even after Curt Smith left will find this album to their tastes. A little more edgy than Tears for Fears of old with just a hint of techno, Orzabal didn't depart far from his past. Much of the album has the same astral feel to the music, and the lyrics are poetic and meaningful. Orzabal continues to utilize complex musical arrangements to provide a very deep sound. The formula from Tears for Fears is still used, and still works. This is definitely Orzabal's best release since the departure of Smith, and it shows, as most of the songs on this album are keepers. "Snowdrop" is a very big sounding song with Orzabal's harmonized voice, almost hypnotic at times with Taiko type drums throughout. The opening track, "Ticket to the World", "Under Ether" and "Dandelion" shows the new, heavier edge that Orzabal has been experimenting. "For the Love of Cain", "Low Life" and "Hey Andy!" sound like a kickback from the old Tears for Fears days.  If you loved Tears for Fears, don't hesitate to pick this one up.
