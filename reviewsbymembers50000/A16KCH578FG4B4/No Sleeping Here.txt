 Elton John shows us again that he can continue to keep writing good music (with Bernie Taupin). It seems like whatever this duo writes becomes a hit, or gets lots of airplay, and the ten cuts on "Sleeping With the Past" are no different. The songs are composed of good lyrics and musicianship, and should be listened to often.  All of the songs on this album are great, from the opening "Durban Deep" to the title track. "Club At the End of the Street" is the only one that I find any problems with, and that is do to the cartoon video from many years ago, (it's kind of like that Genesis video with the Muppets, hard to hear the song the same way again afterwards). The best songs come at the end of the album. The run begins with the hit "Sacrifice" before moving into the falling in love with a "bride of a handsome man" while watching the ceremony unfold in "I Never Knew Her Name", which is my favorite of the album. "Amazes Me" and "Blue Avenue" finish out the strong second half of the album. Simply, this is a great album.
