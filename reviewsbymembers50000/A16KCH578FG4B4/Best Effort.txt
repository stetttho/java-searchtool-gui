 This EP was recorded live at the Steamboat in Austin, Texas back in 1994. Ian Moore has changed a lot in the past seven years, but I believe that this is the absolute height of his recording career. The only thing that I find disappointing in this album is its very short length, barely clocking in at over thirty minutes. Moore is a stunning live performer whose soulful licks on guitar are only surpassed by his voice.  Only five songs are on this album. Moore and company open with a hot slide number, "Pay No Mind". The upbeat cover of "Me and My Guitar" is the perfect song to finish off the album - flashy enough to keep you wanting more. Moore uses his voice to dig at your emotions on a haunting cover of "Abraham, Martin and John" added to the end of "Blue Sky". "Satisfied" and "Deliver Me" fill out the rest of the show. Even though three of these tunes are from his self-titled first release, they are by no means the same songs. Like any great entertainer, Moore changes the songs by playing different ideas, longer solos, and adding lyrics. He keeps the music live and interesting.  Moore's sound has changed a lot since this recording. If you really enjoyed the old Ian Moore Band, then this is a must buy. The band definitely had it on in late June 1994, and can be heard in this short, but fun, EP.
