 Mix of reggae, punk and rap, and you have Johnny Socko. This band is just a bunch of guys having a lot of fun, and it comes across in their music. With songs like "(This is your) Vasectomy", "Uvula Maintenance" and "I Like Cows" its obvious these guys aren't playing with a full deck, and then you add in all the references to cows throughout the album and, well....  Joe Welch leads with a solid rhythm guitar, venturing out to take an occasional solo, and getting help from Dylan Wissing on Drums. These two provide a solid base for the band. Add in a trumpet, sax and trombone and Mike Wiltrout spouting his bizarre lyrics. There are some strange songs on this album, but some very good ones as well. "(Do the) Post-Modernist Ska" stands out as the album's best. "For Finbar" stands out as well, and the slight departure from the norm in "Flyin' Ed". They end with an untitled track that sounds like a cover of The Vandals' "Pirate's Life".  This is just a fun album to have if you happen to like things just a bit off kilter and out of the mainstream sound. These guys are well worth seeing as well, and put up a pretty good show.
