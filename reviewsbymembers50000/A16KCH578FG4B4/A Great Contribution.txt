 Nothing defines classic rock quite like Jethro Tull does. Ian Anderson's band has help shaped the sound of rock through the 70s, and these are the songs that he did it with. This compilation contains twelve tracks from 1969 through 1977, a good sampling of their contribution to the music of the day.  The classics abound on this album. At one time or another most of the people living today have heard at least one of these songs. "Aqualung" opens with its identifying guitar riff and unique lyric "snot running down his nose". It is easy to hear how JT made such an impact on the music culture. This is how Anderson worked. Listen to the lyrics of the aging rocker's ballad, "Too Old to Rock `N' Roll, Too Young to Die", a song about playing at the tennis club and working a job to pay the mortgage, a song that probably means a lot more to that generation today. Anderson has a couple of other great rockin' tunes on this album with "Locomotive Breath" and "Bungle In the Jungle".   Because of this band's long career, this album is a good place to start and get all their hits in one place in the original sound. Since Jethro Tull's other songs sound like medieval minstrel rock, bordering somewhere between fantasy and psychedelic, it isn't very mainstream and may not be what you want when collecting all these albums. Anderson does have a few songs that sound like he's playing the flute from the bottom of a trashcan. Anderson was definitely a genius, and has done a lot to contribute to the music that we now consider classic.
