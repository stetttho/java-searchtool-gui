 The Kingston Trio is one of the great folk groups from the fifties and sixties. Nick Reynolds, Bob Shane and Dave Guard started the phenomenon that would become the legendary Trio. Later, Dave Guard would leave and would be replaced by John Stewart of The Journeymen fame. This greatest hits disc is full of their most famous tunes. There is probably not a song on this disc you haven't heard. The Trio is probably most noted for "Tom Dooley", but it is not their best work by far, and here's the perfect place to hear their best. There are so many great songs the Trio performed, and all the songs here are great as well. The political ad "M.T.A." about Charlie not having enough money to get off the subway having to spend the rest of his life riding the trains through Boston. "The Tijuana Jail", "Everglades," and "Reverend Mr. Black" are other examples of their famous cuts, but there are other songs here that make this compilation complete. The beautiful "Scarlet Ribbons (For Her Hair)", the tongue in cheek "Raspberries, Strawberries," the nationalistic song of rebellion in "The Patriot Game," and the strange "Coo-Coo-U" also make this album.  For anyone who is a fan of the Trio or folk in general, this is a great album to have. It doesn't show the true Trio, as they were a live act, dynamic and changing, never performing a song the same way twice, and having such fun between songs. Instead this is the cut and dried version of the Trio straight from the studio. This album is great, but live Trio stuff is even better.
