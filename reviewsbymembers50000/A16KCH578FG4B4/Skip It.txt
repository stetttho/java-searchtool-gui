 Being a huge Floyd fan, I have everything ever pressed by THE band. Redundancies run galore in my collection with "Dark Side of the Moon", the 20th anniversary of said album, the live performance of said album in its entirety on "Pulses", the "Shine On" copy of said album, and now the 30th anniversary of said album. Enough said. But, where does one draw the line with redundancy in Floyd material? I say, at "Shine On". Yes, I give it two stars. One, for packaging, and two, for the ninth disc of "Early Singles".  The packaging is great. The disc designs are very "Lawnmower Man"-ish in design housed in solid black jewel cases with a small recreation of the album cover on the front. When all eight discs are in the proper order, the spines display the "Dark Side of the Moon" cover. Pretty neat. Included in the set is a small book that gives brief history, some photos and the lyrics to the song (which we all know anyway), plus several postcards and a handy slipcase for your discs.  The second worthwhile portion of this set is the ninth disc, "Early Singles". Some of these songs can be found elsewhere, but there are a couple of good cuts here that cannot be found easily. "Julia Dream" the futuristic sounding tune, and the Beatle-ish sounding "Point Me at the Sky".  The great thing about buying a boxed set is the extras, mostly unreleased or live tracks. There is really none of that here. You receive eight discs, which you probably already have, and maybe four songs, which you probably don't have, for a whopping price. The insides are attractive, but there is nothing new here. "Animals" from "Shine On" is no different from the plain vanilla "Animals". Skip "Shine On", there are other things more worthwhile to spend your money on.
