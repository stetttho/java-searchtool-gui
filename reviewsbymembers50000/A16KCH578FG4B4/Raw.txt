 "In the Beginning" is one of Stevie Vaughan's first recordings from 1980. It was before he used his middle name, and Double Trouble was Chris Layton and Jackie Newhouse who would later be replaced by Tommy Shannon. Stevie's sound is in metamorphosis to what would eventually be heard on the "Texas Flood" album. Here he is raw and full of power, quick and on the verge of moving into stardom. Even in his mid-twenties, Stevie had a presence on the stage, and you can hear his larger than life sound in this early recording.  He opens with the powerful "In the Open", a loud and fast guitar workout. You can hear the ease as he moves around the guitar in the instrumental piece. The notes drip from his fretboard. Moving straight into "Slide Thing" he plays with a slide across the strings in another instrumental track. Definitely a cool piece. A few of his standards appear here for the first time, like "Love Struck Baby" his jump blues which opens "Texas Flood", a tad faster played live. "I'm Crying" closes this album under the title of "Live Another Day". The star of this concert is the heartfelt "Tin Pan Alley", which is full of signature Stevie licks and his powerful blues voice. He would record this later as "Roughest Place In Town" on "Couldn't Stand the Weather". This raw version is a must have for any Stevie fan. Another great cut is a cover of Otis Rush's "All Your Love I Miss Loving."  "In the Beginning" is aptly named for we hear Stevie at the beginning of his recording career. This is him before the record deals, just an Austin local bending strings and playing the blues on the verge of stardom. He's not quite refined here, but his sound is raw and powerful, and you can already hear how special of a performer his is. No Stevie fan's collection is complete without this early live recording.
