 Eleven guitar heroes join together to cover Christmas tunes in their own personal way. This gives a rockin' twist to the standards. From the first few notes from Kenny Wayne Shepherd's "Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer" you'll now that you're in for melodic delight. Everyone is here from Steve Vai, Satch, Beck, EJ and the BSO.  Highlights include "The First Nowell" from Eric Johnson. He starts us off with an acoustic rendition before stepping over to his electric guitar and wowing us with his fancy finger work, but nothing so flashy as to take away from the original work. As always, EJ's tone is right on and after a couple of his patented licks and runs he turns the tune into his own. The Brian Setzer Orchestra rocks Christmas with a swinging version of "Jingle Bells". The horns blare, and Brian gives us that Rockabilly fell on his Gretch. After checking out this upbeat tune you'll never know how it could have been any other way. Hotei comes in with a good rendition of Lennon's "Happy Xmas (War Is Over)". Jeff Beck gives a haunting performance on "Amazing Grace" pulling out his trademark bends, dives and swells. His take is very beautiful and fitting to more than just Christmas.  For anyone looking for a little less traditional take on Christmas music, or if you're a guitar junky, don't miss celebrating Christmas without this axe-ful album. You may even have to spin this disc in July.
