 Ian Moore burst onto the scene and found himself in a dead-heat race with Chris Duarte for the title of the next Stevie Ray Vaughan. A title that neither of them wanted. Moore's self-titled first album was an exploration in Texas blues. The evolution of the Ian Moore Band really begins with "Modernday Folklore". The difference between this album and his previous two albums is noticeable, but not drastic.  There is some great guitar work on this album although Moore's guitar is not necessary in the spotlight on every song. One of my all-time favorite songs appears on this album. "Today" is just a piece of brilliant songwriting. Moore starts the song off slow, and then picks up the intensity twice before return to the close in the same slow pace. Great lyrics as well, with a good meaning underneath it all. The album starts off with "Muddy Jesus", which delights us with a fast groove, catchy lyrics, and good guitar work. "Daggers" is a slow bit of acoustical solo that gives you a sample of Moore's singing ability. Then he kicks it into the overdriven "Bar Line 99".  The only song that I really don't care for on this album is "You'll Be Gone". Maybe this is the first song of Moore's evolution. Although I own and listen to Moore's subsequent albums, they don't move me like his first three albums do. I prefer the Moore of old, but I don't blame him for breaking with convention and following his own voice. He might have lost a few listeners in discovering himself, but I'm sure he's gained a few more who wouldn't listen to his early stuff. I have to admire someone who's willing to follow what's inside then to be contorted to what the labels and listeners want. I'll still keep tabs on the Ian Moore Band, albeit not as close as I once did.
