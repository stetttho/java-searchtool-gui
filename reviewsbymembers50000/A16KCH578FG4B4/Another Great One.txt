 Seal has one of the greatest voices in music today, and everything he sings is pretty much a hit. His second album doesn't differ, and is a great release from the master of vocals. Everything he sings is perfect, moving and lyrical. Besides the two overplayed songs on this album, there isn't any duds here.  My favorite off the album is "Dreaming In Metaphors". His voice is powerful, and almost pained. It is a soft, almost haunting song, soft and slow. "Bring It On" is more upbeat with a great rhythm guitar track guaranteed to get you body moving. "I'm Alive" is another upbeat song, reminiscent of his first album. Another favorite for me is "People Asking Why". The singles from this album, "Prayer for the Dying" and "Kiss from a Rose" are great songs too, but they've been overplayed on the radio.  It is hard to beat a Seal album. The compositions are well assembled, and multi-layered yet simple so as not to distract from his voice. As a musician, Seal is amazing, but he far exceeds that with his singing. Another hit album, like everything else he does.
