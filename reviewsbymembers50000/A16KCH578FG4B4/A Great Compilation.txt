 There are very few bands that not only leave their mark upon the music world, but who helped to shape it into what it was today. Traffic was one of those bands, and have since been elected to the Rock-n-Roll Hall of Fame for their contribution. The original brain-child of Steve Winwood, Jim Capaldi, Chris Wood and Dave Mason. Others wood come and go, but the magic of Winwood and Capaldi continued for most of the iterations of Traffic. The on again off again career of this band last for about eight years producing nine albums, (before Capaldi and Winwood would reunite in the early 90's), which provide the material for the twenty-six tracks of this compilation.  Traffic took a variety of styles to create their sound, borrowing from Jazz, Blues, and the psychedelic movement of the late sixties. Each of the members had multi-instrument talent, but their greatest skill was writing the lyrics for their songs. Even if you never have heard of Traffic, you have heard their music. Such great songs appear on this album like, "Dear Mr. Fantasy," "Feelin' Alright," "Low Spark of High-Heeled Boys," and "Paper Sun." Traffic's very best stuff is on this compilation.  "Smiling Phases" is the perfect album to get the greatest hits of Traffic's career. If you are a fan of Winwood's or Capaldi's career, or the sound from the late sixties such as Clapton, The Who and Hendrix, this is a must for your collection. Here you can hear how Traffic shaped the future of music.
