 I never knew Charo could play the guitar, but this album proves she can. And surprisingly well too. Straight from the opening licks of the title track, she let's you know that she knows her way around a fretboard mixing classical and flamenco sounds. She lays down some lightning-fast runs, and gives it a good feel. Though I love her guitar playing, I'm not big on her singing. I've always enjoyed Spanish singing, and am a big fan of Luis Megial, but Charo is just too squeaky for my liking. Yet, her dancing on the strings even on the vocal tracks is amazing. The opening phrase of "Fantasia," and the flamenco like rhythm she keeps are great. With "Seduccion" she leaves the singing behind and sticks to the guitar. "Sudeccion" has a strong flamenco feel to it, complete with castanets, and she varies her soloing to make it interesting. Fast runs, and slower notes add variety. "Leyenda" is classic, and Charo plays it so well. She finishes off the album with a beautiful rendition of "Romance De Amor."  Overall, I think this album is pretty decent. Half the tracks are strictly guitar and Charo can play that. Unfortunately, she possesses a voice you either love or hate, and I don't much care for it. For those who like smooth jazz with a Spanish flare, this is a good album to add to your collection, and flamenco/classical guitarists may appreciate it as well.
