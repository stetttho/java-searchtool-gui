 Before Big Head Todd and the Monsters hit the major label, they were just a little band with big tone, lead by Todd Park Mohr on guitar. His playing is a mix of rhythm and melody making the band sound larger than it is, and his monster sound and tone make this band stand out. "Midnight Radio" is mostly a live effort, recorded without overdubs making this album raw and powerful. It is still one of my favorites from the Monsters.  Mohr's fast rhythm playing and brief solos fill the album. The album opens with the solo piece "Vincent of Jersey" with Mohr almost talking and providing just a touch of acoustic guitar to fill the spaces between his verses. "Dinner with Ivan" is full of Mohr's rhythm and almost whiny vocals. The original "Bittersweet" appears here before the extra tracks were added for the "Sister Sweetly" album. Much more raw, and much more fun. The best track on the album is the slow title track, "Midnight Radio". The song's words, backed by Mohr's guitar paint the picture of long winding roads through the night. The volume swell notes add depth and flavor, and the fast paced solo at the end of the song is built over the rhythm. Mohr's voice is powerful and soulful. "Midnight Radio" the song and the album are hard to beat.  This album is different from where the Monsters are today. Live and raw of a band trying to cut its teeth into a tough business. Soon after this album they would vault into stardom outside of Boulder, Colorado and become a national act. Still, I return to this album often, and with "Another Mayberry" find these as my favorite.
