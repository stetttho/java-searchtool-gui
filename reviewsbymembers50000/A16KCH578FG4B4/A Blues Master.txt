 Albert Collins was one of the most unique blues pickers to grace the stage. Tuning his guitar to alternate tunings and using a capo, he would walk around the bar with his 100-foot cord wandering into the bathrooms, out on the street, around the bar playing the blues all the while. He mixes his blues up playing soft, slow blues, and powerful instrumentals. Sometimes his topics are serious, other times his humor comes through. Collins was quite the entertainer.  Although "Ice Pickin'" is a short album, it is jammed with the blues over eight tracks. In such a short amount of time, Collins covers a lot of ground. From his upbeat "Honey, Hush!" to making his guitar talk the argument between him and his wife on "Conversation with Collins" it is nothing but enjoyable. He shines with instrumentals like "Ice Pick" and "Avalanche". His phrasing is like talking. Never to many words, and he can get his point across with hardly any effort. Humor shows through in "Too Tired", where he's too tired to stand after sitting on a pin, and "Master Charge". He also gets heavy on "When the Welfare Turns Its Back On You" and "Cold, Cold Feeling".  A definite master of the guitar, and the blues. He has entertained many a people over his life. As he said in the movie "Adventures In Babysitting" - No one leaves until they sing the blues. He sure did.
