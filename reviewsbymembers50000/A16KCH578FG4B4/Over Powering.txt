 I first discovered Walter Trout on the Ruf Recording Sampler where his cut "Gotta Broken Heart" appeared. I like the version of this song enough to go ahead and get one of his albums. I purchased "Live Trout" for its price and because live albums are usually full of raw energy which you cannot find on a studio album. I was right about the raw energy. Trout abounds with energy, power, and sheer presence. He's so fast I'm amazed that his strings don't get tangled.  Unfortunately, he bores me. It's great that he can shred with the best of them, but you don't have to fill each second of a song with notes. The times I got into Trout were when he was playing with volume swells and slowing down. Also he does a good cover of Bob Dylan's "I Shall Be Released." Even the beginning of "Serve Me Right to Suffer" is good, but he jumps in with his speed. I believe anyone can play with speed, but speed doesn't say much. Music should be felt, not forced.  I like it when guitarists rock out, but I tend to tread the line a little on the purist side. Trout has a great following and loyal fans and he really can connect to them. I think of him as Blues Heavy Metal, and those who lean more to the King's (B.B., Albert, and Freddie), SRV, Buddy Guy and even Hendrix may find this too heavy to palate.
