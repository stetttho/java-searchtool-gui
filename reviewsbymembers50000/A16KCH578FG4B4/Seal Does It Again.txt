 It seems that anything Seal sings is destined to be good, and IV is no different. Like his three previous albums the music is top quality, dominated by Seal's powerful voice. The cuts vary from up-tempo R&B to soft ballads. This album is right in the middle of Seal's ability, and although he doesn't reach to try something radically new it is still a great listen.  From the opening notes of piano and Seal's voice on "Get It Together" it is easy to hear this album is worthwhile. Starting with the upbeat dance feel tune of vocal gymnastics, Seal rushes back to the scene. "My Vision" is classic Seal letting his voice carry the beginning of the tune, as the accompaniment is barely noticeable before they jump in with force. The music experiments with different levels of intensity all held together by Seal's voice. He gets back into more R&B sounds with "Let Me Roll." His slow stuff is good too, but how could it not be with a voice like his. "Don't Make Me Wait" is soft yet powerful, and "Love's Divine" follows suit. Let's face it, we buy Seal albums for his voice. His is one of the best in the business, and even if he played the same music over and over and only changed how he sang, we'd buy it too. The music is the canvas on which he uses his voice to paint vivid pictures of soul and feeling. If you're a Seal fan, this album is definitely worth it.
