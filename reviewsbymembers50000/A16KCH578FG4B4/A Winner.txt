 Tears for Fears was my favorite band back in my high school days, and I still have a soft spot for them. Roland Orzabal continues the name and delivers the best TFF album to date, sans Curt Smith. Although Smith's departure was a sad event, (not to mention taking a step backwards with the release of "Elemental"), Orzabal proved he could go it alone with "Raoul and the Kings of Spain". He pairs once again with Alan Griffiths to pen this album.  "Raoul..." is one of the best complete albums I have heard in a long while. To listen to a track out of order detracts from the overall listening experience. It is as if all these songs are meant to be played together. Orzabal scores a hat-trick in the middle of the album starting with the hauntingly soft sounds of "Los Reyes Catolicos" contrasted by the harder and heavier "Sorry" following with a distorted slide on the heals of the last ringing word. "Humdrum and Humble" rounds out the triple play. Other winners on this disc are the title track, "God's Mistake" and "Don't Drink the Water", but every song is a keeper. Orzabal is a great lyricist and musician. He writes songs with feeling and passion, and aptly composes music that fits the lyrics perfectly. The partnership with Griffiths appears to be a real winner, and their lyrics are poetry with meaning. I hope to eventually see more of these gentlemen's work under the TFF label.
