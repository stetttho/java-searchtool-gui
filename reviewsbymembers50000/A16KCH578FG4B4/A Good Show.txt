 This recording follows the Freddy Jones Band during their seventeen-stop live tour of the West, starting in Chicago, and ending in, my hometown of, Denver. The songs that appear on this album are a collection from their previous four albums played in several different cities. This is another band that has changed from their start years ago, maybe not for the best, but definitely not for the worse either.  The first couple of songs on this album are throwaways. The band sounds lackluster and flat in their tunes of "One World" and "Better Tomorrow". With each song thereafter, the tunes get better as if the band knew what they were doing when they laid out this album. The version of "The Puppet" that appears on this album does not compare to the live version off their first album, but still stands on it's own as a good piece, different, but good. It also marks the turnaround in this album where the songs get better. The last part of the album contains their most energetic songs. Overall, the album is good; especially if you're an FJB fan and enjoy the way the music has changed over their four albums. There is no canned music from the originals as the songs differ from extended soloing to a complete change in sound. "Texas Skies", my favorite FJB, loses its country feel and takes on a rock flavor, while "Take the Time" turns into a nine-minute jam fest. Besides a few flat sounding songs, the only other complaint I have for this album is that the long intros to the songs are gone. Several times during the live show, the band would segue songs with a long intro that touched on their own musical heroes. Unfortunately, this album sounds like it will be the last of the FJB, for at least awhile, if not longer.
