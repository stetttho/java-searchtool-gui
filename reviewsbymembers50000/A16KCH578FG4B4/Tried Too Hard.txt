 It seems no one is invincible from the sophomore jinx, and Corey Stevens is no exception. Coming off his excellent first release, "Blue Drops of Rain", Stevens released "Road to Zen". If you loved his first, "Zen" is a major disappointment. Nothing really stands out on this album, nothing wows, and nothing drops my jaw. "Blue Drops of Rain" rocked, but the fire is gone here.  There are a couple of worthwhile songs on the album, like the Clapton-like "One More Time", and the opening track "Only One For You." The guitar work is decent and the lyrics are not too bad. The guitar on the opening to the title track isn't bad either, but then he starts singing. His singing is a definite negative aspect of this album. Add in lyrics that don't flow or sound well, and this album isn't going anywhere fast.  Great songs like, "Brothers", "Gone Too Long", and "It's Over" were such great artistry on the first album are lacking here. I think Stevens just tried too hard to outdo "Blue Drops of Rain", and set himself up for the jinx. He's proved to us that he has the ability, and just needs to remember: Play Corey, just play.
