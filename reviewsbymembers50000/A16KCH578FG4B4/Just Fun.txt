 There are a few albums out there that are just plain fun to listen to. There are even a couple that are actually good musically. This is one of those musical fun albums. "Essential" uses sixteen tracks to cover a ten-year span of their music from 1981 to 1991. All of this music has a good beat to it, creative lyrics, and numerous sound effects.  I wasn't disappointed with any of the tracks on this album, and although a departure from my normal musical tastes, I find myself playing this disc quite frequently. The album starts off with the now infamous "Oh Yeah" as appeared in a certain movie, but there is more to this group than this one popular song. "The Race" with its upbeat tempo made it into the movie "The Cutting Edge" for the skate routine. "Drive/Driven", "Lost Again", "Of Course I'm Lying", and "Desire" are slower songs that show this duo's writing ability. The quicker "Rubberbandman", "Pinball Cha Cha", "Bostich" and "Jungle Bill" show off more of their humorous side.  If you grew up in the eighties, you will recognize most of these songs that are on this album.
