 I thought with Mark Knopfler's release "Sailing to Philadelphia" he had made it back to the top, but "Ragpicker's Dream" makes sure there is no doubt where Knopfler sits. This album is a mixture of country blues, rock and other flavors of music to provide a toe-tapping good time. The guitar work from Knopfler is excellent as expected. The songs span a range of genres, even hinting a little at the Dire Straits days, and funny at times.  The album kicks off with the upbeat "Why Aye Man". The song rips as Knopfler jumps into several cool solos, and changes tempos throughout to keep the song interesting. Not bad for a pumped up English ditty. "Quality Shoe" is a great marketing pitch for a pair of good shoes. People have sung about everything, and now that includes shoes. The lyrics don't seem that far off, and the guitar and piano solo in the middle are classic. Knopfler gets a good sound for "Hill Farmer's Blues" that is reminiscent of the Straits' days. The music has an aerial sound to it, and his solo buzzes. "Fare There Well Northumberland" has a good country-blues feel to it, and Knopfler steps up with another great solo that sounds good over the tinny rhythm guitar, piano and harmonica.  Whether you love him or not, Knopfler has outdone himself with this album. Knopfler did a good job with the album, and it has a little something for everyone, especially guitar.
