 Junior Brown is about as unique to Country as his guit-steel guitar and trademarked rolled up cowboy hat. With his deep, baritone voice and tongue-in-cheek songwriting makes this guitar virtuoso worth checking out. As a guitar player, this guy is amazing, mixing his twangy Telecaster style grooves and solos with some nasty slide playing. You have to see him live just to understand this man's dexterity.  This understated guitar great's talent can be heard on the guit-solo in the middle of "I Hung It Up". The thunking sound you hear at the end of the song is your jaw hitting the table. He starts the album off with "Gotta Get Up Every Morning" a humorous look at a partying girl friend that rolls in from clubbing just as he's getting up to go to work. He continues this parody cautious look at women with "Venom Wearin' Denim". He sings with Red Simpson on the title track, a true truck-driving song with some fancy guitar work. You can't have a Country singer without a ballad, and Brown has a couple. He croons on "I Want to Hear It From You", and the nearly depressing "Parole Board". Brown just isn't Country though. He likes surf too, as he shows with "Surf Medley", the classic compilation of "Pipe Line," "Walk Don't Run" and "Secret Agent Man".  To put it simply, Brown is amazing. He's definitely one to look at if you are into Country or are just a guitar loving fool. The man is amazing with his axe. His music is fun and enjoyable as well. The only complaint I have about this album is that it is very short, clocking in just over half an hour.
