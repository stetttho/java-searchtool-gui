 After many years of hiatus after "Brothers In Arm", Dire Straits finally comes out with a new album. If you've been listening to Mark Knopfler during the Straits break, then this album isn't anything new to hear. After playing with Chet Atkins on "Neck and Neck", and his time with the Notting Hillbillies, there isn't a surprise that "On Every Street" is heavily flavored with a country sound. This isn't a bad thing, and the album is still very good, it's just a large departure from the Dire Straits of the 70s and 80s.  One thing is certain about this album though, and that is Knopfler's guitar work is still a thing of beauty. His phrasing is simple, yet he is able to speak volumes with just a few notes. "Fade to Black", the best cut on the album, is a good example of his playing. Very blues on this cut, and just enough notes to pull at your soul. He doesn't have to be flashy, and he still sets the mood quite well. "Heavy Full", "Iron Band" and "Planet of New Orleans" has that Straits flavor, especially from later in their career. Songs like "When It Comes to You", "Ticket to Heaven" and "How Long" are heavily flavored with Country.  Fortunately, I enjoy Country and the other solo stuff that Knopfler has done. Even though I was hoping for the Strait's sound, this is still a good album. The songs are well mixed up so you're not stuck with Country cut after cut. If you're a fan of Knopfler, this is a good album to get. It's more like the prequel to "Golden Heart".
