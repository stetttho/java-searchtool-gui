 This box set celebrates the long career of the original guitar god, Eric Clapton. It traces his history back to the days of The Yardbirds, his time with John Mayall, Cream and Blind Faith, and his solo career. Over eighty cuts on four albums provide a great sampling of Slow Hand's evolution of sound and playing. This is still one of the best box sets that I've found, covering all of his greatest hits. Of course, Clapton has so many great hits, that it requires a second box set to cover them all.
