 Two British bands would help to bring in the heavy metal movement decades later. One was the American sounding Led Zeppelin, and the other was Black Sabbath. The quartet of Ozzy Osbourne, Tony Iomi, Geezer Butler and Bill Ward were the first iteration of Black Sabbath, named after the 1963 Boris Karloff horror movie of the same title. People were lined up around the block to see the horror flick, and the path was set as to the type of music they would pursue. This three-disc set follows the beginning of the career of that first iteration of Sabbath. Everything that appears in this box set is a hit, and a great listen. All the major hits are here, as well as great songs that never got the airplay they deserved. For any fan of metal in the `80s, this is where it began, and is a must have for fans of Ozzy and early Black Sabbath. Well worth finding if you're able.
