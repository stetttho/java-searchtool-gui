 "Scream In Blue" is Midnight Oil's collection of live cuts recorded around Australia (and one cut from New York) from 1982 to 1990. Midnight Oil is one of those bands that seem to explode with energy once on the stage, which makes their live albums a step above their studio productions. Peter Garrett is nothing but energy to begin with, and he conveys that through his vocals to the listener. The band picks up on it, and rise to the occasion to deliver a great album.  This album has a bunch of their greatest hits, but appear here a little different than their studio versions. "The Stars of Warburton" is the strongest cut off the album. Great arpeggio guitars from Jim Moginie and Martin Rotsey, and of course Garretts lyrics make this song very powerful. The album starts off with a feedback, disharmonized intro that sets the fillings in your teeth to rattling, then segues into "Read About It". The energy is already pumping as the song starts, and they keep the same level throughout the album. Everything on this album is great. "Dreamworld", "Beds Are Burning", and "Sell My Soul" are a few of the excellent tracks here. If you like some of the stuff Midnight Oil has done, and like a high energy show, this is definitely a must have. The songs are great, and Garrett's energy is passed on to you as you listen. How a live album should be.
