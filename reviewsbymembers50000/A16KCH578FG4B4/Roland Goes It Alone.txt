 Whatever happened after the amazing "Seeds of Love" release, it looked to be the end of Tears for Fears. Curt Smith left Roland Orzabal to go it alone with the TFF name. Orzabal enlisted the help of Alan Griffiths, and although took a step backward, laid down the groundwork for a great collaboration that would reshape TFF into the last decade of the century.  As compared to "Seeds of Love" I'd say that this album is not as good, but it sure is close. With the title track Orzabal let us know that the band is still the same sans Smith, with just a bit of a twist. The song has more of an edge to it than previous TFF stuff, a little heavier sound, but still the same great Orzabal voice. After reaching out a little, Orzabal comes back into a signature sound with "Cold". "Break It Down Again" is a little funky with a Orzabal's staccato lyrics helping to drive the rhythm. The album goes back to being heavy with "Dog's a Best Friend's Dog". The album ends with "Goodnight Song", a great song with Orzabal's voice ringing, and almost bluesy electric guitar. Very recognizable format in today's music scene, a song way before its time.  Orzabal is definitely trying out his new wings of freedom. "Elemental" is definitely a transition album. You can hear the change in TFF from "Seeds of Love" to "Raoul, and the Kings of Spain" and on to "Tomcats Screaming Outside". Orzabal picked a good title for this album, as it is the building stone for the second half of his career. It's a good start, and a must own for any Orzabal or TFF fan.
