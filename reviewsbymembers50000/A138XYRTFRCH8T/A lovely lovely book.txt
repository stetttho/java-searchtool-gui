 I just resently discovered C.M Barker's work. Her wonderful artwork is used in this book is beautifuly reproduced. It contains only a handful of the actual Fairies, but alot of leaves and flowers. The point ot that is to  use more leaves and items to make the Fairy stand out as a focal point.  Eazy to follow and set, this book is a must for anyone who loves fairies or  want to decorate there house with beautiful things.
