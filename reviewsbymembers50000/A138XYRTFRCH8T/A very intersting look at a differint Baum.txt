 This is one of Baum's less famous and more infamous series. Being out of print for many many many years and now coming back. I for one am grabbing up the editions as fast as they come out. Similar to the storytelling in  his Master Key the Boy Fortune Hunter follows the exploits of three your  boys. Now there is a note in the beginning about some of the viewpoints  might not be PC, but not to the point (at least in my opinion) that they  take away form the story. It is really your typical turn of the century  boy's stuff, but it still is wonderfully Baum.
