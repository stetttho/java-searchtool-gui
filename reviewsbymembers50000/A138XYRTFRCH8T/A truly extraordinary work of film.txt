 I have to admit I wasn't born until about 12 years after the film was made. It was always one of those films you heard was either really good or really bad. I used to work for a video retailer, and it was always one way or the other with people. For years I toyed with the idea of getting the film. It had gone out of print, so I thought of buying it, but never got around to doing so. Then when the DVD came out I picked it up mainly because years of curiosity got the better of me. I started with watching the two-hour documentary. And it must admit it really helped me understand the hype behind the film, and put it into the historical context of the time. It  is one of, if not THE best, documentary extras ever on a DVD. It is about the only major extra on the set. A short 1963 newsreel documentary is also included along with a trailer or two. Then I sat down to watch the film with its marathon length of 405mins! It was breathtaking. It was captivating and rich in texture and scope. The scenery was extraordinary (and none of it CG...even better) and one can really see why the producer wanted no one else but Liz Taylor for the role, and why she signed the first million dollar contract to do it. An extraordinary piece of film with a great presentation on DVD makes this the edition to buy before it goes out of print.
