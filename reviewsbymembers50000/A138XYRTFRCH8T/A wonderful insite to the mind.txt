 I'm a HUGE fan of Baum.Always have been. Ever since I was a kid. Reading Baum in published order is an ever ongoing project with me. Now I'm not one who wants to take apart the wonderful stories and put all the elements into  little boxes and find out what they are make of, but this book does  something that is just the opposite. It takes the stories and looks at them  in the order in which they were written! This book is a wonderful look at  the "periods" in the Baum Canon. This is a great look at how say  something like the Life and Adventures of Santa Clause and Queen XiXi of IX  relate to each other. Great writing and research makes this book a MUST for  any Baum collector.
