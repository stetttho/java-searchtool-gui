 This recording is the latest in the ever growing line for the resurrected JEEVES musical that was originally written back in 1975 by Webber and Ayckborn. I must was that the new version is wonderful. A charming show by a talented writer and composer. You need not be familiar with the Wodehouse stories, but that helps. This recording is form the upcoming VHS & DVD of the show. If I would have to choose I would choose the ST. Joseph recording of the show to start with as it has the most bridging dialogue. The other two versions of this show as well have a great narrative to link the story to the songs. You might be a little lost with this recording, but it is a wonderfully tight and crisply preformed album, and a fine addition to any collection. The songs are chirpy and memorable. The humor wonderfully British and well done, all in all I recommend it!
