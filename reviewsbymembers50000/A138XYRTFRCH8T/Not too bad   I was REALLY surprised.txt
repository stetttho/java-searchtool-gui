 I originally had no idea as to the story of this show, and frankly after I saw the first episode I was not all that impressed. Then as I started to watch the rest of it I really got into it. It's really a sophisticated show  with some great humor and wonderful philosophy on modern life. I whole  hardly recommend this show to singles and couples alike!  I great cast  coupled with a set of great scripts make this show a real treat
