 Over the years this piece of theater has become a  bit of a joke, but one watch will change all minds. It is not a "conventional" piece of  theater by any meens. It is more of an explosion of dance and song. The  filming is wonderfully done, with close-ups on the faces to see make up and  everything. What is lost in it thoe, is a sence of expreience that one gets  seeing it live. In the theater the interaction between cast and audience is  a part of the fun, but for people whom have seen the stage version this is  a good refresher. All the make-up has been redone for this disk, and  the  staging tighten up to top notch form. The cast is ab-fab ( all but for the  Rum-Tum-Tugger he's only ok). All but for the opera seen have made it to  film, but no great loss. The 5.1 will bring tears to the eyes of any fan,  and the documentary id great to watch to. So look at this piece of theater  as it should be looked on, as the greadfather of the stage spectical,  because that is what it is, a real piece of musical history
