 Now I'm an adult who ran across the book just a little while ago. I have always loved fairies, but was not really into the horrid interpretations of modern day artiest. This book is so amazing it's unreal!  The artwork is so  beautiful and delicate. She painted them as beautiful wide-eyed children  and adolescents, with absolutely amazing accuracy on the accompanying  flowers. The poems for each flower fairy describes the chararistics of the  flower with such grace it sends chills up my spine. A WONDERFUL book for  parents to read to their children, as well as a great book for adults who  want to stay children at heart. I can not express enough the beauty and  gentleness of her artwork enough!  The book here contains all 8 of the  Flower Fairies books as well as story of The Fairy Necklaces and the poems  she illustrated for Old Rimes for All Times. You will not be disapointed.
