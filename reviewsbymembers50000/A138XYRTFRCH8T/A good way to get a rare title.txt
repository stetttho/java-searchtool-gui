 Well after a long debate as whether or not to spend that much money on a sight unseen reproduction of a Baum book I broke down to do it. As some of you might not be aware of this work was done as a small hand pressed book  done by Baum himself. It was done in a 99 copy edition size. So as one  might imagine it is next to impossible to find. This edition is well done,  but could have been a little better bound. The binding is just your normal  library binding. A dark orange with black lettering on the spine is all  that indicates what is inside. The complete text and illustrations are  reproduced here in black and white, with a very good introduction on the  history of the text. The poems are typical Baum... none of which will lead to  a great romantic following. The poems are a very interesting look at Baum  writing for adults. (This is one of the rare instances that this happens.  Most of his adult writing has fallen into obscurity these days. So if you  are collecting the man this is a wonderful (and in all reality the only  way) to get this rare text.
