 I can't say enough wonderful things about this book. First off is the design of the book. A beautifully designed read and gold hardcover it befits the title of religious book. No huge pentagram or scantly dressed "witch" here this is a book for all those that take Wicca as a real religion as opposed to a means to find wealth or love. The text it slightly baroque, but beautifully written and very reverent of all pagan religions. It first explains about the different kinds of prayers, and then it has the different prayers in sections. Morning, Evening, Night, Seasonal, Full Moon. No prayers to find love, money, or anything else, just beautiful praise and thanks to the Goddess Mother of us all.
