 With 18 different cast recordings of the show I would be the fist to admit that Cats is german is a little weird. This is one of two german cast recordings out.(The other one is a Live double disk recording.) If you like  the show then I would get it just for the novelity. It has a few good  voices,but the orchestera is small and sorta bland. Out of all the  recordings I have this is around the bottom of the lot,but still cute and  fun. If you can find the other German it's much better.
