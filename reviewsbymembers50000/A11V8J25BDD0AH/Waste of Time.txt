 Uzzel borrows liberally from previous research and writing on Jefferson while supplying very little of his own. I didn't learn anything new about Jefferson from reading this, nor will any other decently informed blues fan. There is absolutely zero analysis of BLJ's songs or musicianship, nor any attempt to place him in the context of his times. Uzzel knows nothing about other bluesmen, so he abstains from potentially insightful comparisons to BLJ contemporaries in Texas and Mississippi. There is no discography, so the reader is left guessing at exactly what, when, and where BLJ recorded his tunes. All in all, a vacuous read and a waste of everyone's time and money.
