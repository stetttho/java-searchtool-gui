 I was disappointed by this one - I liked "shopaholic" and "Can you keep the secret?" and expected another fun and easy reading, but in this book Kinsella tried to touch some bigger issues... well, it did not work. The main character, Samantha Sweeting begins from being smart and successful, but totally overworked corporate lawyer and somehow, by series of misunderstandings, becomes to be... a housekeeper. Well, most of times I am so stressed out in my job that I am ready to be housewife... for a couple of months. OK, the story is funny, the characters are recognizable, the necessary element of romance is in... But why does she have to choose between two absolute extremes? Is there any sweet compromise that all of us - poor overworked career women - are trying to find, if not in the real life, so at least in the fiction?  I can guess already that in the next couple of months - after she learns "Cooking Advanced" the woman will be royally bored in her kitchen. At least that much she should know about herself. I guess, this way Kinsella leaves herself the opportunity to develop the plot in the next book . Hopefully, the next one would be better.
