 I haven't expected a lot from this book, as usually about eighty percent of reviews are hyperinflated. Surprisingly, I liked it. It is simple memoir, without false pretenses, telling about experiences that most people - immigrants, teachers, students, parents - can easily relate to. This is one of the books that makes you remember, reminiscence and think. I am glad that McCourt took up writing. The world has now one more good writer... and may be, because of this, it became a slightly better place.
