 As much as I like other Reverte's books, I was tempted more than once to close this book without finishing it. Somehow I got to the page 160, and then all Reverte's magic was back, and I was glad that I did not put the book down. The main drawback for me was that the plot was relatively easy predictable, as compared to the other novels of Arturo Perez-Reverte. Also, my timing was not so good - after all Dan Brown buzz any book that begins in Vatican gets from me an immediate "not again" response. Anyway, Reverte's ability to weave together history, romance, philosophy and suspense still creates magic, despite  not-so-fascinating plot and one-dimensional characters. And... now I'd really like to visit Ceville.
