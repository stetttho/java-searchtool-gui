 I will not say that this book is one of the best thrillers that I have ever read, but it is definitely one of the most original  ones. I admit that I know nothing about quantum physics and neuropsychology, so I will never know at what point Fawer moves from science to speculations (in a way, similar to what Dan Brown has done with historic theories). But Fawer does it in a brilliant way, and so his excursions to the probability theory, statistics (the bell curve and formulaes are actually part of the book!)and quantum theory are not only necessary background, but very interesting on their own. Should I say: "more interesting than the plot"? As the story develops and moves to the culmination point, the secrets and mysteries become more or less solved... that's when I realized that the story itself is just a thriller template . The (almost) mad scientist that wants to achieve absolute power, twin brothers with extraordinary psychological abilities, Russian maphia and Russian agents (did I forget Mossad?), corrupted politicians. Fawer takes all those standard ingredients and mixes them, using standard recipe. What makes it different from the rest? Improbable flavour of  species - Laplas and Einstein theories, to name a few. I guess, that's what happens when MBAs start writing fiction ( no offense, I got one by myself).  Nevertheless, the book is entertaining,and will help you to forget about the reality - somewhere in the airport, or on the plane. However, it is not original or scandalous enough to be next "Da Vinci code". Does not have to be.
