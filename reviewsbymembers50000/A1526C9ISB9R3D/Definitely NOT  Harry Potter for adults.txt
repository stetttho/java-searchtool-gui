 Very well written book... but awfully long. The 200 pages in the middle could be lost - without any damage to the quality of the book. It took me a while, but I enjoyed my reading. I just had to realize that this entire publishing buzz about "Harry Potter for adults" is a buzz - and no more than that. This is not a page turner, and never supposed to be. For me, this is something that Dickens would have written, if he had been inclined to write a fantasy book.(Not that I ever had patience for Dickens :-) So, enjoy the book - if you have enough patience, sense of humor and love for both historical fiction and fantasy. Well, it will also help if you have something action-packed on your bookshelf, for the times, when you actually have to put the book down and get some break from its density and complexity.
