 Nice and funny book. It entertains you, makes you laugh and feel better. Even though the story has happy ending, the characters and dialogues are real, so it does not feel like in bad Hollywood movie. I read it in one sitting and enjoyed very much. ...on the second thought - this book could be transformed into nice playscreen and nice Hollywood movie (J. Aniston as Bekky?:-)
