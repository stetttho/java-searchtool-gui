 Thanks G-d for Oprah! The book has been written a long time ago, but only now it got all the attention it really deserves. Similar to other Holocaust books, it is not an easy reading - but it does not simply plays on your emotions.  "Night" not only makes you cry, it makes you think and doubt. I have read the whole trilogy ("Night", "Dawn" and "Accident") in two days  and would recommend to everybody to continue with the trilogy, to see how the character and the philosophy are developing. "Night" is one of the rare books I would always remember and  think about - even though I would probably not re-read it, because of the strong emotional impact. The book was worth bying anyway, simlply because I would lend it to many of my friends.
