 The same old, the same old... As much as I liked the first books in the series -  and even gave them my personal "Best ever written fantasy (after Tolkien)" prize, as much I was struggling through "Chainfire". There is nowhere to go, nothing more to develop in the characters - so Mr. Goodkind includes more and more philosophy - instead of telling stories, as it is expected. The result is disappointing. All of you, who have seen Matrix re-loaded, re-furbished and re-installed, know the feeling. I guess the real skill that fantasy writers should master, it's realizing when to stop the sequels ( My applause to Dave Dunkan, who knows how to do it and best wishes to JK Rowling). PS I am still going to buy "Phantom" next March, hoping for the miracle: after all, I liked "Pillars of Creation"(7) more than "Faith of Fallen" (6)
