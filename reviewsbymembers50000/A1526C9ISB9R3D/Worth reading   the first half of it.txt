 Wow! I was reading first pages of this book, laughing and crying simultaneously. If I hadn't left my job at one of big consulting firms a week ago, I would be really tempted to do it, affected by the book. So, the beginning was promising, funny, smart and as real as it gets in the real life of any working mother. I really enjoyed it and was ready to give to Kate well-deserved five stars, but... The second half of the book is disappointing. The humor of most situations is wearing down, and author repeats herself. What's worse, she is getting into all those antifeminist discussions (I may or may not agree with them, but they certainly do not make the book more readable and convincing). Towards the end, it feels more and more like The Manifest of Modern Women. I could feel the presence of the new (anti?)feminist revolution ghost walking on the roads of Europe.  Three stars - and please, if you are still compelled to read the book, save your money and borrow the book from the library.
