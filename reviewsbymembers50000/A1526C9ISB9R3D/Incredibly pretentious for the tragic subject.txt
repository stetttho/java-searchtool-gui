 One of the reviews says that Holden Caulfield would be glad to jump into this book.  Honestly, I felt as if the protagonist IS Holden Caufield. As much as I like both of them (Holden and Oskar), I had to remind myself all the time while reading the book that the protagonist is only 9 years old. True, he experienced a tragic death of his dad in 9/11, and this made him grow up faster. True, most of the book is allegoric and mythical anyway. But for me, to truly enjoy the book, I have to begin with at least something realistic. This is especially true for the book that deals with one of the most tragic events that we have witnessed in our life.  Also, I could not escape the feeling that author speculates on my emotions, to get the desirable effect and weave his experiments in the style and philosophy into the story. Add to this the fact that I continuously feel manipulated ... 9 years old boys play "Hamlet"? (Oscar plays Yorick, to get the most  effect). Most of those boys I know would not know who is Hamlet and for which hockey team he plays.  The man dies in the World Trade center, and his dad (very surrealistic figure by himself) is one of few survivors of Dresden's bombings? If the history comes back, why go that far? Because otherwise author all of a sudden gets into too much politics, and he prefers to stay above all of this? May be, I oversimplify it; may be, I was looking for the answers in the wrong book, and "Incredibly close" is really the mythical quest after Truth and not after truth. But it just did not feel right for me.
