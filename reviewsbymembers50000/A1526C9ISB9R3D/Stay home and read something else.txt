 This book is totally not up to "Eats, shoots and leaves". When the first one was witty, funny, short and to the point, the other one is just complaining, trying to be funny and witty, and then complaining again. Honestly, I missed the point. The peope became rude, self-absorbed and do not pay attention to social surroundings? Yes, I got this one. Have a couple of examples of my own - as probably any other person on the earth. But what else? Why there was a need to write THE BOOK ? To complain again and again about the rudeness of Brits? (who are actually extremely polite, if you compare them, let's say, to Russians). Or just to get another bang of big cash?? The analysis of the reasons behind the social event is not deep enough; the conclusions are just missing, the advice does not exist... and Ms./Mrs. Truss is being extremely intolerant and rude herself (I do hope she'll apologize in public for this "gluten-intolerant" comment).  Bottom line? Go out there, get some coffee at the corner, but  be polite and show people the example of polite behavior. And if you are so inclined to stay at home, choose another book as your companion.
