 I tried to put this one down several times; the beginning is slow and sometimes too boring to try to go further. Only my good memories of "instance of a fingerpost" kept me going. But then the story got momentum - or it was me who finally got on the track - and I kept reading till 2 am, following the old painter's monologue, even knowing already the main secrets of the story. The atmosphere of Impressionist's Paris, London smog (and snobs), the story of the boy from small Ireland town becoming a painter, vengeance, menace, and much more - how all these elements mix together and make a mystery, is a mystery for me. But in the hands of Iain Pears it works.  The main caveat for me was the fact that the book is written as a monologue - the intonations never change, all characters are described only through the eyes of the main hero. This makes the reading similar to the driving with cruise control on 90 km/h - you eventually get there, but the way is monotonous.
