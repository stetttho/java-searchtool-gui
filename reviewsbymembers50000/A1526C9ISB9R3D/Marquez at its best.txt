 It is a crime to give less than 5 stars to Nobel laureate, but ...  "100 years of solitude" has always been my "6 stars" book; I missed my subway station twice when I was reading "No one writes to the Colonel", so I was expecting the same effect from the "Love in the time of cholera" and was disappointed when it didn't happen almost till the very end. I guess, for the first 3/4 parts the story was too slow to keep me motivated to read further. I had to stop and return to the book not once, but many times. But at the end I caught up and was as captivated by words of Marquez, as always. The book has it all - beautiful language (applauses to the Edith Grossman - English translator!); subtle humor - always on the verge of not so subtle; descriptions of sleepy, rotting but still enchanting small towns somewhere in Caribbean; and of course the main characters - sometime naive, often strange and twisted, rarely "normal" in a normal meaning of this word, but always charming. Many reviewers point out that the heroes are not "likeable", but this is rarely the case with Marquez characters, so I personally did not have problem with this. And, of course the romantic in me just loved the idea of eternal love, proclaimed by a boy who kept it through the 50 years - despite (or because of?) 622 affairs documented in his diary.   This is a great book by the great author. You only have to have patience - and you would be rewarded.
