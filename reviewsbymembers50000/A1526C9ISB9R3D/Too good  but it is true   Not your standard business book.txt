 I finished this book in a day and now I REALLY want to work for Semco, for two major reasons: a.I am all for flexible hours, since I am absolutely non-functional before 10 am b.Afternoon siesta at work sounds like something I can use... Jokes aside, the book is a very interesting and refreshing reading. It is full of original ideas, non-standard approaches and difficult questions. I can have my doubts whether Semler ideas could be implemented on a larger scale, than one company - after all, I have personally seen the end of an attempt to "build a socialism in one separately taken country". I have seen numerous examples that people, when left to their own devices, may behave as responsible adults, but this is not always the case. Semler, however, insists that all of us would behave as rational people, looking for self-interest... Well, first of all, the rationality of human beings is considered as only a hypothesis by most of scientists . Also, there is this part of self-destruction in all of us - if it is not balanced by somebody's else common sense, the best laid plans (such as Semler's approach) would not be implemented. Having said all of this, I am still going to recommend this book to all my friends. Even if each of us will implement only one or two small things from this book- and in some companies it could be more than that - our work and life would be so much more enjoyable. This is the book that is really worth your time and money.
