 If it is the first time you read Murakami, do not begin your journey with this book. You really should go through his short stories, and then at least "Dance Dance Dance" before you try this one.  It is not an easy reading, and unless you are used to Murakami's style, are familiar with some of his previous works and ideas, you will not enjoy the book as much as you potentially can. On the other side, if you are already "hooked" by Norvegian forest and are able "to listen to the songs of the wind", then add this one to your bookshelf and enjoy. (Sorry, I am slightly cheating here - I usually read Murakami's books in Russian translations, which are fabulous - I do not know whether Murakami was "lost in translation" into English.Hopefully, not - and it's worth the try, anyway.)
