 Audrey Niffenegger defines this book as a "visual novel", and that's exactly what it is. It's not a book to read, but the book to look at - think about art albums. Look at the cover , flip the pages - if you like the aquatints (as I did), you'll enjoy the book - it's gothic, it's mystic, it's weird... and yes, it is a little bit too creepy for my taste. Anyway, even for somebody who has not read "Time Traveller's wife" it is obvious that the author is very talented artist, with weird imagination (isn't this what you expect of all of them?) On the other hand, I do agree with one of the reviewers who said that if not for Niffenegger's first novel, this one would not be published. I guess it is not because the book is bad , but because it is way too strange to appeal to most of people. On the funny side: my seven years' daugther picked this one from my desk before I could do it, read it in 20 minutes and concluded that she liked the book. I really hope now that she meant the pictures, and not the story itself...:-)
