 I had two reasons to buy the book in the bookstore: 1. I flipped through the first 20 pages and have not seen any cliche that became so tiresome in the fantasy (elfs, dwarfs, dragons... you name it) 2. The price was 5.99 Canadian dollars, so I decided that the risk is not high. Serious mistake... the rest of books have standard prices, but after reading the first one I realized that I must buy the rest of the series! Cool marketing trick, by the way. Anyway - I read a lot of fantasy, but currently got tired of the standard formulaes in it. GRRM does not use formulaes, represents different point of views on the same story, the plot is fascinating, and characters are alive, not your normal fantasy black-and-white (sometimes you actually can not decide whether they are heroes or villains - which is unsettling, but adds to the tension). All this immediately put this book into "my favourites" shelf. ...on the other hand, my husband stopped at the book one and asked me to give him a short synopsis of the rest of the series -he prefers more action, less confusion in the fantasy books, so he found this book "too dense" for his taste.
