 Excellent reference book for everybody who needs (or inspires) to write in English, from ESL students to writers. Some of the entries are really basic ("affect" vs. "effect"),some give you an origin of words , and many caused "I haven't thought about it" effect. Very useful book, written with the sense of humour , so reading it is much more fun as compared to looking up the word in a dictionary or checking the grammar book.
