 Good reading, but slightly disappointing. Well, we knew already in last July  that book six was supposed to give some hints how to beat Voldemort. We also knew that Harry is not going to beat the Dark lord in this book, because otherwise there is no need to write book seven. As well, there is nothing more left to say about Hogwart , as everything has already been said in previous books... so there is nothing unexpected in all those "unexpected" twists at the very end (well, I am not going to spoil it for you anyway).  So, the only disappointing thing is actually that JKR follows the scheme so diligently; even the sweet romances of adolescence that were expected at this point are present. All of this is still fun read, but what I really wanted to get is something extraordinary to happen...probably got spoiled by the first books from series. Anyway, I'd like to know the end - so I am waiting for next year installment. As an afterthought - as a parent of 6-year old girl, I am going to wait at least another year to give her even the first book of Harry Potter (even though, influenced by all PR, she is trying to search the bookshelves and find the hidden six volumes). As for the sixth volume, this is definitely not kids' reading.
