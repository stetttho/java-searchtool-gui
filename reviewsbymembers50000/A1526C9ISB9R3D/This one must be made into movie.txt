 From the first time when we borrowed one of Child's first books "Killing Floor"  in the library, we were hooked by Child's writing -  and the appeal of Jack Reacher, ex army cop. Those are the best thrillers I have ever read; we recommend those to all our friends and nobody ever complained. Actually, instead of borrowing paperbacks from the library, we now are buying hardcovers of each new Child's book - which is something that in our house is never done for thrillers. And no, I am not going to tell you, what is this book about. It is suspense, after all. Just read it.
