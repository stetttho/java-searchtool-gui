 The world is flat, according to Friedman. The world is connected, in normal language. So what? I have read the first 60 pages and then began to skip pages, trying to find something else , but found more and more examples, illustrating the same point again and again. I got the feeling that I am reading the weekly magazine column over and over again. As much as I like Friedman style, the book is way too long for a couple of ideas that he has on the subject. Alternatively, he should have left writing on economics to the professionals. "Roaring 90's" by Stiglitz have more ideas in any one chapter, than there are in the whole "Flat world". (Well, Stiglitz earned his Nobel prize in economics, so presumably he is better qualified to write economics books).
