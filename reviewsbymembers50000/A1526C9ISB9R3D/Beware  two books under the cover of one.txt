 June 22, 1941 - the morning that has changed the history for all Russians; the morning when  "Great Patriotic War" was announced on the Soviet Radio; the moment when millions of lives had been changed.. This is also the morning when the story of "Bronze Horseman" begins: nice summer day, first day of war, when 17-years old Tatiana Metanova, while strolling on Leningrad streets, meets Alexander - the love of her life. In the beginning, I thought that the idea of this story is promising - the Great Love during Great War. After some hundred pages, I realized that I was reading two different books: the romance novel and the historical chronics. The first one is really below any critics: the plot is unrealistic, the heroes are annoyingly perfect, their conflict is made up, and the love scenes are so silly and cheesy, that I began to skip them altogether. This part of story is worth less than 1 star. The second book, one that deals with the life in Soviet Union, siege of Leningrad, terror of life under NKVD's eye, is surprisingly good. These parts of book will have strong emotional impact on you, even if you know something about this period in history; and they certainly will make you cry if this is the first time you read about it. I can easily give 5 stars for those parts of the book.  One of the reviewers said that the plot is not logical. I would argue that as long as the plot follows historic realities and general atmosphere of Soviet Union, it is believable and realistic... but as soon as the development is based on the heroes' sentiments ("he thinks that I think that he thinks" stuff), it does become annoyingly stupid.  I am close to the end, and I am going to finish the book, skipping love scenes. If you are able to read the book this way, I certainly recommend it. If not - you will be better off reading "Ice road" by G. Slovo
