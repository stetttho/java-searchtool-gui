 Actually, it's a pity that this book got so little attention in North America. I can not be really objective, being born in Leningrad and living there for the first 20 years of my life. So, reading the "Ice road" returned me to the good - and not so good - old times in Russia. But this is not the only, and not even the main reason for me to enjoy the book. First of all, it is a real story. Well, it is real in a sense, that this story truly has happened to many people - and all of them had to go through grief, losses, betrayal, doubts... and this was the system that broke the people down. Read the book, and you understand how it works - something that will help you to discover one of those infamous "Russian mysteries". Secondly, I was truly amazed to see that Slovo, who never has been in Russia, was able to find the right words, to paint the right atmosphere and describe all these Soviet hard idealists better than most Soviet writers that I know. This is a very impressive thing to perform from South Africa.  Bottom line? Highly recommended. If you want to read a really good book, which will make you both to turn the pages at 2am, to cry and to think, pick this one.
