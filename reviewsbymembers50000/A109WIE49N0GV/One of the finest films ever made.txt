 THE LAST PICTURE SHOW is a perfect, if depressing, film about small-town Texas life in the 1950s.  The film combines some of the most intersting characters ever put on screen (masterfully created by writer Larry  McMurtry) with an amazing film technique from director Peter Bogdanovich,  with superb performances from such actors as Jeff Bridges, Cybill Shepherd,  Timothy Bottoms, Ben Johnson, Cloris Leachman and several others.  This  film operates at many different levels, both figuratively and literally  (observe the infinite depth-of-field sharpness to the black-and-white film,  reminiscent of Orson Wells' CITIZEN KANE).  It is truly one of the most  important, and perfect, films ever made.
