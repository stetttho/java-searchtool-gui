 Ah, the high school memories come flooding back...  I own the vinyl versions of all of these terrific '80s singles, and I'm thrilled to have them all together on CD for the first time.  Although much of this material has been released on CD before, this is the first time that I know of that it's all collected into one set.  For those who love the early years of Duran Duran, this is an absolute must for your collection. However, EMI didn't execute this concept in a particularly user-friendly way.  I know they have a tradition of releasing miniature reproductions of original singles in box sets, but it's frankly very annoying to have to change discs after every three or so songs in order to hear a lot of this material.  A collection including all of these songs on two or three full-length CDs (with a nice booklet containing reproductions of each record sleeve) would have made for much easier listening. On the subject of liner notes, don't expect any here.  There's a little fold-out poster that comes in the box, which has very minimal track information on the back.  Track titles, writer and publishing information, and who produced each track is about all you get -- not even any track lengths are listed.  I really expected more detailed liner notes in the box, and I was disappointed to discover how little information there is in the box. So there are plusses and minuses to the set.  For the die-hard Duran Duran fan, the plusses will far outweigh the minuses.  I would rate it a five-star item were it not for the annoyance of having only three tracks per disc...
