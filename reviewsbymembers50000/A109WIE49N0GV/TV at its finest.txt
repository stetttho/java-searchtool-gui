 I'm not an HBO subscriber.  I didn't really know anything about "Six Feet Under," either.  But it looked like a good show, so I bought the DVD set. I was blown away!  From the very first moments of the pilot, I was hooked.  The opening theme music is one of the best ever composed for a television series, and the opening credits are fascinating -- so much so that there's a featurette on the DVD just about the making of the opening credit sequence. Then there are the characters.  These are not two-dimensional sitcom charicatures; they are very rounded, deep, complicated people.  They actually seem like real people (and a LOT like my own family). Add the acting to that -- what a great cast!  Every single principal actor on this show is terrific.  As an ensemble, they equal more than the sum of their parts. That writing!  These are well-crafted episodes.  Each episode tells a couple of self-contained stories, but there's some serialism going on, too, which keeps you coming back for more. And direction... very fresh and stylized, not the standard TV dramedy fare. I'm gushing, I know.  This is GOOD TV.  OK, Nate and Brenda's constant cycle of blowing up and making up gets a little tiring, but that's really the only complaint that I have (other than the fact that Season 2 doesn't have a release date yet).
