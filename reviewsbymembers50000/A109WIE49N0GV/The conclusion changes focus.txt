 WAR AND REMEMBRANCE - THE FINAL CHAPTER is the conclusion of the trilogy that started with THE WINDS OF WAR and continues with WAR AND REMEMBRANCE VOLUME 1.  Unlike the first two parts of the story, the conclusion narrows in scope to focus much more on the lives of Natalie and Aaron, as well as Byron and Victor, leaving behind much of the epic saga of world war seen in the first two parts.  Even the bombing of Hiroshima is only mentioned in passing, while the story focuses on Byron's search for his son.  As was the case in Volume 1 of WAR AND REMEMBRANCE, the Holocaust is depicted with graphic reality, and can be quite painful to watch.  However, this is one of things that makes WAR AND REMEMBRANCE so important -- current and future generations need to see this reality, to make sure this can never happen again.  Why the two parts of WAR AND REMEMBRANCE are packaged separately is a mystery to me; both parts must be seen in order to get the whole story.  But the entire epic saga is well worth watching and re-watching, so I heartily endorse all parts of the story.
