 Like the other reviews here, this collection isn't EXACTLY a "greatest hits" collection.  For one thing, one of Shawn Colvin's best-known songs is "Nothing On Me," which was used as the theme song for the television series SUDDENLY SUSAN, but that song is not found here.  If being a TV theme song doesn't qualify as a "greatest hit," I'm not sure what would.  Other than that one exception, this really is a collection of Ms. Colvin's best-known work.  It's a great item for the casual fan or new listener (unless you're looking for the theme song to SUDDENLY SUSAN, of course), and if you're a completist you have to get it for the new song.  What could have made this package more attractive to all fans would have been to include some other rarities as bonus tracks, or even a second disc of odds & ends.  As it is, it's not her "best," nor is it a complete "greatest hits," but it is a good collection of great songs.
