 This is a true collectable for Sheena Easton fans -- her early greatest hits sung entirely in Spanish.  In 1984, I was eagerly awaiting the release of A PRIVATE HEAVEN, and so I would check the Sheena Easton bin at the record store every week.  One week this album with an unfamiliar cover turned up, and I flipped it over to look at the tracks.  All the song titles were in Spanish.  I figured I must have found a Mexican "best of" release (as many of the song titles appeared to be translations of familiar songs), but I was curious enough about it to buy it.  What a surprise when I got it home and played it!  Sheena had re-recorded many of her biggest hits in Spanish.  The tracks were re-recorded using the original instrumental backings, so they sound like the original hits, only with new vocals.  Her pronunciation is quite excellent for someone who said she didn't speak any Spanish; she must have had very good vocal coaching.  Most interesting about this collection is that three of the songs are songs she never recorded in English.  "Amame" is a lovely ballad.  "Una Vez en la Vida" is an uptempo dance track which could have fit right in on BEST KEPT SECRET had she recorded it in English (it is not, as another reviewer listed it, a Spanish version of "Take My Time").  The third original from this album is "Me Gustas Tal Como Eres," a duet with Luis Miguel.  This duet won Easton and Miguel a Grammy in 1984 for Best Mexican-America Performance.  All of these original songs were written by Juan Carlos Calderon.  This album was released on CD in several Spanish-speaking countries, including the United States, but it was not widely available in the U.S. outside of record stores specializing in Spanish-language music.  It went out-of-print many years ago, and has become one of the most sought-after items in the Sheena Easton catalogue.
