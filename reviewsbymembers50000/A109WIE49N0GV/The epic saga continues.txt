 WAR AND REMEMBRANCE picks up right where THE WINDS OF WAR left off.  Story-wise, part one of WAR AND REMEMBRANCE is every bit as good as THE WINDS OF WAR, too.  However, there are a number of major cast changes here which are a bit disconcerting.  The switch from Ali MacGraw to Jane Seymour is the one I found the most troubling; Jane Seymour may be a better actress overall, but her Natalie lacks the confidence and self-reliance of Ali MacGraw's Natalie.  The change from Gunter Meisner to Steven Berkoff as Hitler is also a bit of an adjustment, as is seeing Sharon Stone as Janice.  On the other hand, there are some improvements.  Hart Bochner is a better Byron than Jan-Michael Vincent, and Sir John Gielgud is truly amazing as Aaron Jastrow.  It does take some time to get used to seeing different actors in all these roles, especially if watched back-to-back with THE WINDS OF WAR.  Robert Mitchum, Polly Bergen, David Dukes and Victoria Tennant are all perfect in their roles, as they were the first time around.  Like THE WINDS OF WAR, WAR AND REMEMBRANCE is just a pleasure to experience, with an epic scope juxtaposed with the intimate details of the lives of the Henry and Jastrow families.  Dan Curtis does not shy away from the realities of war and the Holocaust here, and some scenes are visually and emotionally intense.  This only adds to the realism, though, and serves to make the story that much more compelling.  And, of course, Part 1 of WAR AND REMEMBRANCE is only part of the story -- the middle of the trilogy, so to speak.  Part 2 has to be seen in order to complete the story, which makes me wonder why both parts weren't simply packaged together for DVD.
