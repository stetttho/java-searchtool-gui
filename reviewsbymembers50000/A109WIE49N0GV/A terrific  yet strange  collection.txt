 This is an unusual compilation from Japan of Carpenters' material.  It all comes in a DVD-case-sized package, which has the cover of the GOLD DVD collection (as issued in the U.S.). Disc one is the collection called GOLD, as released in Europe in 2000.  Nothing new or different on it, just a great collection of 20 of their biggest hits.  Interestingly, while this CD/DVD set is a Japanese release, the Japanese version of GOLD differs from this version. Disc two is the CHRISTMAS PORTRAIT album, first released in 1978 but presented in its 1996 remix here.  It's exactly the same as disc one in the CHRISTMAS COLLECTION, right down to the printing on the disc itself. Disc three is the DVD.  It's exactly the same as the U.S. GOLD DVD (which was exactly the same as the earlier YESTERDAY ONCE MORE videotape).  However, this is a region 2 DVD, meaning it will not play in region 1 players, as we have in the U.S. The collection does not contain much by way of liner notes or photos.  There is a separate booklet that includes all the song titles and lyrics and a lot of stuff written in Japanese, but within the package itself is only a simple insert with a bare minimun of information. For the American buyer, this is really an item only for the completists, as all the songs/remixes have been heard before, and the DVD isn't playable here.
