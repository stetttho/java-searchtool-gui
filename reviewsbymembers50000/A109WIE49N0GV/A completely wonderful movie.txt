 FIELD OF DREAMS is truly one of the most wonderful movies I've ever seen.  It is a simple, honest, innocent film, unlike anything else made in the last 40 years.  It is perfectly suited for Kevin Costner's strengths, and  it is one of his best roles.  I envy anyone who is seeing it for the first  time, because the film keeps surprising you with more and more wonderful  turns as the end approaches.  Keep the tissues handy!
