 I'll admit, I bought this CD because Kristin Chenowth appears on it (she sounds fabulous, by the way!).  Turns out Daniel Rodriguez is a decent singer.  However, one listen to this CD is probably all it will ever get from me.  For starters, the choice of songs is horrendous.  It was as if a bunch of people got together and voted on the sappiest, most overblown, most tired songs ever written, and these were the top choices.  On top of that, the arrangements are completely unimaginative.  Several of these songs could have been saved by interesting arrangements, but apparently "boring" was the theme the arranger was seeking.  My biggest complaint, however, is about the production.  So much reverb has been added to Daniel's vocal as to almost obscure it.  Usually reverb like that is only used to cover up serious flaws in the performance, which doesn't seem to be the case here -- the vocals themselves seem fine.  That would indicate to me that it was justa a terrible choice made by the producer.  Adding to the production problems is the poor use of the stereo sound field in regard to the orchestra: a full orchestra can be used to create a rich and wide sound field quite easily, but the producer has chosen to mix most of the orchestra toward the center of the sound field, both burying it beneath the vocals and leaving the overall recording sounding like something more appropriate for AM radio than for the high-fidelity sound systems that have been in existence for, oh, the past 50 years.  I'm sure there is an audience for this sort of thing, but the flaws in the production and material make it something I cannot recommend.  Mr. Rodriguez would be well advised to bring on a new production team for future projects, because I think he really does have the talent to make a career out of his singing.
