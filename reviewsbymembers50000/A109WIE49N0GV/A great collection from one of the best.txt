 I admit, I'm biased -- I think Pat Benatar has one of the truly greatest voices in rock music history.  Her flexibility and range are phenomenal, and her power is simply amazing. What I like about this collection is that it shows off many of the sides to this spectacular talent.  For those who think of Ms. Benatar as just a "rocker-chick," this set will show you things you might not have encountered otherwise.  Diverse would be a good one-word summary of this set. The hits are well-represented here, along with some great album tracks, but this set also brings together quite a few rarities -- demos, songs from soundtracks and other collections, and some unreleased songs.  Not all the material is of the caliber of "Promises in the Dark" or "Love is a Battlefield," but Pat shines on each and every track. For fans of Pat Benatar, this is a must-own set.  Even the casual listener will find this set quite complete in its selection of songs they've heard on the radio, although with quite a bit of other stuff tossed in.  If you're only after the hits, I'd suggest you go with one of the single-disc hits collections, but if you're interested in the diversity and scope of Pat Benatar's career, this is the set to buy.
