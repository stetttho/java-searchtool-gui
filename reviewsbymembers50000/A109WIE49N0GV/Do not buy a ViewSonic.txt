 My ViewSonic PF790 quit working entirely when it was 7 months old -- my only option for repairing it was to return it directly to ViewSonic in California.  First there was the $80 shipping cost (the monitor weighs 55 pounds!), and then I heard nothing for weeks.  I contacted their customer service department, who told me that they had not received the monitor, even though I had proof of delivery from UPS -- two weeks before!  They then made excuses about being out-of-stock on replacement monitors amd promised to send one as soon as they could.  Several more weeks went by, and after three more phone calls to their customer service department, they finally shipped me a "new" monitor.  It turns out that the "new" monitor they shipped me was a reconditioned used monitor which has some big problems with the picture tube.  They told me I could return that one for another one (at my expense for the shipping, of course), but I decided to forget it.  So I'm spreading the word -- Viewsonic [is terrible] and their monitors aren't any better!  DO NOT BUY ViewSonic.  That's my advice.
