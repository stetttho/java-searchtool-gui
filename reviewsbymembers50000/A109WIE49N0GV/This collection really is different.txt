 Yes, this is yet another collection of the same hits, looking like SO many others before.  But it is actually different from earlier compilations. Many of the original Supremes' hits are presented in a way you've never heard before -- the songs are allowed to "play out" longer than the original mixes.  In some cases, this means a few more seconds of the song play before it fades out.  In other cases (notably "Stop! In the Name of Love" and "Back In My Arms Again"), as the music fades out at the end, the vocal track is kept at full volume, leaving the songs with an "a cappella" tag at the end.  And "You Keep Me Hangin' On" (the original, not the remix) and "Reflections" have actual endings that are totally different from the fade-outs heard in earlier mixes. Strangely, the liner notes don't mention any of these changes to the mixes. For those who keep track of these things, all the Supremes songs presented here are the stereo album versions, not the mono single mixes (which were sometimes different takes altogether).  I leave analysis of the post-1969 tracks to someone else, as I'm only really familiar with the work up through 1969... So for the Supremes collector, this is definitely a set worth buying.  For the casual fan who might not have a good hits collection, this is also a top-notch collection of their biggest hits (along with the top hits of Diana Ross).
