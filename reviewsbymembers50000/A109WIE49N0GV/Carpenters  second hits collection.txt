 This album is the follow-up to the hugely successful THE SINGLES: 1969-1973.  However, it doesn't have the strength or impact of that first collection.  The songs represented here were, for the most part, moderately successful singles ("Please Mr. Postman" is the only one of the bunch that reached #1 on the charts in the U.S.). Interesting to note is the fact that this album was never released in the United States (was A&M Records losing confidence in the Carpenters, or did Karen and Richard have something to do with this decision?). This collection is not as carefully crafted as the first one; THE SINGLES 1969-1973 contained newly-recorded segments which created introductions and segues between some of the songs, and other songs had new vocals recorded or instruments added in a remix to create a "new" sound for some songs.  The only thing different about THE SINGLES: 1974-1978 is the inclusion of the single version of "Can't Smile Without You," which has a modified lead vocal (Karen sings some different lyrics at the beginning) and a different instrumental mix.  Otherwise, it's just a collection of  songs that can be found elsewhere.
