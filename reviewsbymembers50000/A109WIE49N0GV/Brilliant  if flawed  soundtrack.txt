 This is by far my favorite movie soundtrack from the 1990s.  The combination of songwriting, production, and performance all comes together to create an amazing album.  Larry Klein truly captured the spirit of the Brill Building and the flavor of the productions of the '60s in a way that few others have been able to do.  Given that, this is a flawed soundtrack.  My reasons for finding it flawed are much the same as the other reviewers here -- there is a lot of material from the movie that is missing from the CD.  Kristen Vigard's version of "God Give Me Strength" is the most notable omission, and even though a recording of it can be found on another CD, it is shameful that the most important song of the movie was left off the CD.  (On the other side of that, I'm thrilled by Elvis Costello's version, and I'm glad it was included.)  It seems that this soundtrack could be made perfect by issuing a new, 2-CD version of the soundtrack, including all the other music from the film -- most importantly BOTH film versions of "God Give Me Strength," the solo version and full orchestral version.  Even with the flaws, this is still a fantastic soundtrack.  The tracks by For Real are especially good, sounding as close to a Motown or Phil Spector production as you could possibly get.
