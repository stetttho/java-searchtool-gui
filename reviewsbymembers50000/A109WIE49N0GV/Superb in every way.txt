 THE WINDS OF WAR is truly great television. Epic in scope and yet intimate at the same time, it draws you into the world of pre-war Europe and the lives of the Henry family. There is a perfect balance between history and fiction here, and both are totally compelling.    What makes this mini-series such a pleasure to watch are the performances by terrific actors. Almost every actor in this production is perfectly cast, most notably Polly Bergen as Rhoda Henry, David Dukes as Leslie Slote, and Victoria Tennant as Pamela Tudsbury. Robert Mitchum, Ali MacGraw and John Houseman are also terrific. The only shortcoming in the cast is Jan-Michael Vincent as Byron Henry; his acting skills just weren't quite at the level of the rest of the cast, and so he ends up seeming a little flat at times (especially in scenes with Ali MacGraw).    At 18 hours, this is quite a long show, but I found myself not wanting it to end. Of course, it doesn't end there -- there are 30 more hours to go in WAR AND REMEMBRANCE.  But THE WINDS OF WAR is a true pleasure to watch in and of itself. And you get a great history lesson about the events that led to the start of World War II.
