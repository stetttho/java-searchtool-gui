 This album stands out as being very different from the bulk of Dougie Maclean's recorded work -- and not necessarily in a good way.  It was the last of four albums he recorded for the Plant Life label, before he started his own label.  While there are several very good tracks on this album, there are also several synth-pop dance numbers that just don't sound anything like Dougie Maclean songs.  The record label was obviously pushing him to do something more "radio-friendly" for the early '80s, and instead it seems to have pushed him to leave the business of working for another label and start his own, where he would have total creative control.  For the casual listener, I would recommend buying albums from his own Dunkeld label before venturing into his early work.  But for the Dougie fanatic, this album is a must, if only to hear him doing something outside of his traditional genre.
