 Being a big fan of both Steve McQueen and Ali MacGraw, I recently got the DVD of "The Getaway." I was largely disappointed in the film -- it looks and feels very dated. Visually, I suppose it was meant to seem innovative at the time, but it looks like a lot of the bad movie-making of the early '70s now. And the soundtrack by Quincy Jones is remarkably amateurish-sounding.    My biggest complaint, however, is with the pacing of the film. The action sequences are top-notch, but when it slows down, it gets REALLY slow. It shifts gears this way several times, going from edge-of-your-seat excitement to falling-asleep boredom.    This film had potential that it failed to live up to, and although the actors in it are superb, they are not directed well. Check out "The Thomas Crown Affair" or "The Great Escape" for far better McQueen.
