 This is a strange Christmas CD -- many of the songs are not "traditional" Christmas songs, but that's where some of the true gems are found.  Mary Chapin Carpenter's track, "Bells Are Ringing," is one of the greatest songs she has ever recorded, and yet it has never appeared on any of her albums.  Shawn Colvin's track, "I Don't Need Anything This Christmas," is also an extremely good song.  These two tracks alone make this CD worth the price, especially given the fact that the Shawn Colvin track has never appeared ANYWHERE else.  For any fan of Mary Chapin Carpenter or Shawn Colvin, this CD is a must-own.
