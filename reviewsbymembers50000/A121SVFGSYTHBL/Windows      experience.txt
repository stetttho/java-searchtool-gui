 This game is so good and UBI Soft is so bad! Based on the other reviews, I decided to take a leap of faith and purchase this game for use on a Windows 2000 OS. Of course, UBI Soft says, explicitly, that they do not support Windows 2000 or XP. But, that's usually legalese to deny liability. Sure enough, Chessmaster 8000 works on my Windows 2000 system even though the install program put DirectX 7a on my system. (When the install was finished, Windows informed me that it was an old version and would not run on Windows 2000.) Nonetheless, I tried running the program and it worked fine. For good measure, I went to the Microsoft Web site and downloaded DirectX 8.1 and installed it. No noticeable change, but I feel better. BTW, do *NOT* install the patch available from UBI Soft Web site. It's an old version 1.0.3 and the CD is 1.0.4. The install patch goes so fast though (without informing you that you're about to install over a newer version) so that I had to un-install and re-install CM8000 to get back to 1.0.4. There's a lot of nitpicky details (such as being unable to turn off the voice that reads the tutorial), but there's a lot of good stuff, too. The graphics are phenomenal. The tutorials are great. And there are a ton of computer opponents to choose from so that you don't get your butt whipped every time you play. All in all, it's a great game, but be prepared to be annoyed by quirks.
