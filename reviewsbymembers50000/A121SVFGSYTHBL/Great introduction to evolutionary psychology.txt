 This is a wonderful book. Ridley is an engaging writer and his book is hard to put down. The content and presentation are flawless. For other interesting books on evolutionary psychology, I also recommend "The Moral Animal" and "Survival of the Prettiest." Unfortunately, Ridley's thesis, to prove that virtues are genetic, is flawed. To be honest, I couldn't pick this up on my own, but after finishing Ridley's book, I read an article in the Boston Review by H. Allen Orr that laid waste to Ridley's thesis. Nonetheless, I wouldn't have understood the argument had I not read Ridley's book. Therefore, I recommend this book as a great introduction to the debate over their source of altruism.
