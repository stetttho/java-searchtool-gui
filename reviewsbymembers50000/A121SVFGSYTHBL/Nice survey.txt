 What's nice about this survey (or any survey) is that you're bound to find half the essays good and half bad with one or two essays that are spot on. Personally, I think the key to enjoying this book is to skip the sections that you don't click with -- though I have to say I wanted to skip the exerpt from A Savage God and I'm glad I didn't. This book is also interesting if you're a writer since it offers so many different writing styles. Sort of reminds me of an episode of, I think, Sesame Street in which two painters rendered the same tree. Here, different writers render their own version of a similar emotion, depression. Definitely worth reading.
