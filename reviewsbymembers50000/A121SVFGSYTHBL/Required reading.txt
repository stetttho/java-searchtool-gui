 It's a cliche that justice belongs to the rich, but this book demonstrates that sometimes money isn't the only factor. People -- to an depressing extent -- are, as the expression goes, only human. The amount of dishonesty and self-deception -- only blatant in the last hundred pages or so -- is thoroughly disheartening. I can only hope that Skinner, Facher, Jacobs, Riley, and a few others read this book with shame and humiliation; but I imagine that they only read it with anger and indignation. The true crime in my mind, however, is that this type of mockery of justice -- the human error of refusing to own up to your own mistakes -- probably occurred during the 2000 presidential elections. Reading this book now, I would have hoped that we, as a society, had learned something. We apparently didn't, which makes it even more important for more people to read this book.
