 I tend to agree with the previous reviews. Seth has definitely tapped into a great idea, but I think the free portion he provides is sufficient for you to get a sense of the book. Unlike "The Tipping Point," Seth does not breakdown the structure of the idea virus as effectively and therefore his book is not as educational. However, as I pointed out in my review of "The Tipping Point," this is not easy stuff to figure out. There is no step-by-step directions and if you intend to practice it, I recommend Seth's book, "The Tipping Point," "Anatomy of Buzz," and "Crossing the Chasm" to get your brain thinking in the right direction.
