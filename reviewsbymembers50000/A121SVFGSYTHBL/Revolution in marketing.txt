 I disagree with the previous review. Although he, or she, summarized the book's core concept very well, the epidemic theory is difficult to turn into a step-by-step guide. Therefore, the numerous examples are necessary to help the reader brainstorm ways of creating his or her own epidemic. This book has a similar thesis as "Anatomy of Buzz" and "Unleashing the IdeaVirus," but I think it does the best job of breaking down the structure of an epidemic. The fact that these three books are appearing at the same time suggests to me that a marketing revolution is afoot and I, for one, plan to start up a PR agency to help companies take advantage of this new idea.
