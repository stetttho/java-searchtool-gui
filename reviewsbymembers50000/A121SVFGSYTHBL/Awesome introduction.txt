 Most history books that I have read have far too few maps to help you visualize the events that you're reading about. Moreover, these books do not provide a quick overview so that you can appreciate the long-term trends and the significance of some arcane details. This book solves both problems. It is extremely simplistic with few details, but provides maps (thank you) and an overview of the major trends (thanks again). If you plan to study any aspect of the 20th century in detail, start with this book first. FYI, this book is actually just the last chapter (of 6) taken from "Atlas of World History" by the same author. If you're concerned about portability, then buy this lightweight volume. Otherwise, get the entire book, which starts at 10,000 BC and runs through the present -- and only costs $20. It's an INCREDIBLE bargain!
