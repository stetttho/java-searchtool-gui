 Let's be honest. Buying -- and more importantly, reading -- a book by an unknown/firstime author is scary. Is it worth the investment? In our culture, we are taught that the cream is supposed to rise to the top. Yet, we all know about the hidden jewels that, for one reason or another, don't attract the attention that they should. This is that hidden gem. I read this book because I took a writing class with the author. Several students read the book during the term and raved about it, but I remained reluctant. (Not sure why, but I was.) A few months after the class, though, I decided to pick up the book and read it. And I was not disappointed. "The Tender Land" is a true story about the author's attempt to deal with the suicide of her brother. Although nobody in my family or circle of friends has committed suicide, I was still able to sympathize with the author and thoroughly enjoyed reading her story. Not only is there a good story here, but the writing is interesting, too. Finneran's writing style reminds me of Ellen Degeners: she keeps going off on tangents, but does it in a way that is entertaining AND compelling.
