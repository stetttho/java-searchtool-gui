 ...The problem is that this books seems like it was written for high school students. The first chapter opens with a self-diagnosis: "I clarify the group's goals and ensure that the goals are formulated so members 'sink or swim' together and are committed to achieve them." Or how about, "I advocate my views and challenge the views of others in order to create high-quality and creative decions." It never gets better. On page 231, for example, in the chapter "Using Power," the authors state, "Even though we sometimes do not like to admit it, power is a basic aspect of social life. It can be seized or given up, increased or lost. It can be used for good, evil, or trivial purposes. All relationships -- with family, friends, lovers, co-workers -- involve power and influence. Yet many person are unaware of the influence they exert on others, and many people are unaware of how necessary and constructive mutual influence is in building effective groups and collaborative relationships among members. Being skillful in influencing other group members and taking responsibility for such influences are important parts of being a member of a group." Ya think? The book goes on to identify "the process by which group members mobilize their power in order to accomplish their goals..." Each "action item" is followed by a paragraph of fluff just in case the heading isn't clear enough (not included here): 1. Determining Your Goals.  2. Assessing Your Relevant Resources.  3. Determining Your Needed Coalitions. 4. Negotiating a Mutual Support Agreement. 5. Implementing the Contracts.  I was really disappointed with this book because I was hoping for a book that analyzed the psychology of group behavior and offered practical rules based on that analysis. This book, however, is just too shallow to accomplish that. I imagine it was written for undergraduates, but I would think that even a sophmore would feel insulted.
