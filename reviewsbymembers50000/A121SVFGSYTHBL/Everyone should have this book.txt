 I first purchased Haywood's "Atlas of the 20th Century" and later came across this full edition at a local...[store]. While the 20th century version is more portable, this book is the whole enchilada for a bargain price.  As the earlier reviews point out, this books is phenomenal. It is gorgeous and extraordinarily detailed. And, as also pointed out, the book gives fair coverage to other parts of the world, even detailing small civilizations like those in the pacific islands and Americas before European civilization had arrived. My only criticism of the book is not even a fair criticism: the accompanying text is helpful but too short and modular to create an engaging story narrative. For that, I recommend "World History for Dummies" as an accompanient -- a good, but not great, book.  "Atlas of World History," however, is great. Even at twice the price it would still be a bargain.
