 Many of the reviews stated that this book was an easy read. Personally, I found it difficult. The content is fascinating, but poorly organized. Moreover, I've found Matthew Ridley's writings (Origins of Species, Red Queen) to be more fluid while Robert Wright's (The Moral Animal) are wittier. Etcoff is -- I don't know, but her writing style just isn't compelling. My biggest complaint is Etcoff's penchant for name dropping and quoting. Occassionaly, it works and enriches the perspective on beauty, but many other times, it just seems to be irrelevant and redundant. That said, I'm doubly confused with some of the conclusions other reviewers came to about the book's content. For example, one reviewer said, "men will select women who look like x and have waist-to-hip ratio y etc. because this will be better for reproduction." Etcoff didn't say this at all. She argues that beauty is an adapted evolution mechanism and so, our ancestors (mainly men) sought out beauty because IN THE PAST it provided a better-then-average method for finding fertile mates.  In fact, Etcoff writes, "A woman's peak fertility is between the ages of twenty and twenty-four and remains near peak throughout her twenties. By the end of her thirties, a woman's fertility has declined by 31%, and after that fertility declines much more steeply. Usually by her early fifties a woman has reached menopause. Things are very different for males, who can father a baby naturally at age ninety-four. There is no visible sign of a good sperm carrier, at least no one has found one." All in all, I think the book is worth reading, but I wish it was written better.
