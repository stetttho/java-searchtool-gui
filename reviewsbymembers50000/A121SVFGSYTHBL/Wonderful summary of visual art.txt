 I can't believe nobody has rated this book yet. I came across it many years ago and came back to Amazon to purchase a copy for my younger sister. I'm getting it for her because it's a wonderful survey of Impressionism, Postimpressionism, Fauvism, Cubism, Abstractionism, Dadaism, Surrealism, Abstract Expressionism, Pop art, and Op Art (all Chapter titles). If these terms already mean something to you, then the book is probably too simplistic. But, if they confuse and mean nothing, then this is a good introduction.
