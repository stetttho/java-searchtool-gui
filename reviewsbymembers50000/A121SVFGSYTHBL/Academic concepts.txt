 I've only been able to read through the first 3 chapters of this book because it's written in a very dry, academic style. While it brings up a lot of interesting issues that affect VC's, it's done from an  economic/academic perspective. For example, it describes 3 different  categories of covenants that restrict VC partners (overall fund management,  activities of the general partners, and restrictions on the types of  investments). But, rather than offer case studies on how these covenants  play out in the development of the fund, it delves into statistical  correlation of these covenants with different fund variables (such as size,  rate of growth, and age of venture). It's probably fascinating stuff if  you're an economist, but I'm not sure it's that helpful to anyone who's  setting up a fund or is interested in working for a fund.
