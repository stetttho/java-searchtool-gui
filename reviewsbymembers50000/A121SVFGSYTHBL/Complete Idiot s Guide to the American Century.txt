 I picked up this book because I'm studying the Middle East conflict and wanted a general overview of what was happening in the rest of the world in the 20th century. This book did not help. The author admits, in several places, that this book was written from an American perspective for an American reader -- and he should have added -- who is studying American history. If you're using this as background supplement for eventual study of American history, this book may help (though I would recommend "A People's History of the US" instead).  If, however, you're studying any other region around the world, this book puts too much emphasis on American events and too little emphasis on the rest of the world.
