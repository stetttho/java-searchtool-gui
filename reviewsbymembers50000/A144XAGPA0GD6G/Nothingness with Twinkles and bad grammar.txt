 The Book of the LAw is perhaps one of the most beautiful, and incomprensible books I've ever read.  I'm compelled to believe that Crowley really did recieve his message from the Angel Aiwaiss.  Crowley was such a master of letters that he rejected this book simply on the basis that its grammer and general development of ideas was horrible from a strict, editorial standpoint.  In any case, wheter you buy this argument or not, read this book.  Read it without "lust for result", then read the commentaries in both The Law is For all, and the Equninox of the Gods.  Eventually it will all start to come clear.
