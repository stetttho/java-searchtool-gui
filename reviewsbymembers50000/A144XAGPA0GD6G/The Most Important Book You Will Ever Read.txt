 In this book Starhawk somehow managed to put together everything I've ever  thought or felt.  She intertwines the aspects of our culture that are  designed to make us slaves and gives them a name. This book was, for me,  the AHA! experience so many occultists speak of.  I had a copy of it that I  had highlighteted extensivly.  Now, as I prerpare to replace it, I realize  that if I highlighteted evwrything important, I would highlight the whole  book.
