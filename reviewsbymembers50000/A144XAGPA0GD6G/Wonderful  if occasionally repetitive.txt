 This book is based on a very simple idea, one which seems almost like a Copernican inversion.  That is, the Universe is intellegent enough to keep a billion trillion stars or more spinning in heavens and a billion trillion cells in every organism on this planet in working harmony.  Therefore, its probably intellegent enough to solve your problems.  Chopra explains the process of becoming sensitive to this greater intellegence, and allowing it to work through you.  He uses seven laws, though these laws seem to be more conventions for division that actual principles.  In truth, they really all blend together.  The interrelatedness of the different sections leads to a repetitive feeling that can give the impression that you've read a passage before,which may cause you to skip the paragraph and thus miss a new point that has been made.  This is only the real drawback to the book.  Otherwise, I wouldn't hesitate to reccomend this book to anyone interested in finding deeper solutions to their worries.
