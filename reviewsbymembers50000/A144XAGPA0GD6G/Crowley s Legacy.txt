 The Holy books of Thelema stand quite apart from the technical works Crowley wrote throughout his life.  They were "received" or channeled if you will, rather than developed by Crowley's ego (by which I mean his mortal psyche).  Every Liber is a gem, proving to anyone who reads them with an open mind that Crowley was a true prophet.   Within you will find not only the Book of the Law, but the Liber Lapis Lazuli and the Book of the Heart Gird Round by the Serpent.  The latter is a spiritual masterpiece equal to Liber AL.   I reccomend that the Holy Books be read slowly, perhaps a passage at a time.  That way, they'll sink in.
