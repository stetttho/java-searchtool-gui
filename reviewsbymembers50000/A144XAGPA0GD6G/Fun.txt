 This story of a San Francisco governess and a magician turned werewolf is an entertaining blend of magic and love.  Lacky manages to steer clear of the Disneyfication that could have cropped up in the tale.  Alongside the archetypal fairy tale are Chinatown whorehouses and the genral squaller of the seedier part of San Fransisco circa the early 2oth century.   Recomended for those times when your head has been buried in Crowley for three weeks and feels as though its about to explode!
