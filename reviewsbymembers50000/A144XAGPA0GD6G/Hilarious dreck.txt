 Bob Larson is the funniest man on television.  An impotent Cotton Mathers with greasy skin and sleazball suit, he trumpets his gospel of paranoia to a captive audience (most of his parishoners undoubtedly having come from a mental hospital).   This book follws the grand tradition of Montegue Summers and Hal Lindsay.  Meaning that its a mix of misinformation and fictions arising from a psyche that would make a Freudian scream with delight.  Witness the demoniac origin of masturbation illucidated in this massive slander, and see what I mean.   Page after page of this book is an insult to every religion besides the authors own.  Buddhism, Hinduism, Wicca, and yes, Satanism are all flagrently misrepresented.  Larson's exploits among his wicked quaries  are enough to make Max Weber give up anthropology and take up coin collecting.  Has the man never heard of "valueless anthropology"?   Recomended for a good laugh, after which it should be promptly consigned to the flames of a Solstice needfire.
