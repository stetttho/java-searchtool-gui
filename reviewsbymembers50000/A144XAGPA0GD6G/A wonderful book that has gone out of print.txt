 It is a shame that this book had to go out of print.  In many ways, this book picks up where Ellen Cannon Reeds "Witch's Kabbalah" leaves off.   The Tree of Life is given a Goddess centered spin that makes perfect sense if you think about it.  The discussion of the four worlds is tied together with the Middle Pillar exercise, whuch is the best way to illustrate the concept.  Best of all, this book contains practices which will lead up to actual Pathworkings.  The book is difficult (probably the reason for its low sales) but worth pursuing if you want to tie your Craft to the Kabbalah.  Look around; if you really need the book, it will find you.
