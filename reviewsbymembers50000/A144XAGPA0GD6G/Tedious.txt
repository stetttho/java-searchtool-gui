 While this book is useful, both as a psychological survey and as a guide for astologial planning, its over all feel is one of pure tedium.  Gone is Crowley's deft use of the English language.  The editing is slight, to preserve the content of writing not intended for publication.   These diaries reflect what was actually the downward slope of Crowley's life.  The Abbey at Cefalu is dissolving.  His relationship with the most intense Scarlet Woman has gone sour.  Crowley's physical health has gone down hill as well. We learn more about the Mega Therion's bowel movements, lung problems, and drug addiction than we ever wanted to know.  The tone of the diaries is one of depression and struggle.  There's even a contemplation of sucide.   Perhaps those pencil pushers of the occult world, the Gematriasts, will find Crowley's endless calculations interesting.  For those of of not so inclined, they are laborious reading.  They do, however, show Crowley's fantastic ability to relate everything to the Law of Thelema.  The intepretations of the I Ching are also interesting, and give us an idea of how Crowley's inner senses worked.   This volume is only recomended for people seriously interested in Crowley as a person, as well as the Mega Therion, Bophomet, ect ad nauseum.
