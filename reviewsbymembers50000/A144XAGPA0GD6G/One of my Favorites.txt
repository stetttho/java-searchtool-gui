 This book has been a favorite of mine since I first read it at the age of 15 (it was the 10th SK book I'd read by that time.)  The plot is complex, and the manner King uses to tell it is very different from what some are used to.  Once you realize how he's threading evrything together, it all sings beautifully.  Read this book.  Many times
