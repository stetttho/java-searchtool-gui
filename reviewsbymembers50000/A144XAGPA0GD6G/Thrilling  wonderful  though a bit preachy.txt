 This book is one of the few to reveal the Spirit of the Arthur legen, the spirit of Avalon.  This is a very real place, if you know how to get there.  The great strength of this book is that it makes you want to.  However, I would actually take off half a star for the heavy handedness that permeates the conflict between Augistinian Christainity and British Paganism.  In places it slows down a book which some readers may find is overlong to begin with.  For those who like to live with their books for awhile, Mists of Avalon is a treasure, dispite its flaws.
