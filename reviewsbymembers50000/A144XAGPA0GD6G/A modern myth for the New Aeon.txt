 Thou art God.  That is the message of this book.  It is a truth so alien to our culture that it may as well have come from Mars, and so Heinlein personifies it as a Martian/Human name Velentine Michael Smith.  Embedded in a delightful story is some very indulgent propaganda that, for all its didacticism, is thrilling.  One leaves the book feeling empowered, as though they have been reborn.   To be read at least once a year, preferably around the Spring Equinox.
