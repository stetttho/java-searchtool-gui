 (actually, 31/2 stars)   The story of Mr. Crowley is one of the most poinant tragedies I've ever come across.  Niechze's descent into madness is the only adequate paralell I know of.  Madness would have been a kinder punishment for the Beast.  He had to live out his life in total awareness of his pain.  A great magus he was, but his Vision was to big for the small Victorian ego it inhabited.  Crowley was unable to overcome his arisitcratic training, and thus his revelation became as poison unto him.   In a Just-the-facts biography, Lawrence Sutin chronicles the Tragedy of the Beast.  The work is  well done, doing its best to avoid rumor and vitriol condemnation.  Much of the information comes from Crowley's own diaries and the words of the people who knew him.  I also appriciated the fact that Sutin does not end with any sort of Asopian Moral to the Story.  The tale provides its own moral as the reader interprets it.   There are a few stylistic problems, however, marr what is otherwise a wonderful book.  First, Sutin throws around terms like Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram without suspecting that some readers might not know what he's talking about.  Throughout, he assumes a primer knowledge of the rites of Ceremonial Magick that the reader may not posees.  Also, his endnotes are confusing and referance to them hampers the flow of reading.   I recomend this book for any who want to understand the Master Therion.  It is a tragedy on par with Promethius.
