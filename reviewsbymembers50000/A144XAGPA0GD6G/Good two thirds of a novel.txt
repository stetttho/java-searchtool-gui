 The Inheritor is an early attempt at occult fiction of the type that came to fruition in books such as Ghostlight.  All things considered, this is a good idea for a novel.  The problem is, it needs about a hundred extra pages to resolve all the character development and side plots that Bradley builds up.      The story centers around a psychotherapist named Leslie and her sister, Emily.  Leslie has been experiencing psychic phenomena before the story begins, and "The Unseen" seems to be tracking her down.  She buys a house in San Francisco (the book was written in 1984, before the idea of a normal person buying a house in San Francisco would have been the most fantastic element of the story) which happens to be a vortex of occult power.  The place was owned by another psychologist, an occultist named Alison Musgrave who died without training a succsessor.  The reason she didn't train a successor is because the person who would have filled that role, a musician named Simon, had a nasty habit of sacrificing cats and junkies in the garage.  Leslie is, of course, sleeping with Simon.  These could have been the ingredients of a very good book, if Bradley were to follow through.  However, so much is left unfinished that the novel feels like a Persian carpet with a thousand frayed ends.   I enjoyed The Inheritor, I only wish Bradley had seen fit to finish it before sending it to her publisher.
