 The work of H.P Lovecraft always makes me wish one thing:  that the "beings hidious beyond description" would just rise up and take over!  That way we could finally put a rest to all these arrogant, racist academics who have nothing better to do that poke their noses in other peoples (admittedly strange) business.  Another thing I dislike (as hinted above) is Lovecraft's CONSTANT use of the literary cop-out that is "it was horrible beyond description."  DESCRIBE IT ANYWAY!!  This phrase, or something like it pops up in nearly every story in this volume.  To begin with, from what I can tell, they aren't all THAT horrible.  Just kind of fishy.  Secondly, it cheating.  I gave this book 3 stars because its still fun, even if it does get on your nerves initially.
