 The Kybalion is a little book that does nothing less than tie up every loose end you can think of.  Within its pages the root of all religion and philosophy is put forth in simple language that neither obfuscates or spoonfeeds.   The book is a tretis on the seven Hermetic Laws of Mind, Polarity, Gender, Causatiion, Rhythm, Correspondence, and Vibration.  These seven laws are a part of every religion in some form or another.  They also form the bedrock of the Mystery Tradition.  To understand them is to unravel the discrepencies between different schools of occultism.   The Kybalion can be read in an hour.  However, a better method would be to read it once a week, or month, or whenever you can spare that hour.  You will find something new every time, since the Mysteries grow with you.   This is an essential text.  Without it, you will be lost in a world of myriad methods and uter nonsense.
