 Dora Von Gelder Kunz here presents her experience of the world of fairy.  In almost anthropological detail she describes different kinds of fairies and the angels that guide them.  All the descriptions contain personal anecdotes of the author's own contact with the realm that lies just in the corner of our eyes.   Now, of course Von Gelder could be making all this up.  If she is, then this work is a startling work of detailed imagination.  If she's not, then we would do well to heed her words.  Either way, this book is a delightful way to awaken one's wonder of the natural world.  Forget "science" for a moment, and open your heart.
