 Raven Grimassi has given us a book which does something few books ever do.  He actually explains the HErmetic Mysteries in SIMPLE, DIRECT LANGUAGE YOU CAN UNDERSTAND!  However, there are times when he seems to contradict himself, which I imagine is the fault of Llewellen's bad editing.  Also, in explaining the passage of power from one plane to another, he uses a metaphor which assumes that the hierarchies of our society are somehow mirrors of an Astral Hierarchy.  Other than a few little glitches, the book is very informative, thought mainly for experienced practitioners. Beginners might get a bit confused.
