 Ms. Watson's book is a wonderful step by step guide to creating a ritual.  There are plenty of annecdotes-always appreciated in occult books, where the author can come off as damn near godlike if they don't watch themselves.  Watson's reasoning is easily understood, and the exercises constructed in a logical manner.  Overall, this is an exxelent book.   There are however, 3 flaws that stuck out at me when I read the book.  One is relativley minor, the other two could cause major problems if the reader is not aware of them before hand.   First, the minor one.  Watson's footnotes are in chaos.  There is no regular pattern to their placement, and in one case they repeat themselves.  It really very distracting.   One of the major flaws is that Watson references the Chakra system, in one case relying heavily on it, without giving the reader an overview of the subject.  She just jumps right into them, with only the barest idea given as to how the system works. I would recomend Anodea Judtih's Wheels of Light as a good introduction to a very complex system.   The other problem is the personality test that gets quite a lot of mileage in the book.  THe test itself is slightly confusing, and I often ended up picking the respnse that was closest to what I actually thought, rather than the one that resonated with my spirit.  Many of the answers seemed to be the same anwser, in my opninion.  While I feel that the assesment given by the test is more or less accurate, I don't quite trust it.  Certainly not enough to base work with elementals on.  And Watson is pretty clear about the dangers of working with elementals that go against your nature.   Other than these tow considerations, the book is excellent.  Anyone interested in ritual magic should read it at least once.
