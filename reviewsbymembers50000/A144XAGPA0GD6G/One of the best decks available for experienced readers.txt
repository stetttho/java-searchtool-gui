 If you have at least three years of experience with reading one of the many Rider-Waite based decks and want something a bit more challenging, Crowley's Thoth deck is one of the best around.   Crowley departs from the Waite-style decks in several areas.  Certain cards are given different numbers and names.  Strength, for instance, becomes Lust,Temperance is Art, and Justice is Adjustment.  The concept of reversals is replaced by Elemental Dignities, which leads to more nuanced readings.   The system of attributes is based on the Kabbalah, so experience or knowledge of this is helpful as well.  Crowley uses a Golden Dawn derived system of correspondence, but departs from this by moving the Star, as per his communication with Awaiss.   Lady Frieda Harriss' surrealistic artwork perfectly compliments Crowley's wild spiritual vision.  Many of the cards contain not situations, but totally abscract representations.  This makes the deck more useful for deep spiritual readings than for bread and butter divination.  A perfect deck for esoteric contemplation or pre-ritual divination.
