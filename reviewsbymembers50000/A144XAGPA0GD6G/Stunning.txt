 In the "White Goddess", Robert Graves speaks of true poetry as that which sends chills up your spine because it clearly has divine origins.  While Graves' work does not meet that standard, "Innana" more than does so.   With the fist stanza, "In the first days, in the very first days, in the first weeks, in the very first weeks, in the first years, in the very first years", you enter a primal Dreamtime where the the Goddess exists as a real being made tangible by enchanting words.  It takes a true poet to translate words from a dead language into a modern one and have them retain their effect.  Wolkstein does this with grace and power.   The imagery of the tales and hymns themselves is lush, erotic, and real.  I reccomend this book for anyone interested in finding a sacred text that opens up a living channel to the Goddess.
