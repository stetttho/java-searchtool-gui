 Taort Journey's represents, in my opinion, a watershed in the creative talents of Miss Galenorn.  The meditations in this book are deeply evocative, channeling the ture essence of every card.   The author does not merely stop at one deck.  She uses several to glean the material for the meditations.  In the HIgh Priestess we see shades of Crowley.  The Empress draws upon more Pagan decks.  The meditations build on eachother, so that they really exist as an entire Quest.   Tarot Journeys includes a CD with two of the meditations recorded by a professional voice actor.  These are wonderful, and one only wishes the entire book had been treated thus.   For anyone seeking to know the Tarot, this book is delightful.  Even if you couldn't care less about cartomancy, the Fool's Journey will evoke the Deepr nature within you.
