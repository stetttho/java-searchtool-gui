 For those of us with a certain relationship to the Moon, this book is a treasure.  Fortune's theme is expressed vividly and wonderfully in this book about the unveiling of the hidden nature in men and women.  The initiation sequence leaves me breathless everytime.  Of course, there's also about 50 pages left after that, which makes the book feel uneven.  Also, the class and race attitudes of the 1930's are apparent in some minor passages.  Don't let the fact that the bbok was written in by a bourgiose professional in the 30's deter you-this is truly a wonderful book.
