 This book is totally indespensable for anyone interested in the Practical Kabbalah.  I only regret that I purchased three books which covered different aspects of the material contained in this volume without checking out the "Garden" first.  Don't make the same mistake.  Most modern texts are versions of bits and pieces of this one.   The editors' contribution, which constitutes half of the edition, contains practical meditations that illuminate the different paths beautifully.  There are also instructions for Scrying in the Sprit Vision and actual pathworking.  I only wish all modern writers on the Kabbalah took the approach the Ciceros do.  That is, taking an existing classic, adding footnotes to clear up confusion, then giving practical suggestions for its usage.  This is much better than the typical proccedure of throwing together a cribbed version of ohter's work and passing it off as your own.   Highly, highly reccomended.
