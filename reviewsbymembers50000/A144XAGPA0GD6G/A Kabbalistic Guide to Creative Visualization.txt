 While it is never explcitly stated, this book provides a Kabbalistic guide to creative visualization.  Its theory comes out of the concept of the Four Worlds on the Tree of Life.  For those familiar with that theory, this book puts this powerful technique in a framework they already understand.  For those unfamiliar, it should still work incredibly well.   The wonder of the Four Worlds is that the idea is so common sense that the authors never even directly mention it.  They lay out progressive  techniques which access each level of Mind without dwelling on heavy occult theory.  In other words, this book is useful to everyone, regaurdless of whether or not you know what the Ruach is.   The book basically takes you through the formative stages of daydreaming, on to planning, concrete visualization, and charging with Divine power.  There is also a quikie technique called "the Star" which helps with matters of immediate concern.  The Master Technique, as they call it, could easily be modified for use with the Middle Pillar or similar Kabbalistic Exercise.   I'm very impressed with Denning and Phillips in general, and this book is another example of how woderful their work is.
