 "Historical"  is not, perhaps, the best way to describe this book.  The stories use different time periods as their settings, with the preponderance of them focusing on either the Victorian period in England or France during and after the "Terror".  Most of these are quite good.  One of the best stories, however, is the tale entitled simply "Garden".  This story goes all the way back to the Garden of Eden (not an historical period, but never mind).  "Garden" is deliciously heretical, with hints of sexual awakening.   The book turns inevitably to sadomasichism.  This is due to the fact that one can only write their favorite words for genitalia so many times.  Some of the stories are merely poorly drawn character studies where the author takes forever to get to the real business of erotica, if they ever do.  Some of the tales fail to meet the "wet test" altogether.   Recomended, as long as you don't mind skipping stories.
