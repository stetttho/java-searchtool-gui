 Hakim Bey borrows from Situationism, dada, the occult, and a few other sources to create Ontological Anarchism.  The result is a very strange and very wonderful pattern for a revolution that starts now.  Bey is not interested in whether the dialectic has reached its head.  This is a personal revolt, an insurrection in everday life.      The first section deals with Poetic Terrorism, an extension of Situationist praxis beyond street theatre.  Basically, any action taken against the spectacle fits into this, but especially those aimed at institutions of misinformation.  The second part is comosed of broadsheets detailing everything from surrealism to black magick.  The third is TAZ proper, or improper as the case may be.  Bey includes some fascinating information on pirate utopias and the lost Roanoke colonies that were almost certainly left out of your high school history book.    The book does not so much suggest techniques as it does evoke a spirit of revolt.  This is anarchy for those who like their insurrections occult and their politics way outside the mainstream.
