 In Promethues Rising, Robert Anton Wilson tells you how to alter your brain in a positive fashion.  He teaches you to see the world differently, though not neccasarily his way.  What he has done is written a book which demonstrates how the human miund can be either used for freedom or slavery.  The choice is up to us.    Using Leary's model of the Eight Circuit nervous system Wilson explain such things as patriotism, brainwashing, and morality.  He then systematically shows you how to brainwash yourself for fun and profit.  The exercises are the main benefit of the book.  This is taking into account all the uselful information he provides on each circuit, along with corespondences to the Tarot and James Joyce.    Wilson's hopeful outlook and crazy sense of humor keep the book moving through material that could, in the hands of a less skillfull writer, be hard to wade through.  The only danger is that some readers might mistake his light hearted approach as a sign that he can't be taken seriously.    Really, the world has gone through enough blunders and attempt to change it "for the better".  The answer is to change yourself first, then reach out to others.  This book is one way of beginning that process.
