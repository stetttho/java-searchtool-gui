 Lon DuQuette has a talent for making things like the writings of Aleister Crowley almost make sense.  With "Understanding Aleister Crowley's Thoth Tarot", DuQuette continues his project of demystifying the difficult but critical body of literature left behind by the Beast. The current work includes an introduction to the Rose Cross design that is worth the price of the book in itself.  There is also a brief overview of Crowley's life and work.  This latter is somewhat superficial, but any biography of Crowley is bound to be incomplete.  DuQuette then goes over each card in turn, bringing the lofty metaphysics of the Book of Thoth down to earth.   His formula for understanding the small cards is a good example of this.  Apply it, and you should be able to memorize and internalize the cards at a much faster rate. This book was written both for people with no interest in Crowley, and for those who wish to understand the Beast better.  As such, it has to make a few concessions that it might not have if it had been written exclusively for magicians.  Some of the more sexual aspects of Crowley's doctrines are toned down a bit, for example. This is only a deterrent for those who wish to keep Crowley in a box, along with their honorary degrees, suitable for framing.  The rest of us will profit immeasurably from DuQuette's hacking through the thicket of Victorian prose to expose the roots and blossoms.
