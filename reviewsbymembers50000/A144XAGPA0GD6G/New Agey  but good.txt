 The Way of The Wizard takes the reader through a 20 step program to induce a relaxed, aware state of being from which true magic can arise.  The practices are equal to any sytem of meditation or yoga, and followed through to the end "without lust of result" (Crowley, not Chopra) will bring about the sate of being described.   That being said, the book has the obvious flaw of New Age oversimplifation.  THe natural paralells with the occult are watered down for the bourgoise audience.  The use of Merlin is mythologically absurd.  This is acceptable in the context of this work, however, since it is not intended as a tretis on Merlin.  Rather, Merlin is used as an archetype of fulfillment and mastery of life.   Recommended with reservations.
