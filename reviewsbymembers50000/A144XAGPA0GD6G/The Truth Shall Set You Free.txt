 Pagel's book is one of the most lucid expositions of early Christianity available to the general reader.  In this work she goes step by step through the four cannonical gospels to show how the Christian Devil evolved into a unifying symbol of hatred. Her tretis is not really nuetral, but in light of the Inquisition, the 700 Club, and Bob Larson, nuetrality would be the sign of a numbed psyche.  If nothing else, Pagels shows how the concept of Satan in Christianity has marred its message with filth and morbitity.  For those Christians still deluded enough to believe literally in the Bible, it would be too much of a shock to read this book.  This book is for people who wish to rise above the fear they were subjected to in childhood.  (its part of our society.  No one escaped it.)  It is not for the "faithful".
