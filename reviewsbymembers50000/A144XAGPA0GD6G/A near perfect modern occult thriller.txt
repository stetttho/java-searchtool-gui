 Marion Zimmer Baradley once rejected a story I submitted to her magazine on the basis that it was too occult.  After reading two of the books from the **Light series I am convinced she knew what she was talking about.   Witchlight revolves around the child of a magickal leader whose character  reads as a cross between Crowley and Leary.  The occultism is very  accurate, and the story is nearly perfect.  There are a few times you want  to slap Truth for her stupidity, but feel you can't really blame her.   She's falling under a spell, after all.  I read this book straight through  in one sitting.  If you like the Darkover books, yo'll enjoy the expansion  of Bradley's occult themes into our present reality.
