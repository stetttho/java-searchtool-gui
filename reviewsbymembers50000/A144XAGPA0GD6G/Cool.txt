 The Book of Lies is a good collection of occult writings from a variety of perspectives. You find articles on Crowley, Sigil Magick, and even subjects that one would not normally associate with magick like William S. Burroughs.    You also get to read some detailed articles about Austin Osmon Spare, the Great Grandaddy of Kaos Magick. The two or three articles dedicated to Spare point up one of the more important aspects of this book: it's exploration of the connections betweeen art and magick.    The biggest reason for the deduction of two stars is the presence of an article by one PR Koenig. This represents such an egregious editorial error that I do not think this deduction is too harsh. Koenig's article is much like every other article he's ever written: poorly put together and full of blind assertions masquerading as "objective fact".    Besides that, the Book of Lies is an excellent look at the more avant garde side of the occult movement.
