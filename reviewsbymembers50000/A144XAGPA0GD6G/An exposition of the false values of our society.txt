 This book follows the story of Pheadrus (Pirsig himself) through a disillusionment with the constraints of Wetern Philosophy and Science.  In page after page of this "Chotoqua", Pirsig reveals how our culture is wreck of valueless, empty rationalism with no concern for Quality.  He doesn't however, leave it there.  He then goes onto explain ways of injecting Quality into one's life throught the metaphor of a motorcycle. To be read at least once a year, ideally around the Winter Solstice.
