 If I could, I would give this book as many stars as are known to human astornomy!  Death, the sweet little goth sister of Morpheus, here shines on her own.  She is Death in the most benevolent manifestation.  Her job is to teach those about to die how to get their life in order before they pass on.  In this story, she helps out a young man with some definate karma to purge.   I love Death, and recommend you get to know her too.
