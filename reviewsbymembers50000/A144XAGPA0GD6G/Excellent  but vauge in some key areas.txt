 The Book of Thoth is a wonderful companion to the deck of the same name.  It illucidates wonderfully the symbolism Crolwey wished to convey through Lady Harris' art.  The history section is sane and avoids dogmatic pronunciations about the ancient history of the Tarot.  Two things, however, marr what is otherwise a wonderful book.  First, the technique given for reading the cards is likely to stump one's intuitive flow.  Second, Crowley barely touches on the system of Elemental Dignities upon which the deck relies.  Both of these gaps, however, can be filled in by reading elsewhere.  Reccomended.
