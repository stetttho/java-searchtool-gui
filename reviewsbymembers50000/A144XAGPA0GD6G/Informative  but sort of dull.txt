 "Modern Sex Magick" by DM Kraig contains a great deal of useful information and techniques.  The chapters are set up logically, beginning with monfocal sex magic and proceeding to polyfocal opererations.  There's even a section on bondage and sadomasochism.  The sections by three female practitioners are a good balance to Kraig's style of writng.    And it is this style that is the book's main debility.  Kraig burdens the book with so many qualifications and concessions to political correctness that he actually makes the subject of sex magick seem kind of boring.  After the tenth description of the same idea with a new variation, one enters an intellectual coma, rather than wanting to experience a state of "erotocomatose lucidity".   The other objection is the minimalization of Crowley's contribution to this area.  This feels like reading a book on classical music that leaves out Beethoven.   The most interesting part of the book (apart from the guest contributers) is the totally speculative section on Jewish sex magick and the "hidden secrets of the Golden Dawn".  This section, however, suffers just as much from Kraig's milktoast writing style as the rest of the book.   However, if one is patient enough to bear this, "Modern Sex Magick" is a very good introduction to a realm of magick which is generally left out of the mainstream.   Provisionally reccomended.
