 In Sex and Drugs, Wilson shows how drugs have been used along with sex through the ages as paths to mystical experience.  He then demonstrates how the current "war on drugs", is really a holy war between different factions of drug users.  He details many experiences of people whose lifes have been changed, for good and bad, by the use of drugs.    This book is a bit more sober than Wilson's other works, and suffers from having had updates to the current edition inserted into the texts without revising the context to fit it.  Otherwise, a good look at sex and drugs as something other than a reason to shred what's left of the Constitution.
