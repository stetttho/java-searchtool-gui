 Ellen Cannon Reed's book on the interface between Kabbalah and Witchcraft is an important work. For Pagan's interested in using the Practical Kabbalh in their magick, it is a good place to begin.  The best feature of the book is the relating of the Sefiroth (the spheres on the Tree of Life) to the passages in the Charge of the Goddess.   I deducted one star for the ambiguities surrounding the practice of Rising on the Planes.  The technique given for this is not, in fact, Rising on the Planes, but a description of a useful technique for attuning to the energies of a particular Sephrira in preparation for actual pathworking. Despite this drawback (one which is unfortunatly all too common in books on Practical Kabbalah) Reed's book is excellent and should be on every Witch's shelf.   Very highly reccomended.
