 Venus in Furs is one of the most spritual works of erotica I've ever read.  Much has been made of its "perversity", to the extent that the name of its author is also the name of a psycho-sexual disfunction.  However, I feel that this is a grossly unfair way to treat a book that deals so beautifully with the descent and return of a man through his psyche.   Sevrin's tale is one of submission, slavery, and redemption.  It is through the experience of being a woman's slave that he realizes his own worth.  To treat this as an epic of laciviousness is puritanism of the lowest kind.   Venus in Furs also reminds us that the difference between hammer and anvil may not be so clear cut.  It is Severin who brings out the whip in his lover.  He then reaps the whirlwind, and can only ride it out.   This book is recommended for people who can see though the drivel that has been dripped upon it since its creation.
