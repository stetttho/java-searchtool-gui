 Trancework is a much neglected topic in occult literature.  Most books fixate on ritual technique and give little if any information on inner workings.   "Magical Images. . ." is a bit different.  Knight shows how trance works, and gives a more or less kabbalistic outline for structurng a trance journey.  The writing of the trances is exceptionally evocative. drawing on kabbalistic and Arthurian imagery to create it pattern.    The book loses one star for its misleading title.  Magical images are, technically, thoughtforms built up on the astral and imbued with life by the magician.  While trancework can be vital in this practice, it is not nessacary.   All and all, however, this is a good book for those interested in broadening their Work and strengthening the muscles of creative visualization.   Recomended.
