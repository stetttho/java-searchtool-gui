 This book is important, because it grounds modern paganism in a tradition that goes back to the earliest humans.  Grimassi makes it clear to anyone who actually reads the sections on history that this tradtition changed and grew, but its core values such as reverance for Nature remained.  His sources includethe scholarly segment of the Goddess history movement, and the view of the older, matrifocal societies is balanced, rather than romanticized.  History, however, is not the main focus of the book.  The real intent of the book is to expose the roots of the Wiccan faith, whether one beleives it to be a genuine survival or a reconstuction.  Grimassi touches on everything from the Watchers to chakras (universally percieved energy centers NOT uniqueley Eastern)as well as examining the sacred texts of the Craft in detail.  I enjoyed this book and reccomend it to anyone interested in the deeper aspects of the Craft.
