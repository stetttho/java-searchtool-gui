 This work, the first of Galenorn's, is a wonderful journey through the season's and the elements.  Each meditation is a lesson, an unfolding story that absorbs you in every trance.  The Sabbat meditations strike an especially deep chord.   Trancing the Witch's Wheel is essetial.  It is especially useful to those oppressed solitaries who, living with families who wouldn't understand, can neither afford fiancially or emotinally to drag out a million different tools every time a High holiday rolls around.
