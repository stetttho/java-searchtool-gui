 Witchcraft: Theory and Practice is actually an expanded version of a book the author wrote as a primer over a decade ago. That book was one of the first that I read on the Path and I am glad to see that it has been expanded.  The author stresses the seriousnes of comitting oneself to the Old Religion in a way that makes you understand that this is not a game. There is an entire section devoted to self exploration, including a Book of Elements to help you find an order in those sometimes chaotic personality traits. The work serves as a caveat that the first step taken on the Path is one you can never take back.  The first section of the book focuses on fundamentals: self exploration, meditation and visualisation skills, and basic grounding in the thought process of an occultist and Witch. Section two is ritual and religious instruction, and the third part is a collection of unique spells.  Kabbalah informs much of the work, although I'm certain many Kabbalists would object to the author's interpretation. There is a series of guided journeys designed to open up understanding of the Spheres for the reader.  Finally, the most impressive aspect of this book is its poetic nature. Angeles clearly has the soul of a poet in her, which is far more important, in my opinion, than endless lists of tools and correspondences. Her language drips with imagery, and takes the reader into the realm of the Witch the way few books do.  This is a brilliant work. Truly a book one would save if they had to pick their prized possesions on the way out of a burning building.
