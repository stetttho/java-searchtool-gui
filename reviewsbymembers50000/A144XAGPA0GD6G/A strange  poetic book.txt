 This short, odd novel is a work of imagination and poetry.  There's no plot to speak of, more a series of juxtapositions (and other kinds of positions) and atmospherics.   Contrary to what the cover says, the Marquis De Sade is very much alive in this book.  He has discovered some occult sexual secret which keeps him alive.  With his sister, Marciana, he enacts incestuous rites of sodomy intended to unite the Marquis with his tutelary female ideal, Laura.  In the end, brother and sister are married, which Sade sees as the culmination of the work of three centuries.   The castle the Marquis inhabits contains a basement that represents his own tortured subconscious.  Much of the novel revolves around a similar use of atmosphere to expound on the Marquis' psychological state.  Even the wine bottled on the estate contains the essence of eternal autumn midnight.   The key contrast comes from the meeting of the House of Sade with another house which is similarly sealed from the outside world.  At a great concert followed by an orgy, we are introduced to an alien "posthuman" named XZ.  The conflict between this guru and the Marquis basically points out the conflict between Nature, represented by Sade in full Pan-ic, and technology represented by the trancsendental XZ.   "Sister Midnight" is a difficult, sometimes disturbing book.  Some of the metaphors, such as Sade's whip, are never fully fleshed out.  One wonders why it was added at all.  This, and other elements, lend an unnerving quality to the book.  Whether that was the intent, or just an oversight is difficult to say.  Either way, the book is not for senstitive readers.  For those with a stronger psycholgy, however, "Sister MIdnight" is an odd but interesting work sure to make one think if nothing else.
