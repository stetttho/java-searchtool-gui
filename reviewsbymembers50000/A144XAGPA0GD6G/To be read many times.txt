 Illuminatus! is pershaps one of the most wonderful books I have ever read.  The combination of occultism, anarchism, and outright wierdness carries the reader through the most bizzare conspiracy theory ever dreamt of.  This book will make you laugh, rage, and probably cause you to become a bit paranoid.    The story, or stories, hinge around a search for the truth about the Illuminati, a worldwide conspiracy that has apparently existed for centuries.  Wilson complied a great deal of information, as well as tid bits from letters sent to him by crazies when he was working as the letters editor at Playboy magazine.  The result is a book that leaves you wondering where fact ends and satire begins.  That is, of course, the point.  Wilson is out to blow your mind.      Professional cynics, who delight in nay-saying the creativity of others without producing anything of their own as an alternative, will find the book sentimental and a bit silly.  For those with truly open minds, however, the Illuminatus Trilogy will be a book to read many times over.  There is enough subtlety to keep you as busy as a thorough reading of Finnegan's Wake.  The hidden messages and allusions seem to multiply each time you read.    You may even see the Fnords!
