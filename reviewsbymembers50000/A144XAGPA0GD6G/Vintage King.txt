 Breaking my rule of never writing for a book with more than twenty reviews in grand style...   Dreamcatcher is a textbook example of a Stephen King novel.  This is either a very good thing or a very bad thing, depending on your point of view.  I take the middle, and say that, while the King formula is entertaining, it does not challenge the reader in the way a horror novel can and should.   This story begins in the classic King fashion, with a great deal of time spent getting to know a bunch of alchoholic, middle aged white guys before something bizzare happens to them.  This time its extraterrestrials, making this King's take on War of the Worlds.   The story begins when Jonesy, a college professor, nearly shoots a man who has been impregnated by an alien weasal-thing.  These weasals gestate in the carrier's intestines, eventually exiting from the rear.  Be prepared for some lovely descriptions of the victim's backside after the weasals are done with them.   Dreamcatcher has a decidedly New Age twist, using a character with Downe's Syndrome as the focal point for a psychic connection between the four main players.  His name is Duddits, and his story is the truly sad part of the book.   I thought the ending of this novel was a bit pedantic, but overall Dreamcatcher is a solid effort by King.  He weaves events from his own life into the narrative, one suspects that some of the weirder bits were written while in a percoset haze.   Dreamcatcher should be considred along with Needful Things, the Stand, and the Dark Half as King's best.
