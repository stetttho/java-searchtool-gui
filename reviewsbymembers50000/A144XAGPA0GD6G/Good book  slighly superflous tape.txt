 The instructions contained in the book, which is available separately, are wonderful suggestions for strengthning the etheric body, projecting its energy, and finally injecting your consciousness into that energy.  The cautions are somewhat elaborate, since the author's point of view is that of Ceremonial Magick.  Overall, though, the book is very useful.   The tape contained in this kit, however, is totally unnecassary.  The relaxation can be memorized and elaborated on by the practitioner.  Once one is truly outside of their body, having a voice tell them what to do or music playing in the background is an invitation to be pulled back by any transition or variation in the tones.  I find the best tool for this sort of work to be a pair of earplugs!  Of course, that's just me.  If you want to have the security of a voice guiding you, that's legitimate as well.  If you think you might feel this way, but the kit.  If you're a silent type like me, buy the book by itself.
