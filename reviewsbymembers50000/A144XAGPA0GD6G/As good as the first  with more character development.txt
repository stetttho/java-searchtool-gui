 THis novel continues the **Light series.  As with Ghostlight, the fictional magickal system is quite realistice, though with certain leaps of imagination that might be occultically impossible.  I say "might" because that phrase is itself a troubling one.  Can we really say that a magickal childe cannot form its own consciousness and go beyond it's creator's intnet intent?  In any case, the diversions from acccepted theory help keep the general reader from getting bogged down in explinations of magick that can't possibly be all that intersting to those interested in the mystery of an occult novel, not its minute acuracies or innacuracies.   The storyline is more intimate than Ghostlight.  We learn more about Winter's family, and more about Truth Jourdemain, than the above novel allowed for.     Those concerned about occult accuracy, which overall is quite present in this novel, should pardon leaps of imagination.  It is, when all is said and done, a FANTASY.  Don't take it so bloody seriously.   Recommended.
