 "The Heart of the Master" begins with a vision of blood and terror.  This is the way Crowley always imagined the New Aeon would arrive, since it involves a radical shift in human consciousness.  Form this terror, the Great Beast is taken into the halls of the Great White Brotherhood and takes his place among the other Avatars from all Aeons past.   This work is among the more readable Class A (inspired) documents.  The flow from one passage to the next is more logical than some of the more ponderous tomes such as the Book of the Heart Girt Round by the Serpent.  This is because it basically celebrates Crowley's rise to power as the head of the O.T.O.   The edition includes a fanciful tale of this ascention, and an illustrated meditiation on each of the Trumps of the Thoth Tarot. A very good work of Crowley's, presented with historical context by the editior.
