 This translation of the I Ching presents a starkly beautiful, poetic explanation of the hexagrams.  I got more insight in the few hours of work I did with this book in two months of previous research.   The book also contains a fairly indepth summary of the I Chings history.  This section is enjoyable in its own right, and helps to clear up some of the more ponderous references contained in the oracle.  For instance, the allusion to drinking a cup of wine as a penalty refers to a game.  There are many such little bits of cultural history woven into the translation.    The section on physics and the I Ching is interesting, though a bit dry.  In context, however, this brings more life to the book.  It helps ground the oracle in the present day while looking toward the ancient origins of this facsinating oracle.    I highly reccomend this translation.
