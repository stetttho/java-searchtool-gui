 I read this book at 17.  It served as my first introduction to the Craft of the Wise.  Within, Cunningham seperates the religion of Wicca from Folk magick and explains each in turn.  He also gives a brief description of other systems of magick, and explains the differences between them and Wicca.   Cunningham designed all his books in the most efficient way possible.  This book is recomended for explorerers, and as a good book to give family who want to know what your up to when all that incense smoke stars billowing out of you room!
