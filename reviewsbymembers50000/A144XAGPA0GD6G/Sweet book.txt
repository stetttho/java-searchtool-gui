 "Midnight Butterfly" is a sweet, moving story about a girl emerging as a woman.  Under the tutelage of a high class call gorl and two angels form both heaven and hell, the protagonist Ellen is taught the ways of sex, seduction, and unfolding Will.  The characters are all likable, and the story is a good blend of both Ellen's fantasies and her actual experiences.  These scenes are all incredibly sexy, save for the fantasies which are intentionally cliche to show Ellen's moribund existance in a small town.  The no boundaries attitude of the fantasies allows Ellen to discover her boundaries in actual life.  They show that sex is more than mechanical copulation.  There's an "everyone's sexy" outlook that is very empowering.  Sexuality connects every aspect of Ellnen's life,and helps her find her ture place in the world.  The book may be a little PC for some.  Lloyd insistance on safe sex in nearly every scene proves a bit distracting.  Overall, though, this is a great book about a someone discovering who they really are. Recomended.
