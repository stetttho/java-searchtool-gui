 All too often, books on the Craft seem superficial.  One is left with the feeling that there is a deeper mystery that is not being explained, a richer, darker, more passionate way to approach the Old Religion.  The works of Starhawk and the Reclaiming Community stand apart from this depressing state of affairs.  Each one unearths deep emotion and is filled with insight.  This is the real thing, and that reality is felt bone deep.   "Twelve Wild Swans" is no exception.  The lessons are based on an old, somewhat unsettling fairy tale.  This story is approached from three different directions that enhance eachother.  The most important thing, in my opinion, is the stress the authors both put on the seriousness of commiting one's self to the Craft.  Witchcraft is a life altering journey, and that journey should not be embarked upon as a fashion statement.  The Outer Path sections make this especially clear.   As a book that stresses dedication and a deep commitment to the Goddess, "Twelve Wild Swans" takes its place as a classic on par with, if not exceeding, "Spiral Dance".  Thank you Starhawk and the Reclaiming Community!
