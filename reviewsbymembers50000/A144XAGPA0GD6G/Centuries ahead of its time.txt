 It is little wonder that the Marquis De Sade spent the last years of his life in a madhouse.  Anyone as far ahead of his time as he was is sure to be considered insane by his contemporaries.   This collection of his work is exhaustive, and deliciously exausting.  You not only get "Justine" and "Philosophy in the Bedroom", there are many shorter works and a collection of De Sade's letters.  All of these paint a picture of a man and a philosophy that was at least 150 years ahead of the morals and thought of his period.  Sade not only anticipates Freud and Niezche, he goes beyond them.  He declares homosexuality natural and advocates a woman's right to choose.   The cruelty Sade is known for is the natural outgrowth of his philosophy and the pervailing attitude toward Nature during his life.  Nature is the only real ruler of man, he says.  Nature is sometimes cruel, indeed in the view of Western Civilization, Nature is always cruel.  Therefore, says the Marquis, humans, if they are to be in harmony with the only true governing force, must allow themselves to at least imagine being cruel.  Now, while one might criticize the Marquis for not being able to cross the rubicon with his views on Nature as he did with homosexuality, the fact remains that the conclusion is logical within De Sade's framework.    This is not a collection for those seeking light erotica.  Indeed, some of the situations described are the exact opposite of erotic.  Read as philosophy, as the Marquis intended, his work is an earth shattering precursor to the modern and post modernist movement.  This colection goes a long way in wresting Sade's name away from the pathology that unfortunatly bears his name.
