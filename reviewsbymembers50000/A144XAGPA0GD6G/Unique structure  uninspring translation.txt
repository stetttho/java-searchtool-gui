 The I Ching workbook has a unique feature which allows you to track the appearance of the hexagrams in your readings.  The forms also allow you to track lines that change frequently in certain situations.  This is an excellent way to develop your thinking about certain aspects of your life.  I quite enjoy this feature, and it has helped greatly in my fledgling understanding of the hexagrams.   That being said, R.L Wing's translation is rather dry and uninspiring.  It is intended to facilitate understanding, but the poetry which first attracted me to I Ching in the first place is eschewed in favor of prose dissertation.  That's precisley how it feels, as though someone had written an academic thesis on the hexagrams.  This, in my opinon, makes it extremely difficult to form an intuitive response to the text.    Still, I reccomend the workbook simply for the journal feature.  You may or may not have the same response to the translation.  If you do, there are other translations that you can refer to, while still using the tracking feature to follow the influence of the hexagram.  Better still, combine insights from both translations.  A more poetic viewpoint actually helps render the thesis more inuitively intellegible.    An excellent tool for exploring the hexagrams in your own life.
