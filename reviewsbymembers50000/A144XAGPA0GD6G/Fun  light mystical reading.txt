 The Secrets of Dr. Taverner is a fun book, with lots of esoteric philospophy lacing a Sherlock Holmeslike psychologist.  The sperate stories take place in a "nursing home" -i.e a mental hospital. run by Taverner in a most eccentric way.  The doctor uses his training as an initiate of the Western Mysteries to solve his clients "issues".  These issues run the gammut, between vampirism and faery lineage, to psychic manipulation and past life transgressions.   OF course, the book is absolutley studded with examples of the author's aristocratic prejudices.  Once or twice I had to stop and exclaim to my self "God! Could this woman be WHITER?!!"   That being said, Secrets really is a good book.  Like all of Fortune's work, once you get over the initial shock of reading the words of an early 20th centurie bourgoise, its thourougly enjoyable
