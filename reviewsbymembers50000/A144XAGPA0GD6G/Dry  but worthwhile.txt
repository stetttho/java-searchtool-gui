 Crowley's intepretation of the Taoist classic is very illuminating, showing if nothing else the flexibility of the Law of Thelema.  The book is a peircing look into Crowley's own sycretist mind.   However, Crowley's technique of intepretation leads to a very dry reading of the text.  The book is set up like a typical Thelemic Liber, with paragraph headings and so forth.  The chapters are written in prose paragraphs, rather than free verse as other translations.  THus, the poetic power of the text is actually somewhat diminshed.  The inclusion of footnotes to  explain things is very unTaoist in spirit.   Overall, however, Crowley's Toa Te Ching is a very illuminating read.  It shows that the Law truly is for all, and that it has been hiding for centuries.  This, if nothing else, makes the book worthwhile.   Provisionally reccomended
