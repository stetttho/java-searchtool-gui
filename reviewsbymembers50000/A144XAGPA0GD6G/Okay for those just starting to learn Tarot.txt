 If you're just starting to learn about the Tarot, this book Tarot Spells will give you an interesting new avenue to explore.  Each spell is basically a progressive layout designed to provoke your subconscious into the action necassary for magick.   More experienced Tarot readers and studenst will find the spells a bit tricky.  The interpretations of the cards used here are the most basic ones.  So, if you use Elemental Dignities or the Kaballah (I use both) the spells can actually seem to be opposed to the stated goal.  The best advice for the advanced cartomanticist is to use the book as a framework for developing more nuanced layouts.  This way, your subconscious won't rebel when you give it conflicting instructions.   Recomended primarily for beginners.  For iimediate and advanced levels only if they wish to use the book as a framwork, not as a grimior.
