 The Middle Pillar Exercise, like any routine alignment of the etheric and physical bodies, is a benifiacial way to promote good health and a positive outlook.  These two things are a prerequisite for a fulfilling life.   In The Ture Art of Healing, Israel Regardie presents a solid, clearly defined program for using this powerful technique daily.  THe instructions are easy to follow, divorced from the mystical gobbelty gook that permeates much of the Western Inner Tradtion.     Of course, this book was not written for practitioners of that tradition.  It was written for everyone.  THose involved in magick will undoubtedly find some bits very odd indeed.  Regardie's  pronunciation of the Tetragrammaton, for instance, will give many ceremonial magicians fits.  Also, the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram, usually regaurded as a nessacary part of a magickal routine, is absent here.  Most of the trappings of magick, in fact, have been stripped away to reveal the core technique which can be used by anyone.  Regardie used this program as part of his psychological therapy, and since none of his clients were struck down by lightning, we can safely assume that his premise that the Middle Pillar is a valuable healing tool for everyone is correct.   Recomended mainly for non-magicians
