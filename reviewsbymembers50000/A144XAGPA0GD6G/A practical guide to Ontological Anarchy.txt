 In the temporoary Autonimous Zone, Hakim Bey evoked a spirit of insurrection.  In Immediatism, he gives ideas on just what to do with this wild spirit or "strange attractor" once it's flying around your kitchen.   Immediatism basically entails a return to an economy of the gift, or reciprocity rather than commodity.  Bey suggests forming secret societies of "art terrorism" and quilting bees with a twist.  The point is to keep your art away from the Spectacle.  If THEY get ahold of you, you're (...).   This is not a political program for those who enjoy dry sessions of critcism/self criticism and "non-violent" resistance.  It is about creating a new society "in the rotting shell of the old".  It is for true radicals, not "reformers" or  "progressives".  Bey is as hostile toward leftist values as he is right wing morality.  Immeidatism is about life, not theory.  It is for those who wish to dance with Chaos.
