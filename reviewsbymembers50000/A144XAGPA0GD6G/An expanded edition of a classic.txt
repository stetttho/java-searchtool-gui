 The Middle Pillar is one of Regardie's best works.  It lucidly explains the correlation between the Tree of Life and the human body, and how certain energy centers are activated for magick.   This edition expands on the original.  Included are the musical notes for the various rituals, versions of the rituals in languages other the Hebrew, and an essay on Regaries feelings about psychology.  The hope is to present basic magical technique as a dovetail to therapy.  The additional material contains good information in this area, mostly based on conversations between the Regaride and the Cisoeros.  As occultism and psychology are both interests of mine, I loved this book.  Recommended for intermidiate magicians and psychotherapists.
