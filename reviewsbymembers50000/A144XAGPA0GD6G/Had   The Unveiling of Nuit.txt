 Reading the Liber AL can be frustrating if you actually expect to understand the thing.  (foolish Mortal!)  This volume of Crowley's own commentaries clears up most of the confusion.  You find Uncle Al's contridictions made plain, so if complexity in a human being disturbs you, stay away.  Crowley was a Master Therion, not a simple Fool.  The very real anarchism expressed here is libereating in and of itself.  To be read after the Liber AL has had time to sink in.
