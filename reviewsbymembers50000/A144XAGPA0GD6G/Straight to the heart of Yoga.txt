 This book is an excellent example of Crowley's two main strengtss as a writer: to get to the heart of an apparently obscure subject, and the use of humor to disarm the audience and provoke insight.  The latter of these can, if the reader takes it too seriously, detract from the former.   The first half of the book, "Yoga for Yahoos", is the strongest by far.  Here crowley explains the practical "limbs" of yoga that are nessecary preperations for practice.  The exposition is lucid.   The second, "Yoga for Yellowbellies", suffers from the inability of language to describe anything which is super rational.  "Yellowbellies" tends to ramble a bit, especially when the Beast begins weaving in modern physics.  You have to get to the end to come to the realization that, for the most part, this synthesis is a literary joke.  Yoga is beyond science and reason.  Again, for those with little sense of humor, this can be frustrating.  However, the final stroke, the proof that Yoga dovetails with, and perfectly justifies, the Law of Thelema, is an ecstatic literary experince you shouldn't miss. The technique of progressive visualization is very useful as well.   Recomended.
