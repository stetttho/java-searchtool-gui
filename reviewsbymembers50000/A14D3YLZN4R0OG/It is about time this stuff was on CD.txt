 Sounding like a US version of the UK group "The Records", The Producers wrote and played some excellent instantly memorable pop tunes (complete with great harmonies and catchy guitar riffs) led by Van Temple's soaring tenor voice and guitar, Bryan Holmes' driving drums, Kyle Henderson's melodic bass lines, and of course, Wayne Famous--the resident looney on keyboards. It is a shame that their only really major national success was "She-Sheila" because a large percentage of the tunes should've been hits. They were very popular with the college crowds circa 1982-85. I saw 'em three times and EVERYONE in the crowd knew all the words! In concert, they also did a killer cover of "A Hard Day's Night" (hmmm, maybe a live album is called for). The first album (Producers) is the most fun of the two in this package. Innocent, light weight, hummable, and a killer soundtrack to your college beer party (well maybe not these days). "What's He Got", "I Love Lucy", "What She Does To Me", "Certain Kinda Girl",... ahhh greatness! The second (You Make The Heat) is a little more serious and probably an attempt to compete more with the arena supergroups at the time. The songs are still good. It is just a little less Hollies-sounding and a little more Journey-sounding. "You Make The Heat" and "Breakaway" are standouts. These recordings have been criminally out of print for years. I myself have only had a cassette tape copied from the LP's back in the 80's. This release is greatly welcomed. I don't know how well it will go over with today's youth, but I know that a bunch of folks that were in college during the first half of the 80's are going to be tickled pink about it. I am now going to pop open a cold one, put this disc on and wax nostalgic. "Lucy....Luuuuuucy!" Thanks Producers for some great memories.
