 Honeybus were an excellent band from the late 60's UK music scene that had great musical chops, beautiful vocal harmonies, and a knack for coming up with brilliant pop tunes (primarily from Pete Dello and Ray Cane). Their  sound brings to mind Hollies, Badfinger, Simon & Garfunkel, late  Move/early ELO, and of course, the Fab Four. "I Can't Let Maggie  Go" was, unfortunately, their only big hit. "(Do I Figure) In  Your Life"--later covered by Joe Cocker--and a bunch of the other  tunes including the entire "Story" LP (tracks 1-12 of CD) should  have been topping the charts but went criminally unnoticed by the record  buying public at large. The history of Rock music is littered with such  "tragedies". Thanks to this CD, you don't have to miss out. If  you are a fan of the above mentioned groups and styles of music, stop  reading this and purchase this disc immediately. Also, seek out the  Repertoire CD "Honeybus Story" which duplicates a lot of these  tracks but has a few extras (and better mastering) to make it worth  grabbing. Getting turned on to Honeybus has been one of my more pleasant  musical experiences.
