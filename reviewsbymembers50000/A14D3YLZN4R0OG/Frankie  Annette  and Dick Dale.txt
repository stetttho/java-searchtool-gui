 This first in the series of "Beach" movies made by AIP back in  the 60's is my personal favorite of the lot. Bob Cummings is delightful as  the bewhiskered professor studying the strange and primitive tribal rituals  of the beach dwellers. Frankie is "cool" when he sings in a  finger-snapping Bobby Darin kind of way. Annette is voluptuous and just as  sweet as ever. Eric Von Zipper (Harvey Lembeck) is hilarious as he deals  with his gang (The Rats & The Mice-a bunch of stupids) and gives  himself the finger. Most important is the appearance of the King Of The  Surf Guitar, Dick Dale with his Del-Tones. You want real California  surfer/beach scene authenticity? Just watch the sun-tanned, earring-wearing  Dale playing his left-handed, upside-down strung, reverb-drenched Fender  Strat and wailing about jumpin' in his woodie and hot-doggin' on his board  at his "Secret Surfin' Spot" where the "gremmies and the  hodads never go". Priceless. Dated? Of course. Entertaining? You  betcha! You like Dick Dale? Get this film. The fact that Frankie and  Annette were hip to him moves them up a few notches on the  "cool-ometer". Hooting!!
