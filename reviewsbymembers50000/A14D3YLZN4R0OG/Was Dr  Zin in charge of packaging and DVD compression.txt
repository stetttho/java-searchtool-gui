 Got the set in the mail yesterday and have only watched "The Robot Spy" (one of my favorites) so far.  There are what appear to be some mild pixelization artifacts present (a character moves and a few stray "blocky" pixels of the character's image remain on the background from the character's previous position).  Maybe it is in the source print but in freeze frame, it looks like artifacts to me.  Otherwise, the quality is pretty good.  We'll see how the rest of the episodes measure up.   The DVDs are packaged in that "wonderful" quadruple-fold cardboard thingy that Warners is known for.  I don't know about you, but I do not care at all for this cheapish, flimsy, awkward packaging, especially for a relatively high-dollar item such as this.  Perhaps Dr. Zin works at Warners and was trying to keep the set less than perfect. :-) For all these "nit picks", I dock the set a star. As far as content, I watched JQ in syndication in the late 60's and early 70's when I was a wee chap.  It was one of my favorite shows and having all the episodes is a real treat.  This set has been long overdue.  Now, if we can work on that packaging...
