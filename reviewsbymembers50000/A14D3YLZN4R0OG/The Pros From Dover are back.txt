 When I first saw M*A*S*H the movie on TV after being a fan of the series, I didn't like it much. Upon repeated viewings it began to grow on me and over the years has become one of my favorite films. In fact, I bought a laserdisc player in 1995 just to be able to own a widescreen copy of it. Seeing it in widscreen was like seeing it for the first time. Seeing it this past week on the DVD brought the same experience. Both picture and sound restoration are simply marvelous and bring a fresh appreciation to a film I have seen at least 50 times. There are plenty of extra features. I too was a little disappointed in Altman's commentary but it does not spoil the overall package. A five star film, a five star DVD set. This film ain't for everyone. It has no conventional story line and the overlapping dialogue may require reapeating viewings to pick up everything--although I still get something new everytime I see it. It's gory, sometimes mean, sometimes crude and sometimes slapstick. Drop your paradigms on movies, forget what you know and expect about film, forget the TV series, and just enjoy the experience. Give it a chance. You may hate it at first but if you are somehow drawn to it as I was, give it another chance. It just may grow on you. And one day you too may realize that Altman created one of the most brilliantly made films ever. There is nothing else like it. Now if only I could see it at the theater on the big screen.
