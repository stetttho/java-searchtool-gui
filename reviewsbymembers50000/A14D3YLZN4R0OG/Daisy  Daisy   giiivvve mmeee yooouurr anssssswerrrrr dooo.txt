 Some folks love it and some folks hate it but none can ignore it. I could rave and rave about how good this film is, but there are those who have said it better than I. It is simply a treat for the eyes and food for the mind. If you have a low tolerance for subtlety and prefer to have everything spelled out for you and tied up in a neat little bundle, it ain't going to happen with this film. You get to figure it out yourself. In fact, don't try to figure it out. Just sit back and enjoy the ride. I will probably never get to travel in space. Mr. Kubrick let me feel what is like to be there. The vastness, and the quiet. Pretty amazing for someone who never went there himself. I still get a little sad when HAL is disconnected though. The film gets 5 stars. I was a bit dissappointed in the DVD though. A landmark film like this is worthy of a whole disc full of extras. We get a trailer. That is about it. The transfer looks good. A deluxe edition is called for though. Until then, pick it up. You will either be very frustrated or you will keep saying to yourself "Wow!".
