 This item works fine most of the time.  The included software includes a note telling Mac users to download Mac software from Iomega's web site (where you'll find a charge for it).  A call to their customer service quickly answered my questions (and the gentleman was very helpful).  There is no current software for the Mac, but the Toast Lite "should work."  With only occasional freezing of our machine, we have found it's a fine back up when it does work and look forward to Iomega sending us software when it's available.
