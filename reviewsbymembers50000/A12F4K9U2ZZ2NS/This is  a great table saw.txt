 After reading the reviews on www.Amazon.com and talking to friends, I decided to give the Bosch portable table saw a try.  I have a Delta Unifence and have no complaints about that, but (of course) it is at the lake and I was at home facing a Pergo project (and you can never have too many tools).  The fence is more true than any I looked at.  No need to measure and remeasure.  It locks down in one easy movement and stays in place.  This is simply the easiest and most accurate table saw on the market (my opinion).
