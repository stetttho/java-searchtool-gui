 Bought this to replace a Cuisinart grind and brew (had to replace them once a year...both had the heating element fail after a year of use).  So far (after a week), we have been impressed both with the ease of use and the quality of coffee.  The parts are a bit "plastic" for the price (we expected a bit more of a substantial appliance), so we'll see how they hold up.  Thanks to the other reviewers for giving us guidance when deciding which coffeemaker to try this time.
