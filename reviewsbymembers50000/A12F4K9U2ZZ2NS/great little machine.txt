 Pretty impressive cordless vac.  Have had several through the years and this is by far the best.  The suction is great for cleaning up the small messes we make.  We use the small crevice tool a lot for corners and edges.  Haven't used the other attachment, so have no comment on that.  So far, we highly recommend it.
