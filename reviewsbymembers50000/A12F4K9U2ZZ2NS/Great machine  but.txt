 For all rotisserie lovers:  this machine is awesome, but read carefully when the instructions say to bake up to a five pound chicken.  It does not work when the user (that would be me) doesn't follow instructions.  We are now ordering the Jr. size and predict complete satisfaction.  The parts are fairly easy to clean (a little elbow grease is required around the vent areas).  The chicken is moist and better than the store bought.  And the standing rib roast is done perfectly.  For the price, it's a great little machine.
