 The compact design is great for the small pick up jobs around the house.  It does fine on Pergo picking up sand (unlike the electric brooms we have had) and crumbs.  We aren't impressed with the carpet performance, but didn't purchase it for major cleaning.  The only critism we have is the lack of some sort of onboard accessory storage.
