 Bought two phones and cards (and rechargers)as gifts for traveling parents who don't "need or want" cell phones.  Told them both they are more for us than them so that we wouldn't worry if they found themselves in trouble on the road.  Easy for us to moniter and replace minutes, so they have no worries other than being instructed in the initial use and remembering these instructions.  The manual is easy to follow.  Virgin Mobile uses the Sprint network and coverage is fairly good. For us, this has been a great find and we recommend it for those in similar situations.
