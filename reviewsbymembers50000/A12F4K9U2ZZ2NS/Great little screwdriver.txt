 Purchased this as a Christmas present for my wife and have been installing blinds ever since.  While it's not intended to take the place of an 18 volt drill, it does a great job screwing and unscrewing.  The forward, reverse rocker switch is more convient than others that we have used and the angles are handy.  I would not recommend it as a replacement for the DeWalt heavy duty cordless screwdriver (my favorite), but it's lighter and 1/3 the price.  Well worth the money....
