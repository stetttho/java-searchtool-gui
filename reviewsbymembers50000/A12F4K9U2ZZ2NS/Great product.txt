 Almost didn't purchase this, but decided to try it after reading the reviews.  Much better than the wooden ones...sturdy and does not leave yellow marks from the wood discoloring on the clothing.  There is enough space between the bars to hang larger items and enough bars to hang a load of clothing.  We liked it enough to order another one.
