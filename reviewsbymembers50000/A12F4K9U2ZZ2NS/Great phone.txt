 After problems with the 2.4 Ghz phones interferring with our wireless connection, we decided to try this unit.  So far, the computers work as does the phone.  It's easy to program (excellent directions) and attractive to look at. The range seems to be more than adequate for our needs.  We recommend it for those who have a wireless connection in their homes (and anyone else who just wants a good cordless telephone).
