 It's hard to read these "These cartoons are edited" reviews on Amazon, simply because they don't give a brief explanation on exactly WHICH cartoons are missing cuts or containing the redubbed voices of Mammy-Two Shoes.   After buying this set, I am able to find out which cartoons contain the redubbed voice of Mammy-Two Shoes. Out of the 37 cartoons (excluding TEXAS TOM which is already included on Volume 1), only four contain the redubbed voice of Mammy, which are:   Saturday Evening Puss Knit-Witty Kitty Polka Dot Puss(?) The Lonesome Mouse  Now after reading those "These cartoons are edited" reviews, I thought at first Warner Bros. only used the Cartoon Network/Boomerang prints which leave out minor cuts, but amazingly, these cartoons, which have been literally edited on Cartoon Network/Boomerang (or any other major TV network)--  Puss Gets the Boot Fraidy Cat Dog Trouble Puss n' Toots The Mouse Comes to Dinner Mouse in Manhattan Trap Happy Part-Time Pal Old Rockin' Chair Tom Safety Second  --ARE PRESENTED IN THEIR ORIGINAL UNEDITED FORMS RIGHT HERE IN THIS DVD SET!! That was more than what I would expect when it comes to the WB releasing MGM cartoons on DVD. The rest of the cartoons in this set are presented unedited as well! How about that?  I wouldn't know whether or not to recommend this DVD set to     anybody, depending on how they are writing reviews here on Amazon, but I would pinpoint my opinion on this set: On the downside, it's still a disgrace to have a few cartoons contain redubbed voices of Mammy, and neither is it any better than Volume 1. But on the upside, it's still a lot better than how Tom and Jerry cartoons have been airing on TV these days.  But that's just me. What do you guys think?
