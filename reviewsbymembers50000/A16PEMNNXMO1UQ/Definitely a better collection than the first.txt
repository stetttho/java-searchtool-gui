 I say this, because this collection is a REAL blend of the Golden Age-from the late 30s to the late 50s.  Here are my given thoughts on the four discs with 15 shorts each.  Disc #1: Bugs Bunny- A great collection of Bugs shorts, like THE BIG SNOOZE, THE HECKLING HARE, LITTLE RED RIDING RABBIT, BABY BUGGY BUNNY, and the other two-thirds of the Bugs-and-Cecil Turtle trilogy. 9/10  Disc #2: Road Runner and Friends- This comedic duo is half better than Tweety and Sylvester, and I think it's because the gags come in at a much better timing, able to give us a few chuckles all around. Both the RR selection, and its "and friends" selection, including CHEESE CHASERS, THE DOVER BOYS (classic) is top-notch. 8.5/10  Disc #3: Tweety and Sylvester and Friends- To tell you the truth, I'm not a fan of Tweety-- well, all the Friz Freleng ones. I think those are mind-numbingly derivative; Tweety may be cute, but his character is stale enough to avoid the comedic punch. It would've been nice to get a few Bob Clampett Tweetys; he was much meaner then. At least the "and Friends" selection makes up for it: The serious Chuck Jones cartoon OLD GLORY, and 4 Bob Clampett gems: BABY BOTTTLENECK, THE GREAT PIGGY BANK ROBBERY, KITTY KORNERED, and the ultra-surreal PORKY IN WACKYLAND. Plus, the MAN FROM WACKYLAND: THE ART OF BOB CLAMPETT featurette is very interesting. (Want to see the Ren and Stimpy creator John K. himself?) 5.5/10  Disc #4:All Stars- The real deal here. This disc includes a few more Bob Clampett gems like THE HEP CAT, BOOK REVUE, and the Fantasia parody itself, A CORNY CONCERTO. Also it includes two of Chuck Jones's all-time best cartoons A FROGGY EVENING and WHAT'S OPERA, DOC?, as well as my three personal favorite "musical" cartoons, KATNIP KOLLEGE, I LOVE TO SINGA, and HAVE YOU GOT ANY CASTLES? (Completely uncut, too! Never saw the Town Crier scenes at all.) 10/10  Yes, there are a few duds, but it's still a great collection overall, compared to the first collection.
