 ...the worst auditions of Seasons 1-4 all on DVD.  My family and I are not really true fans of this show, because we would rather watch anything else but people singing for a wasted hour. But we always wait at the beginning of the year to watch the auditions hoping that we would laugh so hard at the singers' performances (Love that William Hung audition). And we did. Just a few months ago, though, Fox was airing an AI program called the "World's Worst Auditions", which lasted only an hour. As of today now, I've heard that they are going to release a "worst of" DVD that has TWO AND A HALF hours worth of material! That has really got to make a perfect Christmas gift now!  Hold on now...Just a few more weeks...
