 Warner Bros. has announced that the first Animaniacs DVD is on a July 2006 date(that may subject to change). And the plan is to sell this show, along with Pinky and the Brain in separate 4-disc "Volume" sets each containing 22 or so episodes in its original broadcasting order. That doesn't mean, though that Pinky the Brain will be absent from the Animaniacs set--they started their own series in 1995, so all their episodes that aired on Animaniacs will still be there as the PATB set will start with the 1995 showing itself.  What great info this is! I loved this show so much as a kid that I kept singing its theme song and still play it in my head up to today. I just feel like writing it down here...    It's time for Animaniacs, and we're zany to the max! So just sit back and relax. You'll laugh 'til you collapse. We're Animaniacs!  Come Join the Warner Bros. and their Warner Sister Dot! Just for fun we run around the Warner Movie Lot! They lock us in the tower whenever we get caught, But we break loose and then vamoose, and now you know the plot!  We're Animaniacs! Dot is cute, and Yakko yaks! Wakko packs away the snacks while Bill Clinton plays the sax! We're Animaniacs!  Meet Pinky and the Brain who want to rule the universe! Goodfeathers flock together, Slappy whacks them with her purse! Buttons chases Mindy, while Rita sings a verse! The writers flipped! We had no script! Why bother to rehearse?  We're Animaniacs! We have payed or played contracts! We're zany to the max! There's baloney in our slacks! We're Animani...Totally zany... (This line changes simultaneously but comes with something that rhymes like "Here's the show's name-y") Animaniacs! Those are the facts!
