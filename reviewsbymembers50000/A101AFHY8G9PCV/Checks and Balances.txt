 Reading this book, comprised of info from many sources, I got frankly angered by the way this administration, as well as others in the past, used tragedies and wars to take our freedoms from us and invade our privacy on a whim.  I understand some liberties must be sacrificed in times of conflict.  The government just after 9-11 was running straight from the executive branch without any checks and balances.  Of course who would dispute or bring up civil liberties in times of crisis, obviously not anyone in the courts.  People were labeled enemy combatants and contained without right to trial, any proof of guilt, and held months without anyone even knowing their whereabouts.  Many were probably guilty, but some were innocent and in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Our government wanted to get people to act as spies, surveying their neighborhoods, spying on neighbors, getting your library to turn you in as a terrorist for reading muslim literature or something containing dissent to the govt.  Luckily that brilliant plan of ashcrofts has not gone over to will not be tolerated, and should not be tolerated by the citizens that are supposed to be the backbone of our democracy.  Very informative book.  AMerica must fight to revise this orwellian act that is the patriot act.
