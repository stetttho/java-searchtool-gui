 This film was touching, truthful, and rightfully damaging to the regime we call the bush administration.  All republicans do to condemn this movie, which most dont even watch, is say it is full of lies, which it is not, if so-prove it!  They cry "Moore has an agenda to get Bush thrown from the whitehouse because he is biased".  Of course he is!  When your president is so completely unfit for his command why would you not be biased towards him.  Get him out and try something new.  I often laugh when debating a repub over  our president , because they are so brainwashed and argue about a movie that in my experience they hadnt even watched.  I ask, how can you argue that point when you havent even watched it. And the reply is "Yeah...and ill never watch that garbage. "  I mean come on!  Pathetic is a word that comes to mind.  There may be others as well.  Get some balls, watch the movie, try not to let your head explode with frustration as you wonder how your president could be so careless.  Then in typical republican fashion just disclaim the film as all lies! LOL. You have no argument. Wake up. The proof isnt just in the film, but in the feelings of many soldiers in iraq right now.  In the feelings of hundreds of protestors at every single stop Bush makes across the country.  A country divided more than ever.  There has to be something to these strong feelings.  Its time for our own regime change.  Wake up America - Bush doesnt care about you. Michael Moore should be saluted for his bravery.  The patriot act probably has him classified as an enemy combatant now.
