 This book in an amazing book, becasue it is written by soldiers themselves confirming many things in Fahreinheit 911.  Not just soldiers, but men of the higher ranks, mothers, spouses, family of deceased men and women.  They were not given adequate armorment, they had shortages of simple things like water, they witnessed other soldiers hatred of all iraqis, even if they werent the enemy.  These are voices from the war, voices that think the war is unjust, some concealing their names for safety reasons, some disclosing their names for all to see that they spoke out.  A war that will go into history as a calamity similar to vietnam.  These are soldiers who feel betrayed by our president, a president bent on thriving corporate interests, who wanted iraq only a day after 9-11 began.  The letters express hatred, anguish, fear, but overall- betrayal.  A medic didnt have enough scrubs to wear and clean while operating on soldiers wounded in battle, so the mother and a friend make them and send them to the unit.  A soldier writes about his interactions with iraqis, " we pick up rocks before patrol for the kids that will no doubt be throwing them at us." Soldiers are told to run over anyone threatening on the roads, while most run to the roads begging for food or a handout.  Most just feel that they had gone to a just war, but after time it felt much different, they didnt want them there, the soldiers didnt know their mission.  The worst letter to me was a soldier who came home with post traumatic stress disorder, but a high rank captain told him not to go home and cry about PTSD, you can get over that by going to the bar and downing some drinks, he was made to feel like a wimp if he needed help.  The soldier ended up killing himself.  I definitely recommend this book to anyone with a soul, something Brian who gave the book a 1 star doesnt have.  You are a moron!!!!!
