 Al Gores book is brilliant.  It is rare that a politician recognizes the need to heal an environment that is being destroyed by its inhabitants.  Gore not only describes the effects of Global Warming, Ozone depletion, deforestation, faulty irrigation, but also delves into the evils that are corporations swaying the views of high ranking officials to turn the other cheek towards the environment.  George W. Bush is doing it now.  Although most scientist agree these are problems, Corporations put out loads of propoganda saying it is junk science supported by only a few "scientist" who are in it for big incentives and overall greed.  The book expresses the need for USA to take the lead in changing the effects of the overall corrosion of earths balance.  The fact that people can dismiss the enviroment and the health our children makes me sick.  Quite honestly it makes me ashamed to be an american.  Our administrations, with the exception of Clinton and Gore, are ruining the environment for political and mentary gain.  I wish them only the worse.  Vote Kerry 2004!
