 This book is one of the most informative, as well as funniest books ive read.  Franken nails these republican morons for what they are.  Bush is by far the worst president weve had in a long time, coming directly after one of the best of all time, Bill Clinton, the facts prove it.  Republicans will rage over that statement mainly because they know theyve got no argument.  Biggest surplus to the worst deficit.  Completely dismantling clintons environmental laws, which should be one of the most important subjects on the table, considering there are hormone disrupting chemicals contaminating our bodies and undermining our fertility as we speak.  I recommend reading "Our Stolen Future" by Theo Colburn. Scary and FACTUAL! Bush is a liar, and o reilly, and fox news, which blows anyway-talk about bias!  If Bush gets re-elected, which he wont, may the God he pretends to love for political gain have mercy on all of us!
