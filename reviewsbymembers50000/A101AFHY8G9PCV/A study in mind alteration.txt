 The fact that he writes most of his poetry and song in drug induced trance is what makes this book compelling to me.  He wrote what most were afraid to confront within themselves. Anger, sadness, rebellion.  No matter how horrible the thought, he wished to express it.  No matter how negative the response, he would voice this thought, however sinister it may be.  True poets share all.  This book gives a glimpse into the best rock band of all time.  A voice so distinct in a sea of musical monotony.  To this day no band has a quality so unique as the music of the doors and jim morrison.  Chode!
