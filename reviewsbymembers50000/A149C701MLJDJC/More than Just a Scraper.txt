 This is one serious scraper... and the price is right, too.  This scraper will feel solid in your hand (no tinny/slippy feeling to it).  It will certainly get any job of scraping you have in the kitchen done.  I safely use mine on a ceramic stovetop (no scratching, etc.).  This is the Cadillac of scrapers.
