 As you should do, read most of the reviews you can (from one-star to five-star reviews) in order to determine whether this product is what you want.  Cons:  The Braun 7526 Synco Shaver did not work well for me.  Everytime I tried to shave the front side of my neck (a couple inches below the jaw bone) it would leave a good bit of area unshaved.  I'm not entirely certain whether this is due to skin type or hair type.  Shaving in general is a bit more difficult if you skip a day or two.  Pros:  The shaver is sleek and does not take up too much counter space in its holder/recharging/cleaning unit.  The shaver holds a really good charge.  The 'cleaning' phase does a superb job of keeping your razor fresh.  It does leave a skin-tight shave on the rest of my face outside of the neck.  Conclusion:  I ended-up purchasing a Norelco 7845XL Quadra Action shaver which I have been extremely happy with.
