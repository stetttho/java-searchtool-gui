 This is a good overall guide for taking care of an opossum.  I purchased this book/guide for my uncle who found an "abandoned" opossum at his back door.  For its size, the book is extremely thorough in explaining:  where do opossums come from (why are there so many "abandoned" opossums around), how to care for an opossum (health signs to watch out for), how to feed, how to set up a proper environment, etc.
