 I am extremely pleased with my purchase.  You cannot buy a better pair of headphones this size/light (let alone at this price).  I have had my Sennheiser PX200's for six months now.  I use them every afternoon on my bus ride home from Washington D.C. to the suburbs.  I use my headphones with a 40gb MP3 player.  The sound quality is excellent with a decent range of sound covering highs through lows.  You will be extremely pleased with this set of headphones.
