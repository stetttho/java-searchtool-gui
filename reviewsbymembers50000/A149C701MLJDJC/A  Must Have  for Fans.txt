 This is a superb DVD.  No corners were cut in the making of this DVD... as songs are seen in their entirety and there are no oddball interuptions as I have seen on countless other music DVD's.  If you are a fan (even a casual one) of Jethro Tull, you will enjoy this DVD over and over again.  The choice of songs is well-balanced.
