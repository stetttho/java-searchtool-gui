 Beautiful Swimmers will make you feel like you are a part of growing up in the Chesapeake Bay region.  If you already did so, it will bring you back home.  Beautiful Swimmers serves as excellent literature for a multitude of readers:  naturalists, historians, travellers, and folks who enjoy reading a good novel.  It also provides a good blend of natural and cultural resource history.  I moved to the Chesapeake Bay area (Deale, MD) several years ago and was referred to Beautiful Swimmers by several members of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation.  Prior to reading Beautiful Swimmers, I grew extremely fond of living on the bay.  Since reading the book, I have that much more appreciation for the culture of the bay.
