 I purchased this book a year ago at a point where I knew nothing about powerboats.  Reflecting back... this was a really good book in that it explains everything you want to know (and don't want to know) about purchasing a powerboat.  There are entire sections dedicated to helping you decide specifically what type of powerboat you may want as well as sections dealing with boat inspections, sea trials, and techniques for purchasing.  The book is well worth the money.
