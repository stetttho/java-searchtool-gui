 I love this CD!  Although I am biased (owning several other The The cd's),  I cannot imagine most people not liking Mind Bomb's excellently composed  lyrics and enjoyable music.  If you're into great sounding music for home  (and espcially for playing in your car) then this one's definitely for you.
