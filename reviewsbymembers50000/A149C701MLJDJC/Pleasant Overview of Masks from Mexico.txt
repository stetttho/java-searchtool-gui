 I'm not sure why the other reviewer left only three stars (after praising the book).  Anyhow, Ruth Lechuga's book will compliment any book on the genre.  It is a superb overview of masks you will find from the various cultures within Mexico.  The pictures are nice and crisp with excellent detail (nice photography).
