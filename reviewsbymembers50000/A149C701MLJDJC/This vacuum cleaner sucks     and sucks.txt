 I purchased this vacuum cleaner about half a year ago, and it is still working extremely well.  I previously had another Eureka Whirlwind vacuum cleaner (some earlier model I purchased about 5 years ago); well, my previous model kept clogging, and clogging so I definitely needed something new.  So, as you can imagine I was a little bit apprehensive about purchasing another Eureka; however, have no fear... this machine is awesome. To be quite honest, I put a lot of credence in the reviews and opinions of other reviewers... and I think most everybody was dead-on right.  This vacuum definitely has good sucking power.  I think that a price you pay for this is the fact that the machine really wants to go... albeit it is not really 'that' difficult to handle.  Weight wise, it is a little bit heavier than my previous vacuum (but realistically not that much more)... besides, with that weight you definitely get really good stability while vacuuming and utilizing the accessories. The carpet/hard floor switch is an awesome shift when you need to do hard floors.  I must admit, though, that this is not the best unit for getting edges.  The accessories are easy to use.  And most important, I've had absolutely no problems with the unit; someone wrote about a suction problem... they should probably check to ensure that they seated the canister properly.
