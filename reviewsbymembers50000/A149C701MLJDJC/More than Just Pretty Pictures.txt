 I purchased this book for my mother.  Since she grew up in Vienna, I figured she would enjoy many of the recipes as well as the excellent photography provided in the book.  She enjoyed the book so much that she had me order a few extra copies for her sisters as well as a friend of hers (all of which are either American, Austrian, or Hungarian).  The are equally enjoying their copies of Kaffeehaus.  Noticing a couple mentions of 'small print' in other reviews, I asked them if this was a problem.  Nobody I asked seems to have a problem with the print size in this book.
