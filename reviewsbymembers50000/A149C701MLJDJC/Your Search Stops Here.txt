 If you have been looking for that cookbook on sauces, rubs, etc... you have finally landed at the right spot.  I purchased this book about a year ago and have tried about 25% of the recipes with great success.  The recipes are easy to use and simple to understand.  The book offers a good variety/balance of wet/dry finishes for your meat.  You will have a general sense of what the sauce/rub will taste like before you even get started.  My favorite is a recipe that condenses down ("reduce") 2 liters of root beer into about a cup or two of sauce (after you add additional ingredients).  You cannot go wrong with this book.
