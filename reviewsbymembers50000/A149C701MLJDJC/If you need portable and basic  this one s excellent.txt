 Wow, I really loved my Nomad Jukebox... a million years of music on one unit.  The problem was that when I took it on the train, I had to hang it on the back of the seat in front of me; when I went on walks, I had to bring a backpack to toss it in the back. In plain English, what makes the Kazoo an awesome unit is its size and simplicity... provided that's what you are looking for (you don't buy a Honda Civic expecting Porsche performance, style and handling).  The Kazoo IS small.  A 5-year old could nearly wrap his/her hand around it. It is simple: play, pause, forward, back, stop, random, repeat, repeat random, and a decent 'equalizer' called DSP that lets you select a type of music and base/treble etc. are adjusted accordingly (I like to put mine on Jazz... even if I'm listening to Ninjatune stuff).  As far as looks go, the unit is rather appealing.  The only downfalls may be no tuner (hey, price... size?) and the software is not as good as my Creative Labs software.  Also, I have not had any problems with sound, whatsoever. So, nowadays, I just hang the Kazoo around my neck or attach it to my belt... and off I go.   P.s.  I have the 64mb version, but haven't added an addition 64mb yet.
