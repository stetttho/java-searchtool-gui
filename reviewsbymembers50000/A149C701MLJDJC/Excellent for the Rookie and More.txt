 If you're as big of an idiot as I am, this book will come in handy.  I am new to watching the stars and cannot put my copy down.  The introduction is superb and does an excellent job in putting everything into perspective (historically and spacially).  The rest of the book serves as an incredible manual to the stars with superb photos and descriptions.  This book is a must!!!
