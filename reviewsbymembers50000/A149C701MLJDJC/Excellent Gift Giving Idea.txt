 This is one of those books you come back to because it is so neat... you will also want to share it with your friends.  I purchased a copy of this book for myself as well as one for my brother (as a Christmas present).  The quality of the print is excellent where you get to view postcards in great detail (front and back).  Many of these will make you laugh and some might even make you cry.  It is amazing how reviewing many of these postcards will take you back in time.
