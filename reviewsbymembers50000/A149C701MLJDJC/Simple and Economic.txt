 This unit is very easy to use (even a monkey can use it!!!).  There is not much to loading batteries into the unit and getting started.  Most everything else is pretty intuitive; however, if you are the instruction reading type... the instruction are very straight-forward (as opposed to confusing instructions I've seen with many other electronics).  Additionally, the price is definitely good.
