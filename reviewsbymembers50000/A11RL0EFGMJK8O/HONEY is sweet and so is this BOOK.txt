 Sue Monk Kidd is an incredibly desciptive writer; not only in decribing the setting of her story but also in how she describes the feelings of her charactor in this novel, The Secret Life of Bees.  Lily Owens in the protagonist in this novel, who is tortured by her abusive father but even worse, her earliest memories that swirl around her deceased mother. Kidd spins her yarn in the first person point of view, which is very effective in evoking emotion from her elegant prose in this, her first novel. What an amazing novel it is, my friends. I loved reading her thoughts, that are abundantly sprinkled on each page, like a beautiful dried flower from your grannie's flower garden.  Take this thought, for example: The Honey Song: "Place a beehive on my grave and let the honey soak through. When I'm dead ad gone, that's what I want from you. The streets of heaven are gold and sunny, but I'll stick to my plot and pot of honey. Place a beehive on my grave, and let the honey soak through."  Wow...it just leaves a reader wanting more...like a spoonful of honey tastes like....more!  Kidd describes scenes in such a magical way...she truly has magical thought that lifts your thinking...here's another.. "That night, in my bed in the honey house, when I closed my eyes, bee hum ran through my body.  Ran through the whole earth.  It was the oldest sound ther was. Souls flying away."  This book starts off running and you're able to keep up despite the rapid pace. I loved it and I recommend you read it and savor each word as if it were a loving spoonful of honey for you to taste and devour to your good health!
