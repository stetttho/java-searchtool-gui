 This beautiful, hard cover book has much to offer any person who is interested in caring for KOI> I bought the book as a Christmas gift for my husband's folks... They just installed a 16 X 33 foot Koi pond in their back yard. They have three little waterfalls the aerate the water, and are in the process of adding appropriate plants. They really do not know a thing about KOI. But I guess it's a new hobby for them....they're retired and perhaps need a new direction in life. I hope they read this book before they lose too many of those expensive, shiny fishies! I read the book prior to giving it to them, and it details the many names and types of KOI, (which means CARP in Japanese.) The book explains how one would proplery build an in-ground Koi pond, and shows many examples of how to go about this. It's facinating...did you know that KOI require a high protien diet for their health, and to maintain their beautiful, bright colorings?  There is quite a variety of food available to give them. There is a ton of useful information in this book about KOI, and it makes a very nice gift for the Holidays. MERRY CHRISTMAS TO ALL!
