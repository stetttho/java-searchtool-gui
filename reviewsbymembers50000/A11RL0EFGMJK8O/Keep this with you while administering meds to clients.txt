 I teach nursing, and this DAVIS Drug Guide for Nurses is a must-have for all my students as they learn how to professionally administer medications to their clients.   All nurses should have a convenient system to use when the occasion arises that a nurse gives a medication that they are unfamilair with...I found that this DAVIS Guide is a quick and easy way to investigate the medication, it's indications, contraindications, nursing considerations and idiosyncrasies.  Adverse reactions and normal dosing ranges are included for all medications ..... There is also caution advised to prevent medication errors....near misses are always preferred over real errors any day.  How the heart skips a beat whenever that happens! Nurses NEVER intend to make errors, and this book gives a cautionary tale in the beginning - to help professionals understand the grave seriousness of it all. It's never too late to buy an informative drug guide, and here I recommend this book to ALL --- professional or not. It's cruicial that all people who give medications or take them understand the actions of the medications comprehensively. The more one knows the more choices they posses. Before you pass the meds, pass the DAVIS Drug Guide!
