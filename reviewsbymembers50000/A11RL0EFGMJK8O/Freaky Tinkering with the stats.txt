 In deciding whether or not my economics would support the purchase of this book, I thumbed though it and stopped at the name selection section --- this just grabbed my attention. The authors compiled some unforeseen data from California birth records since 1960 until the present times and they studied the data closely to reveal the importance of NAME SELECTION. Now parents should really pay closer attention to what they choose to name their offspring, because names can be a child's destiny.   What I appreciated the most from this wonderful book is all the original thoughts that went behind the statistics of our world. It makes wonderful banter at cocktail parties; but be careful of how you would come across: lots of the arguments presented in this book can be classified as politically incorrect. That's what sold me on this book, by the way. The political incorrectness of it that directly addresses many social issues in our world. Read this book and refresh your own point of view....the contents of FREAKONOMICS will influence your conversations and make them sparkle like they've never sparkled before! Some may comment that your thoughts have evolved into the freaky side of political incorrectness, but heck. At least your friends will not be able to slap a boring label on ya!
