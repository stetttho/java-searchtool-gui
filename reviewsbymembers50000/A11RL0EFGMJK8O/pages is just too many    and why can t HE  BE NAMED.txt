 Harry's life seems to be spiraling out of control in this adventure, but what can one expect of a young wizard who is adopted by mean muggles and is world famous and secretly wealthy?  JK Rowling did another superb job of it, but I think it was a bit stretched out and tiring. "HE WHO SHOULD NOT BE NAMED," really is getting worn out, why the heck don't we just call him by his name and pare down the page count, Ms Rowling?  What's the big deal about saying his name -- VOLDEMORT?  It's really a silly old name, you know. I am not devouring this book in the same manner that I relished the first four books.  It's hard to pinpoint what the problem with the writing is, although I can start with  too much familiarity  in the plot development. There is also alot of jibberish baggage in the subplot evolution, for instance - I forget who Cedric is, and what are Phineas?  It gets more complex as the plot thickens... Honestly now, JK Rowling has all the money in the world...I think she should stop writing now while people still pay attention.  Perhaps the sixth book will not be such a show stopper after # 5.  Have fun reading this one....it'll take a while.  All 870 * pages of it; pass the VISINE !
