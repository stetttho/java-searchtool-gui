 Madonna aims her second book at the young man's market, where the main charactor, Mr. Peabody is the local school teacher who also coaches baseball during the weekends. The local boys have so much fun in the little league games that they do not notice the long losing streak they had been having. Then one day, Tommy Tattletale spies Coach Peabody taking a shiney apple and did not observe payment of the fruit. Gossip begins in this wee little town. Next thing you know, the town has turned against Coach Peabody, all due to a misunderstanding. The moral of the story is as old as apple pie:  Nobody likes a tattle-tale because tattles can bring a fine, upstanding person to ruin. I liked the goosefeather metaphor; like so many feathers floating in the breeze, it is easier to slander a person than to restore their tainted reputation. Boys will like this tale, and it gets to the point quickly. Lorent Long was commisioned for his beautiful illustrations that help to tell the story....I'm glad Madonna used the baseball analogy --- it's bound to capture young hearts and teach a valuable lesson to boot.
