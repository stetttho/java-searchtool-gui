 What drew me to purchase "The English Roses," were the colorful and bright illustrations created by Jeffrey Fulrimari.  He draws with much energy and originality; the English Rose girlie-girls are unique and unlike anything you've seen before. It has alot of the same appeal as little French Madeline, and that I find very refreshing and beautiful. The storyline is one typically found amongst our little girls, (peer jealousy.) There is no mention about eight year old boys in the storyline..which is a shame, since I bought this book for my eight year old son. He is an excellent reader and I wanted to reward him with a colorful new book that would magically arrive at our doorstep after school.  He didn't really appreciate reading the book, he said it was, "All about silly girls," but he did enjoy the drawings. Perhaps her next book will focus more on boyhood musings; for her adorable little son's interests. Madonna's first effort in children's books is a credible one, and it would be nothing without the fabulous illustrations done by Mr. Jeffrey. The lead charactor, Binah, is a reflection of what it must have been like growing up in young Madge's shoes.... She came from nowhere and had not much, and grew to be a rock and roll icon, and she never quite got over the hurt that other women inflict on her because they are jealous of her success. Perhaps this story is a way for Madonna to let others know she is not a threat, but can be a good and worthy friend .... A delightful reading experience! It promotes the thinking that girls can grow up to be anything their hearts desire...and this is the best lesson ever because it's TRUE>>>>>......even grown women can learn something important from this book.
