 One Small Step took two and a half hours.         "First Man" takes a giant leap into the personal abyss of what is known of Neil Armstrong's private life; which is what makes this book unique amongst all other books that were written in unauthorized fashion about the man. Armstrong was the first human being to ever step foot atop the lunar surface back in June of 1969 - making real President John F. Kennedy's big technological dream of sending a man to the moon and bringing him back safely within the end of the decade.  Armstrong was his own person, not bowing to any other person's moods or demeanors.  He was a dryly technical person who could trouble shoot and fly highly specialized aircraft like none other.  He also came face-to-face with death a time or two before his big Apollo 11 mission to the moon. Armstrong lost many a close friend in fiery explosions and technical errors that were part of the Apollo journey.  He himself had his share of injuries and accidents, but none of it was to interfere with his greatest achievement; landing first on the Moon.  It was as if God appointed him since before his own birth to hold this distinction amongst all great pioneers.  Neil Armstrong was the first man on the moon....Buzz Aldrin was second, and holds the distinction of being the only astronaut properly photographed on the surface of the moon.  Michael Collins was the fly-over man who completed the mission.  All three men will be famous for all time: they referred to themselves as, "Amiable strangers." They weren't especially close friends, but they were able to work for hours alongside of one another, highly focused on the tasks at hand and eager to fulfill the mission in the most professional manner. 	This book starts out very dry....the first 16 chapters are chock full of reviewed technical details that are, in my opinion, quite tedious to read over.  I didn't fully understand all those intricate details that were printed in this fine book, and I feel that pages and pages of these details  do not contributable to the overall story of Neil Armstrong's life.  But then again - every detail is important in the face and consideration of history.  Mankind may never step foot on the moon ever again.  A book written like this one preserves forever these tiny details for future dissection of this important mission, and the most famous triad of in the history of space exploration. 	Chapters 17 through 25 start the ball rolling and we come to understand the extreme training and human endeavors that Armstrong had to face and conquer before his big mission. The decision to place Armstrong first on the Moon was discussed at length in this section of the book.  Aldrin really wanted the honor very badly, but this was not meant to be.  	Perhaps the most stellar of all ideology and essays conjured up in this book are contained in Chapter 26, "Dialectics of a Moon Mission." In this chapter, the author, James Hansen, attempts to describe Armstrong's persona and how the press was forever pushing to get a personal opinion out of the man.  Hansen wrote that Armstrong had this "Sly privacy of a man whose thoughts may never be read."  Hansen wrote that people acted like, "Psyche-eaters and psyche-gorgers," trying to figure out the inner personality of the fiercely private man.  What precisely was within Armstrong's deep inner soul regarding the moon landing was always kept private within him.  Hansen described Armstrong as being extraordinarily, judiciously restrained in his demeanor.  Furthermore, Hansen described Armstrong as becoming an, "Oracle of ancient times, a medium, wise prophetic, mysterious, by which fortunes and misfortunes were told, deities consulted, prayers answered."  It frustrated a great many people that Armstrong was so quiet with his thoughts in regards to this epic mission.  Thus begins everybody's quest to understanding the psychology of astronauts...it would require one giant leap for the average American to understand the inner psyche of Neil Armstrong. 	Interesting that the Apollo 11 Moon Landing Mission backed by 400,000 scientists, technicians and other assorted brainiacs resulted in the Armstrong and Aldrin Moon visit moon visit time to only 2 hours and 31 minutes and 40 seconds. On page 521 it reads, "The time between the hatch opening and its closing was two hours, thirty-one minutes and forty seconds."  Neil's actual quote upon stepping foot atop the moon was, "That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind."  The two astronauts had many experiments to do in that short frame of time and that gave Aldrin an iron-clad excuse to why he did not take a single proper shot of Armstrong during their moon walk. People were very upset with Aldrin over this omission of his duties, and to this day psychologists may argue that it was the vengeance of Aldrin. 	Returning safely to Earth was the beginning of the end for our hero, Neil Armstrong, because he was sent in motion to do a world tour in celebration of his grand achievement.  This made him bitter for reasons still not explained; it was as if he developed this great resentment for becoming an international icon.  I personally gathered from reading this book that it meant that because he became an international treasure, he could never go up into space again.  Was this the seed to his great dissatisfaction? 	His wife of 38 years, Janet, became quite frustrated with Armstrong also, and decided she was going to take him to the dark side of the Moon.  She filed for divorce due to his ever constant business with everyone on the planet except for her. Even though Armstrong was basically the same man he always used to be, he would never find his Sea of Tranquility with his wife ever again. He neglected her on a regular basis, and no wife can put up with that indefinitely.  Janet writes that she had to wait a full year before the two of them could go on a ski holiday with their family.  She finally had enough of the First Man and sadly, she never had her moment in the sun being his First Woman.   He was heartbroken over her departure from his life and due to the stress of the divorce; Armstrong had a heart attack in 1991 while on a ski holiday.  He became very depressed and begged Janet to return to him, but she could no longer live with the personality of Neil Armstrong. She has since launched a life of her own and is a much happier person. 	Out of the dark blue depression, Armstrong met a lively woman named Carol whom he wed in 1991.  I gather that he decided that ignoring one's spouse is just not the fair way to go about being married and he changed his ways. The book tells us that today Mr. Armstrong is happy and healthy and still continues to travel the world extensively. 	IN all the book contains 654 pages - it tells the tale of the greatest American technological achievement of Apollo 11.  It is an excellent book that is relentless with all details regarding the Moon landing back in 1969.  It even discusses people who debunk the fact that the US landed on the Moon, which I found to be quite hilarious.			  What I found to be most important of all is the book's explorations into the private life of a public hero, Neil Armstrong.  Many people are happy that finally a book is finally written and authorized by the man - after all this time.  It is high time that that world has some understanding of this highly complex and famous man.  Armstrong's legacy lies in what is most humanly genuine about his life's story.
