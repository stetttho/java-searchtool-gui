 Once you slip this hot pink, fat little book out of it's book sleeve, you will be impressed and amazed by the beautiful victorian-flavored drawings inside of it. I got it because of the artwork contained within, and one would be happily engaged in this book once they knew of the visual treats they were about to encounter. This book has limited dialogue pertaining to the history of food -- finding it - preparing it - serving it and eating it. Which I feel ADDs to the book on the whole. There are not many books on this planet that offer so much optical enjoyment for so little money. Check the price; you will be tempted to want one for your own book collection.  It inspires a person to take out the old charcols and dabble in an artful composition or two. I love this book, and so will you!
