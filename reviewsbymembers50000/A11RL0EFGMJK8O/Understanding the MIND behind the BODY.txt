 This is great reality TV - I bought this for my hubby who loves Arnold for his body-buidling greatness, but he dislikes him for his Republican loyalities. I myself LOVE all aspects of Arnold, and I wanted to learn more about the man, WITHOUT having to subject myself to watching the TERMINATOR series of movies. (NOT my kind of movies...)  I just wanted to have some insight on this beautiful, magnificent man, who seems to have made all the right decisions when it comes to major life events. He came from nowhere and he had nothing. But he moved to the right place, America, because he made the right friends....Joe Weider to begin with. He married the right woman from a famous Democratic Family. He lives in California and now has the TOP JOB in the state. If you want a little peice of reality of what is going on in the mind of Governor Arnie, well ---- look no further. Here it is....it's funny --- it's intelligent. It's super shrewd marketing of a super-human being. I loved the DVD and I drool over his body big time!
