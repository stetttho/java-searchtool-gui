 "A Painted House," is an interesting story...very nicely plotted and subplotted and a nice change of pace for the author who is famous for writing legal tales of mystery and suspense. I appreciate him stretching out his new legs on this story about a young farm boy and one particulary tough summer. No law mentioned in here, which proves Grishim can write whatever he feels like writing about. Yeah, buy the paperback.  It'll paint some pretty pictures in your head....if you saw it on TV already, that's okay. The book is much better .... really.
