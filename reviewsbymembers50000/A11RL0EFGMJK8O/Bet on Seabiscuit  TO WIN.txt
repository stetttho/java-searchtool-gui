 This book is written with historical accuracy and the author took great pains to get it right..down to the edgy details of fraction times. There were times while I was reading this novel that I found myself scooting towards the edge of my chair, waving my arm and encouraging SEABISCUIT to WIN! IT was very exciting and simply and beautifully written.  Ms Hillenbrand spent four long years composing this novel, which may be her masterpiece work. I encourage all people who love horses and love to read to spend some time parked in front of this compelling book. You will go away dazzled and will have learned a great deal about our nation - pre and post depression.
