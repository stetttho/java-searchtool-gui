 If you are one of the few people in this world who LOVES her/his job each and every day, consider yourself extraordinarily LUCKY! (You many think of this book as wasteful of your time.)        As for the rest of us, we could use a little deep thinking on the subject of what it is that we DO for a paycheck.   Do we need to keep doing what we are doing - or should we change it? This handy little book explores the things some people did that were GOOD, and what other people did that were NOT so good at all.  The reader is encouraged to apply what she has read, and hopefully - it will transform the trajectory of her life....The aim is to redirect oneself into a life more worthy.  After all - professional work requires tons of personal effort..shouldn't it be fun at least SOME OF THE TIME???                              If this book helps someone to spend some valuable time examining thier professional life; it is well worth it. No, this handy little book will NOT TELL YOU WHAT TO DO with your life -- it only begs the questions -- is what you're doing worth one's effort, and do you really wish to waste much more time spinning your wheels at something you HATE and DETEST doing? One can appreciate the interviews Mr. Bronson conducted, and the time he spent traveling alone in order for himself to reflect on his career as well. I'd say Bronson is in the right business. I found the book to be most inspiring. One additional unexpected bonus (that means nothing at all)...Mr. Bronson is surprisingly handsome.  Not to insinuate that authors are bad looking, but I was pleasantly surprized to see his lovely face at the end of the book. If he gets tired of writing, I suppose he could choose modeling as a career alternative!  HA!
