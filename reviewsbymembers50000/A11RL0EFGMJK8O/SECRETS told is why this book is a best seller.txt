 49 weeks on the LA Times best selling books for FICTION tells you that talented author, Alice Sebold has crafted a good story that stemmed from a horrendous murder of a 14 year old girl. I'll cut to the chase on why this book is worth your time --  it tells seldom - told secrets about death, Heaven and souls that occupy our world.  Places like convalescent homes, hospitals, old theaters and old restaraunts feel so familiar and friendly to the living because our departed family members and good friends still hover over them...not all the time....but Sebold expands on the possibility of what the dearly departed do with all their spare time.  It's creativly written with kindness of heart and gentleness of the soul....and it encourages us all to believe in the goodness of angels near and far. Sebold explains in a comforting way what Heaven will be like for us all on our fateful departure from Earth... Heaven is unique to each individual - it is the stuff of our simplest dreams...and every Heaven is expandable and you make new friends....FAMILY however, is always family and there can never be additions to it unless it is created on Earth. There is a lot of sadness surrounding young Susie Salmon's death --- but life goes on --- life goes on --- and the dead never want us to be saddened by our loss of them. I think this book could help those who've lost loved ones to violence....its a real winner.
