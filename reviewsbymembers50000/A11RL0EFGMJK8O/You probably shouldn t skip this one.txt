 Christmas time means many things to many people, even Jewish people.  Grishim manages to capture the frantic, craziness of the holiday season on this thin little book that one can read in one night, providing they are all through with their Christmas shopping -- UGH!   Definitely, pick this one up next time you're out spending way too much money on everyone except yourself.  Drop the few bucks $$$ and splurge on a little literary enjoyment just for little ole YOU!  I think you're in for a treat. Reading a short book is such a great diversion during Christmas time, and you'll be tempted to do what the main couple do in the story. Oh yesssss........once you see how they plan on skipping Christmas, you'll plan your escape as well. Happy Holidays!
