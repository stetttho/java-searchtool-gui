 I've been a fan of Creedence and John Fogerty since I was 9 years old - the powerful sound that is signature Fogerty is what gave me the courage to rebel and become the person I am today. Fogerty's "Deja Vu All Over Again," song is a masterpiece that deserves to be heard in the white house.  I don't know how Fogerty does it after all these years....he is an important artistic icon from the 60's! Still power-hitting some fantastic and timely songs - - it's unreal! MY second favorite song from the CD is "Sugar, sugar," an original upbeat tune written by Fogerty in an updated form. "Honey Do" has a bluegrass flavouring to it, which is lively and enjoyable.  "Rhubarb Pie" is a song containing a hidden meaning, and it's an instantly likeable classic song, having a blue-grass feeling to it. Finally, "Wicked Old Witch" brings back a Creedence swamp rock sound to it, and the album also contains 5 other very good songs that keep the listener entertained and thirsting for more. Fogerty tells the world that his life is finally where he wants it to be in terms of love and personal happiness.  The CD "Deja Vu" is the opposite of "Eye of the Zombie" and let's just say that unhappy CD could be forgotten once a person hears "Deja Vu." John Fogerty remains as masterful a songwriter in the new CD, and I for one, am overjoyed that he is still puttin out those songs for us to hear and be inspired by. This CD actually did exceed my expectations, especially the title track, "Deja Vu."   Where Fogerty's muse backs up to is a mystery to me, but he has a fountain of great ideas just waiting to be published and recorded.
