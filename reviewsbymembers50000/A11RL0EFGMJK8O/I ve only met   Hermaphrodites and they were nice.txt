 I'm in the medical field - I've been a nurse for 27 years and I've only run across 5 or 6 such individuals ala intersexual' and it's a rare, rare book indeed that can carry on such an intellectual discussion on this condition. What I learned that I valued the most is that modern western medics and nurses and parents should act in haste when encountering such a special person. Sexual ambiguity is what it is....medical people were well-meaning when they saught to correct it, but they possibly could have destroyed the true gender identity of a intersexed individual. Living in the enlightened society of today, with western modern standards, there is a lot less "fear" associated with intersexed persons.....more facination than fear anyhow. This book is very intellectual - but understandable by the average college-read person.  I encourage all persons who have become aware of this 'condition' to pick up this fine book - read it - and learn a bushel-full of facts regarding hermaphrodites and the various 'forms' people come equipped with. I have only yet begun to understand that this condition may be more prevelant than ever considered before. This is a very facinating book and it comes with my highest recommendation for a truly underrepresented topic.
