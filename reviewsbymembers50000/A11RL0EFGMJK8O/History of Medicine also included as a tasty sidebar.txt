 I encourage all persons who are still alive to read this book right away but --- Don't read this book in a library or any other place that humans are expected to keep silent.  WARNING: Contents of "STIFF" will be cause to giggle, chuckle and discourtesly LAUGH ALOUD --- so, read this book in loud and disruly places.  It is a hoot and everything in it is true and accurate information.  Ever since I read "STIFF," I can't stop thinking about cremation for my own remains.  I can't get the maggots out of my head....it's sad.  Until I read this book, I never considered my Roman Catholic burial and funeral.  No rotting or gleeting for me, no siree!  Cremation is the only way to go.  I am such a tidy thing... Before I exhaust my thousand word limit, I have to inform all the potential readers of this book that the author, Ms Mary Roach did a lot of painstaking research on the history of anatomical dissection and study.  There's a bunch of great stuff on the historical perspective...the ancient grave robbers have a chapter dedicated to themselves and their naughty obsessions.  But how else will we have learned about all the stinky stuff our bodies house?   I now have a healthy respect for my life and while I am alive, I best communicate with my family what I want done with my remains after I die.  Thanks to this book, I now know how to tell when I'm dead...I don't want to rot and putrefy.  Nor do I wish to bloat...I guess rigor mortis is unavoidable though... HEY -- Have a nice day!
