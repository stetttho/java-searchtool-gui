 Barry Strauss has written one of the best books of 2004. If history can be seen as a teacher for the present, this is it. With a solid and clear understanding of ancient Greek civilization, warfare and naval history, he brings the battle of Salamis alive in the context of the Greco-Persian War of 480-479 B.C. He does it not just with outstanding scholarship, but with a talented literary skill that gives a true human meaning to characters, events and the myriad of all those little and not well-known details that are History's real substance. It's fascinating how he starts each chapter trying to see the events through the eyes of Herodotus, or Themistocles, or Xerxes, or Artemisia, or one of the lesser known but equally interesting characters of that thrilling and trying time. You read "The Battle of Salamis" almost as a riveting novel, with the plus of its historical accuracy. It's just captivating. I sincerely believe it could be a very good candidate for the next Pulitzer Prize on Nonfiction.  This is the story of Athens, the world's first democracy, in a time of war, bitterly divided, with no certain allies, standing up against the powerful mosaic of the Persian empire forces and getting a brilliant but unexpected victory that paved the way for the Age of Pericles and the Western Civilization. Reading it in the troubled world of our days helps to get things in perspective. Who says classic history is boring? Get this book: you'll find a precise combination of historical expertise and gifted storytelling.
