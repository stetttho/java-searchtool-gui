 This is a difficult to find book and that's a pity. It really deserves a reprint. If you can get your hands on a library or an used copy, don't hesitate to read it. In 1982, while running for governor of New York, Mario Cuomo kept an almost daily diary to keep things in perspective. That's exactly what the book is about: A gifted politician, who's not afraid of using ideas or admire them, makes his case about campaigning for office without losing his soul. From the daily little things that conform a modern campaign to high-flying discussions of values and issues that still at the core of the American political process, Mario Cuomo demonstrates a self-evident truth: Intelligence and politics ar not at odds.
