 Historical novels, good ones, are a valuable source to grasp the human dimension of gone civilizations and past epic events. That's what Steven Pressfield has done in "Gates of Fire". He has crafted a riveting story and a memorable cast of characters that take the reader to the battle of Thermopylae and life in Sparta and Greece during the Persian invasion of 480-479 B.C.  The first chapter, where Xeones, the axis character of the novel (who is nearly among the dead), is chosen by Apollo to tell the story of those who died in the battle, is just powerful and very well-written. There begins a mystical tale of honor, loyalty, courage, sacrifice, friendship and love. These values, that were at the core of Greek lifestyle at that time, are really the unseen and most important characters of the novel.  If you enjoy epic history and good fiction, do yourself a favor and read this book by one of today's best historical novelists.
