 Miniter's book is the first global chronicle of the war that America has been waging since September 11, 2001. In the context of a very different kind of war (one that is really fought not only abroad but at home as well, against an intelligent, subtle and elusive enemy) he has made a good effort, limitations aside, to show what can be seen as a scoreboard of what George W. Bush's administration has done up to date. His book is agile and clearly written. He has a point. It really deserves to be read.  In this time when many Americans seem desperate to recover the innocence lost on 9/11, which is impossible, Miniter's effort should be commended. In addition to this book, there are another two that should be read to keep memory alive: "The 9/11 Comission Report" and The New York Times' "Portraits of Grief".   One last thing: Please remember that this site is to review the book. Don't be confused: Poll boots will be installed near where you live on November 2.
