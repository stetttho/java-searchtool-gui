 I have been interested in George W. Bush ever since he was elected governor of Texas in 1994. Like all human beings, Bush is not the cartoon character his critics believe nor the last Coke in the desert his ultimate fans would like him to be. This book can be read as an official biography of the Bush campaign for '04. The author had access to the president himself and to the Administration's top players. It's well and clearly written. If you are an eyes-shut-Bush-fan this is a book you want to read; if you're not, you will find it hagiographic.  One of the most interesting facts about Bush is his unpretending nature (there you have a sign of real intelligence; and watch out, don't confuse it with stupidity.) But in this book, from the very beginning till the end, the author insists in portraying an unbelievable perfect human being. Even previous admissions by the president himself about his wild youth are dismissed. There's hardly a single word of critic from the many friends, members of the Administration and Republican politicians who were interviewed by the author. But once in a while Bush's own voice slips out of the pages, and there he is: unpretending; intelligent; really trying to be compassionate, but not always succesful; believing one can change the world out of pure will but getting the hard facts of reality instead; strangely aware of his imperfect nature; and, last but not least, deeply, contradictory human. That's why I give it four stars.
