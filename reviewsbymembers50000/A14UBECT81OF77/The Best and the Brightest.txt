 This is a memoir full of lessons for everyone interested in the human side of politics. Bill Clinton and George Stephanopoulos formed an interesting and intelligent partnership for nearly all the eight years of the Clinton Administration (and the previous campaign.) I still can't figure out the reasons that made Stephanopoulos finally turn away from the man that gave him the greatest opportunity in his political life, even when he tries really hard to explain those reasons in "All Too Human" (in "My Life", Clinton says he didn't have a clue about George's dissapointment until he read this book.) May be Dick Morris (that brilliant and cynical mercenary) had a lot to do with it, and also Clinton's lack of emotional closeness with Stephanopoulos in the really difficult period between the elections of 1994 and the victory of 1996.  Be what it may, "All Too Human" is a highly readable political memoir. Stephanopoulos is a fine writer and has a sharp talent to comunicate feelings and images. That's the case of the fascinating encounter, for example, between him and Bob Woodward. One can see the "draculesque" atmosphere when the author met Woodward in his Washington house. Woodward was writing "The Agenda" then, and wanted to get information from Stephanopoulos. "The Agenda", unfairly it seems, resulted in accussations of leaking for Stephanopoulos and was one of the reasons for the beggining of the decline of his fortune in the Clinton White House. Imagine that: the rising and youngest star and the ultimate wolf of journalism in town meeting face to face. It's just captivating.  The best and the brightest of the Clinton era tells it all here. His is a story not to be forgotten. Beware: Politics in Washington is indeed the most fascinating, seductive and dangerous of games.  Read it. You'll end reading it again. Then read it one more time and after that watch some of "The West Wing" episodes. You'll find certain, how to put it?... Distance.
