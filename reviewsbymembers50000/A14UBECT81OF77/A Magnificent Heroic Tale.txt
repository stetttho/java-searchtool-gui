 Steven Pressfield has written one of the best novels on Alexander the Great. "Virtues of War" captures the essence of Alexander as supreme warrior and relives his heroic character (in the Homeric meaning of the concept.) In a journey that takes the reader into the conquest of the Persian empire and beyond, with flashbacks explaining the formation and education of Alexander, Pressfield's novel has fine insights on military leadership, strategy and tactics.  In this sense "Virtues of War" is a literary next step from "Tides of War". In that one, his third novel, Pressfield wrote a fascinating interpretation of Alcibiades (the forgotten but brilliant Athenean stateman and military leader of the Peloponessian War) and gave the reader truly original insights into Alcibiades's strategic thinking. Now Pressfield has gone beyond, because "Virtues of War" is also the tale of the education of Alexander's young brother-in-law in leadership and the art of war by Alexander himself, as he tells him his life and times as a way of getting things into perspective in the difficult days previous to the Battle of the Hydaspes River.  There are quite a lot of historical novels on Alexander out there, but I think none is as faithful to Alexander's true nature and essence as this one. Once again Steven Pressfield has written a great novel, one that reminds us how sadly far away we are today from that ancient heroic temper.  And, as always, the action, detail and agility of his battle scenes stills unbeatable.  Read it: It's one of Pressfield's best books.
