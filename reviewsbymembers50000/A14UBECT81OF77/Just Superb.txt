 This is the best watch I've ever had. Forget all those fancy and expensive brands: Luminox Navy Seals reliability and resistance are just superb. It has never let me down no matter the environment. And last but not least it has the plus of its really unique luminous system. If you're a pilot flying at night in the almost black atmosphere of the cockpit, you want one of these, believe me.
