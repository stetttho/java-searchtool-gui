 50 Cent's "The Massacre" is not "Get Rich Or Die Trying part 2" so with that out of the way lets talk about this 21 song juggernaut.  Lyricaly he is not the man that brought us " Power of the dollar" The lyrics sound kind of childish.  He talks about Guns, Guns, Drugs, Sex and heroin there is not much depth on this album. But he trys with "God Gave me style" a great song that shows how happy he is with his life.  "So Amazing" should have beem cut out the album, its 50's worst son of all time.  Producer Scott Storch has proven to be a great producer and he shines on this LP, He's the guy who ghost producing for Dr. Dre for years. "Disco Inferno" could have been written by a 7 year old, but hey it gets the women on the dance floor.  And "Magic Stick" oops i mean "Candy Shop" is the song that proves 50 can not come up with an original hook.  "I Dont Need em'" and "Position of Power" are better than anythin on "Get Rich" and are the best song 50 made in a while, these songs remind me of "The Power of the Dollar" days.  The rest of the Lp is on point and its not as bad as people are saying.
