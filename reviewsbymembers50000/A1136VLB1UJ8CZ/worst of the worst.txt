 NAS' NASTRADMAS is so bad it needs to be herd to be belived. It marks a all time low for Nas, for this is his worst. Not only Nas' worst but the worst album of 2000.   Nas seems to be on heavy drugs as he made this album, and worst the production is awful.   Nastradmas is a dent in an almost flawless career.    "Life we choose" starts things off well, the only above average song on the album.  "Nastradmas" is  corny,  The chours is laughable. "Some of u s have angels" is instantly forgetable.  The original version of "Project windows" is a classic, but the beat has been altered and a gay chorus kills it.  "Come and get me" is a classic premier beat, beautiful but Nas' average lyrics cant pull it off.  "Shoot Em up" Is Havocs worst beat in his career and the lyrics are halriously Bad.  "LAST WORDS" is borning.  While the lyrics on "Family" featuring Mobb deep are great but Havoc once again fumbles the beat (I think Havoc was a little to high during this pieriod)  "God Love us" Is the most ignorant song Nas has ever made saying things like "Next to Jesus on the cross was the thug n**az" wow.   "Quiet Niggaz" is a pathedic atempt to put on the awful Bravehearts.  Now on to "BIG GIRL" the worst song Nas ever made, so bad, so awful i cant even skip over this track without giggling.  "NEW WORLD" rips off the Toto beat as Nas predicts the future, really corny stuff.  "You owe me" is the second single produced by Timberland and an atempt to go commercial but it left people wondering what the heck is Nas doin.  Nastradmas is the worst of the worst when it comes to Nas.  Thank god he dropped "stillmatic" and regaind his title as a great Mc, but alot us wont forget Nastradmas.  Nastradmas is proof that even a great MC can make a awful album
