 The main problem with Star Wars - Episode II, Attack of the Clones is the special effects.  The actors look lost and confused most of the time because they are constantly behind blue screens.  The end battle looks like a cartoon, it looked like the actors were trapped in Toy Story world.  Another problem is the script, it is really lame, with lines like " Sand is corse, but not like you, you are everything soft."  its corny lines like this that make some scences laughable.  George lucas is probly the laziest dirctor of all time.  This film was not directed by George lucas it was directed by the good guys ofI.L.M Cause this movie is one big special effect.  Its sad to hear John Williams legendary score over this waste of a Star Wars film.  I hope Lucas trys a little harder with episode 3. Actually i pray.
