 I Just saw King Kong..actully i just experienced king kong and all i have to say is its breathtaking, wonderfull, funny, scary, and sad.  As i was watching i felt like a kid again, its one of those movies you have to see on the big screen.  Jack Black is great, so is Adrian bRODY.. But Watts is truly amazing.  Peter Jackson took the great story of Kong and somehow made it better.  King Kong is the best movie this year for sure.  See it in the theater.  The 3 hours go by really fast
