 STREET DISCIPLE suffers from lack of production, and wierd lyrics.  Maybe its me but while listening to some tracks i found myself asking "what the **&& is he talking about.  The album starts off good but slowley falls into average territory. I belive the album would have been alot better if he cut like  6 songs out and left it as a single cd.  Nas has proven he still has skills with "Stillmatic" and "God Son" but "Street Disiple" just has to much filler.  This album seems very personal so personal that Nas looses the listener, because we dont know what hes talking about. Producers Salim Remmi and L.E.S try to bring back the days of old and they do a average job. I think nas should bring back DJ PREMIER!!!!!!!!!!!!
