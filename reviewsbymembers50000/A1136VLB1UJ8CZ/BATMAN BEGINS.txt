 This is the Batman i will always remeber, although the joker is a bigger part of the film. Tim Burtons 1989 version of Bob Kane's dark comic book hero is the best Batman movie ever made no matter what critics say.  At the time i thought Burton was a bad choice, but i was wrong.  After this film Burton would make some of his best films Edward Sissorhands, Batman Returns and Nightmare before christmas.  Each of those films has a gloomy yet colorful production, But BatMan is Dark, really dark and somewhat depressing.  Michael Keaton is great at Batman but he owns the Bruce wayne role, he plays him troubled and quiet.   Jack Nicholson's Joker is the greatest villan in comic book movie history.  Nicholson is having so much fun with this part you cant help but to love him and hate him.  The new Batman film is good but is missing a few things: A Great score, Fun, Adventure, a good villian, and sillyness that made Burtons film so entertaining.  The movie is so good that it will give goose bumbs by the end.  If it was released today i think it would still be a hit.  Some say that the movie shows us the orgin of bat man. Yes it does but it offers nothing else, no sense of discovery, no joy, no fun.  Ill take Tim Burtons version over Nolans version anyday.
