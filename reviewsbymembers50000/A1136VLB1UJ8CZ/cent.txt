 Ahhh remeber the days hip hop was great.  A day when a person like 50 cent would not even be able to hold the mic at the party.  But now hes the king of so called hip hop.  With the release of the Candy Shop single, 50 cent has now lost respect from many of his hardcore fans.  The lyrics are so awfull, so awfull that its strange that people actually like this.  or do they.  Or are radio stations so gassed off this guy that they drown us with this garbage, when they can easily play quality music from artist that matter and have something to say.  "CANDY SHOP" is the worst song 50 has put out yet.
