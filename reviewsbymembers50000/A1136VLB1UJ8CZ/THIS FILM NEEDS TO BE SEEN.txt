 This movie needs to be seen.  Many people will be awoken to the horrific tragedy that took place in 1994.  Don Cheadle deserves some kind of award for his performance.  During the film i was filled will anger, and sadness but i was moved in a way that i could not explain.  This is one of the most important films ever made.
