 Is this guy really that great..no.  But the Beats are dope so dope that i guess i like it.  Actually no.  The Game's Documentary instrumental album may be a classic, but Game's lyrics are not consistent enough for me to recomended.   The game has his moments, but i found myself saying "thats was dumb" way to much.  So kids save your 5 stars for a real classic, but this right here aint one.
