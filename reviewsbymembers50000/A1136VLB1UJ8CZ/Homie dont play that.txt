 Im pissed off.  In living color was my childhood.  in many ways watching this show makes me relive my past.  But i can remeber so much more.  So much more.  Is there a reason, is my memoery playing games with me.  NO.  This is not in living color.  This is In living color with no soul.  The music has been changed into Techno rap that seems just strange.  In living color was known breaking Hip Hop into the mainstream.  But those great songs are gone.  I asked myself the fly girls seem lame. its not the fly girls its the music thier dancing to.  Where are all the music Videos  Shabba ranks Mr Ugly man,, vanillia ice.  Only thing ive seen is Mc hammer.  Why are they palying with us.  i dont care if i have to buy another set just give me those Videos and lost skits.  Please.
