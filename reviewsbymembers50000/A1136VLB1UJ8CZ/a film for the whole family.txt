 One of the greatest of all comedies.  Tom green in the directors chair gives us something to rememeber and show to our children in the future.  Freddy got fingered isnt all comedy there is a love story at the heal of this epic and  a story of redemption.  This is one of theose films you will watch over and over again with friends and crack up everytime.  This film can also be looked at as a gut renching story of overcoming child abuse and how some kids sometimes lie about to punish thier parents. To some the movie is depressing, to some sick, vile, repulisive  but to me its a vision of a man who we let into our lives for a brief moment.
