 This is one of the best dvds ive ever owned.  I watched, i learned and im very impressed.  Ive always wondered alot of thing about Dylan and now my questions are answered.  It paints the best picture possible about a man who changed music forever.  Dyan is a true genius.  Its hallarious when he aswering questions from dumb reporters.  "Do you listen to my music"  "No"  "So why you asking me questions"
