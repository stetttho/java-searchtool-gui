 The production on here is immaculate.  At the time you didnt need alot of money to get Dj Premier, Larger P, Pete Rock, Q-Tip to produce your alubm, you need skills. On one side Nas' Illmatic is a blueprint on how to make an album, On the other it is a lyrical masterpiece.  Every Line, every drum, ever sample is on point.  Illmatic wasnt a commercial hit, and thats part of its charm.  Illmatic has no room for flaws.
