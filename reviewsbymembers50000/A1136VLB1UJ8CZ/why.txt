 The cosby show is one of my favorite shows of all time but why is it hacked.  why is the cover and box so impressive and cant forget the 13 page book that comes with everything you want to know about the show.  But why? why did we get this sindicated mess.  All the episodes are incomplete and seems to go by to fast.  I know its DVD and im happy to have it but can someone tell me why?
