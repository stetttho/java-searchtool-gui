 'Spin' is not a good book in a literary sense, but it fulfils the need for a compelling read when you are trapped with a plastic tray in front of your knees at 30,000 feet. The story was suitably lurid, the narrative  fast-paced, and the plot overly ambitious and somewhat unbelievable. The  resulting combination therefore did the trick one dull weekend. It worked  for me. For connoisseurs of the airport lounge bookstore novel, this is  certainly not in the ranks of Michael Crichton or John Grisham, but it  certainly does work well in that genre, and I didn't close the last page  feeling that I had wasted the time I was trying to waste.
