 I had the opportunity to meet Peter Mansfield a few times when I worked in London between 1993 and 1994, a softly-spoken and dignified man who had made it his life's work to learn about and understand the Arab World and  its relationship with the colonial powers.  Sadly, Mansfield has since  passed away, but this book remains as a beautiful epitaph that is as close  to a definitive but digestible history of the Arab people as I've read.   Recommended for those who want to understand the big picture before  getting into the detail of the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict.
