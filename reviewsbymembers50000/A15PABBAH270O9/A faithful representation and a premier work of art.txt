 Joe Sacco's book -- describing "an innocent's walk" through the occupied Palestinian territories during 1991 and 1992 --  reminds me of my first trip there during the Intifada in 1989. Palestine Book 1: 'A Nation Occupied' faithfully evokes the realities of daily life for the  Palestinians of Gaza and the West Bank, the latter area in which I lived  from 1994-1998. Sacco accurately captures the striking images of the  region and conflict in this powerful graphic novel/comic book format, a  fabulous medium to introduce a reader to the Israeli-Palestinian  conflict. Palestine Book 1: 'A Nation Occupied' is distinguished as a  humble and honest account of one man's attempt to make sense of it all, as  well as a premier work of art.  Particularly chilling (and representative  of the testimonies collected by human rights organisations and the  testimonies of people I have personally known and interviewed) is the  account of a Palestinian father's torture experience.  Be sure and also  check out the second book, "Palestine Book 2: 'In the Gaza  Strip'" by Joe Sacco.  Both books together cover a wide variety of  other topics, including life for refugees, Israeli attitudes to the  conflict, daily life inside prison, and more. A faithful representation  of the atmosphere of a visit to Palestine, and a well-conceived  articulation of the conflict. Highly recommended.
