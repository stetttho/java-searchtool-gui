 Sharp is described by the publisher as "a collection the likes of which have never been seen before", a book with such "brilliant lenswork" that it allows one "repeated viewings that never tire or bore."  If you are a photo editor that wants to run images of celebrities that depict every pore, with contrast on the image so intense that the subjects look like coal miners on their way home after a day in the pits, then this is your man and he's in the phone book under Creative Photographers, Inc. In short, while Sharp represents an impressive roll call of celebrity faces, Parry's style is quickly revealed to be visually monotonous in the form of a collection.
