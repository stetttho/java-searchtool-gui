 I got hold of this book with a pile of others in a second hand store. Although I had selected the book specifically for its apparent airport lounge while-away-a-few-hours qualities, it was one of the first of that precious genre that I have nothing redeeming to say about. It was irritating and hard-work from beginning to end. The three protagonists were two-dimensional. None of them were appealing on any level, each cheating on the other and themselves pretty much constantly throughout the book.  The various secondary characters were actually more interesting. This is perhaps because Rees didn't spend as much time fleshing them out (read: turning them into cartoon characters like the protagonists).   The backdrop of most of the book, Liverpool during the time of the Beatles, was also two dimensional. You got the feeling the author thought that a few mentions of Brian Epstein and the Cavern would magically transport us there.  Uh, no. If on the off-chance someone offers you a free copy of this book, do yourself a favour and politely say, "No, thank you." You'll thank me for it.
