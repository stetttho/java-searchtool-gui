 1. When You Give It Away - A funky rock and roll song reminiscent in pace  and sound to much of the material from the "Dart To The Heart" album, "When  You Give It Away" is also lyrically powerful. The  song begins with a sense  of alienation as the result of both the harshness  of reality and the almost  existential absurdness of much of collective  human communication .   "When  You Give It Away" includes  possibly the first lyrical reference to both O.J.  Simpson and Prince  Charles. 2. Mango - Reminiscent of the often explicitly sexual poetry  found in "Song  of Songs/Solomon" from the Bible, Cockburn has  suggested this inspiration in  a comment that "lyrically, ['Mango' is  a] kind of a hymn to female  sexuality." Vocally, the song reminded me  somewhat of J.J. Cale. Slide bass  by George Koller gives the song an  earthy, jazzy, sensual feel. Kora by  Janke evokes the pouring of  waterfalls and the lush, exotic hint of  paradise. Margo Timmins' ethereal  lyrics provide the required mist and  sexuality for this romp in Eden. 3.  Last Night Of The World - If you've ever heard Cockburn play a solo   version of "Night Train" -- a song that would have been aptly  titled even if  it had been an instrumental -- you won't be disappointed by  this song's  strong rhythmical finger-picked guitar. Cockburn's acoustic  and Colin  Linden's electric guitars canter along side-by-side like two  horses, Linden  kicking in after a few solo bars by Cockburn, delivering a  clean, free, and  buoyant sound. 4. Isn't That What Friends Are For? -  This spoken song is a space-evoking,  lyric-scape that opens on a misty  forest, with percussionist Rick Lazar  populating the tree tops and ferns  with an understated but veritable zoo of  bird, animal and insect life.  I've got to say I'm no fan of country music,  but Lucinda Williams  contributes an unforgettable and world-weary vocal for  the song's  bittersweet but powerful refrain, "Isn't that what friends are   for?" that made me want to dig around for my cowboy boots and hat, and  take  the next train to Nashville. 5. Down To The Delta - Described by  Guitar Player magazine as a "rocking  McCoy Tyner-inspired jam",  "Down To The Delta" is very reminiscent of both  the sound and  melody of "Tibetan Side of Town" and the excellent  instrumentals  that Cockburn contributed to "The Charity Of Night".            6. The Embers Of Eden - The darkest song on the album, "The Embers  Of Eden"  is nonetheless lyrically and musically consistent in itself,  describing a  sexual nightmare that draws on imagery from the Fall of Man.  Some people  might find this a little tough to listen to at first. 7.  Blueberry Hill - Margo Timmins' duet with Cockburn, and Cockburn's  heavily  distorted guitar throughout the song, makes this a very fresh and  suitably  subversive rendition of an instantly recognisable tune. 8. Let The Bad  Air Out - A song that will be familliar to anyone who  attended Cockburn's  concerts five years or so ago. The music has been given  a totally new  reworking, with two distinct sections that keep cycling. The  lyrics are  delivered in a Dylanesque "Suburban Homesick Blues" kind of way,   and are a humourous poke at the general corruption and shenanigans of   government. 9. Look How Far - The spoken verse beginning to this song  tells us that  Cockburn is in autobiographical documentary mode. In an  August 1999 radio  appearance, Cockburn talked about the origins of this  song: "One of the  characteristics of the sort social side of what I  do is this constant kind  of, in a way, frustration of meeting people and  bouncing off them and going  away feeling like you've seen somebody that  you've really wanted to see, but  haven't had a chance to find out really  anymore than the surface of how they  are doing. And I had come away from  one of those encounters with Ani in  Toronto. She was playing in Toronto  when I was leaving town the same day to  go do something else and so I got  to catch a little of her before the  soundcheck and then I took off. And  that's what sort of set this song in  motion, it could apply to her, it  could apply to any number of people who  would find themselves, or that I  would find in the same way." 10. Deep Lake - For Cockburn fans who  enjoyed the "In The Falling Dark"-era  instrumentals, "Deep  Lake" is very much a hearkening back. The restful but  majestic  progress of the song brings to life the feelings of... well... a  deep lake  with some gigantic and awe-inspiring although, thankfully, calm  creatures  swimming around in its depths. 11. Use Me While You Can - The music  evokes the desert in the way that only  a resonator guitar and a well-spent  youth spent watching Westerns can.  Opening with a cascading kora melody,  joined soon after by Cockburn's  resonator guitar in an extended  introduction, "Use Me While You Can" is a  beautiful anthem to  the meeting in our lives of the personal and the  political, against the  backdrop of a ancient world stage swept by the "dust  of fallen  empires" that foretells our own passing. As this theme suggests,   there is no big crescendo finish to this album. It just fades away abruptly   - leaving you thinking.... Although, like all of Cockburn's material,  the album has a lot of immediate  appeal, it will also grow on you as the  complexity of the lyrics and music  unwind over time. In other words, you  aren't going to like everything  instantly, but on the flip side, you  certainly aren't going to let dust  gather on this album any time soon  either. However much you like the album  on first listen, it'll still sneak  up on you some. And don't worry, if you  liked "The Charity Of  Night", you'll also like "Breakfast in New Orleans,  Dinner in  Timbuktu".
