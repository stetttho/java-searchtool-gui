 Although the history of America's "special relationship" with Israel is by no means a unexplored topic for authors, Kathleen Christison's "Perceptions of Palestine: Their influence on U.S. Middle East  Policy" breaks new ground by its sheer scope of analysis, tracing 130  years of formulation of American perceptions of the Middle East, and their  ultimate manifestation in U.S. government policy.  "In the Middle  East," writes Christison at the beginning of her book,  "terminology shapes reality; it becomes a way of seeing reality, and,  finally, it is reality."  This single line, perhaps better than any  other, encapsulates the political landscape mapped by Christison's book, a  well-referenced 293-page investigation of the sources of the US mindset   that has shaped Middle East policies through twelve key presidencies from  Wilson to Clinton.  "Perceptions on Palestine" analyses the  state of knowledge of the president and key policymakers in each  administration and the preconceptions with which they entered office, by  examining - where  available - their writings and the writings of those who  most closely influenced them; by exploring coexistent popular attitudes  towards the  Middle East in the media, films, and literature; and by  looking at how each administration was influenced by the prevailing  conventional wisdom.  I would unhesitatingly recommend this book as a  standard text for anyone wishing to understand the reason for the prolonged  nature of the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict.
