 For the past 50 years, Nobel laureate Saul Bellow has been perfecting the *roman  clef* -- a novel in which real people or actual events are portrayed in fictional disguise. But what should we call a memoir in  fictional disguise? Bellow's latest novel, "Ravelstein," is a  thinly fictionalized character sketch of his late friend Allan Bloom, a  rakish classical scholar who wrote (at Bellow's suggestion) "The  Closing of the American Mind" (1987). But "Ravelstein" --  the "novel" -- is also the story of a relationship between two  men: Abe Ravelstein, an intellectual who becomes a best-selling author, and  Chick, an older writer who suggested Ravelstein's treatise on human nature  and the narrator of this story. Five years after Ravelstein dies of AIDS,  Chick faces the consuming task of writing a biography of the complex don,  whose outsized appetites for Hermes ties, Armani suits, and Cuban cigars  rival his esoteric fascination with Rousseau, Machiavelli and Plato.  Why  fictionalize this real-life friendship between two larger-than-life figures  in American culture? Only Bellow knows. Fictionalizing the story of Allen  Bloom might have allowed Bellow more flexibility with an intricate, humanly  inconsistent subject. Or it might simply have been Bellow's way of  exceeding the natural bounds of novel structure. To be sure,  "Ravelstein" swells with all the irony and artistry with which  Bellow has imbued his earlier novels. "Ravelstein" taken *in  situ* slides gracefully along it. It will stand among the best *writing* of  his long career. Still, "Ravelstein" is deeper than the words  on the page, like a ghostly image seen beneath the surface of water. Bellow  blunts the impact of Bloom's character and life by labeling it as fiction.  The lesson of a real life retold burns brighter than a memoir masquerading  as a fable.
