 If you go into a very dark room on a bright day and pierce the window shade, the world outside shines in. On the opposite wall, you'll see it, in all its raw colors and motion, picture perfect.  Such are the physics of past and present - like the equal-and-opposite struggle between light and dark -- in "Parts Unknown," Northern California author Kevin Brennan's first novel of the mind and heart, of memory and dreams. But the physics of the camera obscura are reversed as Brennan's pinhole allows the darkness inside his characters to be projected on the living world. Famed but fading desert photographer Bill Argus informs his young, second wife Nora that he wishes to return to his boyhood hometown of Pianto, Calif., to try to atone for abandoning his wife and young son 40 years before. But when he learns his deserted family has erased his memory - the whole town conspires in the myth that his middle-aged son's real father was a heroic test pilot killed in a plane crash - Bill's journey turns inward, dragging him along the landscape of his past. This journey into the past, through light and dark, across the sun-dappled ancient hills and headlands of rural Sonoma County, is largely chronicled by Nora. In Bill, she sees both a father-figure and her own reflection as a scarred, unrooted woman nearing 40, weighted down by her own history of loss and imperfect love.  Add "Parts Unknown" to the oeuvre of California stories that should transcend the state's borders All it needs is someone to pierce the shade and allow the light to shine through.
