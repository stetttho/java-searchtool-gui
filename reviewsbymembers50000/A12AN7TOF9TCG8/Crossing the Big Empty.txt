 In "CrowHeart" by John Gist, Wyoming's frontier history and contemporary events are told through the eyes of a family that strayed from the beaten trail and settled in "The Big Empty" against the  better advice of their fellow travelers. It is the story of the Daniels  family, descendants of a "crazy" group who left one of the main  trails through Wyoming in the mid-1800s. Gist's first novel, published by a  small press based in Mills, Wyo., is an exploration of some familiar themes  very similar to Doig's: Connection to the land over generations, family  troubles and complex conflicts in time, place and relationship. Gist's  characters are so obsessed with individuality they skirt personal  destruction. Gist has a ways to go before he's on a par with Doig, but the  essence is there Gist is a Wyoming native, with a master's of fine arts  in creative writing from the University of Alaska-Fairbanks. His poems and  essays have appeared in small journals such as Parnassus and Colours, but  Montfort Press of Mills, known mostly for its western historical  non-fiction, chose his book as its first novel. The book's release in May  1999 was scheduled to commemorate the U.S. Congress's funding of the  National Historic Trails Site, soon to be built outside Casper.
