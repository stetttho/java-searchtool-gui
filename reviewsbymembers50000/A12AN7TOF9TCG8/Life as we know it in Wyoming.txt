 In the farthest reaches of the Mountain West, where there are still unnamed streams, water is not just necessary to life, it *is* life, full of melody and mystery, the only stuff from which the Earth can conceal  nothing. Water is so vital to these vast spaces once called The Big Empty  that it flows through our dreams, our industry and our very literature as  both the real and symbolic essence of life.  So it is with Mark Spragg's  "Where Rivers Change Direction," a collection of essays about  Spragg's adolescence as the son of a dude rancher in a half-tamed part of  Wyoming where men have christened streams with names such as Sunlight, Mist  and Cloudburst.   Spragg's collection isn't about water, but about  growing up, not only as the son of a wilderness dude-ranch operator, but  also as a working-hand in the family business. From the one-room school in  Wapiti, Wyo., to the Crossed Sabers Ranch bunkhouse where he sleeps with  the other hired hands, Spragg paints a vivid portrait of life in the  American Outback. A new, lyric literature of the West is beginning to  trickle out of the high places toward the flatland, and Spragg's finely  wrought essays are easily equal to much of the beautiful fiction that is  beginning to define the region's connections between the living land and  the ever-changing self. In this book, a river runs through a heart.  For  men and water, one stream becomes another and a little more about our Earth  is revealed.
