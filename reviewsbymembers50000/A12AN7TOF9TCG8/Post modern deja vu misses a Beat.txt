 In the headlong skid through John McManus's collection of stories, "Stop Breakin Down," there's an eerie sense of post-modern *deja vu,* as if Generation X is channeling the Beats. This debut doesn't herald  a new voice as much as it heralds the discovery of an older voice by a new  young writer, and the effect is mixed. "Stop Breakin Down" is a  difficult book to read. McManus, only 22, has made the beginning writer's  mistake of elevating form over function. Perplexing, page-long paragraphs  and minimal punctuation obscure his real narrative message and punch. His  refusal to use quotation marks to separate dialogue from the rest of his  prose is, in this case, an affectation that ultimately only confuses the  reader. A lot of bohemian ink has been spilled in the name of post-modern  literature, some of it quite good, from Barth to Pynchon. But when straying  from the linear, Grand Narrative style, "pomo" writers not only  run the usual risk of bad writing, but the peculiar risk of being  incoherent, too. McManus isn't incoherent, but he also has not exploited  the pumping, streaming, raging rhythms of post-modern writing to their full  effect. What is the author's intent when he diverges from the conventions  of literature? Who knows, and who cares? The text itself is the thing, and  a reader should not dawdle about a writer's intentions. The story speaks  for itself, or it doesn't. The hallmarks of post-modern work -- anarchy,  radicalism, sarcasm and raw nerve -- sometimes provide the illusion of high  art, but in literature, the real art is the message and it should at least  be digestible and clear, no matter the style.
