 Hal Moore and Joe Galloway's account of the battle in the Ia Drang Valley is truly one of the most riveting accounts of men in battle that's ever been published. It is, at times, gut-wrenching. When the men who were there come forward to say, "Yeah, that's exactly how it was," then the reader should take notice. It's best for the reader not to dally on the decades-after-the-fact second-guessing by armchair tacticians ... they simply have a theoretical, perfect-world view that's less affected by bullets whizzing over their heads -- and through their buddies' faces -- than by textbook strategy and tactics.   Better, if you want some idea of the fear and confusion our boys in Iraq might be facing right now, read Moore and Galloway's account. It's a different war, a different enemy, a different place, a different time ... but boy's hearts don't change.
