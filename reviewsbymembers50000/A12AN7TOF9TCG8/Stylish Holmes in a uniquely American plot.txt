 Christopher Leppek has transplanted the great British detective to American soil to explore one of America's greatest crimes, the assassination of Lincoln. His attention to the facts in the true crime only  make this story more appealing. He has played fairly with the reader by  offering his fictional alternative explanation, to the point where I  momentarily considered John Wilkes Booth in an entirely new light. Leppek  captures the rhythms of Arthur Conan Doyle admirably. Holmes's American  fans (and fans of the number of Holmes knock-offs this century) should love  this story. And before it is classified as merely a mindless mystery  entertainment, it should be appreciated for its expertly handled message  (properly posed by a contemporary journalist): History is not always what  it seems. Good work, Chris. "The Surrogate Assassin" gave me  several hours of pleasureable and challenging reading.
