 This book is an excellent resource for a variety of readers who are involved with criminal investigations but don't really have all the tools and training of a full-time medical examiner. In my case, as a crime author, the text was an invaluable reference, putting some highly technical material into easily digested context. Recommended for laymen of all kinds who need a good reference work on forensic pathology.
