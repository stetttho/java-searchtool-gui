 Miles Hood Swarthout comes by his western sensibilities honestly: His father, Glendon Swarthout -- author of "The Shootist" and "Bless the Beasts and the Children" -- was in the vanguard of the "new" western literary novelists who blended history, landscape and character in a fresh way. Miles' new novel, "The Sergeant's Lady," is literally in that tradition, based upon one of his father's stories. It has all the hallmarks of a good, traditional western adventure, and the literary flourish of contemporary western writers. His beautiful writing and fast-paced action-adventure take us back to those golden days of yore, when good stories had both. For fans of the Old West, the Indian Wars, or just good fiction, this is a marvelous addition to your bookshelf.
