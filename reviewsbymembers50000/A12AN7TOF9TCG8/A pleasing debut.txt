 Any spoken language has unfamiliar words, but when the language is spoken from the heart, little is misunderstood. Lily King's debut novel, "The Pleasing Hour," is about Rosie, a teen-aged American au pair  in France. Empty at heart and yearning for a family of her own after  bearing a child for her sister, the pudgy Rosie swirls over an Atlantic  rainbow and lands in a new world where she works for the Tivot family on  their Parisian houseboat. While the children welcome her eagerly, she  immediately chills in the shadow of Nicole, their remote but urbane mother.  From the outset, Rosie is made more vulnerable by her halting grasp of  French. King brings alive a palette of colorful and robust characters  that might have been collected from an afternoon at a sidewalk cafe in  Provence. Their faces are sweetly familiar. If there's a fault in the tale,  it is Rosie's seemingly dispassionate voice. Gyrating in a maelstrom of  emotions and new sensual experiences, confronting new and old ghosts, Rosie  is as austere in her storytelling as we imagine Nicole to be in her  mothering. Of course, Rosie comes to understand that Nicole and she are not  so different after all, but they are not, in any sense, the same.Still,  this is a rich first novel about families lost and found from a promising  writer with an ear for the kind of language -- language from the heart --  that touches deeply.
