 Bird-watchers have field guides. Hikers have field guides. Even weed-lovers even have field guides. Now horse-watchers have a field guide. "Field Guide to Horses" by Kindrie Grove (Lone Pine Publishing, ...paperback, 176 pages) is a colorful and accessible  reference guide to identifying horses. If you like to look at horses, but  don't know a fetlock from a fore cannon, this is a remarkable little book.  Thanks to easy-reading summaries and sharp artwork, you'll be able to find  and identify horses by markings, coloring, gaits and behavior, and learn  about equine history, vernacular and evolution all at the same time.   This  is a great book for people who drive across the country and wonder what all  those pretty horses really are. If you want to go a little deeper, pick  up Gail Bunney's "Horse Stories: Riding with the Wind" (Lone Pine  Publishing, ...paperback, 224 pages). Bunney, a Canadian horse-trainer  who even got married on horseback, collects her own horse tales, trying to  convey some passion for the animals, as well as her own savvy and horse  wisdom. "These stories don't tell how to buy a horse, how to train a  horse, how to handle different temperaments or even how to break a horse to  ride," the book says. "They are stories about one woman's  enduring love for horses."
