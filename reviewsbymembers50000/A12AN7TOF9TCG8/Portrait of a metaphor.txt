 The tiger remains one of nature's most provocative metaphors for power, independence, grace and spirit, but a world consumed with symbols is hardly noticing as the animal itself sinks slowly toward oblivion. Now one of  the most intuitive nature writers of our recently past century, Peter  Matthiessen lends his poet's voice to the desperate effort to save the  tiger in "Tigers in the Snow." He makes an eloquent case for  enlightened coexistence between humans and tigers, starting in a remote  corner of Siberia where the species has staked its last best hope for  survival. Their impending extinction, he argues, would not only damage the  world's ecology, but also our collective imagination. "Tigers in the  Snow" is more analytical and less lyrical (and far less introspective)  than "The Snow Leopard." Mattheissen's fans will find  "Tigers" comparable to his 1992 book, "African  Silences," a sobering account of the catastrophic depredation of the  African landscape and its wildlife, particularly elephants. Indeed, as with  many ecological calamities-in-the-making, the causes of the Asian tiger's  decline -- hunting, reduction of food supply, man's encroachment and  government policies (or lack of them) -- tragically resembles the majestic  African elephant's deterioration.
