 The theme of fathers and sons reconnecting through baseball is growing more common, from WP Kinsella's "Shoeless Joe" to the new classic "Waiting for Teddy Williams" by Howard Frank Mosher. But Jerry Amernic has thrown us a curve with "Gift of the Bambino," united a son and grandfather through baseball and the sport's most recognizable icon, Babe Ruth. And his results are touching, insightful and often uproarious. Baseball fans will be delighted, but so will fans of stories told with flourish and grace.   Buy this book now, if only because it's difficult to find on chain-booksellers' shelves. To me, a book without the predictable, headlong, simplistic storytelling of today's mass-market books is a gem, and finding it is part of the reward.
