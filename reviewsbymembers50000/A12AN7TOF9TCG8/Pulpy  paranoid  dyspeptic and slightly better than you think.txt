 Palecek is a sick puppy, and proud of it. His world view is a little more paranoid than some schizophrenics, but hell, mental health isn't a requirement for storytellers. And, hey, maybe Palecek is the sane one and the rest of us are insane lemmings. As I read "Bigfoot" I had to keep reminding myself not to confuse authors with their protagonists, but Palecek has been fairly blunt about certain political qualities he shares with his protag, Jack Robert King, who happens (unlike Palecek, one hopes) to be an unsettled, unemployed, unbalanced hyper-liberal screwball-misfit who does little more than rant into the ether about on his Internet radio program.   His topics? The usual: Stolen elections, the obvious conspiracies to kill Kennedy and King, the Roswell cover-up, the Conservative Media ... blah blah blah. But he also puts forward the theory that the WTC attack was a U.S. government conspiracy, and the assassination of liberal Sen. Paul Wellstone in a contrived plane crash. Freaky stuff.  The story finally turns interesting when King hits the road from his Iowa home (at the Field of Dreams movie set) to the wilderness of Oregon, where his quest is to find an old baseball coach and learn the truth about Bigfoot. OK, still a little freaky.  But suddenly here's this freak Jack King in a classic hero's journey, rubbing up against stranger beings than Cyclops and Lotus-eaters on a never-ending bus trip. Whether by accident or shrewd planning, Palecek has contrived a smart story. Not perfect, not always palatable, not even remotely convincing in its politics, but away from the didactics ... pretty smart.  Don't pick up "Bigfoot" unless you think George W. Bush is the Anti-Christ and Dick Cheney framed Fatty Arbuckle. It's not worth busting a vein. But if you want to see what bubbles around in the heads of the Far, Far, Far Left, check it out.
