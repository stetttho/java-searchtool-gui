 "My Dark Places" has become a new classic in the genre of intimate true crime. Think about it: Most true crime is a fairly pedantic and formulaic affair in which a detached observer drops into the investigation (or maybe even the trial) and retells some rewarmed facts more or less accurately.   Very few entries in the true-crime genre have been written by professional storytellers with intimate connections to the crime and its aftermath. Vincent Bugliosi's "Helter Skelter" comes to mind ... and he was the prosecutor, not a relative or friend of the criminals or the victims. Ann Rule's "Stranger Beside Me" is another.  Ellroy's is even more intimate, even more visceral. The son of a murdered woman -- a cold case, nearly 50 years later -- he goes in search of her killer, as well as some of his darker Oedipal tendencies as he tries to explain himself and his mother's murder.  Without giving away the ending, I'll say this: It ends as most of these things do. In that, there's a ring of truth in this "true" crime.
