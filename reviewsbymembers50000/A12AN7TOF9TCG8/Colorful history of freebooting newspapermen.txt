 "Timber Line" explores the lives and times of Harry Tammen and Fred Bonfils, the flamboyant (and flim-flamming) publishers of the Denver Post during its yellow heyday. The two are the moral equals of the occasionally unethical William Randolph Hearst, even if the Post didn't nearly match Hearst's circulation. All one must know about these men is that their newsroom was known as the Bucket of Blood, because it relied heavily upon brilliant, often lurid red headlines to snag readers. Fowler was a marvelous storyteller and "Timber Line" ventures far and wide in telling relevant yarns about Tom Horn, Mollie Brown and many others of the Wild West's transitional period. Thus, this book is not just a profile of two swindlers who disguised themselves as legitimate big-city newspapermen, it reflects an important period in the West's evolution.
