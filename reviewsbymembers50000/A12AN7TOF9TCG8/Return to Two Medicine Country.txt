 It should come as no surprise to any fan of western literature that Ivan Doig has returned to the necessary soil of Montana to tell his latest story.  But that he has combined his familiar landscape and characters with a new twist might cause a pleasant wonder. In "Prairie Nocturne," the West?s pre-eminent literary novelist rides the wide-open range between Montana and New York City during the Harlem Renaissance, gathering a cast of players for one last inspired grasp at love and celebrity.  In a Faulknerian flourish that has threaded through five of his six previous novels, Doig again populates his seventh with some familiar faces in old settings. What Doig fan would be astonished to find the indomitable Angus McCaskill making more than a cameo appearance in Doig?s newest novel? And lest any reader think Doig?s beloved landscape has been relegated to a cameo appearance shorter than any McCaskill?s, fear not. No western writer ? and Doig is the prime living model for that species ? can escape the ageless countryside?s effect on either character or author. Doig?s poetic prose is growing richer and more subtle with each book, like a stone in a river.  In "Prairie Nocturne," as the narrative entwines the pasts and presents of its three principal characters, his essential themes re-emerge: family, landscape, childhood memory, loyalty, and the inescapability of our past. Doig?s characters, new and old, are unforgettable, and not just because he keeps bringing them back to life in subsequent books. He embroiders them with history, myth and sensuality. Combined with the timeless beauty of his own ancestral ground, they are fast becoming as much a part of the American mind-scape as the Snopes family of Yoknapatawpha.
