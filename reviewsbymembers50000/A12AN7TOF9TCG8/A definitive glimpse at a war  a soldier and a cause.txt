 As I stood recently at John MacBride's final resting place in Dublin's tiny, quiet Arbor Hill Cemetery, I reflected on this book about this Irish hero who led Irish and Irish-American volunteers against the British in the  South African War. Tragically, he emerged from the Boer War safely, but was  executed for his role in the 1916 Easter Uprising and his body dumped in a  mass grave with several of his patriotic comrades. His sacrifices certainly  helped lay the foundation for Ireland's freedom. This book focuses mainly  on MacBride's service in the Boer War, the politics and passions of the  Irish involvement, and his relationship with the flamboyant Maud Gonne, who  bore his two children. MacBride is not a perfect hero, which makes him (and  this book)all the more engaging. Dr. McCracken's book is well-wrought  history, finely detailed and comprehensively researched. It is also a darn  good story, well told. He's a devoted scholar and historian, and a fine  writer. I would recommend this work highly to any student of Irish  republicanism and/or the Boer War.
