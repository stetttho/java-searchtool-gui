 Most of the interior West is a space to be crossed, an unforgiving swath of rugged mountains and empty plains on the way to somewhere else. The final destination isn't always geographical, but is often a state of mind,  of self-worth or of sheer will. And all along the way are places where  folks have stopped to catch their breath or gather their wits before moving  on to whatever waits at the end of the line.  Such is the place explained  in "Mountain City." On the first page of Gregory Martin's  atmospheric memoir, only 33 people still live in Mountain City, just a  ragged shred of civilization in remote northeastern Nevada, like a scrap of  old newspaper stubbornly clinging to a sagebrush. The town's mining heydays  -- and there are a few -- are the stuff of both memories and dreams,  "a Western archetype for hope and failed hope and  failure": Less spiritual than "Dakota" by Kathleen Norris  and more desolate than "The Meadow" by James Galvin,  "Mountain City" celebrates the alternate Western seasons of  promise and pessimism, arrival and abandonment. Hardened like the place he  sketches against the vagaries of life, Martin writes sensitively without  being maudlin, as if pity were something he discovered late in life. He  finds beauty in the abandoned shacks of Mountain City, courage in the  elderly people who stay in Mountain City and trust the cycle of prosperity  to come 'round one more time. And he sees wisdom in the temporary and  mobile, like the trailers that come and go with the capricious fortunes of  time and place: Mountain City, the town, is unlikely to survive our  lifetime, but this book preserves it (and other places like it) forever in  the collective conscience, like a road sign pointing the way to a place and  a state of mind that no longer exist.
