 If you think you're the only person whose dad said "Not under this roof, you're not" or "You're not going out in THAT!" then this series is going to broaden your horizons! Hilarious and pitch-perfect, it captures fathers' "wisdom" (if you can call it that) in true form. As a father myself, I cringe to realize I actually have said about half this stuff! Hamilton has created a marvelous little entertainment that perfect for families where dad has often put into words the kind of man he really is! Buy it for the dad in your life, and read it together.
