 Russell Banks isn't a household name in American letters, and what fame he's scratched together as an author has come from powerful novels such as "Affliction" and "Cloudsplitter." But, like Hemingway,  Banks is best (and feels most free) when he writes short, and a new  compilation might finally give him his due as a short-story  writer. "Angel on the Roof" is a literary album of Banks's  greatest hits, 31 examples of what he calls "the best work I have done  in the form over the thirty-seven years since I began trying to  write." Twenty-two of the stories first appeared in four lesser-known  collections between 1975 and 1986; of the nine more recent stories, six  have only been published in magazines such as Esquire and newspaper  literary supplements. More importantly, Banks has freely revised many of  the old stories, so even his most ardent fans can expect to see something  new.  His stories are elegantly postmodern, beautiful and striking, full  of diverse voices and disquietingly vulgar settings. Some are only a few  pages long; others go deeper and longer. But many of his stories, though  sometimes suffocatingly bleak, are also capable of poignant humor and broad  satire. Perhaps the renaissance of the short story that finally elevates  Banks to his proper place among American writers. He ranks with John  Cheever as one of the masters of the contemporary form, if not in  name-recognition.
