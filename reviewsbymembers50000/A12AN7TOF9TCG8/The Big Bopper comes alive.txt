 During the recent anniversary of J.P. "The Big Bopper" Richardson's tragic death, I wrote a piece for The Bopper's hometown newspaper, the Beaumont (TX) Enterprise, about his life, his family and his legacy. These songs are an excellent starting place to learning more about the Bopper -- Richardson's jive-talking, flamboyant alter ego. And if this album gets you more interested in The Bopper's short life (he was only 28 when he died with Buddy Holly and Ritchie Valens) then you are in for a treat. Did you know that in 1958 The Bopper foresaw the advent of "music videos" (his term), the necessary visuality of rock and roll, and even filmed some of his songs to pitch his idea to Mercury Records? He did, and that's just a small part of the complex person "the other guy on the plane" was.
