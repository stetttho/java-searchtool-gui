 The Alamo is the holiest of Texas shrines, a haunted little mission built at the crossroads of fact and fiction, and in the gospel of Texas, perhaps a vestige of Creation itself. With characteristic hubris, Texans can  trace this new millennial world to the blood spilled at the Alamo, a game  of six degrees of historical separation: Without the Alamo, they say, there  could have been no Battle of San Jacinto. Without the Battle of San  Jacinto, Texas could not have existed. Without Texas, westward expansion  would have been stymied. Without the West, the U.S. would merely be an  Atlantic power, at best, and would not likely have risen to a world power.  And without the U.S. as a world power, the world as we know it today would  not exist. So there is no surprise that a gifted Texas writer such as  Stephen Harrigan would return to the touchstone of this single, epochal  event to tell a riveting new story, in much the same way writers have so  often returned to the story of Creation. This book is a new masterpiece  in the literature of fact. The strength of Harrigan's extraordinarily  authentic novel is in its superior storytelling, no small thing when  staring down the hot barrel of history.
