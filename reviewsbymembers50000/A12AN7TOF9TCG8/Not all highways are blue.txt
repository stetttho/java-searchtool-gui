 Some folks say the Interstate Highway System finally made it possible to travel from one coast of America to the other without seeing anything. But "Roads," Larry McMurtry's new collection of  essays, part Jack Kerouac, part William Least Heat Moon, part travelogue,  part memoir, offers a glimpse of places as remote as the human heart.   This collection of essays is not as much about roads as restlessness.  His routine is simple: McMurtry flies someplace, rents a car and drives  home to lonesome Archer City, Texas. On his dawn-to-dusk superhighway  sojourns, never slowing down for three-calendar diners, tourist traps or  even to visit friends, he won't even turn on the radio. The journey itself  is his destination. It's about going, not stopping.  At a level as  uncomplicated as a farm-to-market road, the highways of McMurtry's  collection are merely threads binding together his diverse musings on Los  Angeles, manifest destiny, Hemingway's furniture, the need for  rattlesnakes, the callowness (and shallowness) of contemporary Hollywood,  cowboys, young killers in the Heartland, old books, fatherhood, the yellow  housepaint in Key Largo, great rivers, the Holy Tortilla, and short  remembrances of several dead characters from his stories. His prose has the  quality of conversation on a long, long drive: a meandering, intimate,  unfettered discourse inspired by the passing landscape.  But in a larger  sense, "Roads" is a metaphor for the circular journey of  McMurtry's life.  It leads him to, from and through places where he  considered roads not taken, or where his personal or literary paths crossed  others, or simply where the quality of light through his windshield  illuminated a memory. "Roads" can be read as a natural sequel  to "Walter Benjamin": The boy who never read Hemingway or  Faulkner until he went to college now takes to the open road as a man to  ponder their legacies -- and his own.
