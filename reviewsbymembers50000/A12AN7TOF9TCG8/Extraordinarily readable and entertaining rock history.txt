 Larry Lehmer has crafted one of the better journalistic books about a historical rock 'n' roll event. He brings a newspaperman's observations and senses to the project, which connects all the dots in the tragic last tour for Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and the Big Bopper. "The Day the Music Died" is not only entertaining -- somber and occasionally macabre in appropriate moments, and humorous elsewhere -- but it describes the days and weeks leading up to the tragic crash in Clear Lake through the eyes of people who were there. In each case, he paints a vivid portrait of a fallen star, making their stories all the more tragic. To read this book is to understand how American rock 'n' roll evolved from its early, innocent roots toward the fragmented, even chaotic market it encompasses today. I highyl recommend this book.
