 Writers are endlessly second-guessing their work habits, their ideas and their purpose. As a novelist myself, I found this work-in-progress  comforting, because it showed that even the greatest writers struggle with  "The Process."  Fitzgerald's inherent talent shines through,  despite the incomplete nature of the work. The notes and other addenda  helped shape the story even further for me, leaving it perhaps more  fascinating for the wonder of what Fitzgerald might have done had he not  died so young.  I have groused in the past about the release of several  Hemingway books after his death, and none has come close to the feeling of  this unfinished work, but I cannot dispute the value to the reader of  seeing these words, these last words, of one of America's greatest  novelists. I am happy I got the chance.
