 Lorenzo Carcaterra remains the don of crime-writing that's scraped directly from America's grittiest streets, and with "Paradise City," he extends his reach to Naples -- a city he last visited in "Street Boys." Now he pulls off the labyrinthine plot -- worthy of a scheming godfather or, at least, a producer of TV's "Law & Order" -- with his signature style: Plenty of action, plenty of love and plenty of paisan.   From "Apaches" to "Sleepers" to "Gangster," Carcaterra has laid claim to the urban-crime landscape like no writer since Mario Puzo. Carcaterra's storytelling is real and, occasionally, disturbing. But it isn't oversimplified law and disorder with a side of blood and guts ... his characters are authentic and tangible.  He doesn't write like a lawyer who's trying to be gritty, or an ink-stained Hollywood wretch trying to maximize body count-per-frame. He writes like the guy he is: Somebody who's been immersed in the downside of a rough city and survived.  You want your crime-fiction straight from the hip and genuine? Carcaterra is your guy.
