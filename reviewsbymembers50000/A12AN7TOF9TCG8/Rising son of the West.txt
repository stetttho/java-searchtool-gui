 Last year, while exalting Larry McMurtry as the most popular writer of the American West, the Los Angeles Times relegated Sherman Alexie -- without specifically naming him -- to a group of praiseworthy Western writers who lack mass appeal largely because they explore only microcosmic corners of this vast region.     True, no contemporary author has succeeded in popular Western fiction like McMurtry, the old stud horse in the sparse herd of the regions literary writers.  But Alexie is the mustang: Wild, irreverent, defiant, bold, unpredictable, sleek, distant, erotic, swift and hard to corral -- everything McMurtry never was, even in his prime.   Not that Alexie cares. Hes a provocateur who never left a pot unstirred. Hes a trickster not above mocking himself. Hes a proud Spokane/Coeur dAlene Indian who is just as likely to skewer Indians as totem-loving liberals and Yale-educated conservatives (yeah, him.)  And hes a best-selling author who knows exactly how far to push the sensibilities of his gentler readers. And his latest collection of short stories, Ten Little Indians, once again shows him to be not just one of the Wests best, but one of the most brilliantly literate American writers, even funnier than Louise Erdrich, even more primal than Jim Harrison, and even more eloquent than Annie Proulx.  Since his 1993 debut, The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven, Alexie has had few, if any, sacred cows. Including Indians. As with his last collection, The Toughest Indian in the World, the reader is submersed in yarns that are sometimes funny and sometimes heartbreaking, where Indians find themselves between worlds, between lives, and between loves. Ten Little Indians comprises nine easy pieces in the puzzle of Sherman Alexie, who ranks with the best, even if he stands alone.
