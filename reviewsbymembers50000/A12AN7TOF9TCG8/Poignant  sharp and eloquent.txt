 At what moment does a man stop being alive and start being dead?  Death casts its long, dark shadow across the fevered cast of characters in "Prisoners of War," but it is unlived life that truly haunts them. And life tantalizes each one just beyond the fences -- real and imaginary -- that hold each of them captive. The result is a portrait of people at war -- with enemies abroad and with themselves. POWs are expected to try to escape, and the consequences of failing can be fatal. But what happens when an escapee doesn't cross concertina wire and elude floodlights, but crosses bloodlines and eludes the stultifying glare of intimate history?  Yarbrough, a native Mississippian who now teaches creative writing at California State University in Fresno, is a sophisticated, gentle writer with a gift for subtlety. The latent heat of a Delta autumn wafts through his absorbing prose as surely as the complexities of small-town life float through his Southern memories. His voice is genteel and a little nostalgic, but neither fragile nor elegiac. His characters are superbly fleshed out, and his settings so richly drawn that when the action traverses the county line late in the book, the reader might feel as if he is leaving his own hometown.   Or escaping.
