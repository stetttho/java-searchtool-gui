 This is an enormously easy-to-use travelogue/history book that takes readers on a journey through events that shaped Texas history. The authors have a long history of their own writing about accessible historic places and lessons, especially for kids, and this book is no exception. They hit the high points of extraordinary people, places and events (although a few more contemporary notable figures and spots are noticeably absent) and provide a logical unfolding for the traveler.  It's worth the effort and worth the time to use this book as a guide for your next excursion into Texas yesteryear.
