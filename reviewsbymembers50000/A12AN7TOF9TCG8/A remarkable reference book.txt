 A friend shoved this book in front of me during research for a historical novel, and I found it fascinating! It is a comprehensive guide to the real garb and tack of real cowboys in a real frontier, not a Technicolored  Hollywood wardrober's fantasy. I found it expertly written and illustrated,  detailed and enormously helpful. This isn't the kind of amateur historical  pap you see so often in this category, it's the Real McCoy. Anyone who  wants or needs to know how cowboys and frontiersmen dressed needs to pick  up "I See By Your Outfit."
