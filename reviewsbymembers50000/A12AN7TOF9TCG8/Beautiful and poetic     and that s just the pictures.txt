 Pairing startlingly beautiful photographs of the most minute aspects of life -- neurons, cancer cells, adrenaline, anthrax bacillus, embryonic stem cells, sperm and egg, DNA and more -- with great thoughts of scientists, clergy, philosophers, writers, political leaders and artists is utterly ingenious in this book. For example, a gentle blue photograph of a breast cancer cell appears beside a quote from Mother Teresa: "I know God won't give me anything I can't handle. I just wish He didn't trust me so much." This book not only offers a glimpse inside the human body and related "landscapes," but also a glimpse of great thinking. I found myself marveling at the photographs and mulling the ideas that appear with them.
