 Sooner or later, the cruel mathematics of risk will crush even the luckiest gambler. That's why the Hallorans don't believe in luck and certainly won't risk any more than they've already stolen. Set in Hawaii  in 1971, "Gambler's Rose" is an anything-but-tender story about a  family of card sharps. Trained almost from birth to beat every mark,  Charlie and Reggie Halloran can read almost anyone at a glance -- except  their father, Music Halloran, a one-eyed professional cheat who has called  them together for a game that could ensure they'd never have to cheat at  cards again.  Of course, one of Music's grandest lessons for his  double-dealing sons was:  No game they'll ever play is an honest game. And  the endgame he's contemplating will be anything but fair. In 13 chapters  of "Gambler's Rose"-- perhaps a salute to Music Halloran's belief  that nothing is accidental -- Hawkes deals a full-house of high-stakes  poker and higher-stakes love, and how a player determines the risks worth  taking. The card games themselves are occasionally difficult to visualize,  but one needn't be a poker player to grasp the essence of Hawkes's message:  Maybe the only games worth winning -- including life -- can't be  manipulated. Poker clearly isn't a new literary metaphor for life, but  few have done it with Hawkes's technical precision.
