 As a journalist and author, I recently found myself referring to Dr. MacDonald's book for a very complex tale of rape and murder. His grasp of rape issues, their underpinnings and their ultimate effects is eloquently stated and well organized in this text. His experience in forensic psychiatry, supplemented by his advisory work for the Denver Police Department and consultation status for the courts, is a valuable resource.
