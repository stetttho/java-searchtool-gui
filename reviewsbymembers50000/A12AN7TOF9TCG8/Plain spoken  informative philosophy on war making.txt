 I was given a copy of "Fighting for the Future" just before I was sent to the Middle East to cover the American war on terrorism. I found it absorbing, plain-spoken and helpful, not just for a war correpsondent covering "a war unlike any other," but for common citizens who care about how American soldiers must adapt to a brave new world of war. We certainly face a new battlefield, and since the US military is so often accused of fighting the last war, this book is a sobering treatise on how we must change ... or die.
