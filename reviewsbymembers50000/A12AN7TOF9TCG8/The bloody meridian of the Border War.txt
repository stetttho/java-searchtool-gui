 James Carlos Blake, the descendant of an American pirate in the Caribbean, once said he wanted to write the most violent book in American literature.   In "Wildwood Boys," he might have succeeded. But the savage  narrative isn't driven only by the body count nor the visceral horror in  his account of barbaric guerrilla warfare; what makes this book truly  horrific is the pure poetry and haunting beauty of Blake's writing.    This  is the richly re-imagined story of William Anderson, the real-life  bushwhacker protg of William Quantrill, the ruthless sacker of Lawrence,  Kansas. For most of the Civil War, Quantrill commanded lawless,  Southern-sympathizing brigands whose mass murders, rapes and calculated  terror devastated pro-Union towns in the border states -- until he was  eclipsed by the living, gore-splashed myth who came to be known as Bloody  Bill Anderson. Of course, historical fiction wouldn't succeed if it  didn't disturb the placid waters of  allegedly true history. Blake portrays  Anderson as a moral monster: a lover of dumb animals and poetry; a  cold-blooded guerrilla who questioned the massacre of civilians, but did  nothing to stop it; a principled leader of soulless pirate-warriors such as  Jesse and Frank James, and Cole Younger; a devoutly loyal son and brother;  a pathological hater of Yankees; even a handsome and gallant romantic who  marries a young prostitute because she reminds him of his spirited little  sister -- with whom he had a vaguely incestuous kinship. Anderson's  famous 1864 raid on Centralia, Mo., is recounted in graphic detail,  reworked to blunt the razor-sharp edge of traditionally accepted accounts  of the terror he wrought. And by the time Bloody Bill is shot dead a few  months later, his bullet-riddled corpse photographed and desecrated by  Union troopers, the reader actually feels some sympathy for one of the most  prolific mass-murderers in American history.
