 If not the king of Texas crime-writing, Rick Riordan is certainly among the princes in a royal family that already includes James Lee Burke and David Lindsey. And in "the Last King of Texas," the third in  Riordan's Tres Navarre series, the San Antonio suspense author proves he's  no pretender to the throne. "The Last King of Texas" is a wryly  funny book, not dark, but definitely dusky. His metaphors are apt and  entertaining, especially when they seem to parody the purplish gravity of  some of Riordan's heroes, such as Hammett and Chandler: "She laughed  with all the warmth of rattling aluminum foil" or "(a meal) with  a enough cornbread to construct a small toolshed." With his sardonic  voice, his tarnished virtue and his unlucky-at-love-and-rental-properties  back story, Navarre is a low-rider knight in rusty armor. And Riordan just  might be the king after all
