 For more than 120 years, Jesse James has hidden out in the badlands of the American heart, a moral paradox, half myth and no more than half human. In outlaw hagiography, he is surely the darkest angel. Now, "The Chivalry of Crime," an impressive first novel by Desmond Barry about the unholy  terror of Jesse James, allows readers to touch the very root of violence in  human nature and explore the American fascination with outlaws Barry, a  Welsh immigrant fascinated by the fantastic tales of the American West, bit  off a huge hunk of frontier mythology and chewed it fairly thoroughly. As a  new work of "re-imagined" history, "The Chivalry of  Crime" is perhaps not as literarily weighty as Stephen Harrigan's  "Gates of the Alamo," nor as quirky as Cormac McCarthy's  "Blood Meridian," although Barry is a writer of equally enormous  talent. The book's flaws are rather minor and technical, and it remains an  entertaining historical yarn.
