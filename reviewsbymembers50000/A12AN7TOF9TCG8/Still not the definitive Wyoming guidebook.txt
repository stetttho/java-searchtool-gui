 Add another travel guide to Wyoming's burgeoning outdoor-activity series. "The Wyoming Guide" by Sierra Adare (Fulcrum Publishing, $17.95 paperback, 256 pages) is better than many of the destination-oriented books  that have been recently published for the Cowboy State, with lots of  "factoids" and user-friendly breakouts among the well-organized  listings.  It divides the state into six distinct regions, then subdivides  those regions by major attractions, listing unique and interesting sights,  history, fun things for families, restaurants, lodging and more. The amount  of information is wide, but not deep. My own town's listings, for  instance, aren't much different from most other guidebooks' listings. They  hit the high points in Gillette, Wyo., cursorily (Dalbey Fishing Lake,  McManamen Park, coal mines, golf, etc. Unfortunately, the new book lists  the closed Goings restaurant among the city's six eateries, even though the  Goings was closed long before the book came out -- and a new one opened  long after. And it touts the city pool as a great place for water sports,  but completely omits the Campbell County Recreation Center. Perhaps worse,  the only accommodations listed for Gillette are a single  bed-and-breakfast. Sierra Adare, who lives part-time in Rawlins, is a  capable travel writer, and her "Wyoming Guide" is a good book to  pick up if you take family day-trips or like to give guidebooks to help  your out-of-state visitors ferret out interesting Wyoming places. It's  impossible to keep track of the marketplace in a state where businesses  come and go faster than January snowstorms, but there remain many sights  and travel resources that are often unlisted. So far, the elusive  comprehensive Wyoming guide book hasn't been written.
