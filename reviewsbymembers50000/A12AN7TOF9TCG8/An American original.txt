 In the great tradition of American parody, sarcasm and satire, Jon Stewart is Mad Magazine, National Lampoon and Saturday Night Live, wrapped up in one hilarious ball of 21st century humor. Far from being a Lefty poking fun at Righties (although Stewart -- the person -- certainly is that), this book doesn't discriminate. So if you're a humorless Lefty who cannot imagine anyone poking fun at your sacred cows, go buy Al Franken's book and allow your sensibilities to remain unchallenged. (And the same goes for the Right ... except you might want to pick up Anne Coulter or Bill O'Reilly's books.) But if you aren't on the unthinking fringe of Left OR Right, check out this book and get a laugh or two ... or three ... or more.
