 In this bittersweet memoir about growing up and growing old, Dermot Healy explores the quality of memory, of tales told and heard and told again, of times half-remembered. Highly stylistic prose reflects the stream of human  consciousness, where sometimes a leaf floats past and we think we recognize  it as a leaf that floated past a year before. Dermot Healy's "Bend for  Home" is part "Portrait of the Artist" and part  "Angela's Ashes," combining the ambient grey of Irish poverty  with characteristic Irish humor. Healy has been criticized for betraying  his mother's memory in the book's sometimes hilarious, sometimes wrenching  last chapter. But it is one of the most touching accounts of a son and  mother's last days together since I read Mark Spragg's "Where Rivers  Change Direction." What would make his mother proud is knowing that  Healy has become one of the first rank of Irish authors, and his account of  her decline is a sad, beautiful piece of work. Healy should be more  widely read in America, if only because his is an original voice in a new  key, Irish accent or not.
