 It's nice to know that while corporate crimes dominate headlines, an old-fashioned courtroom drama about murder can still stir the blood.     OK, maybe Enron isn't yet the stuff of best-selling crime fiction, and maybe Scott Turow's new novel, "Reversible Errors," doesn't break new ground for legal thrillers, but it might be a pleasant distraction from obsessing about your plummeting 401K - and wishing white-collar corporate criminals could be hanged. Fans will recognize the romantic subplots that have imbued Turow's characters with depth, frailty and humanity, and so often played a role in the legal dramas he contrives. Love and sex are woven inextricably with law and order to tell a story of human dimensions, where characters' passions are exposed in both the bedroom and the courtroom. And in both cases, those passions can redeem as well as cripple. Happily, "Reversible Errors" is not a polemic on the death penalty, even though Turow is a Chicago lawyer who has often argued real-life capital cases. For him, a looming execution is a plot thickener, not a chance to take sides in the most debated element of American jurisprudence. He portrays good and bad people on both sides of the bar, in and out of prison. Writer-lawyer Turow doesn't write like a lawyer, but his legal descriptions are occasionally as labyrinthine as modern American crime and punishment can get. Fortunately, those moments, as authentic as they might be in reflecting the twisting and twisted nature of the court system, are brief and rare for lay readers. Turow plays the reader like a jury, sucking us into sympathy with his clients er, characters until we are completely in their world, ready to believe anything. The verdict? "Reversible Errors" is a sleek legal romp wrapped in stylish prose, and it makes a good case for Turow's primacy in the world of legal thrillers. And, oh, at least one filthy corporate executive dies.
