 As I cast about for research material for an upcoming book, several American Indian War experts recommended Don Rickey's book as the "Bible" on the frontier soldier's life. I am not an Indian War  buff, but I can tell you this book is chocked full of details and insights  that are not likely to be found collected in any other single volume. The  book is broken down into logical chapters, from a description of the  Western troubles to the typical routines of the soldiers' discharges. We  are treated to what might be some of the last in-depth interviews with  Indian War veterans and, as has been pointed out, we begin to get a feel of  the frontier soldier's daily life as 99 percent boredom and physical labor  and 1 percent terror. Many books have been written around the edges of  this subject, and several were awful in their historical value. But this is  a solid history, well-researched and full of interesting anecdotes to boot!
