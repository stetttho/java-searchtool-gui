 A stranger knocks on your door. He has good news and bad. A distant uncle you never knew has died, but he's left you a fortune. It's a dream come true. Or, in the case of Chris Larsgaard's new thriller, "The Heir  Hunter," it could be the start of a nightmare. Larsgaard offers an  insider's primer on the murky world of skip-tracers and other people who  hunt for humans. And just when you thought it was safe to send your credit  card number to an allegedly "secure" Web site, Larsgaard serves  up about a hundred more sinister reasons you shouldn't even talk to another  human being for the rest of your life if you truly value your  privacy. "The Heir Hunter" is original and cool. Larsgaard's  debut is a masterly bit of suspense writing.
