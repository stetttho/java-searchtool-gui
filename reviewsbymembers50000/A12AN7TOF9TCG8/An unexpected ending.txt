 The only real disappointment in Sebastian Stuart's debut thriller, "The Mentor," is that his entire cast of characters isn't murdered. Unfortunately, it's a happy ending that doesn't happen. So much  for sympathizing with characters. But Stuart deftly guides us through the  celebrity-obsessed Manhattan swirl (where his friendliest figure is a savvy  literary agent) and the media mayhem (where the worst thing that can happen  to a writer is a snippy review in the *New York Times.*) He stuffs the tale  with enough name-dropping and publishing-insider details to give it  authenticity, and certainly doesn't glamorize the shallow little world his  characters occupy. The fact is, "The Mentor" is a pleasing  entertainment, occasionally witty and completely accessible. Okay, so you  secretly hope these characters find a way to pull off a spectacular  three-way murder. In the standard version, all inflated with heroic  happysmoke, they would. But it doesn't happen, so by definition, "The  Mentor" has an unexpected ending. That's just part of the thrill.
