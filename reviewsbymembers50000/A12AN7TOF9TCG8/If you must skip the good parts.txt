 I am still digesting "Ulysses." I read it while walking around Dublin a few years ago. It was marvelous to trace the steps of Leopold and Molly, and to see what they "saw," but the novel remains a distant pleasure to the reader. I must admit it is not the most accessible book ever written, but it gets four stars for its intent ... and that it is better than "Finnegan's Wake." Be warned: This novel is not for the casual reader. But I remain convinced that it is better to read Joyce than to read a summary of Joyce. Cliff's Notes is a worthy service, and generally well done, but I fear too few have actually read "Ulysses" (or several other Joyce works) so I would urge the gentle reader to delve deeply into the novel before surrendering to Cliff's Notes.
