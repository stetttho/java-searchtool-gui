 I picked up "Soiled Doves" while researching an upcoming novel that features a fictional character much like the real women Anne Seagraves describes in this short, entertaining book.  My perpective ... both as a  man and a writer 100 years later ... was greatly expanded by the stories  she tells.  For my own purposes, I had hoped for more detail about the  day-to-day life of these women, but I still found an enormous amount of  anecdotal information that suddenly made these women of "negotiable  virtue" more human. "Soiled Doves" is rare as a readable,  interesting and generally well researched history. Mrs. Seagraves  occasionally gets carried away with some interior perspectives that would  rankle historical purists, but as a casual reader I was enlightened and  entertained.
