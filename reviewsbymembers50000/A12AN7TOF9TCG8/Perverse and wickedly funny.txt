 Contrary to misguided popular belief, some books you can tell by their covers. One glance at the jacket of George Saunders's new story collection, "Pastoralia" -- a plastic deer chained to a light post, with a  thought-bubble containing a caveman -- and you know this is a seriously  peculiar book and maybe an arrestingly original writer. He might be  bizarre, but Saunders's first book, "CivilWarLand in Bad  Decline," was a finalist for the 1996 PEN/Hemingway Award and a New  York Times Notable Book. He's won three O. Henry Awards,  two National  Magazine Awards, and The New Yorker lists the Syracuse creative-writing  professor among the 20 best American fiction writers under 40 -- all  potentially a blessing or a curse to a writer who has a bright future  spitting on media-driven appetites. But, just like in  "Pastoralia," anti-heroes abound, even thrive, in the underbelly  of modern America. Saunders is an odd one, but refreshing, nervy and  outrageous. He could be a star.
