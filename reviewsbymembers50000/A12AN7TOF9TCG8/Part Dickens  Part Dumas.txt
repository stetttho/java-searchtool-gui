 "Empires of Sand" is a panoramic tale of two worlds in which the best of times and the worst of times are parallel, where every loyalty begets a treachery and every intimacy foreshadows a great divide. As two  friends now confront the ghosts of their intermingled pasts as they  struggle with the true meaning of integrity and loyalty. In this sweeping  yet precise epic, Ball has created a swashbuckler for urbane readers.  Ball's voice recalls, by turns, Michener and Clavell, Sir Richard Burton,  and even Alexander Dumas. As a narrative, "Empires of Sand" is  part "Beau Geste," part "A Tale of Two Cities."  He  blends actual historic events and details with his engaging fiction. And  it's not just *what* he says, but *how* he says it. His storytelling style  is literate and graceful, erudite but adventurous.
