 The Irish life is an exuberant, cantankerous harmony with a choir of ghosts. In Eire, the past is passion and even the newest landmark looks like the oldest place you ever saw. And Roddy Doyle captures the melodic  cacophony of Irish history, passion and appetite in his new novel, "A  Star Called Henry." It is narrated by Henry Smart, who takes us  through his first 20 years, from his birth into Dublin's savage poverty in  1901 through the romance of his naive young mother and one-legged alcoholic  father.  The real ghosts of Ireland's rebellion drift in the background  of this novel, providing harmony to Henry's fictional life. The heady  passions of Dublin and the quirks of its people are spun into the yarn so  deftly the reader will actually hear a brogue in Doyle's dialogue. It's  funny and moving at the same time, an Irish peculiarity. But it is also an  immense story about a small island where ghosts walk among the living, just  as Henry Smart walks among us, real as a Dublin fog.
