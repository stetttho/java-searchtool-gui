 Jon Billman's collection of stories is a joy to read, and it resonates with an authenticity that makes a reader want to believe it all. Billman's characters are marginal and marginalized, caught in a range war between the  the herd-fear of conformity and a place that demands robust individuality.  People molded by their surroundings, both geographic and spiritual. As a  Wyoming writer, I found its tone pitch-perfect. Recommended.
