 James Carroll has made a career of stories in which the grand sweep of history is summarized in the infinite choices of fallible and flawed people, and his first novel in nine years now becomes part of his intensely intricate oeuvre. "Secret Father" blends the grandest drama of our time -- the Cold War -- with a journey by three idealistic and rebellious teenagers into the belly of the beast: Berlin at the height of the nuclear standoff and on the verge of building an insidious Wall. The Berlin schism is both real and metaphoric as they revolt against their own families and the inevitable script of their lives. The strained relations between East and West become a perfect simulacrum for the ruptures between men and women, husbands and wives, sons and fathers. It might be a story set more than 40 years ago, but it illustrates how differently -- and why -- Americans and Europeans see our world, and is published at a time when discussions of nation-building and America's role in the world are being debated. "Secret Father" succeeds on many levels, some that the ardent anti-war activist Carroll intended, and some which hark back to earlier themes about the necessary relationships between fathers and sons. It is not a book for the casual espionage-lit buff who delights in Clancy-esque Cold War intrigues between cold-blooded Soviet agents and world-saving rogue CIA operatives. It's deeper and more meaningful.
