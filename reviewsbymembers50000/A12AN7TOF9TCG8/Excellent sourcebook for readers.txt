 This book, originally loaned to me by a police professional, is an excellent resource for a variety of readers who are involved with criminal investigations but don't really have all the tools and training of a full-time medical examiner. In my case, as a crime author, the text was an invaluable reference, putting some highly technical material into easily digested context. The collection of photographs, while occasionally grisly, provides an excellent visual reference. Recommended for laymen of all kinds who need a good reference work on forensic pathology.
