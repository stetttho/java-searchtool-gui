 Eighty years before the ill-fated Soviet submarine Kursk sank, killed its entire crew, and inspired a major movie, another sub full of American sailors faced certain death on the floor of the Atlantic Ocean. But the resourceful crew of the U.S. Navy's S-Five didn't suffer the same fate as the Kursk's crew. And their story is recounted in vivid detail in "Under Pressure."  "No matter how dire and hopeless things may seem," Hill says, "life is worth fighting for." His book is a remarkable story of true heroism in a time of heroes.
