 The test of good historical fiction is a credible context populated by credible characters in a consequential plot -- and usually the context is utterly true ... expect when it isn't. Sanderson is an extraordinary storyteller, with a precise ear for dialect and a keen eye for detail. In this case, his context is the Rio Grande border wars in South Texas -- a landscape he knows intimately. Sometimes, historical fiction isn't 'true' to history, but Sanderson does a little-told history proud, blending the literary tradition of Larry McMurtry and the adventure tradition of Louis L'Amour. He knows the landscape, the lore, the people and the raw wildness of frontier Texas well. "Nevin's History" is well worth the read!
