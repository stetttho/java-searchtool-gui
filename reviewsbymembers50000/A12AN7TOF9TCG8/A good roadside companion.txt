 Ireland might seem a simple place, but it isn't. During a month in Ireland, Cadogan's "Ireland" by Catharina Day (Globe Pequot Press, ......)was my constant travel companion, and I'd highly recommend the newest edition to anyone traveling in the Emerald Isle. The book  contains excellent maps, historical perspectives, a guide to the politics,  historic chronology, Gaelic language, geology, myths and legends, and  religious complexities of this beautiful country. It also has a fairly  hefty section on practical travel advice tailored specifically to the Irish  traveler. The book is divided into very logical sections, and information  is generally easy to find in its rather comprehensive index. Best of all,  the island is divided naturally in this guide into its four regions --  Munster, Connacht, Ulster and Leinster -- so the traveler needn't thumb  through the whole book to find things that might be one mile apart. It is  further divided county by county, and travel is laid out very nicely and  clearly, in the order you would see it by car. I found only minor errors,  none that would have significantly changed my travel plans for the day and  none that might not have been the effect of changing markets and  seasons. I often would read this guide in bed at night, it's so  well-written, entertaining and informative. I would highly recommend this  book to the American traveler in Ireland. It's complete, funny and quite  educational.
