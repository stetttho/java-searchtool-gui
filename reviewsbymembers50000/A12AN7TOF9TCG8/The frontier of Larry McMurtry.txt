 After more than 60 years of life and amost two dozen novels exploring man's various frontiers, Larry McMurtry truly understands that past is prologue, even if it hasn't always been clear *how.* But now, in a  collection of essays that amount to a modest memoir, he explores a frontier  of his own: How a man's roots -- and his ghosts -- affect his  storytelling. "Walter Benjamin at the Dairy Queen" is about the  frontier called Larry McMurtry, and this self-portrait is likely to be the  closest thing to an autobiography we'll ever see out of tiny Archer City,  Texas. He extols the virtues of everything from a lime Dr. Pepper to  rodeo queens, laments the decline of oral storytelling and cowboys, and  paints a portrait of a landscape so vast and empty that it hardly seems  possible that it could be filled to the brim with the spirit of its  inhabitants. McMurtry writes poignantly -- occasionally humorously -- about  his own cloistered childhood, spent largely in fear of shrubbery and  poultry, and his surprising distaste for the cowboy life. He is most  eloquent when writing about his own passion for reading and books, two  entirely different subjects for a man who is not only a prolific writer and  reader, but also a rare book dealer and collector. In the end,  "Walter Benjamin ..." is about growing up and growing old.  McMurtry slyly weaves his personal story with the story of an ripening  frontier that has been washed by repeated waves of people, ideas and  industries, but survived. The Western small town -- whether it's the  fictional Thalia or his real hometown of Archer City, or any of a thousand  others -- is losing some of its dreams, but goes to sleep each night hoping  for new dreams to come along. For those towns and their people, the future  is a frontier all its own, with its own vagaries and vicissitudes. For  McMurtry, too.
