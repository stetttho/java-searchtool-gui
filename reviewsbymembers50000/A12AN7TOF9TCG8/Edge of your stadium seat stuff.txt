 Lupica has nailed the sports thriller, dead on. In this case, high school basketball and murder in what seems like a full-court press from beginning to end. It's nice to know that in an age of mystery-solving cats, amateur-sleuth vampires, and crime-happy psychics (why does it always take them a whole book to figure it out? If they were really psychics, wouldn't it be solved on Page One?) that there's a writer with a fresh style, good grasp of language and a fairly familiar rubric that we needn't suspend our disbelief for too long. Lupica is worth the investment. He shoots, he scores.
