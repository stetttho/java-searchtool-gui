 "Deep in the heart of the heart of every Indian man's heart, he believes he is Crazy Horse," Sherman Alexie writes in "The Toughest Indian in the World," his new collection of renegade short  stories. And that might mean, um, you are Custer. Or it might just mean  Alexie wants you to understand the pride and rage behind these nine  lyrical, rebellious, sometimes funny, sometimes heartbreaking stories,  where Indians find themselves between worlds, between lives, and between  loves.   Fiction writers simulate real life, they don't really bottle it.  Alexie is one of the best American writers of any color today, but not  because he writes about Indians as an Indian. Rather, it's because he  observes the multi-colored light of *human* existence through indigenous  eyes. His prism is a valuable cultural artifact on this reservation we call  America.
