 Louise Erdrich has staked her claim to the seldom-tilled soil entangling her roots, tapping the rich earth of her heritage to tell even richer stories where it's often delightfully difficult to know where fact and fiction intersect. And now in her new novel, "The Master Butchers Singing Club," Erdrich again explores the landscape of both her geography and her heart, of nature and nurture, the best and worst impulses of humans. Erdrich's northern Plains, the pregnant emptiness of North Dakota, is one of those places described as "richly imagined" by Eastern critics, but her place and moment are authentic. Erdrich, a North Dakota native of German and Ojibwe bloodlines, is not inventing this place of "appalling flatness," where streets are lined with half-grown trees, scoured by wind that is "both unbearable and comforting."  She lived in it, absorbed it through her pores. Erdrich is among the most lyrical American writers today, weaving rich imagery with deep, complex metaphor as she explores the distant reaches of American spaces and spirit, where death and survival dance. "The Master Butchers Singing Club" blends her talents for memorable voices, personal history and compelling characters, against a canvas seldom painted as realistically and lovingly.
