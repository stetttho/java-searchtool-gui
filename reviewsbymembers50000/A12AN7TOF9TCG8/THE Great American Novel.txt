 Harper Lee, a Southern woman, wrote the Great American Novel. Without demeaning the quality and value of "Huckleberry Finn" or "Grapes of Wrath" or "The Great Gatsby" -- great American novels all -- "To Kill a Mockingbird" summarizes a nation in constant flux, always examining its personal values, forever wondering whether there is something bigger than each of us.  The story of Scout Finch, her family, friends and acquaintances is the story of an entire nation, whether Harper Lee intended to write a universal story or not. This is not just a book worth reading; it is a book thet should be read by every American reader, lest we begin to believe that Tom Clancy, Stephen King, John Grisham and Danielle Steel are great (or even good) writers who reflect the complexity and depth of American literature.
