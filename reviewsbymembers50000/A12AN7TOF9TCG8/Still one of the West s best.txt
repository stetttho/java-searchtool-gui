 Mark Spragg remains one of the most evocative literary writers of the American West, even at a time when some very exciting new voices such as Pete Fromm and Marcus Stevens are rising. From his memoir, "Where Rivers Change Directions" to his novel "An Unfinished Life," he tells a story that is both richly visual and emotionally precise. A screenwriter-turned-author, Spragg "sees" his story unfold, and through his powerful language, so do we. "An Unfinished Life" spans both media in a poetic way, and a reader is strongly advised to read the book AND see the movie when it arrives.
