 Colorado 24/7 is a delightful glimpse of a beautiful state through the lenses of some of the best shooters the state can offer. And the foreword by Pete Chronis of the Denver Post is as lucid a word-picture as you are to find. I'm proud to say I know several of the photographers who were behind the camera in this marvelous project, and even more proud to see one of my most-loved western states shown so colorfully and beautifully by people who live there, and didn't just parachute in to cop a quick feel. It's a heartfelt collection. Beautiful work.
