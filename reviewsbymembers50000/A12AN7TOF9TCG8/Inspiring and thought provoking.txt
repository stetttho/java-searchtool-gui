 Ted Loder is the best kind of preacher ... one who is not obviously preaching. His storytelling is magnificent and his message is inspiring. For those who have lost faith in the whole faith industry, "The Haunt of Grace" should provide some hope, not just of a higher presence, but that we can find inspiration in common things around us.
