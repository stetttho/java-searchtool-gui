 "The Patient" is what "Die Hard" movies are made of: Brilliantly nasty terrorists hectoring innocent folks with only a wisecracking lone wolf to forestall Armageddon, all set in a complex urban  edifice festooned with state-of-the-art gadgetry. And the gadget just might  be the real star of this traumatic new thriller.  Like Robin Cook,  Michael Palmer writes vastly popular novels about doctors in crises,  including "Natural Causes," a 1994 best seller; "Silent  Treatment" (1995); and "Critical Judgment" (1996).   "The Patient" might be his most riveting book yet, leaving hardly  enough time to take a breath.  After all, it is brain surgery.
