 For lay people and civilians, this is a great insight into one of police work's most critical functions. As a journalist and author, I recently found myself referring to Dr. MacDonald's book (and others on forensic matters) for a very complex tale of rape and murder. His grasp of police processes and rape issues, their underpinnings and their ultimate effects is eloquently stated and well organized in this text. His experience in forensic psychiatry, supplemented by his advisory work for the Denver Police Department and consultation status for the courts, is a valuable resource. I recommend this text as a good civilian reference.
