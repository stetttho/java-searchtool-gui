 Yes, this is a worthy topic to explore. We swim in a sea of BS every day, and it's nice to know what we might gulp every few strokes.  But the Fountain of BS -- that font from which most toro caca spews -- is generally the kind of stuff you read on book jackets! Oh well, nobody knows BS like a BSer!  Seriously, this book is worth your investment as a social study and for cultural literacy. Hey, it's only $8.96! But the look on your pastor's face when you bring it to read in church... priceless.
