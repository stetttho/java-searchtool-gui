 True-crime writer and newspaperman Steve Jackson explores NecroSearch International's history in "No Stone Unturned," a simultaneously macabre and uplifting new book. And the soul of NecroSearch's work is not just finding hidden corpses and collecting clues, Jackson says, but easing pain. Jackson is a newspaperman's newspaperman, the kind of guy for whom "journalist" is simply too pale a term. He once joined two Indians from the remote mountains of Oaxaca, Mexico, crossed the border at Tijuana and journeyed more than 1,000 miles to Oregon to document the hopes, dreams, trials and travails of migrant farm workers. At Denver's Westword, where he worked for eight years, he once wrote a series called "Dealing with the Devil," tracing the rise and fall of a Hispanic street gang against the backdrop of a murder trial. "No Stone Unturned" delves into cases that would make good novels, but they're real. Furthermore, he describes a group of uncommon people performing uncommon tasks, and he does it with respect, accuracy and genuine style.
