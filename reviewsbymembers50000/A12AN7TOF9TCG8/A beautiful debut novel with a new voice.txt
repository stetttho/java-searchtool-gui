 Annette Appollo's debut, "The Last One Home," resonates with the warmth of memory and hope. Her characters are straight out of the lives of any reader who grew up in a small town and yearned to leave ... then  yearned as genuinely to return. Yet, this isn't a melodramatic nostalgia  book that casts youth in the patina of perfection, and it isn't a book for  the most devout among us who literally accept as gospel what they are told  in church, without troubling their own hearts and minds for more personal  answers.  "The Last One Home" is funny, irreverent, sad,  troubling, profound, rhythmic and completely readable. There's a touch of  Anne Lamott here, some Annie Dillard, some Jacqueline Mitchard ... but  mostly the reader can expect a unique new voice from a fresh woman writer  who strikes me as confident, sensitive and thoughtful. I strongly recommend  this book to mature readers who can grasp some of the deeper complexities  of a middle-aged woman's balancing act. It's a refreshing piece of artful  literature that should soon find its place.
