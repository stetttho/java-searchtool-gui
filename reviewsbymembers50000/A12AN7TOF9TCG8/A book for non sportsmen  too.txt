 If you've ever thought about a fisherman's life on the banks of a trout stream or knee-deep in the Bahamian surf, or just contemplated why the seasons change colors, you might want to hitch a ride with Jim  Fergus. The self-described "hook-and-bullet hack" -- in fact,  one of the most thoughtful hunting and fishing writers in America, a field  editor for Sports Afield magazine -- travels "The Sporting Road"  like Kerouac with a fly rod and a 12-gauge, where every stream is a stream  of consciousness. As you cruise the blue highways from Washington to  Florida, Fergus muses about hunters' patient wives, sharptail grouse,  bamboo fly-rods, the coming of snow, bonefishing, Native American culture,  lives worth living, the perils facing small towns, good dogs and good  friends. There's a certain poetry that emanates from somewhere deep down,  an echo of a primitive time, brought up-to-date by Airstream trailers,  Coleman grills and, for better or worse, Eddie Bauer. This is a good book  for non-hunters and non-anglers, the most militant of whom assume avid  sportsmen have little conscience or intellect. Fergus proves otherwise. He  is an eloquent spokesman for the sporting life, not defensive and clearly  thoughtful. If you've ever wanted to understand the allure of frigid  mornings in high-plains cornfields, or soggy nights on the banks of an  unknown river, or why a hunter would drive for two days for a fleeting  glimpse of a bird too small for dinner on its own, read "The Sporting  Road."
