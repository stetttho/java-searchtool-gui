 Could it be that historians have overlooked 100 years of black American history after the Civil War? That's the premise of this excellent history about the development of "freedom colonies" in Texas (and throughout the South) by freed slaves seeking a piece of land to call their own. The authors have thoroughly explored a little documented phenomenon in Texas history, and presented the reader with an excellent reference unlike any you'll read anywhere else.  The possible reasons this chapter in African-American history are many, according to the book: maybe the essential "political incorrectness" of admitting the colonies were often begun with white benefactors and assiduously tended their separation from Jim Crow society. Also, because they purposely kept low profiles.   But whatever the reason, this bit of history shows that not all of the South was a primeval wasteland where Night Riders, exploitive plantation owners, and racists of all kinds were prowling the countryside, making life hell for freedmen. Without a doubt they did, and the misery of feudal sharecropping is real. But for as many as a quarter of freed slaves, the "freedom colonies" were the gateway to a new life, truly free from bondage, and a step toward complete (legal) equality 100 years later.
