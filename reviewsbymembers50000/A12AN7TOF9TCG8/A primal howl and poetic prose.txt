 In a wistful moment of paradox, Jim Harrison once said only animals keep us human.   Of course, this primal poet also once said he'd say anything to keep a reader's ear for a minute. But Harrison, whose "Legends of the Fall" established him as a master of the masculine retro-myth, didn't get there with Hemingway-esque bombast. His stories strip people -- particularly men --  to their intoxicating animal essence. "The Beast God Forgot to Invent" is a collection of three novellas about humans and animals, about the effects of desire, dreams and death on men. Some of them dream of becoming bears, some walk away from civilization, some just go crazy. The characters are sometimes eminently joyless, other times staggeringly funny, but always only a coyote's howl from the animal inside. "The Beast God Forgot to Invent" is pure Harrison, a bone-jarring gallop over the landscape of masculinity, and might be part of a new resurgence in the  novella form. His occasionally complex prose echoes Faulkner, but his voice is evocative and primal, without being beastly.
