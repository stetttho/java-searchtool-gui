 Unlike the other reviewers, I have had a very positive experience with this hub.  I plugged it in and it worked...at USB 2.0 speeds.  It also looks sleek and is compact.  I am not sure, however, how Amazon arrived at their price.  I suggest checking your local major brick and mortar electronics superstore for this unit.  You may be pleasantly surprised by the price difference. :-)
