 I won't settle for just any mouse...and I have a box of them to back that statement up.  This one will not end up in that box...well, at least not for awhile. :-)  I decided that the occasion of a new computer system warranted a new color-coordinated mouse and began my search.  Unlike many of my peers, I have had EXCELLENT experiences with various Microsoft mice so I decided to limit my search to this product line.  I also decided to forgo wireless mice as I may decide to use my system for gaming periodically.  This mouse fit all the requirements so I gave it a shot.  My first reaction upon gripping it is that the tactile sensation is fantastic.  The ergonomics are great (for this right-hander), however, your mileage may vary as this judgment is unavoidably subjective.  The sides of the mouse almost feel like rubber and have a very pleasant feel.  The mouse is light and quite easy to use.  So what about that new tilt wheel?  Well, I can't say that I have used the side tilt, but it is unobtrusive...and can be disabled. I suppose that the real controversy is the fact that the standard wheel direction no longer features tactile clicks.  The mouse now free wheels.  Upon hearing this fact, I was not sure how I would like this "feature".  I use the wheel extensively while surfing and working in applications.  So what is my assessment?  One word - WOW.  I LOVE the new wheel.  It is SO much easier to use.  While I can't comment on the associated challenges for use in gaming, the wheel shines in standard applications.  If you are more likely to be using a web browser, Microsoft Word, or an IDE, then this is your new mouse.  Well, this one or one of the many other color scheme variants.  If you are a gamer, then you may want to save the box...just in case.
