 As other reviewers have stated, this monitor displays stunning video with a lightning fast response time.  Ghosting?  Not on this bad boy...and you would not expect it at this price.  A standard 17" flat panel can be purchased for nearly half the price of this unit, so you are paying for that response time.  I also, however, purchased this monitor for its 90 degree pivot capability and that feature has not worked as well for me.  The monitor will physically pivot 90 degrees on its stand and also ships with a third-party software package (PivotPro) to rotate the screen content correspondingly.  Unfortunately, pivoting the monitor results in a degraded picture.  The viewing angle is definitely optimized for landscape mode.  The severity of this issue is almost certainly subjective, but bothers me on most web sites that do not use a pure white background with black text.  Your mileage may vary.  I also experienced severe pixel bleed when I connected my PC's VGA output to the monitor's VGA input while in the portrait mode.  The result was a ghost image of almost all of the high-contrast items on the screen (text especially), which did not appear when the monitor was in landscape mode.  I eventually bought a mid-range graphics card (Leadtek nVidia-based 6600GT) and connected the card to the monitor's DVI input...and the problem was resolved.  To Samsung's credit, they do include a DVI cable.  That said, the pixel bleed should not have occured with the VGA input as I was using on-board analog video from a high-end Shuttle (SB81P).   Because of the pivot issues, I have subtracted 1 star.  The pivot works...especially for black text on white background word processing documents, but you may need a decent video card and the viewing angle is not optimized for this mode.  In summary, buy it for the response time...not the pivot...and use the pivot function if you don't mind the associated issues.
