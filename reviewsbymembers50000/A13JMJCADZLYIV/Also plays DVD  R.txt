 Fantastic Video, excellent audio, heavy feature set, and looks great...but that's not why I bought it. In the past, if you wanted max format compatibility, you had to sacrifice video quality.  Sure, you can stick a slice of pizza in a Sony DVP-NS725P and it will play a Little Caesars commercial, but the video quality is horrendous.  I searched high and low looking for a player that can read a wide range of formats, including DVD +R, without having to sacrifice quality...and just when I was about to give up, someone turned on a Grail shaped beacon. Enter the Pioneer DV-563A.  I dropped in every +R that I have and it played them flawlessly. No skipping, no laser chirping.  It even played disks on lower quality media that were burned right to the edge.  Absolutely awesome. By the way, the specs do not advertise +R and I am using a recorder that supports bit setting so your mileage may vary.
