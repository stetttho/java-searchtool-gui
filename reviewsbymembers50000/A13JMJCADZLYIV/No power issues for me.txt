 Unlike Dan, my Tivo loves this adapter and reports 76% signal strength to my access point, which is located on another floor of my house. Configuration of the adapter using the Tivo software was amazingly easy.  Tivo even had a firmware upgrade for the adapter stored on my local box, which it applied automatically.  No more phone line for me.  Anyone want to buy half a dozen phones? :-) cheers, Steve
