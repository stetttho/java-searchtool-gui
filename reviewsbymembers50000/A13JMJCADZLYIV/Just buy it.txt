 Rod Johnson is one of the few technical authors with whom I can almost never disagree.  A quick read indicates clearly that his technical insight, which ranges from architectural to low-level coding best practices, are not born of some academic exercise...they are the fruit of actual production J2EE experience...not an academic blueprint.  At times, I felt like I was reading my own words.  Over the years, I began to wonder if I was the only J2EE developer who was not "drinking all the kool aid."  My experience with over a dozen high-volume production applications moved me away from the pure party line.  Now, I realize that my religion has a leader.  Don't get me wrong, I learned a significant amount from this book.  Rod's experience is daunting and even an experienced J2EE developer will glean countless insights from this well-written text.  So what's not to like?  Well, frankly, I was disappointed that security got the same level as attention in this book as it does in most - especially since there has yet to be an excellent J2EE text produced on the topic.  While I didn't expect Rod to write the definitive tome on authentication and authorization, I expected more than two pages with a collection of URLs for more info.  In fact, I loved the fact that he led off the text with testing and was shocked that he didn't follow immediately with security - another system aspect that is frequently relegated to the margins...and often implemented poorly.  So how does that influence my review?  Well, on Amazon's five star scale, I am taking away one star....but I also started by awarding him ten stars for the rest of the text.  final static int MAX_RATING = 5;  final int rating = Math.min(MAX_RATING, (10-1));  if (rating == 5) {  you.buyNow();  }  Rock on Rod.  Can't wait for the "Developing without EJBs" text.
