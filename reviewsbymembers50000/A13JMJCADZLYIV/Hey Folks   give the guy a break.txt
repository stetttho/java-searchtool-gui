 This book is awesome!  It isn't perfect, but who cares?  What a blast from a carefree past.  Personally, I think that the guy did an amazing job considering that the sets changed over the years and that he did many of the blueprints years ago...without the aid of a VCR.  Realistic dimensions?  Yeah, whatever.  I wasn't planning on building these places from these diagrams.  Also, who says that the sets had realistic dimensions? I picked the book up on a clearance rack for [$], but, after viewing it, I think it's worth the full price.  I can't tell you the memories this thing brought back.  This is a killer present for your Baby Boomer friends who were TV addicts as tykes.
