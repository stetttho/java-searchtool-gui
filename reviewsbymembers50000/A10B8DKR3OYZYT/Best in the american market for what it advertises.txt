 I take it from some of the critical reviews of other shoppers that... some of us might be confused about the definition of Kimono... anyway, with that said, this book is great for costumers or experienced sewers that would like to use this information to design/improve other outfits, or make their own Japanese formal-wear.  Anyway, I will agree that the illustrations in this work had me laughing outloud in the middle of the bookstore.  Also, why is this in the cookbook section?
