 This restaurant is on first glance, very beautiful with rich wood paneling on the walls and a nice interior that shines even more because of the store's location on Mott Street, where most restaurants aren't known for their decor.  I, and my boyfriend, were very much looking forward to the opening of this restaurant, as it was hard, until recently, to find real ramen or other Japanese noodles in Manhattan.  Anyway, I was rather disappointed at their hiyashi chuuka, a summer dish, because the sauce was too sour tasting and the vegetables they served with it, not ripe and obviously poor quality.  For real noodles, try ONY on 6th Avenue... one of my favorites!
