 I think this movie was pretty understated.  It wasn't your typical Disney film of recent years with a huge budget and amazing computer colored scenes of sky fights or monsters or heroes or anything.  It was a way more subtle story, with a way more appropriate pastel palette.  In fact a lot of the backgrounds were done in watercolor, as opposed to more traditional animation backgrounds, giving the film a bit of a rough feel.  But this rough feel, actually more of a homegrown comfortable feel compliments the sweet story perfectly.  And the thing I like the best, despite the bad reviews?  Stitch isn't the typical perfect cute Disney animal, and Lilo isn't the typical perfect beautiful angel of a Disney heroine.  But that's what makes the story so real and endearing.  My boyfriend and I both loved this.
