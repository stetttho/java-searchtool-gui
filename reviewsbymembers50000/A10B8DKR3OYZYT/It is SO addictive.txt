 And so so fun!  I play it ALL the time when I get bored (got it used at a blockbuster for 9$!) and love it.  It's just like Tetris Attack, but harder (good for someone like me who graduated quickly from the limited difficulties of the Tetris Attack version!)  The 3-d mode is fun too!  My mom hates the repeating sounds, though... so I sometimes turn it down for her!
