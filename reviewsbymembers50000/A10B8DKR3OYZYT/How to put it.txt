 Yes, I have read all of the 7 volumes that make up Tokyo Mew Mew... and once I have read all of it I can only say... You realize that the story is, in parts almost a direct [copy]of Sailor Moon.  There are parallels too close to be coincedental.  But... I was a huge Sailor Moon fan, and Yoshida Reiko manages this in a way that... isn't obnoxious or frustrating.  Yes, this series is rediculously cute.  If you can stand that, it can be fun for anyone (even those out of the recommended reading age of girls 5-12, to read... my boyfriend picked it up, and is enjoying it...) So yes, it's the manga I was waiting for.  Though it's over after only 7 issues, it has started again in Nakayoshi as "Tokyo Mew Mew Alamode."  Something to REALLY be excited about!!
