 I loved the idea of the customizable souls, and Soma is an awesome character... but there were plot holes you could drive a truck through, (e.g. "Soma is a foreign exchange student studying at a Japanese high school.  One day, he is sucked into the eclipse with his childhood friend Mina Hakuba..." right...)  but all in all an enjoyable SOTN style game.  Better than Harmony of Dissonance!
