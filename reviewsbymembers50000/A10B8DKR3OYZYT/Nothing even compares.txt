 This is THE ONLY animation magazine, as far as I'm concerned.  Neither Anime Invasion or Animerica even come close to being as beautiful, as informative or as interesting as this magazine.  And unlike the two American counterparts, this magazine focuses on the new and the up and coming, not the same old stuff you have heard about hundreds of times.  They also have enough financial support to offer free full color posters, dvds, postcards and a contest in every single issue!  This is the best 10$ a month you will ever spend.  Believe me you get what you pay for and this is definately worth every penny.
