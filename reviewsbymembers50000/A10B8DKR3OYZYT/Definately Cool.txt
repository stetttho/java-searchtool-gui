 Although whoever designed Gunner Yuna's new outfit needed a kick in the head.  That half-skirt thing is mad ugly.  Luckily you can change the outfits based on the class.  It's a really envolved game with super high replay value!  Now, Rikku and Paine always look COOL!  Especially Rikku's new normal outfit, and her hair, definately looks good on her!  I can't wait for the english version!
