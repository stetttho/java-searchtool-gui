 I love this movie because you can watch it with the whole family and everyone will love it.  It's good for kids, but there are many jokes that will be even funnier to adults.  It's not at all the standard Disney movie, it's a little more low budget but in return, they have an ALL-STAR cast of voices (I think John Goodman is one of the best new Disney VA's in recent years and I love his work so far, esp in this and Monsters, Inc.) and make up for it in the amount of laughs in this movie.  There are so many quotable lines.  Perfect movie for a rainy afternoon.
