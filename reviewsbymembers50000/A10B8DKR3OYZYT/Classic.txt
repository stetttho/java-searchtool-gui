 I can still go back and play this game all the time.  And it's still really fun!  The only drawback is the fact that, the processor is really slow (it IS one of the first SNES games,) and that slows down the game play sometimes.  But the music is BEAUTIFUL... they should definately rerelease this for the GBA or something, maybe along with Castlevania V and that other one that came out for the computer system, and the Sega one.
