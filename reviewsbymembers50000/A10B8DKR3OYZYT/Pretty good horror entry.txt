 I think this horror comic was really pretty scary.  There were a few chapters in this first volume... like the one with the girl with posessed hair and the one with the two lovers who snaked together and went into the ocean, which were more corny than scary, but the scary chapters make up for that.  I am looking forward to volume 2...
