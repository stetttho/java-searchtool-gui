 Great semi-sequel to Parappa.  It developed on it.  I loved the fact that you could play different versions of the songs as parappa, and that you could change the sounds of the guitar.  The music in this one is great, I find myself humming it all the time.  Out of all the Parappa series games, it has the greatest variety, and therefore the greatest replayability.  Definately worth a look!
