 This new manga has several elements that make it unusual among manga, including a somewhat unusual art style.  It does grow on you, though, and though starting off with a strange plot that you don't exactly know what to make of, it gets gradually more intriguing and complicated as the series goes on.  Not just your average zombie horror comic.  Highly recommended.
