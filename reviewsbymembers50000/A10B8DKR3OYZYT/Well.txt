 There are things I think are underrated about this game.  The world it's set in is REALLY cool, and the character designs are cute and amazing.  However, the only thing that really brings it down to a 3 stars, is... the battle system is UNBELIEVABLY BAD.  It's kindof unfortunate.  This game had alot of potential.
