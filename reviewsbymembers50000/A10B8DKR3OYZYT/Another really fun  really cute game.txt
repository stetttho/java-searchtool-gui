 Although not that well known, from what I've heard, this game is really fun and really cute.  The characters aren't that obnoxious actually, they are funny for a change.  Although the shaking does kinda make me nauseous, and it is kinda hard, it is fun for people who liked stuff like Mario and Crash Bandicoot (yeah, its kinda like a combination of the 2)  For this price, I definately recommend it!
