 This game was ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE AND BORING.  I have played every Final Fantasy game, and this is the only one that I actually just turned off in the middle after getting totally disgusted with all the characters.  Contrary to EVERY OTHER FF game all the characters are totally 2 dimensional in personality and all so annoying.  It makes it worse that I was in Japan when this game first came out there, and so all I saw was the characters and FMVs everywhere, and I was really looking forward to the game.  So disappointing.  VII, IX and X are ALL so much better.
