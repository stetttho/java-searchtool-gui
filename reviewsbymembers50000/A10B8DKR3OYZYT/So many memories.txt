 I must have watched this movie 100 times, at least, as a child.  But all I had was a really poor quality tape that I made from a TV broadcast.  I assumed since the movie is SO old that it would be difficult to really clean up the picture but actually, it looks great!  And the sound is good to.  I mean, there is a limited quality they had to work with originally, but this just looks so much better than I remember!
