 I haven't seen this so I can't say anything but, I do remember that yesterday, when I saw this same dvd at the store, it said for ages 7 and up, not 17.  Either way, someone is making a grave mistake that, depending on which party, could either be BAD or funny.  My guess from the cover art though, was that the information stated here, that it is for 17 and up, is uncorrect.
