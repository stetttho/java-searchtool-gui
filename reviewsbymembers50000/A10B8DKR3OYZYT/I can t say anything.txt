 ... because I haven't played the game yet.  But I have a point of criticism for Square, who I am in an extreme love-hate relationship with.  As far as the criticism of a scene being altered to remove a suggested sexual relationship, if I am not mistaken, that is what the Rating System for Games (and especially the M rating) was for originally.  The fact that they have done this, just to "sell more games" (cause thats obviously what it is about!) makes me INCREDIBLY INCREDIBLY MAD.
