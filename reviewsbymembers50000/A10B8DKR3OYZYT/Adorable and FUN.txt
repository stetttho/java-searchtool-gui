 First off, the character design for this game is AWESOME.  They are all SO cute and the world they live in is PERFECT.  It's fun because its a combination of 2-D and 3-D, in a way that doesn't make me nauseous, and its a platformer but just a little harder and little more involved.  The story was great, it made me cry.  And I love the little invented language!  It was so cute!
