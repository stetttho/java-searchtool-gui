 I do think that I need to say to start out with that certain people need to remember that "manga" is as broad a category as "novels" in America, that there are all different subjects and USUALLY one is not a reader of "novels," but a reader of "horror novels," or "fantasy novels," even getting more specific.  Americans should remember that each manga is written for a specific audience, not for everyone in general, and that they are not eexpected or even encouraged, as a reader of manga, to like ALL manga.  It would be akin to liking "TV" meaning ALL tv. That said... this is definately a good example of manga for an older male teen audience.  Though, it does boast many fans in other categories, as well.  I myself first read this as a 14 year old girl and enjoyed it for its strong, realistic style and story that the author works hard to make believable.  If you don't mind violence and want to read something good, try this.
