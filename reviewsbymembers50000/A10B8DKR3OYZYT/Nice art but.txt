 My only problem with this series is that it is only 5 issues long and so as a short manga alot has to happen in a short amount of time.  That tends to be why I like longer series.  But anyway, I think the art in this is amazing and if you like CLAMP its a good buy.  The only other problem with it, in my opinion is that I am getting kind of sick of stories about little kids who are geniuses and don't even have to ever practice anything but just suddenly get good at it without trying.  Misaki gets an angel, and then like, 2 weeks later is in the National Championships?  It's a little TOO rediculous.
