 This game, truthfully, just seemed like a good way for me to kill some time, but actually, it was GREAT.  Not only is the world the game is based in (ours, in the future, with the names changed, but the idea of the internet, where you have "Navis" (like avatars, of a sort) that are programs that battle with viruses) was really actually cool and entertaining.  They pay attention to alot of the details.  Almost everything that you see around you in the world can be touched and explored (little text messages pop up when you look at almost everything!)Technically, this counts as a sort of different RPG, with some not too hard but just challenging enough to be fun puzzle elements added in.  It kept me entertained for SO LONG!  Definately fun.  I've already preordered the new one!
