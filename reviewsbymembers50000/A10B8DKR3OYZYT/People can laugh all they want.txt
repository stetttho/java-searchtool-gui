 ... at the fact that, when this new game comes out, there will be about 400 different kinds of Pokemon in all and that the show is uninspired and always the same (cause it kinda is...) but the games are always alot of fun and new pokemon add a kind of interest to the game.  Plus, this game will be on GBA and it has great graphics comparitively.  I know I preordered my copy!
