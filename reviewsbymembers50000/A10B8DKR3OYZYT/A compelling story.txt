 From Tomino Yoshiyuki, the original author of the Gundam epics, comes another space opera story, this time in the form of a feature length film.  Gundam F91 was originally intended to be a year-long series, but due to funding issues, was relegated to movie status, therefore hampering the overall pace of the story.  There are many parts which viewers will wish had been more well-developed.  Still, there is enough in this movie to make it great to watch, even when viewed simply from an aesthetic standpoint, as the animation and colors are beautiful, and the suit designs for the enemy army (Crossbone Vanguard) and the Earth Federation are, to put it plainly, just amazing.  Anyway, despite the pacing problems, I definately reccommend this to any sci-fi animation or Gundam fan.
