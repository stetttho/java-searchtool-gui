 ... bringing my 2 favorite companys of all time together in one fabulous game.  Unfortunately, I never finished it.  Not because I didn't think it was worth finishing, though.  I get motion sickness really easily and all the jerking motions of the camera made me REALLY nauseous...  maybe I will work on it some more this summer... slow and steady!  The revised character designs for Cloud and Sephiroth, BTW, are AMAZING!
