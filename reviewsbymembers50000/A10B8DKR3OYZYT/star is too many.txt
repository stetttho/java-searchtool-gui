 I wish the rating system had a negative stars rating.  I haven't read this book, but the discription I got from other readers is enough for me.  The saddest part is that, we can tell from the 2nd review that, this book has caused at least 1 japanese person to take on the belief that americans could never know or love real sushi.  this is a tragedy.
