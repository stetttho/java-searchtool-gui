 I can't stress enough how great of a show this is.  You know, I think alot of people look at Ranma etc, (which I happen to like, but many don't) and compare the two because they were written by the same author.  First, Inuyasha was started about 10 years after Ranma (the manga version) and it is possible for an artist/writer to mature in 10 years.  Takahashi's work was always great, but this is the best of the best!  I didn't think I would like it anywhere near as much as I do.  I just hope they release the 2 movies (and 3rd coming out in Novemvber in Japan) in America too!
