 ... because I love Parappa SO much that I don't think it's fair.  This game was SOOO fun.  And the gameplay, the graphics and the environments and music, plus the story and the videos were all WAY better than one.  But since I loved it so much, I have to complain about it, because it is WAY too short!  This game needs to have like, 80 stages!  Not 8!  Way way way too short!  In addition, I thought it wasn't cool how regular mode was SOOO easy, but then the battle mode you needed to get the secret songs unlocked was SOOO hard.  They needed to even that out a little.  The 8-bit song was classic.
