 A great satirical look of Japanese pop culture.  Definately not for kids though, lots of jokes about sex.  But it helps the author to make his point thoroughly.  One of the funniest things that sticks out in my mind is the daughter who commutes all the way to mars to go to the school with the cutest uniforms.  I thought that was hilarious. Great for people who like to have a critical eye turned towards Japanese pop culture.
