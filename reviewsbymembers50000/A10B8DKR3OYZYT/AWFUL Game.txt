 Had the worst story ever... so poor.  The graphics were poor too, and the music.  I have a feeling that, were it the current soundtrack or the original I'd hate it either way.  It wants to be Bust a Groove (great game,) but the system is aweful, easy and not fun.  It's more tedious than anything else.  Total waste of money.
