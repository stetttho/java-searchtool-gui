 This movie is probably one of the best recent Disney movies, as well as of all times.  It's got humorous and serious moments both, and always makes me really emotional.  Plus, there are some songs but it's not the corny musical style numbers that Disney had been making a lot of in the 90's. The animation also is amazing, and this film featured well-blended cg in the scene where Tarzan slides down the trees, showing that Disney is still a pioneer in animation techniques.  You will not lose with this movie.
