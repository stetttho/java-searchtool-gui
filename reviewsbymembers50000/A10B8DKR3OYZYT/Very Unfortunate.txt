 I am a big fan of the shamisen, and picked up this CD assuming that, since I had heard so much about the Yoshida Brothers as virtuosos of their instrument, that it would be packed full of the breathtaking, high-speed music that is usually associated with Tsugaru-jamisen. (the type of shamisen the Yoshida's play)  Unfortunately, I was sorely disappointed.  Kodo is really the only good track on the CD.  The rest is over-processed, horrid new-age stuff.  I find it very unfortunate, that for some reason the beauty of this very Japanese instrument has been presented in every way (an Arabian style track, a Spanish flamenco style track, a Chinese track) OTHER than it's original context.  I just feel like if I wanted to listen to flamenco music, I would buy a flamenco CD, not a shamisen CD.  Other than that, the Yoshida's are very technically talented, something I have to admit.
