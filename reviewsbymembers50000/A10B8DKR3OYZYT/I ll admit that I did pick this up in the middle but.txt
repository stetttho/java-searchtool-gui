 Yeah, I was kinda confused because this is the first volume I read... but, on the other hand, I don't think that picking up the story from the beginning would have saved my opinion of it.  Kishiro Yukito is a talented artist, yes, but I found this story to be really trite and [weak], and kinda gratuitous.  If thats your thing, go for it but, I'm assuming that everyone wants to read quality, right?  If so stay away from this and pick up something better.
