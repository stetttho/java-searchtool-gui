 I love Megaman games, and I love the kind of childish designs of the characters, etc in this game.  But it's REALLY REAlly rediculously hard, at least for me.  Maybe I am doing something wrong?  But I don't think so.  I have played all the Megaman games so far and this is the only one that has been TOO hard...
