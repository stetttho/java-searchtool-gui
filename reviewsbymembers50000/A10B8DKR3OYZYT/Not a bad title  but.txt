 I feel like I wanted to give it 4 stars, but the translation provided by Del Rey didn't really do much justice to the story.  It seemed somewhat poorly written to me, which made it lack any kind of coherent flow.  This might be an issue in editing, or in translation itself, but it just did not read very well.  Anyway, as far as the story/art go, I'd give this a 4.  It's cute, but not spectacular.  The story about two witch girls on earth competing to be queen witch by stealing the gems in human hearts which love them is pretty standard shoujo fare, and the dynamic between the shy character who finds herself suddenly well-liked on earth, while the boisterous character finds herself disliked/feared by the boys in her class holds some promise, though I feel at times like the story goes out of it's way to condemn the louder girl.
