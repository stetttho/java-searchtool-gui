 This is one of the most criticized of the Muppet films but I think it is alot of fun.  Especially for people originally from the NYC area, such as my self, it is rather nostalgic.   The only part that I can remember as slightly lacking was the very end scene, where the musical is actually performed, but the other aspects of this movie, and the comedy of Kermit when he has lost his memory is more than enough to make up for that.
