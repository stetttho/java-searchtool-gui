 ... leave out the good songs.  No, this version does have some good songs on it, but nothing like the arcade version of DDR MAX, (although there were alot of technical issues with that, but that's besides the point.) Luckily the DDR MAX2 for PS2 is coming out here soon!  May DDR mania continue to spread!
