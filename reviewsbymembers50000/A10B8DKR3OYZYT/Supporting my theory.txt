 Another game that supports my theory that, much of what Square made from 1998-2002 was just sort of testing out different character types, different clothing types, and different colors to be used in their masterpiece, FFX.  As far as this game goes... I love the idea, love the world, and love the characters... the execution, on the other hand, and the game play are both horrible... oh well, you can't win 'em all.
