 Another classic manga by Takahashi Rumiko that will keep you laughing the entire time.  She introduces a whole cast of unforgettable characters, many of who are victims of the Nanichuan cursed springs in China, and will turn into various things (girl, panda, pig, cat, duck, etc) when they get water dumped on them.  As is obvious, much water-dumping and hilarity ensues.  It's really sweet and funny.
