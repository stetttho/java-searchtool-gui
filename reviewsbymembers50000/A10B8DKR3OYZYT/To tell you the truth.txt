 I had heard about this show alot, especially about the movie version and it was precicely that fact that made me stear clear from it for a while.  I am a huge fan of Sailor Moon, and it was the beauty and purity in my mind of that show and that world that I didn't want to pollute with something that was supposedly more "edgy" but just dirty and gratuitous.  Luckly, when I got sick in Japan this winter and had to stay home in bed, my boyfriend and I went to get videos at the video store.  One piece and Inuyasha were being rented, so we went with the DVD's of Utena.  They were GOOD!  Way better than I thought they would be!  The setting (kind of a bizarre non existant place highly influenced by gothic french architecture) is gorgeous and kinda makes you wish you were there, and the characters are memorable.  The only one I can say kindof annoys me is Anthy but I think that's kind of supposed to be the intention of the author. Anyway, I was really impressed though I thought I would dislike this show.
