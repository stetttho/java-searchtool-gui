 I am not one to write summaries of products I review.  I can say, however, that this is a TRULY great series.  As far as dramatic/serial shows go, I am really really picky, but this one managed to really hold my attention!  But, why is there no pilot episode?  Not that that is a reason to NOT buy this (the picture quality, compared to when on the TV and VHS, has gotten ULTRA clear) But I think the studio should release the 2nd season and Pilot episode both on DVD, because thats what the fans want!
