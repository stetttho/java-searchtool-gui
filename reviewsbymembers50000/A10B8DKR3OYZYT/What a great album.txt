 I have to admit, when I heard about this song on the radio, I wanted it, but just because it had Panjabi MC feat. Jay-Z's Beware and Wayne Wonder's No Letting Go on one disc.  Anyway, I'm pretty glad I bought this album.  I actually have to say, I though I like the Jay-Z version of Beware, the Twista version, also on this album is really good too (maybe better?) It has some good tracks from some strong artists, Lil Kim, 50 Cent, Sean Paul, etc. and some GREAT TRACKS from people I haven't personally heard of before.  I have to say, I like the Kardinal Offishal song, Sick! If you want a great all around album remixed well with music from a bunch of totally different artists, then this is a great CD for you!
