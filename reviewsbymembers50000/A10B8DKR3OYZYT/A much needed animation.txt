 This animation was like a breath of fresh air.  It is a serious feature, little comedy to be found here but it handles the subject without being overly sickeningly melodramatic.  The score by the always fabulous Kanno Yoko is just amazing, perfectly fitting the action in the show.  The CG is brilliantly blended with traditional animation, making this series very visually attractive.  I have heard criticism that it is overly pushy of the envionmental message, but I think it handles it just perfectly.  Its an animation that most of the family can watch together.  I also liked, just as a side note, main character Juna's voice alot.  Not too girly or fake, just natural.
