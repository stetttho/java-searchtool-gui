 A beautiful adaptation of the anime.  Makes a GREAT gift.  Too bad there is no box set or something, I think that would sell REALLY well... Anyway, the color is just beautiful and its a great way to relive the action and emotion of the original anime, or for people who didn't see it to see it for the first time.
