 I loved Parasite Eve and other gothic-y horror games so this game was perfect for me.  I loved the fighting system, so easy to use, and you could just wild out with it.  Also Dante is an amazingly cool character, and whoever designed him deserves alot of credit.  Definately highly reccomended, though I can't say the same for #2.
