 And definately the best Castlevania game.  Alucard is my hero.  I beat it way long ago but I still turn it on and play all the time!  Never gets boring.  Some of the other newer games for GBA have good ideas about making your characters super-customizable, though.  I like that idea... if they were combined it would be a game so awesome, it'd be unbelievable.
