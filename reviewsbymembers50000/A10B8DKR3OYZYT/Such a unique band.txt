 There is no one else who sounds like Rasputina.  I had the good fortune to see them live and I was truly amazed.  They have such energy, and it even translates to classic songs available on this CD.  "Transylvanian Concubine Club," is an absolute must listen, and "Dig Ophelia"  has a haunting sound that will pull you in to the quieter aspect of the band.  Absolutely beautiful.
