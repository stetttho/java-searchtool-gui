 Di Gi Charat is so cute, it's amazing to me that it's been overlooked in the US for so long, and that someone hasn't picked up the rights to the TV series, especially now that new seasons have come out.  Well, now that the Comic anthology is coming out, possibly there will be enough interest to do that.  This is really cute and if you like cute, and super short comics, this is a good buy!
