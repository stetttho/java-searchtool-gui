 ... that this isn't higher up on the list of popular Japanese cookbooks on this sight.  I consider this book to be one of the most definitive books on the subject of Japanese cooking.  The Nobu cookbook (which is the most popular) isn't Japanese so much as it is Pan-Asian, and then the other books, are all sushi books, which is strange to me seeing as, having lived in Japan, I know that Japanese people rarely eat sushi (it's expensive there too!)  Hiroko Shinbo's book was given to me as a present, and I have grown to really love it.  I was at first put off a little by the lack of photos, but then when I realized that it contains many of the REAL dishes that I am familiar with, I started to use it more and more.  It is easy enough that anyone can cook the dishes in this book, and has all the real dishes that I remember eating in Japan.
