 I loved looking for the different spell cards and that whole system.  The controls were also nice and easy to use (take that Harmony) and it was long enough even for me.  The only drawback?  Possibly the darkness that made it impossible to see what was going on unless you were playing directly under a fluorescent lamp.  But if you have an SP, that shouldn't be a problem at all.  A must have for SOTN fans.
