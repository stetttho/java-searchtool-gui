 Shirow's work in color is ok, and its mainly the details and the lush CG color that makes it look good.  My main problem is that he draws mainly large breasted women with big guns (or big swords, in this volume) wearing skimpy costumes, and this is really obvious in his illustration volumes.  The problem I have with this isn't just that it doesn't match my personal tastes, (I am a girl... so not so interested in the girls in this book) but also that I feel like its presence does alot to further the stereotype that many people have as anime being only about girls with big boobs and big weapons wearing very little clothing.  In fact, I have read hundreds of volumes of original Japanese manga, and it doesn't have to be about this at all! It can actually have good substance.  That's why Tokyo Pop is commendable in its quest to find real manga of all different genres and bring it to America.
