 I love 2-D games on the PS2 because the high processing power means that they can be extremely colorful and beautiful!  This is one of the games that takes full advantage of this!  Its a great translation of the arcade version, great replayability (because the matches in this game are so involved) and absolutely beautiful, full of the creepy-cool characters we expect from a Guilty Gear game!  We rented it and I played it a bunch but, I definately plan to pick this up when I get a chance!
