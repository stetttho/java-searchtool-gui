 I love this book.  I thought that it was a great guide book for getting started without being serious.  It did have alot of jokes but there is alot of relevant material in there too.  I don't think it was meant to be a parodu so much as it was meant to be a humorous guide that can acually be used.  I highly reccommend it, because it gets down to the core of each genre really well... but it isn't for kids, as the other reviewers mentioned.
