 This movie is sure to please everyone.  Adults will have fond memories of when the movie first came out and kids will be happy to rediscover this adorable version of the classic story of Robin Hood, Disney style.  Of course the cast is composed now of animals, and the choice of foxes for the main characters was perfect, and really cute. I have seen this movie dozens of times and I still love to put it in the DVD player every time I get bored!
