 The title suggests a book of toilet humor and slapstick.  In reality, this novel is sweet and touching, and good for kids who don't get along with those around them in school.  I know when I was young, I was one of those kids, and I read this book for encouragement.  Even now, years later, I read through it and it somehow has a way of making me feel better about myself. One of the best books ever written.
