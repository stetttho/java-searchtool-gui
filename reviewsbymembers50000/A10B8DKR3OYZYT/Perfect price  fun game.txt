 This is a nice, colorful update on the original classic puzzler.  Although I admit that it wouldn't really be worth it when the game was new and more expensive, it's definately good now that its way cheaper.  Gotta check out the new one, also, I haven't played it yet, but if it's an improvement on this already fun game, it'll be great!
