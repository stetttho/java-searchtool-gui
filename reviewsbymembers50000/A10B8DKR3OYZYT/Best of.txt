 Honestly, when I picked up this album at the store, I too thought that these were not necessarily the tracks that I would have myself chosen for Best Of.  However, the CD works beautifully as a whole, and the remastering is amazing.  My boyfriend, who despises older music quality, couldn't believe that many of the tracks on the album were close to 20 years old.  Some of the songs that really stand out are, "Sugar Hiccup," Fifty Fifty Clown," but I think there is something on here for everyone.  Great music for the art workshop.
