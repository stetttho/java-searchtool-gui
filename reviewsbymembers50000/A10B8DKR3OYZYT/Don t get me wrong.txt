 I'm a huge fan of Inuyasha, in fact it's because I'm a huge fan that this book gets 4 stars.  Yeah, it's great to look at for someone who loves Inuyasha, and understands kind of the depth of the story and the characters.  But, Takahashi Rumiko's art, even in color, though cute, is not the kind of thing that would instantly get the attention of someone who wasn't already a fan.  Her stories are great and her art, cute, but not CLAMP-caliber, for example.
