 I have played most of Square's games, and I definately thought this game was disappointing, despite the fact that my friends recommended it highly.  I thought it was SO boring, and the characters were, for a traditional type RPG, really lacking in any discernable personality.  The graphics are REALLY dated, and the music was subpar even for Mitsuda Yasunori.  If you want something without depth of character, go for Legend of Mana.  At least a: it never pretends to have deep characters, b: the music is good and c: it's REALLY pretty and fun!
