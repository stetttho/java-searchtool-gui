 I feel like this game was really overlooked because of the disappointement that was FFVIII.  But its a wonderful gem, sweet and amazing story.  I don't usually like things that fit in to a more standard classic fantasy world, but this is a definate exception.  Its a beautiful game and I played it right through!  Everyone who likes games with characters that you can love should play this game.
