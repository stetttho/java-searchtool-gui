 Takahashi Rumiko, as always brings her signature brand of love humor to this series.  Not that it's a "romantic comedy" in the classic sense of the word.  This is the kind of show that guys and girls could both watch and not get the sense that it is too sappy or too cute.  But it's because of the dynamics between the characters (and the weird, humorous subplots involving, well... everything from battle acting to battle rhythmics to battle tea ceremony) that you get to learn about the hilarious cast of characters and their slightly more serious sides (that are revealed once in a blue moon, of course)  Great for people who like comedy anime with a bit of action mixed in.
