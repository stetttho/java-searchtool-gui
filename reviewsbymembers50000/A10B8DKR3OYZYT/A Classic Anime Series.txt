 Made during the 1980's, which were generally known as the "Golden Age," of Japanese anime, Zeta Gundam is the follow-up series to the original Gundam series/trilogy.  Though released in 1986-7, it's animation stands the test of time, as much of it has greater charm than most of the computer colored animation that is being released today.  I did see this series all the way through, and can say it is extremely compelling and should appeal to fans of science fiction, anime and animation in general.
