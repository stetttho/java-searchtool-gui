 Not that interesting or hard.  The dubbed voices were horrible.  I wonder if Square was aiming at their own sorta answer to the Popopocrois games or something with the SD designs and all.  I think it's probably worth taking a look at, if you like square games.  The whole, samurai dropped in the middle of a midieval fantasy world thing was a bit much for me, though.
