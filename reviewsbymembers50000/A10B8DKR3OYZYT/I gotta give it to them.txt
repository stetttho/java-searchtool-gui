 I respect the dedication it took for these artists to get their entries in to the contest.  All in all they weren't bad but looking at them, you definately don't get a sense that anyone amazing is going to emerge out of this, of course.  And it is true that, the subject matter was really not for the most part what you would find in any Japanese manga.  I was dissapointed because several of the artists are really famous on line and in all those cases, I found their art that I had seen prior to this contest to be better.  Oh well... maybe the pressure got to them?  I don't know but I found the whole thing so average.
