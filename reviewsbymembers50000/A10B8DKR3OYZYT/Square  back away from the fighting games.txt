 Square needs to not make fighting games.  They are always horrible and this one is the worst.  The control and the system is aweful, and there is no reason to replay this idiotically easy game, ever.  The music is pretty decent, and I heard from a friend that if you put the disc into the cdplayer you can listen to it like that.  It would be a better use than actually playing the game.
