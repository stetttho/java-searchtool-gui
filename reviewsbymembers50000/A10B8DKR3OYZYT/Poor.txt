 This story doesn't make any sense.  The only reason that people like it is because it is hyped so much.  I read it the first time when I was 13 and even then I didn't buy into the hype.  Then, I went back recently and read it again at 19 just to make sure that I wasn't being stupid and immature when I thought that the story didn't make any sense and was just tedious, and no, it was as I had thought, the story still wasn't that great.  All I can say is that, though this original manga and the movie were both DOGS, for some reason Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex the new TV show is really good.  I commend the director and studio who could actually do something with so little to work with originally.  That's because they stayed away from gratuitous nudity and such.  And because they didn't waste time with that, they could actually fit in plot.  Amazing how that works sometimes.
