 I used to play Rockman and Forte (the original Japanese title) on the Super Famicom (SNES) all the time, and loved it.  So I wondered why the game never made it to the US.  Even now it is mysterious that it took so long.  I love my copy to death.  It's great to have the choice between Megaman and Bass... Trebel is so cool looking... and this game is definately challenging.  The levels are really involved too.
