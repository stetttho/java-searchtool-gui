 This is a classic series brought to you by Takahashi Rumiko's unique brand of humor.  Of course it wouldn't be a Takahashi series without a weird catch.  In this, her first series, it happens to be that Ataru, a perverted HS student is cursed (through a series of bizarre events in the first episode,) with an alien girl named Lum who follows him everywhere in a tiger-striped bikini, calling him Darling.  On the other hand Ataru kind of has real feelings for Shinobu, the girl he was kind of dating before Lum came to earth, and lusts after anything and everything female that he comes across, from the school nurse Sakura to a snow princess and a princess of the crow demons.  This show is awesome.  For fans of retro classics, this is definately it.  I'd also like to say that if you like music in the early 80's style, the soundtrack to this is rather fun.
