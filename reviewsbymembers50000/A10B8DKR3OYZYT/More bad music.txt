 The music in this game is just awful... and the dubbed voices are rediculous and horrible.  I can't believe they hired those people... and despite the fact that the story isn't that great and the graphics are bad... it's like a train wreck... I couldn't look away and so I played almost all of it... funny how that works some times.
