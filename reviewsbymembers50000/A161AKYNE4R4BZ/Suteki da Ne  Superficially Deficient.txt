 Suteki da Ne: Superficially Deficient. I will start off by noting that I am an avid Final Fantasy music follower, and that I have worshipped Uematsu's previous works for a long time. I must admit that at first, I was sorely disappointed by this single. 1. Suteki da Ne. Isn't it wonderful? A breathtaking song mixing Japanese folk music with Japanese Pop and other genres. The biggest note of widespread annoyance is the flat high note, which is actually intentional, and adds to the mystery of the song. It's also exceedingly complex to replicate, especially repetitively. Probably my favorite pick off this album. ^_^ 2. The Moon ~Utikisama~. *Beautiful* piece. I love the sound and the altogether feel of this song. I wish Pure Heart were more like this. You can feel the raw emotions flowing through it. Very well executed. 3. Pure Heart. A vocal mix of one of Final Fantasy's most highly-regarded songs ever, Aeris' Theme from Final Fantasy VII. Again, I was initially disappointer be this track. It seems no one can do Aeris justice, her song is so reverenced in video game music circles. As I listened more, though, Rikki's style and voice grew on me more and more, and now this is probably one of my favorite Aeris Theme arrangements, second only to the Final Fantasy VII Reunion orchestrated track. 4. Suteki da Ne (Instrumental). This is the instrumental music for the first track. Very beautiful, but not as moving without the vocals. Fun to sing along to, though. ^_^ Overall, an exquisite album, though short.  Yeah, I know it's a single, but...yeah.  And while the instrumental track is pretty, I don't find it all that useful.  *shrugs*
