 A great supplement to a great series.  Some people might find reading an essential indexing of magical creatures boring, but not me.  It is especially enjoyable to read Rowling's take on creatures I've encountered in other works. And in both books, the notes are often the funniest parts.  Little scrawls by "Harry" or "Ron" flit about the pages, bringing humor to what is supposed to be a textbook.  Very clever. And of course, the clincher is that much of the proceeds from these two books go to charity.  What more can one ask for?  I recommend these books to any Potter or fantasy fan.
