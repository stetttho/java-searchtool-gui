 I am not a fan of eastern European folklore.  Heck, I'm not a fan of most folklore in general.  Going into Enchantment, who'da thought I'd fall in love with a warped Russian folk tale? Anyway, this is a fancified tale involving the Russian stories of Sleeping Beauty and Baba Yaga, and a great one at that.  I found myself transported to a hamlet in old Russia, faced with the problems of the people...and I was hooked.  I could not put this book down, and 18 hours and 419 pages later, I was finished, left with a sense of awe and a longing for a sequel that was not to be. One of the things best pulled off in Enchantment is Card's accuracy to the folktales.  I read that he recieved help from scholars and common people who knew Russian folklore from the inside.  He knew that a common failing in adapted fairy tales is a skewed (and typically wrong) view of things.  Enchantment escapes that problem.  I have yet to find a fatal flaw in any of its writing. In a word, enchanting.  =)
