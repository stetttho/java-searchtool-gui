 I love celtic-type music, I love vocal movie themes, and I love Enya's music.  Funny...this soundtrack has it all! Recently usurping the crown of *Drex's Favorite Movie Soundtrack* from the beautiful Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, Howard Shore's Fellowship of the Ring soundtrack has much to offer.  Haunting, ethereal melodies abound.  Multiple talented vocalists lend their aid to this brilliant work of art. There are five tracks that use vocals, and I'll touch on them more so than the others.  My favorite instrumental tracks are The Treason of Isengard and Concerning Hobbits, which include some themes that pop up throughout the soundtrack. Four of the five vocal tracks utilize the ancient elven tongue, lending more of an air of mystery to the work.  There is a lament for one of the Fellowship (I'll not spoil it for those ignorant of the plot) in "Lothlorien" which uses the Elven tongue extensively. Aniron (contained in "The Council of Elrond" is the beautiful love theme of the human Aragorn (Strider) and the Elven princess Arwen. In Dreams (contained in "The Breaking of the Fellowship") is my second favorite piece in here.  A haunting ethereal sound is produced by a boy soprano, backed by an all-boys' choir.  A wonderful Celtic-type tune, and Edward Ross's voice floats above the music, perfectly capturing the meaning in the lyrics. "May It Be" is my favorite track, the featured theme by Enya.  Though it carries many of Enya's trademark progressions and sounds, it is truly unique and beautiful, with perfect lyrics to match.  I saw an interview with Enya dealing with her work on Lord of the Rings, and she seemed genuinely happy to be working with such a legend, and to be able to mold music to fit.  Her enthusiasm to make this work really shows. All in all, a *MUST* buy.  Exquisite work, I only wish there was more to go around.
