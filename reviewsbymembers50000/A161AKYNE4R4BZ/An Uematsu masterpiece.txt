 Wow.  This album is quite a work of art.  ^_^  Track-by-track, I gave 9 pieces above a 9/10.  01 Tina is my favorite track, its haunting beauty permeating every note and carrying itself into the listener's heart.  Other notable favorites are as follows: 08 Johnny C. Bad, which I give 9.8/10 for its trueness to the style depicted, its accuracy to the original, its focus on the melody, and its flawless arrangement to piano. 12 Celes, which I give 9.8/10 for its complexity of rhythm (hemiola, or three-against-two a predominantly used device), beauty, clarity, and strength of melody, and tie-in with the emotion of the original character and scene. 07 Kids Run Through the City Corner, which I give 9.7/10 for its beauty of melody, simpleness of accompaniment, and attention to preservation of the original. Overall, I would rate this album 9.2/10.  It is a work of art, and a beautiful arrangement of some of gaming's greatest triumphs in the realm of music.  I highly recommend it to game music and piano music enthusiasts alike.  =)
