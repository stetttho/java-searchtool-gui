 I'm a cellist, so is it any surprise that Yo-Yo Ma's flawless work on Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon ranks said soundtrack as my second-favorite movie soundtrack ever? I hope not. Tan Dun's compositions are exquisite, and Yo-Yo Ma's execution is flawless. The raw emotion that goes into each track is incredible. We can see why he is the most famous cellist in the world. But then, what is a movie without its vocal theme at the end? I was almost scared that with a vocal theme, they'd cut out the cello part. Happily, I was mistaken. Though toned down, the cello still in there, pealing out beautiful melodies and harmonies. Coco Lee works magic on "A Love Before Time". In English and in Mandarin, the haunting beauty is ever-present, and the lyrics are truly touching. When coupled with the storyline, it nearly brings people to tears. A nearly flawless soundtrack, and a must-buy. Its title of Best Soundtrack should be evidence enough of that.
