 I've been a Heroes of Might and Magic fan since the first version was out.  I still remember the awesome town themes, and how fun it was to blast enemies with my Genies, Phoenix, and Dragons.  =D Heroes of Might and Magic 3 captures the feeling I've had with the series since the beginning.  Decent storyline with scenarios to match, fun heroes to play (on both sides of the campaign), and such customizability.  The Map Editor is one of the best yet, and the new possibilities with regards to artifacts leave a great deal of exploring to even the seasoned player.  The graphics are good, the balance is good, my Phoenix are back, there's a slew of new creatures, artifacts, heroes, etc. from Heroes 2, and you can always expand the world yourself. One has to hope that there's even more customizability in Heroes 4, though.  Where are custom artifacts, for instance?  Ah, well.  It looks to be good, too.  At least I can console myself with hours of Heroes 3 in the meantime.  =)
