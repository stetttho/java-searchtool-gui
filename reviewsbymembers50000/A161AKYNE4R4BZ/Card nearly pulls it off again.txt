 Ender's Game.  Definitely among my favorite of science fiction novels.  In fact, the whole series holds a special place in my heart.  Imagine my delight when I discovered Card's new line of Ender books was coming out.  Faithfully I await(ed) eac new installment. Shadow of the Hegemon was the second such installment, after Ender's Shadow, and what a great installment it is, though it lacks the incredible appeal of Game and Shadow.  Bean and his friends face up against the ruthless boy genius general Achilles again, but the plot - and the characters - jump around a lot.  I found myself having trouble keeping track of Achilles' movements, and I was in his head. Besides that, I'm not a very politically-minded person, and politics abound in Shadow of the Hegemon.  What makes it even more confusing is that it's an undulating sense of politics, besides which it is entirely fictional, being set in the future. So, confusing yet very satisfying, and capturing some of the music of the past books.  If you're an Ender fan or a Card fan, it's a great read.  If not, it's still good, but it will lack the extraordinary appeal of Ender's Game and Ender's Shadow.  I'd stick with those first. (3.5/5)
