 Ok, so I'm partial to vocal themes. Sue me. The instrumental tracks on this CD are nice, but they lack the originality or oomph I expect from an exquisite movie soundtrack. Listening to the instrumental tracks away from the movie, I found that they neither evoked emotion nor stirred the mind. Not my idea of a great soundtrack. Then there are the two final tracks, The Dream Within performed by Lara Fabian and Spirit Dreams Inside by l'Arc en Ciel. Great stuff. The Dream Within is such a powerful song that when it started coming in during the credits at the end of the movie, I sat in my seat, stunned, as the rest of the audience filed out. I was amazed by the power and majesty of the music, the lyrics, and Fabian's voice. It remains one of my favorite vocal movie themes to date. Spirit Dreams Inside was initially a turnoff. I don't much care for the genre it belongs to. After two listens in theatres and a few listens off the CD, though, it began to grow on me. Now I enjoy very much enjoy listening to it, though it cannot compare to the beauty of The Dream Within. So overall, I give it a 4. It's amazing how much two tracks can sway one's vote. ^_~
