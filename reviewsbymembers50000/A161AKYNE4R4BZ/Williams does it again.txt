 I think four and a half stars would have been more appropriate. John Williams' score for the ultra-popular Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is quite worth buying.  Magic exudes from every track, and listening to each theme, I can easily visualize the corresponding scenes.  It takes a master composer to truly pull this off. One thing I fault Williams for: lack of creativity.  Some people might go off on a limb and call it expanded style, and I can see where they're coming from, but while listening to this soundtrack before seeing the movie, I couldn't help but think of other movies with similar themes.  It's like seeing cameo appearances of Home Alone, Jurassic Park, Star Wars, and ET.  Fun, but faintly irritating. A great soundtrack, and I highly recommend it for purchase.  :)
