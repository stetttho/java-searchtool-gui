 Decent mixes of fascinating yet educational texts seem hard to come by these days.  Of all my assigned readings in school, I've only encountered one book more delightful to read than this. Wilson's storytelling-type voice lends an air of interest to stories that could be approached on an entirely intellectual level.  Instead of boring lecture material beset with convoluted explanations and superfluous wordings, The Diversity of Life uses a more personal voice, and from real-life experiences in the field, explains matters in a method too underused, and most appreciated.  Though I haven't finished reading the book yet, I feel confidant that it will remain one of my favorite texts to read.  I feel I could even enjoy it outside of class.  It is moving, motivating, and almost compels me to be a Biologist.  Highly recommended, especially for college biology students.
