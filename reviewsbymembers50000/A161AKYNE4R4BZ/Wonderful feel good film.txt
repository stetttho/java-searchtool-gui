 "Summer Holiday" is a wonderful feel-good film.  It is a tale of the hate-love relationship between two people from different worlds - one a recently fired office worker from the city, and the other a hick who lives on a beach in Malaysia.  Summer wants only to sell the beach of which she owns half, but More More Tea owns the other half and has different plans for it. The plot is decent, though the sub-plot with the sunken treasure pushes it a bit.  It seems the filmmakers only wanted to show off their underwater camera equipment, and the beauty of the Malaysian islands.  The acting is decent, and the dialogue is often hilarious, though typically mistranslated.  On top of everything, the scenery is magnificent, and the musical soundtrack is superb.  Even if you don't see this movie (though I highly recommend it), do NOT miss out on the soundtrack.  Sammi Cheng, who plays Summer, is a Hong Kong superstar with somewhere around 30 albums out.  Her karaoke performance of "Kuai le bu kuai le" is featured about halfway through, and is quite nice. Thumbs up all around on this one.  ^_^
