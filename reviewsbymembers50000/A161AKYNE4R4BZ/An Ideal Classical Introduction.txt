 I've always been a lover of classical music, but at the age of 16, I didn't have quite the experience with it I wanted.  I could sing along with any famous classical piece, but get me to name the title or the composer, and I'd be at a complete loss. Then this CD came into my life. I recognized about half of the songs, and they all appealed to me.  What to do?  Of course I bought it straightaway.  ^_^  Let me tell you, I was not disappointed.  I'd encountered the vast majority of these pieces before, and I liked amost every one.  Though some of the songs are not the composers' best in my opinion, and though many of the pieces are not in their complete form, it is a great boost for the beginning classical collector's shelf.  =)
