 After reading the majority of the other reviews for "Deja Dead" I felt I needed to give Kathy Reichs a try. I was actually quite impressed by how good it was. I have been wanting to read a novel about a new medical examiner for a while, since Patricia Cornwell is making Dr. Kay Scarpetta into a wimpy, whiny, pathetic little thing. Temperance Brennan is a very good character and I find it interesting how she analyzes her bones to solve murders. Kathy Reichs's books are great novels thatevery mystery fan should read!
