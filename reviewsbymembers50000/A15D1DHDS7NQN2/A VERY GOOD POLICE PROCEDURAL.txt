 I have always wanted to read this book since the day I say it in the stores. The cover of "First Avenue" was very enticing with the police car on the cover. I was impressed because this was Lowen Clausen's first major novel. He proved to the reader that he knows a lot of background information about being an officer of the law. The storyline was very interesting and enojoyable to read about. The main character, police officer Sam Wright, has vowed to track down the killer who abandoned a small baby child in his house and killed it's mother. Sam seems to have a personal vendetta against this killer. Sam and his partner Kat go on to investigate where the mother worked in the donut shop and discover some disturbing information about the donut shop owner. Mr. Clausen takes readers into the streets of Seattle and sums the book up with an excellent confrontation on the Puget Sound. Great job Mr. Clausen! Brad Stonecipher
