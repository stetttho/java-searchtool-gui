 Well, I have to admit, I was a little disappointed with Iris Johansen's latest novel, "Final Target." Don't get me wrong, the book was good and worthwile to read, but I don't think it was as good as "The Search." and "The Killing Game." I thought that the plot was a little too slow at times and there was a moderate amount of storyline that had nothing to do with the main objective, such as the diamond part of the story. I liked the characters a lot although. Jessica and Melissa Riley were interesting characters to read about, so was Michael Travis. The exciting parts in this book, like the museum scene and the church scene were very fun and action-packed. If you want a good book to read, then buy "Final Target," although in my opinion, "The Search" was better.
