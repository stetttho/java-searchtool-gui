 This novel is so bad. That is practically all I can say. The back of the  book says an amazing thriller just like Thomas Harris's Hannibal. That I  can definitely say is a BIG LIE! I thought the main character was very  poorly developed. The book was VERY confusing in the event that it kept  going from the present to the past without even telling the reader what  time they were in. And suspenseful, GIVE ME A BREAK! I was so bored.  Whoever reviewed this book and said it was good, obviously hasn't read a  variety of suspense novels to know what trash is when they read it. Sorry  Mr. Connolly hopefully your next novel is better, even though I wouldn't  read it!
