 This was just a GREAT suspense novel. It was about a police Lieutenant, Sheila Brady, who is on the case of the Sunflower killer. There have been  four girls who have been kidnapped, raped, and killed. They were left with  sunflower seeds or an actual sunflower on their body. When Sheila starts to  investigate, she finds that the killer could be someone very close to her.  Could it be the police captain, her boyfriend, an intriguing veterinarian,  or the mayor? Sheila has to outsmart everyone to save herself from the  SUNFLOWER KILLER and to protect her daughter and her friends. This novel is  Martha Powers at her best!
