 Smashmouth will always be one of my favorite alternative groups. I think every song on the Astro Lounge CD is great. My favorites being: Diggin Your Scene and Radio. You can't compare Smashmouth's music with a lot of other groups because they are quite unique. If there is one group who is somewhat similar with Smashmouth, it would probably be Barenaked Ladies. Great singers and musicians in the background on the Astro Lounge CD. If you like to listen to alternative and some great music then try Smashmouth.
