 Every single book that she writes gets better and better. I love that Iris is writing her latest books with a golden retriever in it. I love goldens! There was non-stop suspense, great characters and a wonderful conclusion. I  was dissapointed when I saw it was only 298 pages, because I had the book  done in about 3 hours. I am looking forward to your next one Iris.
