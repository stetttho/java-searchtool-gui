 Christiane Heggan is one of the best female mystery novelists that there is on this planet. I have read all of her novels and I believe that "Blind Faith" was by far her best. The book is classified as Romantic Suspense, but it is practially all hard core suspense.    Kelly Robolo, a Connecticut investigate reporter, is startled to hear the news that her best friend, Victoria Bowman's, husband Jonathan, has been killed in a Miami fire in a drug infested hotel. Kelly and Victoria both know that Jonathan is not that kind of person and think that Jonathan has been set up by his boss and casino owner. Kelly calls upon her only police friend, Nick McBride, to help and solve this puzzling crime. As they investigate they find a link between Jonathan's "death" and Nick's father's death two years ago, who worked for the casino's security company.  Non stop suspense, with a little romance thrown in. If you are going to only read one book this year, then definitely read "Blind Faith."
