 Wow, this book was good. It had suspense, action, and it really probes into the mind of a crazed man, who vows to get revenge on Audrey Goh after the past he has experienced with Audrey's father. There is also another  group after Audrey, a group of Chinese Mafia men who will stop at nothing  to get what they want. This book is absolutely mesmerizing! I have read all  3 books that Thom Racina has written and this one is one of my favorite.  Also it gives you a little hint that there might be a sequel coming. Keep  up the great work Thom!
