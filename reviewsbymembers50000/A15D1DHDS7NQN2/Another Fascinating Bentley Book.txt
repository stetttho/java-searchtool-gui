 "The Summoning" orginally came out in 1993 and went out of print. Now, luckily for all us horror fans, Bentley re-published it! This novel takes place in Arizona, just like all of Bentley's other novels. Brad Woods, a local coroner, is noticing a change going on in his small town of Rio Verde, Arizona. People are acting strange and having their blood sucked out of them and left to die. Brad, Robert, (the town sheriff), Rich (the newspaper chief), must hunt down this "vampire" and kill it before another one of their friends are drank to death. They along with Sue Wing, a local twenty year old woman, whose grandma knows a lot about vampires join the task force. This book is quite long, 541 pages to be exact, but it is by far, the best vampire horror novel I have read in my life.   Brad Stonecipher
