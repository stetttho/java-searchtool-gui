 The first novel in the Rune series was "Manhattan is My Beat," and I didn't care for that novel very much. But "Death Of A Blue Movie Star" was ten times better. Rune is now a production director's assistant. She gets in the middle of bombings of movie theaters and production companies. Rune's new friend dies in one of the bombings. Can Rune stop the bombings and discover who killed her friend before she dies herself? Trust me, it's worth the money. The third and final Rune novel comes out in late January/ early February, and it's called "Hard News!"
