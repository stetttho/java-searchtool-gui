 I have read about 8 Stephen King novels till this day and allof them were ok, but this one is so dull. I think the plot is aninteresting idea, but there are so many wasted blah, blah, blah pages in this book. This book didn't have to be 732 pages. At the beginning it was boring. I thought for sure that this book was going to get better but boy was I wrong.This book actually got more dull and obnoxious closer to the end. Yuck, I've decided that I will no longer read a Stephen King book again, SORRY! ...Try John Sandford, now that's a good writer.
