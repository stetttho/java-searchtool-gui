 I recently read Remember September last year and was sooo impressed by Jon Salem. Then a couple days ago while I was browsing in the stores I saw The  Perfect Mother. Oh boy, I thought, it's by Jon Salem, so I figured its got  to be good. I bought and loved every last word of it. Suspense throughout  the entire book. It was about a woman named Georgette who gave her baby  away for adoption when she was about 18 and now she wants her back. But now  the girl is already 15 and living with a very loving and supportive family.  But Georgette wants her "baby" back and she will do anything to  get her back, EVEN KILL! Salem is a future Jeffery Deaver in my eyes.
