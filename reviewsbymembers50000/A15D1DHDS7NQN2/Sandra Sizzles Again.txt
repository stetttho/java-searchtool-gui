 My 2nd Sandra Brown novel was another wonderful read. I loved everything about this book. The characters were remarkably well written. There wasn't  much romance, mostly action packed suspense, which I like. I finished  Unspeakable in 2 days and enjoyed every minute of it. My favorite novels by  Mrs. Brown are Unspeakable and The Alibi, both in paperback. It is great  that Sandra Brown has changed from writing romance novels to mystery  novels. I can't wait for The Switch!
