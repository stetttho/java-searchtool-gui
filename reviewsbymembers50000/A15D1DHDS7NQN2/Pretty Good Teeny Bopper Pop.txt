 I think "Dream" is an awesome group! It is amazing that a group of girls the same age as me, has such fabulous talent. There songs are like a mix of Britney Spears and Innosense. My favorite song is of course, "He Loves You Not." I listen to that about four times a day. Of course, they play it about a thousand times on the radio. "Dream" has a lot more good songs including "I Don't Like Anyone" and "When I Get There." There are fast fun songs, and slow steady songs. "It Was All A Dream" is a good buy for your money.
