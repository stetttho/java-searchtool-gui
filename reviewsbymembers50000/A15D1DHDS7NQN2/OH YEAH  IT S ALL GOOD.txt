 "24 Hours" was my second Greg Iles novel and I found it absolutely fabulous! It was a non-stop thrill ride that would not slow down. Will & Karen Jennings are two respected members of their community and everything is going good for them until their daughter, Abby, gets kidnapped. Will is at a business conference and Karen is at home. A woman named Cheryl with the kidnapping appears at Will's side to watch over him and another psychopath stays with Karen until Will wires the ransom money into the kidnapper's account. Unfortunately, little Abby is in the hands of a ... individual named Huey, who is willing to kill Abby if his boss, (Karen's tormentor) tells him to. This novel brings the FBI in after a previous victim of another kidnapping done by the same three people, goes to tell the FBI that he has a feeling that the three will strike again. This novel takes readers on rides on the ground and in the air. The suspense keeps going all the way until the shocking finale! This is Greg Iles at his best! Brad Stonecipher
