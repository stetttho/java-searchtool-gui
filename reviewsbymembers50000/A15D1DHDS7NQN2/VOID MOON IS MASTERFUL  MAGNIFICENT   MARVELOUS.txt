 I have now read every single book that Michael Connelly has written and I  believe that each book definitely gets better and better. I enjoyed Void  Moon and Angels Flight the most. Void Moon was so good. I kept picturing a  movie in my mind the whole time because the scenes were so intricate in  detail and the description of the characters and their surroundings were so  well done. Action, suspense, betrayl, and death are all in this book. I  couldn't believe how so many people died in this book! Jack Karch is one  evil man. Mr. Connelly created a wonderful lunatic to chase Cassie across  Las Vegas and the state. I hope Cassie Black is back in his future novels  because she is a great character, although you can definitely call her a  "Bad Girl" considering the fact that she robs people when they're  asleep, she is still portrayed as the protaginist. I can't wait for "A  Darkness More Than Night" on January 23, 2001!
