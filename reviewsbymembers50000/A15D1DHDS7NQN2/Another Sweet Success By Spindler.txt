 I have read all three of Erica Spindler's thriller/ mystery novels and I  have loved every single one of them. I feel that she is just as good as  authors such as Mary Higgins Clark and Tami Hoag. My first novel by her  that I read was Cause for Alarm. I then went out and bought Shocking Pink  and later All Fall Down in April 2000. Erica will always be on my list for  mystery authors to look out for.
