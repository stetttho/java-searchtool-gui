 You have got to be sooo bored to read this book. This is my first time I  have read a novel by these two sisters and I was not impressed at all. I  like the character Nina Reilly a lot, but the plot is so SLOW! The  O'Shaughnessy sisters could have had this book be about 275 pages instead  of 448. Instead of getting right to the plot, half the time the book is  about Nina meeting another lawyer named Collier and getting married in one  book. That is not that bad, but this lawyer is the prosecutor on the case  against her! GIVE ME A BREAK! Instead of getting to the mystery of the  sisters, the authors talk about the secretary's relationship problem and  another old woman who has a problem concerning divorce. It just goes on and  on! Too Slow for me! No more O'Shaughnessy for me!
