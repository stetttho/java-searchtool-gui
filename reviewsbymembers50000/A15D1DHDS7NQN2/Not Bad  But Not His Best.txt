 This was a very good and well written novel, but to me it doesn't seem as good as Certain Prey. A few questions were left and unanswered at the end. Like what the killer and the victim were arguing about before she was  killed. I was hoping that this was going to follow up with Clare Rinker  from Certain Prey. I liked that there were 2 killers in this book, since  this brought more twists and turns. Overall a good book!
