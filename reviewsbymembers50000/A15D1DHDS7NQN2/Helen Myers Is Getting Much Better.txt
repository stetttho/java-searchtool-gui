 I didn't care for "Come Sundown" at all, because of the excessive romance in it, but "More Than You Know," on the other hand, has just a little romantic scenes here and there and A LOT OF MYSTERY. I liked the character quite a lot. The main character was investigating the mysterious death of her brother and she believes that one of the cops is involved. So she and her lover, another cop, are on the case. Between "Come Sundown" and this one, "More Than You Know" is better.
