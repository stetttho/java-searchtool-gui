 I just started reading Stuart Woods about six months ago and I think he is a great writer. I especially like his novels that includes his main protaganist, Stone Barrington. I have been looking forward to L.A. Dead for months. I think this novel was one of the best novels that Stuart has wrote. Stone Barrington is in Italy getting ready for his marriage to Dolce, the daughter of a rich Mafia man. At the last minute before he gets married, he gets a call from the police in Los Angeles, saying that Vance Calder, Arrington's new husband, has been murdered and that Arrington is the main suspect. (If you don't know who Arrington is at all, then you need to start with the earlier Stone Barringon novels or you will be confused!) Stone dashes out of Italy and arrives in Los Angeles. Stone along with Dino Bachetti, his old partner and friend, must prove that Arrington is innocent and discover who the killer is before someone else dies. The only problem is that Dolce, Stone's fiance, is incredibly mad at Stone and she even gets a little violent. One of the things that will shock the readers is the ENDING! You will be in shock. I'm looking forward to Mr. Woods' next novel coming in the future.
