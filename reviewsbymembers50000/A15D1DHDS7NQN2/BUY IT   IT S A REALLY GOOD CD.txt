 After hearing the Wallflower's smash hit Sleepwalker on the radio, I knew that I had to purchase this CD. I was very glad I did because there are a lot of good tunes. My favorites on the CD are the first three by far. They include "Sleepwalker," "Hand Me Down," and "Letters From The Wasteland." All three of these are very good songs. One thing that I like about the Wallflowers is that all there songs don't have the same tune and beat. They are all different and have different sound quality. The Wallflowers are one of the best alternative groups that there is. If you like Third Eye Blind, Green Day, and Lifehouse then you'll enjoy BREACH.
