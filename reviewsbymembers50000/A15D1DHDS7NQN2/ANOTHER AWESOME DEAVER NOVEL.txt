 I believe that Jeffery Deaver is one of the best mystery authors there is and is also one of the fastest novelist when it comes to publication. He always had about 2 new hardcover and a couple paperback novels come out each year. The good thing is, almost everyone of them are great. "Speaking In Tongues" is no exception. Tate Collier, a prosecuter, his ex-wife, Bev, and his daughter, Meagan, are going through some real hard times in their family. Meagan is a troublemaker at school. Bev is having more relationship problems and Tate is all alone. Matters get even worse when Meagan is kidnapped. Tate and Bev must come together and dig up their past to try and figure who would want to target their daughter. The killer, Aaron Matthews, holds a grudge against Tate because Tate put away his son in jail a long time ago. Now Aaron wants revenge! The novel is very interesting in the aspect that you get to be in the killers mind for half the novel, while you are with Tate and Bev the other half.      I didn't like "Speaking In Tongues" as much as Jeffery Deaver's Lincoln Rhymes and Amelia Sachs novel's but trust me, this novel is definitely worth the money. Great action, suspense, and psychological terror throughtout the whole book. I can't wait for "Blue Nowhere" in May 2001! Brad Stonecipher
