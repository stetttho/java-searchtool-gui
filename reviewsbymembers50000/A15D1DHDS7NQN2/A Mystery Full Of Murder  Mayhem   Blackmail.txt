 "Hiding In The Shadows" is the second "Shadows" novel by Kay Hooper, the first being "Stealing Shadows." I felt that "Hiding In The Shadows" was a wonderful read. I finished this novel in two days. The one thing that I love the most about the Shadow series is the psychic and paranormal activity that the author uses in helping to solve the crimes. "Hiding In The Shadows" was a blend of mystery, psychic abilities, and kidnapping. Faith Parker wakes up in a coma and wonders how she got there. She later finds out that she was drugged in her drink and she drove home and crashed. She has lost her memory totally. SHE HAS AMNESIA! She later finds out that Dinah Leighton, her only friend was the only one who visited her in the hospital. When Faith gets out of the hospital, she finds out that Dinah has been kidnapped. Faith must do anything she can do to try and find her only friend and get her own memory back before her old life catches up with her and eventually kills her. The reason why I gave this novel four out of five stars was because I LIKED STEALING SHADOWS better. "Stealing Shadows, "Hiding In The Shadows," and "Out of The Shadows" (coming October 31st) are all wonderful mysteries!
