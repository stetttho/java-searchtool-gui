 I was very intrigued with this novel after the first couple of chapters. I thought for sure that this book was going to be a winner, well I was wrong. I agree with the other reviewers, this novel ran out of steam FAST! The author talks about the killer name Michaelangelo and then he talks about some criminals flying their stupid planes in the air. Michaelangelo wants to be on the TOP TEN MOST WANTED list. The concept is so incredibly stupid, it's laughable. So good old Mikey starts to kill the criminals on the list, while there is drug trading and other criminals flying in the air. I can understand why all of Ryne Pearson's earlier novels are out of print, because they are probably so bad. IF YOU LIKE MYSTERY read RIDLEY PEARSON! Now he can write great!
