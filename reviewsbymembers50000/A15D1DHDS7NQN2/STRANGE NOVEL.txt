 I agree one hundred percent with most of the other reviewers when it comes  to When The Wind Blows. It starts out really well, and I was very  impressed. But later on and all the way until the ending it was very  unbelievable. The whole town seemed to hate the main characters throughout  the whole novel and that made it very hard to decipher who was the killer,  who held a grudge, and who was Mark, the main character's real parents.  Also at the end of the novel, the explanation of why Mark had a death  certificate was not explained well AT ALL! Another thing that I didn't care  for was that the conclusion of the novel was about 60 pages long. I agree  with one of the readers when she said that this novel could have been about  100 pages shorter. So I didn't really care for When The Wind Blows at all,  but I loved ALL FALL DOWN, Zach's early novel. I hope Cradle and All is  better, I HAVE FAITH IN YOU MR. FOX!
