 Blood Work, being my 3rd Michael Connelly novel was another winner. I couldn't stop reading this one and finished it in a day and a half. This book was about a series of gun shot murders over the last couple years that  led the detectives to feel that the killer was probably someone trying to  harvest their organs. Well, maybe the detectives are wrong, read it and  find out? My collection of Michael Connelly novels' are growing.
