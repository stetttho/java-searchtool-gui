 Yes, that's right, another winner by the male king of suspense, Jeffery Deaver. As most of you Deaver fans know, Jeffery is revising and  re-publishing his older novels. Manhattan is My Beat was the first  re-published and I enjoyed that novel a lot. The only thing I didn't like  was the main character in that book, but overall it was a good novel. But  with SHALLOW GRAVES, that's another story. Great characters, a great plot,  action, suspense, drug-dealing, shootouts, and more! What more could you  want in a suspense novel? I have heard through the "grapevine"  that Death of a Blue Movie Star will be out in October, and Blood River  Blues and other older Deaver novels will be out in the future. Along with  his NEW thriller Speaking In Tongues in December 2000, that can be ordered  with Amazon.com, of course. If I could, I would give Shallow Graves six out  of five stars.
