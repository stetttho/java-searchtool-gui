 The first song that I heard by this fascinating artist was "Only Time" on the radio. I loved it totally. I have never heard a more beautiful song than that one. So when Enya's CD came out, I had to go out and buy it! I am very happy that I did. It is beautiful and splendid music, with excellent instrumental precision in the background. If you are looking for a CD to raise your mood, than "A Day Without Rain" is your best choice.
