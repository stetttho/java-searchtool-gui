 On the back of the book, the summary makes "Come Sundown" seem like a psychological thriller that will be an interesting and exciting novel to read. Well, that is NOT THE TRUTH! This novel is practically ALL ROMANCE!  This is one of the novels where Helen R. Myers is changing over to write mystery instead of romance, but there is way too much romance. I think they have sex in every 5 pages. I felt that the little mystery that there was, was VERY GOOD! I just didn't appreciate it that the back of the book made it sound more mystery than romance, when it was really the opposite.
