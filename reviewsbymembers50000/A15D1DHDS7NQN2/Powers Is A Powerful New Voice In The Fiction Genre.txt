 Martha Powers's first mystery novel was titled "Sunflower" and I read it this last summer. That was a magnificent work of mystery and suspense and I was greatly awaiting the release of "Bleeding Heart." In some ways, "Bleeding Heart" is similar to "Sunflower." They both are set in a small town and both of them have strange murders occuring there. Maggie Collier and her son Jake live in a small town in Delbrook, Wisconsin. They moved there after the horrible car accident with Maggie's husband that killed him. Maggie's father in law, George, is knifed to death on a country club's golf course. Maggie later finds out through investigating that George had taken a picture of something secret and he was going to reveal it to the public. Someone killed him in order for that picture to remain a secret. Maggie sees a link between her father in law's death and a series of three kidnappings that have occured around the Wisconsin. Maggie and Grant, the nephew of one of the kidnapped girls must work together to capture this crazed killer and kidnapper, dubbed THE WARRIOR, because of the feathers he leaves at the crime scenes, before Maggie and Grant are the next victims. If you like Erica Spindler and Wendy Corsi Staub, then you'll like Martha Powers. Brad Stonecipher
