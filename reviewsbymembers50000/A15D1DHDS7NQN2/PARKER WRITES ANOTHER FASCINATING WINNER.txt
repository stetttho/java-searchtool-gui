 T. Jefferson Parker can write! That's all there is to it. All of his novels are wonderful complex stories of mystery and suspense. I believe that "Silent Joe" was his best novel! Almost all of Mr. Parker's novels take place in Southern California, which is also enjoyable. The plot: Joe Trona is politician Will Trona's personal assistant and son. Will and Joe are on the way to pick up Savannah Blazak, who was kidnapped by her brother, Alex, and held for ransom until Savannah and Alex's parents pay Alex. They called in Will Trona to drop off the money. While getting out of his car, Will is confronted by a group of about four people who shoot Will dead. Savannah hears the shot and runs away, while Alex disappears. Joe Trona is determined to figure out who killed his father and get Savannah back. Who is the criminal? Is it crime boss and head of a major gang John Gaylen? Is it Bo Warren the Blazak's personal guard? Could it be Mr. Rupaski another politican who holds a grudge against Will? Joe is determined to find out, even if it means killing!
