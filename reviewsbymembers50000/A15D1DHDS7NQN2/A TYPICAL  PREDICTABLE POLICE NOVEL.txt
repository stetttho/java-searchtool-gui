 Bruce Elliot's first novel, "Still Life," is nothing to run out to the stores in a hurriedly manner and buy as soon as you can. It is a good novel, don't get me wrong, but it is very predictable and similar to every other suspense serial killer novel that there is in the world. The main character, Detective Ariel "Touch" Benson, is a very unlikeable character who acts likes a loser because of his large amounts of problems and excess usage of profanity on every page.
