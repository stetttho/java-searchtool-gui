 I have now read every single book that Phillip Margolin has written,  excluding Wild Justice and I feel that The Last Innocent Man is the best!  The best characters, the best developing plot and the best conclusion of  any of his novels. An INNOCENT man is on trial for the rape and murder of a  prostitute (undercover cop). David Nash, a defense attorney, must put his  career on the line to find the real murderer before the Innocent Man will  become the Guilty Man.
