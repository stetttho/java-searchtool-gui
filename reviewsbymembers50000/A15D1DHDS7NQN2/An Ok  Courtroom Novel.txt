 This was my first Phillip Margolin novel and I enjoyed it a lot! I  discovered him in a big pile of books from my grandma and was quite  surprised at how good "The Undertakers Widow" was. I have read a  lot of books by John Grisham, J.F. Freedman, and other courtroom suspense  authors and I felt that "The Undertakers Widow" was better than  most, other than the ending. I didn't like the way that the end turned out.  But other then that it was a pretty good book.
