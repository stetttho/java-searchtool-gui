 I was greatly anticipating the release of Destiny's Child new CD, "Survivor." I figured that the CD would be good because I loved Indepedent Woman and Survivor on the radio. Almost all of the songs on the CD are good. My favorites are the two I just mentioned and I also like Bootylicious, Sexy Daddy, and Indepedent Woman Part 2 also! The only track that I don't like is Brown Eyes, because it's a little too slow. Beyonce Knowles, the lead singer, is definitely the best of the trio and if it wasn't for her, there would be no Destiny's Child. My advice is to run out to the store or add it to your shopping cart right now, because it's a great buy.
