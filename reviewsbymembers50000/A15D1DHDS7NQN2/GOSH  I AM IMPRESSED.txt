 This was my second Lisa Gardner novel. "The Perfect Husband" was the first one. I enjoyed that one, but "The Other Daughter" was so much better. It is the story of twenty-nine year old Melanie Stokes, who was adopted a long time ago by the powerful and rich Stokes family. A reporter, named Diggs, comes to town and informs Melanie that she was adopted by a man named Russell Lee Holmes, a murderer who was executed after being convicted of killing six young girls. Melanie is in shock and starts to investigate her past. Unfortunately Melanie discovers some very disturbing facts about her family. She gets news that her father, Harper Stokes, is possibly in charge of health care fraud scam. Also all of the Stokes's family members are getting threatening notes, saying that the past will come out. The ending of this novel is completely surprising. I am already reading "The Third Victim," Lisa Gardner's new novel.
