 Bentley Little is by far the best horror novelist in my opinion. Each one of his books get better and better. "The Walking" is certainly no exception. Mr. Little takes readers on an 100 year adventure. An evil force is murdering men all across the country who worked on a dam ten years ago. The dam accidently overflowed and the community of "witches," below the damn, were killed. Now one witch is getting revenge, by killing her victims one by one, and making them WALK for her. If you like horror novels, then I strongly suggest Bentley Little.
