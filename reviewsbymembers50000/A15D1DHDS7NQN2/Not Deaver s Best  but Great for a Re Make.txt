 Manhattan Is My Beat is a great thriller by the master of suspense, Jeffery Deaver. I didn't like it as much as his latest one's like The Empty Chair and The Bone Collector. It seems like the each book gets better with  him. There was a great conclusion to this book. You couldn't trust anyone  and it turned out really well. I am looking forward to Shallow Graves in  September 2000.
