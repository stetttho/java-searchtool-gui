 After reading "Crashing Down," I knew I had to read Meg O'Brien's other novels, so I ran out and bought them. It's always like that when you read a good book by a new author. "Sacred Trust" was quite different then "Crashing Down." It takes place in the gorgeous, picturesque, town of Carmel, California! (I personally love that town!) Abby Northrup is startled to wake up one morning and hear the news that her old best friend Marti Bright has been murdered. Her body was placed on a wooden cross with nails stuck through her hands and she was severly beaten to death. Next to the body was the word "Abby." The Carmel PD believe that Abby might have killed her. Abby is shocked and decides to investigate the death of her old friend on her own. As she tries to narrow down the suspects with the FBI and police on her tail, she uncovers many new revelations like her husband's blackmailing scheme in order to obtain land and Marti's son's foster parents have disappeared. The novel leaves the reader confused at points but the ending is extremely shocking and sums the book up well. I'm already in the middle of reading "Gathering Lies," her newest novel!
