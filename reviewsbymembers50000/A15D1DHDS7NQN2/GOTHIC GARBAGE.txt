 I read the first 150 pages of this worthless novel and decided to stop. I have better stuff to do than read boring novels. I can almost always tell from the start if books are going to be good. This one started out real lame. Holly Smith/Randall or whatever her name is, discovers she is adopted and then she gets a phone call from her real great aunt. Then the aunt is later killed and Holly comes running to the family's house. She does not get along with a lot of the family members. She feels that the housekeepers son is strange and so on. I feel like I need some ALEGRE! BUT... I loved Tom Savage's novel "VALENTINE," that was a great novel believe it or not. "The Inheritance" is NOT!
