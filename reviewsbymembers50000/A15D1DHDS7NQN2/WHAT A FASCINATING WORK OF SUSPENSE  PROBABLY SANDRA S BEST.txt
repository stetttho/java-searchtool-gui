 "Envy" just backs up my theory that Sandra Brown is as good of a suspense writer as a romance writer. When I received the Advanced Readers Copy of this novel two months ago, I was captivated throughout reading it. It was extremely arduous to put down at times. The neat thing about "Envy" is that the book actually takes on two separate stories of these two men's lives. The plot: Maris Matherly Reed is one of the head executives at Matherly Reed Publishing Houses, which her father owns. One day she is going through a bunch of mail and discovers a manuscript of a prologue from a writer who just leaves his intitials, PME. She loves the way this man writes and she finds the plot quite interesting and intriguing. She tries to track down this mysterious man on an island off the coast of Georgia, but finds her self shunned away immediately. As Maris tries to communicate with this writer, her husband, slimeball Noah Reed, has his own little agenda. Not only is he sleeping with another woman, but he wants to take over Matherly Publishing, even if it meets killing Maris's own father. Noah comes to be a major character later on in the story when the reader finds out who Parker Evans really is and what is intention is for Maris to come to this island. This an amazing story of betrayl, friendship, and deception, with an exciting conclusion that makes the reader feel satisfied and shocked. Sandra Brown is one of the best!
