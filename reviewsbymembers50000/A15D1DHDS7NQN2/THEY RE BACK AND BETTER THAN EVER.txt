 I was so elated to know that Sugar Ray had a new album coming out because they have always been one of my favorite alternative groups. This new album is all good! I liked every single, which I knew I would because Sugar Ray is always really awesome. My favorite tracks include When It's Over, Answer The Phone, Disaster Piece, and Words To Me. They are all very good singles but those four are my favoirte. If you are going to buy one good alternative CD this summer than buy "Sugar Ray" by Sugar Ray.
