 Most of the time Jeffery Deaver's novels include Lincoln Rhyme and Amelia Sachs or have other detectives who look for killers the old fashioned way, which is going through evidence, analyzing the crime scenes, hoping to find a fiber or hair that will link the killer to the victim. In "The Blue Nowhere," Deaver takes the readers on an adventure ride through the INTERNET! It is very different, but is very good! The plot: There are two very skilled hackers in the California area, one is Wyatt Gillette, who is currently incarcarated for hacking into a business's files and doing illegal hacking. There is also a man known as Phate, who is a murderer. He hacks into his victim's computer or any other government computer and gets information, addresses, and friends of the victim. Phate can hack into absolutely anything! Frank Bishop, a detective for San Jose, California, needs the help of Wyatt Gillette because he believes that he is the only one that can help track down Phate. Gillette is temporarily released and is on the hunt. "The Blue Nowhere," which means that world of computers, is an amazing novel. It's an exhilirating novel of cat and mouse on the net! By the way, the next time your surfing the Internet, be careful, because you may not be alone!
