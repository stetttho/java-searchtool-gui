 After Boris Starling's wonderful masterpiece of a novel, "Messiah," I was greatly awaiting the release of "Storm." Kate Beauchamp, a police detective of Scotland, and Red Metcalfe are back, and they are on the case of the Blackadder. He is a serial killer that kills his victims using the ritual of greek mythology. It starts out when Kate is on a large ferry coming back with her acting team of friends from putting on a production. The captain of the ferry receives a bomb warning from an anonymous source saying that there is a bomb in one of the Transit vans down where all the cars are stored. The captain and his crew dump the van into the water, hopefully, extinguishing the bomb. Well, the captain doesn't close the port doors or the ruters (I am not well educated with all the nautical expressions) accidently, and he turns into a STORM and water leaks into the boat and with the strong force of the STORM, the boat sinks. Passengers jump out, but many don't make it. 327 die. Later, after Kate gets over her distress, she is on the case of the Blackadder. He has killed two women. He cuts their hands and legs off and leaves an adder (a snake) around their necks. As Kate investigates the murders, she discovers a link between them and the attempted bombing of the ferry. Boris Starling takes readers on a suspenseful trip around the United Kingdom, which is fulfilling and enjoyable.
