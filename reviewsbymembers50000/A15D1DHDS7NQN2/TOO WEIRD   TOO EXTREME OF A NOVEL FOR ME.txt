 The two men author team, Peter Gethers & David Handler, are very creative, gifted, and skilled individuals when it comes to the art of writing. I felt that the book was extremely strange. After reading the first one hundred pages of this novel, you think to yourself what the heck are these people talking about when they say the name GIDEON. Well, at first I was turned off from the book because the story seemed so unreal (a struggling author who gets asked to write a book secretly for a strange hit man and his editor, who later gets murdered), but I finished the whole thing! The ending and how it tied together was not what I thought was going to happen after all. I love the cover of this novel, it draws the eye to it immediately and that's what made me buy it. Overall, I would say if you want to read something different than the orginal "serial killer on the loose" novels, then this is your kind of book. Don't mistake me it is a good book, but it just doesn't appeal to me.
