 Robert W. Walker is a fascinating author. I feel that he is one of the best suspense novelists there is. Every one of his Instinct novels and Edge novels are fun, exhilirating, and worthwile to read. FBI Agent Dr. Jessica Coran is a well-developed character, who is enjoyable and exciting to read about. In "Bitter Instinct," there is a killer on the loose who is dubbed as The Poet. At the beginning of the novel, in Philadelphia, he has already killed three victims. Engraved with a sharp pen, the Poet poisons his victims and then writes a few lines of poetry on their back. The Philadelphia police are stumped and ask for the help of Jessica Coran. As Coran and her psychic agent, Kim Desinor, try to capture this sadistic killer, they have to be on the lookout for their own lives. After investigating for days and coming up with no leads, they get a call from a dean the local college who claims to know the identity of the killer. Is this prestigious professor a killer? Is it someone not affiliated with college? Or is it the dean herself? "Bitter Instinct" is an amazing novel with twists and turns everywhere. If you are going to read one suspense novel this summer, then read "Bitter Instinct."
