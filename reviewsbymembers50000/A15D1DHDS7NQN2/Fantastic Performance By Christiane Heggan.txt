 I was so happy when I came upon, "Suspicion." I love mystery novels a lot and I was running out of them to read. Luckily, I discovered Christiane Heggan. "Suspicion" was my first Heggan novel and I loved it so much that I already am beginning another one right now.      Kate Logan, a tough defense attorney, is selected to represent two separate people. One is her ex-husband who is charged with killing a prositute and the other person is Kate's housekeeper's son, who is charged with killing his girlfriend. Kate knows that both are innocent and decides to start her own investigation. She soon becomes suspicious and feels that the prositute and the girlfriend was murdered by the same person. Soon Kate is being stalked and attacked by the murderer. Kate along with police officer, Mitch Calhoun, must bring down this group of murderers before Kate's friends who are charged with murder go to jail for life. Congratulations to Mrs. Heggan because she made it to my list of favorite authors! Brad Stonecipher
