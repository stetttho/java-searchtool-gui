 Aqua is one of those groups that is so unique. You can always identify a song by Aqua because of their two distinctive singers. Everyone remembers the song "Barbie Girl" that gave Aqua their fame. The spunky cute Barbie girl and the man with the deep voice gives away the group as Aqua. "Aquarius" has all of their latest and coolest songs including some of my favorites, such as Halloween, Freaky Friday, and Around The World. If you are in a bad mood or just need some cheering up, then Aqua's songs are what you need!
