 I am still trying to figure this whole thing out. Was this book supposed to be about a crime-solving mystery or whiny soap opera with a mixture of Days of Our Lives and Melrose Place mixed in together? There was so much  WHINING and relationship problems in this book that it drove me crazy!   This book does not live up to all of the other Scarpetta novels at all.  Here are my suggestions to Mrs. Cornwell- Kill that little annoying niece  Lucy, have Mrs. Scarpetta stop whining and blabbering about poor Benton and  stop making Marino look like a stupid drunk. I certainly hope "The  Last Precinct" is better than this novel!
