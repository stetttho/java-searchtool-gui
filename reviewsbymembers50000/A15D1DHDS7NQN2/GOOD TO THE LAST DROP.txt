 Dean Koontz is such a gifted and skilled individual when it comes to writing. I have read all of his novels and practially loved every one of them. He is a very unique author that combines Stephen King and John Sandford together. I believe that "False Memory" was one of his best novels. I like it a lot that Dean Koontz is starting to get away from the supernatural books that he used to write and is writing more mystery and believable type books. There is nothing supernatural in "False Memory." It is about a crazy doctor who wants to turn all of his patients crazy and puts them into a deep sleep in their sessions and hypnotizes them to do evil things, even kill people. Marty, the main character, must try and stop this deranged doctor before Marty's best friend is turned crazy. Dean Koontz will always be one of my favorite authors and I am greatly awaiting his new thriller, "FROM THE CORNER OF HIS EYE" on DECEMBER 26, 2000!
