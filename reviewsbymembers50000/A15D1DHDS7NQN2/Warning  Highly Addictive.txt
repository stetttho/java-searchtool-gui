 I love this CD!! Green Day is definitely one of the coolest alternative groups that there is! I knew I had to purchase this CD after hearing "Minority" on the radio. I was very happy that I did buy it because I found more awesome songs on it. My favorites include Minority, Fashion Victim, Warning and my current favorite song in the whole world, "CASTAWAY!" This is one of the most fabulous songs that I have ever heard. If you love a good alternative album then you gotta buy WARNING!
