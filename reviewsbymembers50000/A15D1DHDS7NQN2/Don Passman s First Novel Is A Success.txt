 I was in a local Costco and I saw a book called The Visionary by Don Passman. I never heard of this guy, but the back sounded good, so I bought it. Boy was I happy i did!  I loved every minute of this book. I couldn't  stop reading it! I will definitely be keeping my eye on Mr. Passman for his  new books in the future.
