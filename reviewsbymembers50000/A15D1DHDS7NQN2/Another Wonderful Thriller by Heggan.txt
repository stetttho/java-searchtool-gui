 My first novel by Christiane Heggan was "Suspicion." I devoured it in two sittings. But "Deception" was even better! Really good mystery novels are so hard to put down. In "Deception," Jill Bennett is shocked to hear the news that her father, Simon Bennett, has driven his automobile over a cliff because of excessive drinking. Jill doesn't believe that it was an accident. She knows that her father would never be that careless. She believes he was murdered! Jill is now being stalked by this killer because she is being to nosy. Jill along with ex-husband and ex-homicide detective, Dan Santini, are on the case to try and decipher who Simon Bennett's murderer is. Is it Olivia, Jill's cousin and business associate that works at Simon's architectal firms? Is it Peter Van Horn, one of Simon's friends and colleagues? Could it even be his own wife? Or is it Mr. Mulligan a greedy man from another business firm? Christiane Heggan is the next Tami Hoag or Iris Johansen in my eyes!
