 "The Madman's Diary," was in my opinion, Thom Racina's best novel. I have read all of his novels and I think they are wonderful masterpieces of suspenseful literary work with an excess usage of mystery, intrigue, and adventure. "The Madman's Diary" was extremely interesting. The author starts the first couple pages with a descriptively gory murder scene that draws the reader in and tempts them to devour this novel in one sitting. The plot: Judy Sussman, who is an interior designer, has noticed that a lot of men in her life are disappearing. Some are dying in gruesome ways. Judy, her friend, Annie, and roommate, Skeet, are watching their backs carefully because somebody is out there watching them. This sadistic person has an obsession with Judy Sussman and he/she feels that no one should belong with her except for himself/herself. This person believes he is a "shaman" and is king. Mr. Racina shows off his knowledge of the Indian culture with descriptive dialogue and structure throughtout the novel. The conclusion of this novel was incredibly well thought out and impressive. Overall, "The Madman's Diary" is a wonderful work of fiction that all mystery fans need to read. Also be on the look out for his next novel coming in early 2002!
