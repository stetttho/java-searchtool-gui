 This has to be one of Stuart Woods's best books, excluding the Stone Barrington ones. Will Lee and his wife, Kate, are going to be the next president and first lady of the U.S. But there are a couple of people who  don't like that idea and they will go to all extremes to let Will not  succeed. Better read this one on a weekend because it is hard to stop.  Looking forward to the next one Mr. Woods.
