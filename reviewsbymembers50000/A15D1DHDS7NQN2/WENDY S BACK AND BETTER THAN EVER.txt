 "The Last To Know" is one of those books that makes you say, "I am so glad that I bought this." This was one of the best psychological suspense novels that I have read for a long time. I loved Wendy's earlier novels like "All The Way Home" and "Fade To Black."     In Townsend Heights, New York, young stay at home mothers are being killed. Sometimes the killer kills the mother with her child standing right next to her. The killer's signature is a puzzle piece left at the crime scenes. Tasha Banks is very scared since she is a stay at home mom and two of the dead mothers were good friends of her. She has three little children and a husband, Joel, who is too much into his work and other things to worry about Tasha and the kids. Margaret, the first victim's sister, is a little off in the head and was extremely jealous of Jane.  The police and an investigative reporter named Paula, believe that perhaps the "Mother" killings were done by a teenager named Jerehmiah, who was seen in the vicinity of the second victim's house. There are suspects everywhere in this novel. Mrs. Staub takes us from group to group of people, some of them are being murdered along the way, one of them is a killer. WHO IS IT? The end will blow you away, I never would have guessed it. I can't wait for Wendy's next novel of suspense in 2002!
