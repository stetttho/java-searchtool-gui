 This is one of my favorite Stuart Woods' novels. I found it at a local used bookstore and decided to try it. This was my second novel by Stuart Woods and I feel, one of his best. Mr. Woods studied and described the  atmosphere and terrain of the south-west in great detail, which was  enjoyable. Another winner for Stuart Woods.
