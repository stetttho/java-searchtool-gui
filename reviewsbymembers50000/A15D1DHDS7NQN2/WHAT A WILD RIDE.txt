 This book was one of the those hijacking novels where there is pure  suspense throughout the whole book and there are to rest stops along the  way. A psychopath dresses up in a clown suit and hijacks a school bus and  holds the kids hostage until he gets paid $20 million dollars. The FBI and  the local police are called in to help. Can the FBI and the cops save the  children in time? Can they stop this madman before more innocents lives are  killed? Note- start this novel on Friday night, because you will be reading  it the whole weekend. It is too good to stop.
