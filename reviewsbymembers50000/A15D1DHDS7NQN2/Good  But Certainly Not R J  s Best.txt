 After reading all three of R.J. Kaiser's novels, I feel that "Payback" is the least best novel. I enjoyed Stephanie and Jack Kidwell a whole lot. I thought that they were really fun characters. After Stephanie's husband is killed, she discovers that she has inherited millions. Stephanie feels that she did not really know her husband as good as she thought. Stephie decides to go on a vacation to the Caribbean and discovers that she is being followed. Later she finds out that her husband was stealing money from a powerful group of people. Stephie has to run Jack Kidwell, her only new friend on the island, who I feel is kind of a slime. She has to find a way to appease these dangerous people before she is bait for the fishes.
