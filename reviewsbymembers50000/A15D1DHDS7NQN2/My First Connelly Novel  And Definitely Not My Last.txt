 I enojoed this novel the whole way through. I read the whole thing in two days, I just couldn't stop! The book was well-written, had great characters, and many other great attributes. I was shocked about the  ending, but it turned out real well. I am going to the bookstore and I'm  going to buy some more Connelly novels.
