 Sorry Cornwell, but Temperance Brennan is a lot better of a character than Kay Scarpetta. In Kathy Reichs's novels there are no soap opera whining periods like Cornwell likes to do. Dr. Tempe is on the hunt for a killer who burned down a house in Quebec. There were four people inside the house, all burned alive. As Tempe investigates, she is greatly disturbed to discover a possible "cult" connection. In this fast-paced novel of thrills and murders, Reichs takes readers on a hunt from Quebec, Canada to North Carolina to try to stop this group of evil cult members before they kill again. The only part that I didn't like about this novel was that in Tempe's free time, she investigated a century year old remains of some religious member at a local church. That part could have been cut of the novel. Overall, "Death DeJour" is a worthwile read!
