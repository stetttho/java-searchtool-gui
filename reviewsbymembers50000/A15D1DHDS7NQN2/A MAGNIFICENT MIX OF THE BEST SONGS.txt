 "Now That's What I Call Music 5" is a wonderful mix of the best Pop, Alternative, and R&B hits. Almost every song on this CD is great, excluding a couple. Some of the best include N'Sync, Britney Spears, Mya, and Destiny's Child. For alternative you've got the smashing hit "Kryptonite," Everclear's "Wonderful," and Nine Days are also on the CD with their hottest hits. The only bad song on this CD is "Shake It Fast" by Mystikal. If you want to have a CD with a great mix of popular music then try the Now That's What I Call Music CD series.
