 In "Cold Paradise," New York private lawyer and ex-cop, Stone Barrington, is back and is in Palm Beach, Florida! He has been sent there by technology millionaire, Thad Shames. Stone's job is to try and find a gorgeous woman who Thad saw a couple weeks earlier. She told Thad her name was Liz, but left no number or address. Stone finds Thad's mystery woman coincidentally. Her real name is Allison Manning! For all you Barrington fans you'll recognize that name from "Dead In The Water," previous Stuart Woods novel. Stone had a relationship with her in St. Marks and she was found guilty of a crime and sentenced to be hung. Somehow Allison got off and has returned to the states. Stone is shocked to see her and is even more shocked to hear that her husband Paul Manning, who was presumed dead in St. Marks is stalking her! Paul was have thought to have been killed and thrown overboard on the Manning's private yacht in St. Marks. Both Mannings participated in an insurance scam, which Allison ended up getting. Weird, huh? Anyway, while Stone is trying to protect Allison from crazy Paul, he also has to keep control of his hormones. Callie, a striking beautiful woman, who works for Shames, is totally infactuated by Barrington and good old Arrington, (Stone's ex-wife), also shows up in the picture, like she always does. If that isn't confusing enough, our favorite little lady, Dolce Bianchi, returns. Dolce is Stone's other ex-wife, who is extremely psychotic. The ending of this novel was very exciting and very well written. The only reason I gave "Cold Paradise" four stars instead of five was because I thought that the way Stone met up with Allison was extremely too coincidental. I thought Mr. Woods could have made that part more believeable. Overall, this is a fun, worthwile read!
