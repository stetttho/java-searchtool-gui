 Dean Koontz is such a unique writer. In "From The Corner Of His Eye," there are three main groups of people with different special qualities and attitudes. Eventually, through deception, murder, and secrets, these three groups of people will come together and present to the reader an amazing story.        There is Bartolomeow Lampion, a young boy who was born right after his mother and father got in a car accident, killing the father. There is Cornelia, a woman who takes care of her sister's newborn baby after she dies in later. Her baby is a direct result of a rape. Lastly, there is Junior Cain, a crazy person, who kills his wife, Naomi, in the beginning of the story. Junior goes into a depression stage and wakes up saying the name Bartolomeow. Junior believes that he is his enemy and he must be destroyed.         These three groups and an important police officer will take the readers on an extraordinary journey, lasting from the 1960's to 2000.
