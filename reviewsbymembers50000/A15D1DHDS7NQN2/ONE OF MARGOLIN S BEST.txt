 I was lucky enough to get an Advanced Readers Copy of this novel, even though I paid a little more money. I just couldn't wait till it was released. Phillip Margolin is one of my favorite courtroom thriller authors. "The Associate" was very interesting. It dealt with Daniel Ames, a lawyer working for a firm in Oregon. He is defending a pharmaceutical company aganist allegations that one of their drugs is the cause to many disfunctions and problems with newborn children. The case picks up steam when a scientist who works for the company gets burned to death. The novel gets more complex from then on, going deeper into the studies of the company and more research. The conclusion is shocking and exciting. This is a must read for courtroom and Margolin fans. Margolin is ten times better than Grisham & Turow! Brad Stonecipher
