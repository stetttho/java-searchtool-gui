 I don't feel like writing a long review about Heartstone, considering the  fact that I accidently wrote it on the novel "After Dark" by  Phillip Margolin page. But Heartstone and After Dark are both fascinating  novels. I would strongly suggest all the novels by Phillip Margolin to  anyone who likes Steve Martini, John Grisham and J.F. Freedman. Make sure  you have your doors securely fastened, because there is a lot of suspense  in the Phillip Margolin novels.
