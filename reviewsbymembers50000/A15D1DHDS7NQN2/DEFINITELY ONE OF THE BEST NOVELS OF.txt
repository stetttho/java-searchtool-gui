 I have read all of Carlene Thompson's novels and loved every one of them. She is an amazingly gifted and talented writer who, in my opinion is just as good as Mary Higgins Clark or better. Most all of her novels take place in a small town or community. A murder is occured there and the local police force is on the hunt for the killer. "Don't Close Your Eye" was Mrs. Thompson's best novel yet. The ending of the novel was great, along with the great cast of characters. Definitely put this novel on the "must read list!"
