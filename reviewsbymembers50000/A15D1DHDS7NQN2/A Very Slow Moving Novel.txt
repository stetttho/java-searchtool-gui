 Having just finished reading all of the fascinating and unbelievably good  Phillip Margolin novels, I decided to try another author in that same  genre. Well, Richard N. Patterson doesn't even come close to the quality of  Margolin. I picked up Dark Lady because I saw it in soooo many stores that  it drove me crazy, so I decided to read it. Good thing that I got it for  half price because it is so boring. Too much of a history lesson  thoroughout the first 30 pages. It is a typical drug/ murder novel with  nothing that is very exciting. I don't care for the main character, Stella  Marz, at all. This book is mainly a time-filler novel. Try the other  Patterson, JAMES PATTERSON, that's a good novelist.
