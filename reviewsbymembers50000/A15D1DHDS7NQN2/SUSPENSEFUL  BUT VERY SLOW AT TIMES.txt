 I have read all of Catherine Coulter's FBI Suspense thrillers (The Cove, The Maze, The Target, The Edge) so I decided to try one of her revised contemporary suspense novels. False Pretenses did not even come to the FBI thrillers. False Pretenses and Beyond Eden have a TON OF ROMANCE in it and not much suspense. Elizabeth Carleton is married to Timothy Carleton, a very rich man. He gets stabs with an ice pick and is killed. Elizabeth goes on trial for his murder but is proven innocent. Timothy's whole family is fighting a war to try and get Timothy's business and his money away from Elizabeth (the heir). This novel is mostly a family bickering session. Near the end of the novel Elizabeth trys to discover who killed Timothy, is it the mysterious person who testified on her behalf, her new lover, or a business associate? If you want SUSPENSE, try the novels I earlier mentioned. False Pretenses should just be classified as a romance novel.
