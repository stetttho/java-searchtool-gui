 I believe that "Dr. Death" was one of Jonathan Kellerman's best novels that he has ever written. Alex and Milo are such great characters, they make such a great team, although I can't understand why Kellerman made Milo like men. Alex and Milo are on the case of "Dr. Death," aka Dr. Eldon Mate. Dr. Mate helped over fifty, sick or depressed people end their lives with various methods of death, including euthuansia, and drug induced methods . Dr. Mate is found brutally murdered in the back of his van, with some of his body parts hacked off. It is very difficult for Alex and Milo to narrow down a suspect because there are over fifty families that could hold a grudge. They start investigating Richard, a long time aquatinence of Alex's. Richard's wife, Joanna, was thought to have been Dr. Mate's latest victim, and Richard was very angry. Unfortunately for Alex, he gets stuck to counsel Richard's son and daughter because of there problems at home and with their mother. Who killed the famous Dr. Death? Was it Richard or his family?  Was it another one of the 49 families? Or was it someone else, someone with a sick obsession of Dr. Death, who was jealous of him? I guarantee you, if you're a Kellerman fan, than you'll fullfilling enjoy "Dr. Death." Brad Stonecipher
