 "Gathering Lies" was one of those novels that was hard to put down because the suspense was incessant. This novel takes place on a little, beautiful island off the coast of Seattle. Attorney Sarah Lansing accepts an invitation from old friend named Timothea, to come spend a week at her writers colony with five other potential writers on the island. Sarah happily agrees because she is in the middle of a total mess back in Seattle. She is trying to prosecute four policemen for brutally raping and beating a prostitute to death. The policemen have been after Sarah lately because she has a key piece of evidence that could put them away. Sarah plans to write a novel about corrupt police and include the incident in Seattle. When she gets to the island, a huge earthquake hits (9.1 on the scale), all the buildings collapse and leave one women dead and the other women seek shelter in an abandoned house where Sarah's old friend used to live. Then two strangers, Luke & Gabe, appear and Sarah's evidence disappears. She and the other women are deeply attracted to both these men. But, which one can they trust? One is there to help and one harbors a deadly secret. This is an amazing novel and may be Meg O'Brien's best yet! Brad Stonecipher
