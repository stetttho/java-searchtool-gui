 I have always liked almost all of Madonna's songs. The ones on her new CD are definitely great, especially "Music," which is number two on the charts right now! I thought the CD had a great variety of Madonna's new songs. I enjoyed every one of them. I didn't really care for the front of the album though, I felt that they could have come up with something a little more enticing. Madonna is one of those singers that will always be good, popular, and successful. This new CD is well-worth the money because it brings many hours of enjoyment.
