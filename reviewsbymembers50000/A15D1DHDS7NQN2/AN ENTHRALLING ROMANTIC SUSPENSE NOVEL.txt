 Actually to be exact, I would give "Dead End" about 3.5 stars. There are many parts that I loved about this novel and some parts that I thought "WHAT THE HECK?" I have read all of Helen R. Myers's novels and I my favorite was "Lost." I believe that "Lost" was a little bit better than this one. The storyline: In a small rural town in Texas, Brette Barry finds a bloody handprint on a DEAD END sign on her way home from delivering the mail in front of the Pughs farm. Brette, being the paranoid thing that she is, starts to worry that it is a prank from her son, Eric, or his friend, Hank. Eric denies it. Now any normal human being would drop the subject and say who cares, it's a handprint, but not Brette. Later on into the evening, Hank goes missing and Brette and her neighbor and upcoming lover Sam go out looking for the teen. Now let us go back to "common sense." Hank's mother, Sally, does not want to go out and search for her missing son because she is too drunk. Come on people it's her son! So Bette and Sam come back empty-handed.      A couple days later, Hank comes back after hitchhiking a ride with a trucker from St. Louis. He tells Bette that he met a teenager online and decided to go met her. (I hope any of my fellow teen friends don't decide to do this, STUPID!) I won't give away anymore of this side of the story because that would be unfair. But good old Brette still cannot get over that handprint! As obnoxious Brette interrogates her neighbors, she discovers that Tracie Pugh has disappeared! Brette goes to the sheriff with this information, claiming that it was Tracie's handprint on the sign. Later on, Brette's tires get slashed and other threats appear, (typical isn't it). Brette is on a mission to find Tracie Pugh and to discover who called Hank up to St. Louis. Slow and sometimes annoying, but overall a good romantic suspense novel.
