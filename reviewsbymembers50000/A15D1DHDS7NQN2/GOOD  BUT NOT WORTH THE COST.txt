 I enjoyed this novel of survival and suspense from Rick Mofina, but I don't believe it was worth the seven fifty. In some parts of the novel, it just dragged on and moved slowly. I thought it was odd that the police just assumed Doug and Emily were guilty for the disappearance of their daughter because Doug cut his hand on the ax. I also felt that the jail break and the chase after, Doug and Emily's daughter, Paige, was kind of thrown in there just for the end. In some ways, this novel left the author wondering a lot about why the family even bothered to go on this ridiculous camping trip. If you want to read a novel about surviving in the wilderness and surviving mental breakdowns then read this novel. If you are a hard-core suspense fan, then SAVE YOUR TIME & YOUR MONEY!
