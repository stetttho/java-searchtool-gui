 Wonderful novel! James Patterson can write demonic and somewhat fantasy books just as great as his other mystery novels. The plot was beautifully well written and the ending turned out not the way I thought, but much  better. I am greatly awaiting James's next novel Roses Are Red in November!  Keep up the great work James!
