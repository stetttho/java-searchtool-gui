 I recently read "Just For The Summer" by Laura Van Wormer and thought that that novel was horribly slow-moving and dull. But I later learned that "Just For The Summer" was the novel where Mrs. Wormer began her transition from romance to romantic suspense. So I decided to give "Talk" a try. I was very happy that I did because it was great.    Talk show host, Jessica Wright, is being stalked by an obsessive fan. He sends Jessica threatening letters and notes promising to be there for her "always". It starts to get way out of hand when this stalker kills Jessica's secretary, Bea. Next Jessica is kidnapped at a local party/ function! It is up to her lover and friend, Will, her producer, Cassy, the FBI and local police to try and save Jessica before her life is claimed buy a nutcase who will do anything, absolutely anything, for Jessica! I already have Expose, Mrs. Van Wormer's next romantic suspense novel, in my possession and I'm looking forward to reading it greatly! Brad Stonecipher
