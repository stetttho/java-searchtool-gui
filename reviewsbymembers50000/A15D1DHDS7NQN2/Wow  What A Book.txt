 The Black Ice was my 5th Michael Connelly novel. I ran out and bought it after I finished The Black Echo. I thoroughly enjoyed The Black Ice the whole way through. I thought that the idea and concept of the plot was very  neat. The ending is the thing that shocked me. This book had to do with the  smuggling and production of a drug called Black Ice. It links the plant  down in Mexico with some murders in the Hollywood/ LA area. That means  Harry Bosch is on the case, and that's a good thing. This was not my  favorite Connelly novel but close to it.
