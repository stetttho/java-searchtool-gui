 My first novel by this amazing author was "Dearly Beloved," one of Wendy Corsi Staub's first novels, what I got at a used bookstore, that is now out-of-print. I absolutely loved it! I then went to the store and bought "Fade to Black." This novel was even better. I read the whole thing in two days. I was on a Wendy Run!! So then I saw "All The Way Home." I bought and devoured it in one day! It was the best one that she wrote. The plot: Four teenage girls mysteriously disappeared from Lake Charlotte, New York, including Carleen Connelly, Rory (the main character's) sister. Rory goes off the college and returns to Lake Charlotte ten years later. While she is back in town she meets Barrett Maitland, Rory finds him attractive and strange at the same time. Then on the anniversary of the first girls disapperance ANOTHER GIRL IS TURNED UP MISSING! Can Rory solve this crime and find out what happened to her sister before she becomes the next victim? WENDY CORSI STAUB IS THE NEXT MARY HIGGINS CLARK IN MY MIND! Keep your eyes open for "The Last To Know," Wendy's next thriller in April 2001!
