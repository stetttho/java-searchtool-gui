 "Expose" dealt with the same characters from "Talk." Alexandra Waring, Jessica Wright, and Cassy Cochran. This is kind of a follow up but with a much deeper view in each of these persons lives. Sally Harrington is recruited by EXPECTATIONS magazine to do an "Expose" (interview, biography) piece on Cassy Cochran. She goes back and forth from Connecticut to New York almost every day. About six tenths of this book is about interviewing people and love scenes and the other four tenths is about a MURDER! Back in Connecticut, a man is found dead by a gunshot. Sally is the one who discovers the body after a mysterious phone call, leading her to the scene. With the help of Crazy Pete, a local character who seems to have conspiracy theories for everything, Sally must discover who killed this man, where did he come from, and why is it that this man's death ties in with her father's death twenty years ago. If you want to read Laura Van Wormer and you like suspense her novels are: TALK, EXPOSE, and THE LAST LOVER.
