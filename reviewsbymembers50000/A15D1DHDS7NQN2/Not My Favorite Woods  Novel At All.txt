 I did not think that "Under The Lake" lived up to the other novels by Stuart Woods. Maybe it was because Stone Barrington wasn't in them. I actually thought the plot was strange and did not turn out all too  well. My favorites are Worst Fears Realized and Orchid Beach. If you want a  Stuart Woods' novel, don't pick this one.
