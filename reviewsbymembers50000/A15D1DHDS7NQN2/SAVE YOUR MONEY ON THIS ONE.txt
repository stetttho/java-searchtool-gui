 I have read many wonderful mystery novels and I do not believe "Dark of the Moon" was very good. Louis Kincaid, a sherriff in this small town, who is the main character, is not a very likeable character at all. The mystery that the police in this little community in Mississippi have to solve, is the thirty year old murder of a young black man. His bones are discovered in the present with a noose next to the body, and Louis Kincaid feels a special bond between the boy and himself, since they are both black. Many years ago many blacks in Mississippi were treated as slaves and being hung. Louis really wants to discover who hung and killed this innocent young man. Unfortunately, everyone in the town doesn't want to talk to him. Secrets are everywhere around there. A few more people die along the way. The conclusion wasn't very good also. If you're looking for mystery novels to read, save your money for James Patterson.
