 This was another blockbuster novel by the new queen of suspense, Christiane Heggan! Heggan and Mary Higgins Clark are two of the best mystery novelists. Clark takes the readers more into the big cities like New York, where she has the big time cops solving crimes, while Heggan likes small-town investigating. Both are great! I have now read every single novel that Heggan has written and I believe that "Enemy Within" was her best or second best novel. The plot on the back doesn't make the novel sound super great. But make no mistake, IT IS super great. Great suspense, many amazing secrets about the characters involved, shocking surprises, greed, and an unthinkable ending. I have Heggan's newest novel "Blind Faith" in my possession and I'm looking forward to reading it.
