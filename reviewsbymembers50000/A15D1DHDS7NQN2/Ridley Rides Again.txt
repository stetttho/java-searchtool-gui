 Mr. Pearson gets better and better everytime. I could not put this book down for anything. I finished it in one day. Which is the average amount of time it takes for a REALLY GOOD book. Lou Boldt and Daphne Matthews are  such wonderful characters. Middle of Nowhere will take you everywhere  around Seattle and across the Puget Sound. Looking forward for more, Mr. P!
