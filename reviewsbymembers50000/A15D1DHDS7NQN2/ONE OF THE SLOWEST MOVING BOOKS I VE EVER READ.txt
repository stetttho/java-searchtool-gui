 How did this book ever get published? It was the most boring thing that I've read this year. The entire book is about 474 pages. Just imagine wasting all that time for nothing. I believe that this novel should be considered general fiction and nothing more. There was some romance in it, but hardly any suspense. It just went on and on. The main characters went to about a thousand dinner parties and banquets. That took up about 75 pages in all! Nothing exciting happened at all until about page 250. But don't get me wrong, Laura Van Wormer is a good writer, because I'm reading "Talk" and loving it! Just trust me, save your money on "Just For The Summer." Brad Stonecipher
