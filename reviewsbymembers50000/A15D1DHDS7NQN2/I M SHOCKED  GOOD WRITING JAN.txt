 "Bones" was my second novel that I have read by Jan Burke. The first one was called "Liar." I absolutely hated "Liar!" It was so slow. The main character, Irene Kelly, was a sap to read about. The mystery was just sooo ridiculous and I had to put it down after page 200. "Bones" is much, much different. It is a fascinating novel of suspense and Irene Kelly has turned into a Dr. Temperance Brennan (Kathy Reichs) or Dr. Kay Scarpetta (Patricia Cornwell) character. The whole beginning of "Bones" kept the readers on the edge of their seat on the wild ride with a serial killer through the Sierra Nevadas and into the city of Las Piernas. The climax and ending were both exhilirating and suspenseful! If you were like me and did not any of Jan Burke's older novels, then try "Bones" and "Flight" because that is where Jan Burke shines.
