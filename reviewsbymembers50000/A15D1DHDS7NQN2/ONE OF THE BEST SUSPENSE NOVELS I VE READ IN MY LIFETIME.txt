 In my opinion, Lisa Gardner is one of the most talented novelists that there is on this planet. "The Next Accident" and all of her other three previous novels are magnificent masterpieces of psychological suspense. I actually think she is better than most of the female authors I've mentioned in earlier reviews. "The Next Accident" is Gardner's best novel yet, BY FAR! This one featured Rainie Connor and FBI Agent Pierce Quincy, (who were also in "The Third Victim). Quincy who lives in Virginia close to the FBI Quantico Headquarters, gets news that his daughter has been killed in a fatal car accident. Foul play is suspected. As Pierce tries to piece together the last events of his daughters past and try to narrow down a list of possible suspects with grudges, he starts to worry about his other family members, like his other daughter and his ex-wife. When another tragedy strikes, he goes to Portland, Oregon, to ask for Rainie's help. As Rainie and Pierce work together they have a hard time keep their attraction for each other a secret. Steamy romance and incessant suspense are non-stop in this fabulous thriller. Lisa, you have made it to the top of my list! I can't wait for you next one!
