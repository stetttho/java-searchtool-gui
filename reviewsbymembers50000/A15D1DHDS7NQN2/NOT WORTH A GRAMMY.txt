 This is one of the worst CD's I have ever purchased in my life! How could forty percent of these artists even win a Grammy? Half of these artists are not even on the radio or heard anywhere. Track 1- "Say My Name" by Destiny's Child- AN AWESOME SONG! Track 2- "I Try" by Macy Gray- HORRIBLE, MISERABLE SONG! Track 3- "Music" by Madonna- It's great, another winner! Track 4- "Bye, Bye, Bye" by N'Sync- I love it! Track 5- "Beautiful Day" by U2- another winner. Track 6- "Beck" by Sexx Laws- Garbage, who the heck are these people? Track 7- "Slim Shady" by Eminem- Not bad, but not great Track 8- "Optimistic" by Radioheard- Pure junk! Track 9- "You're The One" by Paul Simon- He's From The 70's! Track 10- "Cousin Dupree" bye Steely Dan- Who is that? Track 11- " What a Girl Wants" by Aguilera- Fabulous Track 12, 13- I can't stand these songs. Tracks 14-17- Good songs Overall it's about fifty percent good and fifty percent horrible. Not worth the money!
