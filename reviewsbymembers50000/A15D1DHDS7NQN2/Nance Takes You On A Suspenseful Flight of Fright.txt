 This was my very first book by John J. Nance that I have read. I ended up  liking Pandora's Clock a whole bunch. It was about an airplane that was  thought to have a contagious pathogen disease on it and no airport would  let the plane land. It was quite frightening considering the fact that I  was reading it on a plane to Las Vegas and later on a trip to the Grand  Canyon. The time passed quickly though, because this book was very hard to  put down. I think I will read some other books by Mr. Nance now.
