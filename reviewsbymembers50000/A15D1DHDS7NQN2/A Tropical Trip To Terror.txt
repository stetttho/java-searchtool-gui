 Stuart Woods takes readers down to the Caribbean with Stone Barrington. Stone has to help prove the innocence of a beautiful woman, Allison, who is accused of murdering her husband. Throughout the trial, Stone tries to  defend her reputation and his own. Overall a good book, but a depressing  ending.
