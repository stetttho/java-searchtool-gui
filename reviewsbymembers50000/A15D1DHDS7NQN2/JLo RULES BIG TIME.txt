 Not only does Jennifer Lopez look extremely hot, but she sings incredibly hot. I was reading some of the previous reviews and they were saying that she is the Spanish Madonna. I do not agree with that statement. I think Lopez is very unique in her own way. She is a celebrity you can't compare anyone to because she can sing and act! "Love Don't Cost A Thing" is probably one of my top five songs right now. It has the coolest rhythm, beat, and sounds. Also if you are getting tired of "Love Don't Cost A Thing," then my second favorite song is "Ain't It Funny." That song is hecka cool! Also "Play" and "Walking On Sunshine" are fun also. JLO is DEFINITELY worth the money.
