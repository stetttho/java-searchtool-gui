 "1st To Die" is the first in a new series from James Patterson. The characters are phenomenal, the plot is intriguing, and there is fast-paced suspense everywhere. Brides and grooms are getting murdered on their wedding day around the San Francisco area and Inspector Lindsay Boxer is on the case. Lindsey, Claire (the medical examiner), Cindy (an investigative reporter), and Jill (a district attorney), form the Women's Murder Club. Along with their current jobs, they are all on the case of the bride-groom murders. Even though Alex Cross is not in this novel the suspense and action is just as good or better than the novels featuring him. This book is totally worth the money! The ending of this book will shock you totally, just like "Roses Are Red" did. I can't wait for his next women's mystery novel, "2nd Chance" to come out next year!
