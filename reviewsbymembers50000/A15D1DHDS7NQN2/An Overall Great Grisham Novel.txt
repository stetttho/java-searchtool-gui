 My two favorite John Grisham novels are The Testament and this one. I thought that the storyline was wonderful in the Brethren! I liked the characters and their great descriptions. I thought that the ending was not  too great. But it left you hanging and made you wonder if there is going to  be a sequel. Great work JOHN!
