 I have read all of Ridley Pearson's novels that he has written and he is definitely one of my favorite authors. He defintely ranks right up there with James Patterson, John Sandford, and Jonathan Kellerman. I believe that "Parallel Lies" was one of his best novels yet! I received an Advanced Reading Copy of "Parallel Lies" two months ago and I was shocked at how good it was. This novel could definitely be a movie because Ridley paints such a great picture of the setting and the surroundings, especially during the train rides. The plot: A man by the name of Umberto Alvarez holds a grudge against one of the biggest railroad companies because their lights and warning signals around a railroad track crossing failed to warn his wife and children that a train was approaching. His whole family was killed by the train. Umberto feels a need to try and destroy all of this companies railroad cars. Peter Tyler is the investigator called in to try and determine who is wrecking these trains. Peter must try and stop Umberto before he gets to the companies new FAST Train and ruins that one. Unfortunately, Peter discovers some rotten details about the companies' way of running business. The ending of this novel was WONDERFUL! I felt so satisfied at the end. If you are going to read one novel this summer, read "Parallel Lies!" Oh, by the way, you might want to fasten your seatbelts.
