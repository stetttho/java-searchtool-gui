 The Last Coyote was my 7th Michael Connelly. I found The Last Coyote just as good as the rest of them. The only bad thing is that they portray Harry Bosch as a drunk, loser, cigarette-smoking slob in this one, which he  isn't. I loved the plot the whole way through and was, like always,  surprised with the ending. I really didn't see why the author named this  book "The Last Coyote," I feel that were better names for the  title than that. Overall, another winner.
