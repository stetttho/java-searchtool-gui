 I am extremely happy to see Robert Crais break away from his light-hearted Elvis Cole novels because "Demolition Angel" was my kind of novel. No offense to Elvis Cole lovers, but I do not like to read suspense novels that have a lot of humor in them. I like to read about a lot more serious and intelligent investigators, like FBI Agent Carol Starkey. She reminds me more of like Agent Maggie O'Dell from Alex Kava's FBI novels. The beginning of this novel starts out with a bang as an unknown man leaves a bomb next to a garbage can. Starkey's friend thinks the bomb is not that serious and is not cautious enough while approaching the bomb. He gets blown to pieces. While Carol is lamenting over the loss of her friend, she gets on the case of Mr. Red who leaves bombs for people to find. As Carol investigates she discovers that the bomber could be someone fairly close to the department. This is a nonstop race all the way until the end when the seconds are ticking away. If you like HARD CORE SUSPENSE NOVELS like John Sandford or Robert W. Walker and don't like the ELVIS COLE series, (like me) then you'll love "Demolition Angel."
