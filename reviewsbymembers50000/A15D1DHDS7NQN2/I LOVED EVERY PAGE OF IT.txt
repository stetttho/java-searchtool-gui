 Mary Higgins Clark has written another winning suspense novel. I always look forward every year to mid-April because there is always a new thriller from the Queen of Suspense. "On The Street Where You Live" was one of her best ones yet. The plot: Emily Graham has moved to New Jersey from New York because of her new job. She decides to move into her great-great grandmother, Madeline's, large house. There Emily hears the story that her great-great grandmother disappeared one-hundred and ten years ago and was never found. After reading and researching many articles about Madeline's mysterious disappearance, Emily discovers that two other women were kidnapped and never found during that period. Now back in the present. Emily is having a pool dug at the new house and while the workers are digging, they find two bodies. One is her great-great-grandmother and the other is a girl who recently disappeared in 2001, on the same day of Madeline's abduction. There is a serial killer killing new women on the same day of the three other's disapperance one hundred and ten years ago. Could this be the same killer? Was he/she reincarnated? Who is killing women on the anniversary of the other women? Who could know where the ancient women were buried? Mary Higgins Clark writes an amazing and complex mystery novel that will take readers on a roller coaster ride of suspense!
