 Well, I have to admit, I love Britney Spears. I love all of her songs, everyone since "Hit Me Baby One More Time." This was a great CD all around. It was full of her latest and best songs. My favorite songs were Oops I Did It Again (of course), Lucky, and Stronger. I agree with a lot of people when they say that a lot of Britney's songs are very similar to each other, but they are all happy, fun, and lively songs. If you need something to cheer you up Britney's songs should do it. I don't care for some of Brit's slow songs, as much as the fun dancing ones, but the CD is well worth it.
