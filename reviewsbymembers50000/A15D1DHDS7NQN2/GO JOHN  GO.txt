 I love to see Mr. Grisham writing about incidents outside of the courtroom. I enjoyed the trip to South America a lot. I felt like I was down there with him. He described it so well. The plot was so good and I  loved the ending. He did a great job of describing the greedy little  relatives in the story. It made you really hate them. Please write more  books like The Brethren and The Testament.
