 I am very glad that I bought Jessica Simpson's latest CD titled "Sweet Kisses." I enjoy practically every song on it. Her and Mandy Moore are the new female teen sensations, other than Christina and Britney, of course! My three favorite songs on the CD are Final Heartbreak, I've Got My Eyes On You, and I Think I'm In Love With You. The one song that I do not like at all is "I Wanna Love You Forever." That song is too whiny and loud for me. Overall, Jessica Simpson's latest CD is a good choice to buy.
