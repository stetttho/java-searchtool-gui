 Yeah, after reading "Fatal Voyage," I honestly believe that Kathy Reichs is a better writer than Patricia Cornwell. Both Temperance Brennan & Kay Scarpetta are similar and strong characters (except maybe in "Black Notice"), but I would say that Brennan is more realistic and more enjoyable to read about. I found "Fatal Voyage" to be extremely different then Reichs's previous novels. Mostly Brennan is in the morgue cutting up and doing an autopsy on ONE person. In "Fatal Voyage," an aircraft has crashed in the mountains outside of Virginia, taking down an entire school club organization with it. Tempe has to sift through hundreds of bodies and plane wreckage to try and determine if the crash was an accident or a deliberate act of murder. Authorities claim that the crash was deliberate and try to determine if the passengers had any major enemies. Most of their investigation turns up nothing and leave the investigators stumped. Brennan, along with her secret love from previous novels, accidently stumble upon some shocking news about the local town around the crash site. She discovers that there were an extremely high amount of deaths over the last ten years. As she investigates more she gets uncomfortable feelings from the local townspeople that she discovered something secretive about the town. The ending of "Fatal Voyage" was extremely surprising as the story took off on two different directions. The question for us Cornwell/Reichs readers is: Will "Isle of Dogs" be better than "Fatal Voyage?" I guess we'll have to wait until October 8 to find out!....
