 Our class was required to read this novel this year and I was actually quite surprised by how good it was. Gene Forrester and Finny, Gene's friend, are the main characters in this novel. Gene is quite disturbed and jealous of his friend because he is so good at sports. Gene goes to great length to try and be even with Finny, he even shakes a tree limb, which makes Finny fall to the ground and become paralyzed. This novel probes into the mind of crazy, obsessive, people and the extent that they will go to to be considered "part of the group."
