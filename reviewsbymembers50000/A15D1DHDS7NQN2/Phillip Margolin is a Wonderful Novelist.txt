 This was my fourth Phillip Margolin book and he seems to not disappoint me  anywhere over the course of his four books. I have loved everyone of his.  AFTER DARK looked really enticing from the back of the book and it sure  was! A couple, two teenagers, are out on Lookout Point having a romantic  evening. The next day they are found missing and later found murdered. The  cops have two suspects, two poor brothers, who are jealous of the couple  because they are rich. It is up to the defense attorney and the cops to  find the truth. Later the two brothers are acquitted. Did the Court release  two innocent men or two guilty murderers? Read it and find out!
