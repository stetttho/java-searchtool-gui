 I do not understand why numerous previous readers have ranted and raved so much about "Beneath The Skin" as being a suspenseful and exciting read that is extremely hard to put down. These people obviously have not read enough authors to know what good suspense is. I have read thousands of mystery/suspense and romantic suspense novels and "Beneath The Skin doesn't get come close to being as good as those were. Suspense? GIVE ME A BREAK, it is hard to stay awake while reading this incessant biography of all these three brain-dead women who go through a traumatic time period of receiving threats in the mail. Now people, doesn't this seem a little childish? These women are getting death threats and perverse sexual letters in the mail. Come on Mrs/Mr. French, isn't that a little juvenile? To me this sounds like an R.L. Stine Fear Street novel or Christopher Pike novel, which are for eight to thirteen year olds. Here are some parts of the novels that are so ridiculous that they shock me: After the first woman, Zoe, is murdered after one hundred and twenty pages of her life story, and another women, Jenny, gets a another series of letters from the same author, the police fail to tell Jenny that she better watch out. The police officer is too busy having sexual relations with her. This is the same story with the third woman, but luckily for the readers, this one has a few brains her head. Give me a break! The story was just so slow-moving and repetitive that I was so glad that I could finish it. If you like Tami Hoag, Iris Johansen, Kay Hooper, or Carlene Thompson, then you will hate this book because it's not even in the same ballpark as the ones that I just mentioned. BE SMART, SAVE YOUR MONEY!
