 I was so jublilated to discover that Kay Hooper has written another psychic murder mystery series. I absolutely loved all of her previous "Shadow Series" novels and I think that the "Evil Series" will be just as good. "Touching Evil" featured everyone's favorite psychic FBI Agent, Noah Bishop! The plot: Women are getting murdered, maimed, and mutilated in Seattle, Washington. Luckily, one of the victims survived her horrific experience. Sketch artist Maggie O'Connor is called in by the Seattle PD to help recreate a picture of the city's latest psychopath from the surviving victim. Maggie has psychic abilities. When she goes to visit the crime scenes, visions come into her head. Either of pictures of the murder or scenes from the victims eyes. A powerful businessman needs Maggie to help catch this killer because this psychopath butchered his sister. As the case intensifies, and the danger for Maggie's life escalates, Agent Bishop is called in to help. This novel keeps the suspense pounding the whole way like a nerve shattering roller coaster ride all the way until the exciting finale. I can't wait for "Whisper of Evil" in March 2002!
