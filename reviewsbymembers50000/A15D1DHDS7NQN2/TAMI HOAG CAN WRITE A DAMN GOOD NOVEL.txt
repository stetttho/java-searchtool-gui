 You would be shocked to know that Tami Hoag used to write romance novels only, not suspense. Later, in about 1995, Tami did a transaction from  romance novels to suspense novels, and boy does she write good ones. Dust  to Dust is kind of a sequel/ follow up to Ashes to Ashes that came out in  March 1999 and is now in paperback. I enjoyed Ashes to Ashes a lot. On  August 1, I ran out to the store and bought Dust to Dust and was hooked to  reading it on the first day. This book had great characters, Sam Kovac and  Nikki Liska from Ashes to Ashes. Dust to Dust was another success by Mrs.  Hoag that left you hooked to the novel page by page. Dust to Dust had a  very surprising ending, which left me in shock. It seems like all the  authors surprise me in the end. A gay cop, Andy Fallon, is killed after  hanging himself in his own house, which is believed as suicide, but it is  not and the story leads to his father, to rich and famous Ace Wyatt, cops  in the Minneapolis Police Department, and even to the chief of the Internal  Affairs. You could trust no one in this novel at anytime because everyone  had a motive leading from prejudice against gays to a disturbing case  twenty years that involved Andy Fallon's father, Mike. If you are a fan of  Iris Johansen, Erica Spindler, and Wendy Corsi Staub then Tami Hoag is the  one for you and Dust to Dust tops the list of her best novels.
