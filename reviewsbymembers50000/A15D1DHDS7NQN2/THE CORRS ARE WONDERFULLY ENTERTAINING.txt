 When I heard The Corrs, hit single "Breathless" on the radio, I knew that I would like this CD. The Corrs are a group of three gorgeous women and one guy who can sing amazingly. You can't really compare The Corrs to any other group because they are so unique. The have wonderful voices and the background acoustics are great. There is a little Irish ring to their music also. Their best singles on "In Blue" are At Your Side, Reason, and of course, Breathless. I am looking forward till their next mix of songs.
