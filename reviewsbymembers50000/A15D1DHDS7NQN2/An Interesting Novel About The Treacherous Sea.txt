 James Powlick's novel, Sea Change, was about contaminated liquid that was  dumped into into the Northern Pacific Ocean off the coast of Seattle  accidently by a cargo carrier from the Orient. The liquid is a disease  called Pfesteria, which is a deadly and dangerous disease. Many people  throughout the novel are being killed if their body touches parts of the  contaminated ocean. The body burn and sizzles and the person dies a painful  death. A group of scientists and oceanographers are on the hunt to try and  stop the contaminating fluid before the whole ocean is affected and the  city of Seattle!
