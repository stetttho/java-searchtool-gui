 This is my second Barbara Parker novel. The first one was very slow and it  was hard to stay focused on it. That novel was called Suspicion of Guilt.  Now this novel, is just as slow. A lot of romance and a lot of flirting  games that takes up a lot of the story. Barbara Parker also describes each  person in too much detail. Don't mistake me, I think it is great that an  author can describe their characters good, but I don't need to know about  his sparkling jewelry and wear he bought his loafers, and about his Gucci,  neatly pressed suit in EACH CHAPTER! The suspense was slow until the end.  Then you got to hear about the main characters daughter's problems. Very  slow moving plot for about the first 430 pages. Then the last 15 were good.  The book talked about totally different trial cases that had nothing to do  with the main plot of the story! By the way, Gail and Anthony are such  sappy characters. I won't be reading much more Barbara Parker. If you like  lawyers and suspense try Phillip Margolin.
