 I have read all of R.J. Kaiser's novels and I have enjoyed almost everyone of them. I believe that "Glamour Puss" was definitely one of the best! Mr. Kaiser mixes a large dosage of suspense with a moderate dosage of romance. In 1978, Mac McGowan, an owner of a pool company, and his lover, Stella, who he was having an affair with, killed Stella's husband who was nicknamed "Glamour Puss" and buried his body underneath the foundation of their swimming pool. Now 22 years later, the past is creeping back on Mac and Stella, who are now separated. Mac is very rich now and he owns many pool corporations. Mac gets a note saying that someone knows what he and his lover did 22 years ago. Later another note follows and then the blackmailing begins! If that isn't bad enough, Mac and his business associate are being shot at by another person who holds a grudge aganist him because of some business problems! Mac and Stella race to decipher who this person that knows about their past is, before their glamourous lives turn to hell! R.J. Kaiser is a wonderful author of romantic suspense. I'm looking forward to his next novel in June of 2001!
