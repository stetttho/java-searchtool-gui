 The first song of Dexter Freebish that I heard on the radio was "Leaving Town." This is still one of my favorite songs. The entire album of Dexter Freebish is great. The first four songs on the CD are the best. "Higher" I feel is the best one of the tracks! But all the songs are a great mix of alternative and rock. Freebish reminds me of Third Eye Blind in a way. Put "A Life Of Saturdays" on your must buy list.
