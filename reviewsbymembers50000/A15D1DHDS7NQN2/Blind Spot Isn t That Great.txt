 I found this novel in a local bookseller. I have never heard of Barbara  Shapiro, so I gave her try and I really didn't care for the novel at all.  It started out weird and the ending ended in a strange way. The author  talked about psychic experiences and different weird things that were kind  of interesting but this book did not have a solid plot. Also it kind of  tells you things about this author when she has NO books in print. They all  went out of print, probably because of lack of popularity and interest.  Sorry Barbara!
