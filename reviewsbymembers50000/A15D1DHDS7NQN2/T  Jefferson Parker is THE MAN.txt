 This was the first book I've read by Mr. Parker and well, all I can say is that I am going to read every book he's written now. The Blue Hour had a great storyline and great characters. I love Merci Rayborn. It was too bad  about Tim Hess though. I am looking forward to reading the rest of his  novels.
