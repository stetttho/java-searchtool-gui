 "Lost" was by far the best novel that Helen R. Myers has written! The whole book was practially ALL MYSTERY and not so much of the romance garbage! I loved ever page of the novel. Helen Myers had great characters throughout the whole novel. It also had many suspects who you thought could have been the murderer. But whoever you think is the murderer, I guarantee you that you will be wrong, because the ending shocked me. I am greatly awaiting Helen's next mystery novel coming in 2001. This book is definitely worth the money!
