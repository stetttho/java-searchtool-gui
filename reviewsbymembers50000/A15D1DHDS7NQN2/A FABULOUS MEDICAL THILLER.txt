 It seems to me that Tess Gerritsen is slowing changing over from the Medical Suspense category to the Suspense category. Sure, "The Surgeon" had some of the medical jargon that sometimes drove me crazy because I am so ignorant when it comes to anything medical, (of course I'm only 17), but it didn't have a fraction as much as "Life Support" and "Harvest." This book dealt with a serial killer who rapes and murders his victims. The police who are stumped, turn to Dr. Catherine Cordell, a surgeon who works at the local hospital. She was attacked a few years ago by a similar assailant in the same manner, but lived. The only problem is that Catherine killed her attacker back then. The police start to wonder if maybe someone is copying Catherine's attacker. The police find that the victims all reported sexual attacks earlier on in their lives. The investigation turns from the streets of Boston to the hospital that Catherine works in, when Catherine starts having a stalker. This novel is definitely an exciting thrill-ride with not too much medical gibberish that the book will confuse the reader who does not have a lot of medical background. I hope Tess's next book will be this good.
