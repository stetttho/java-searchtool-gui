 I am extremely elated that Lisa Jackson is now writing suspense novels. I have always known her to be a prolific romance novelist. "Hot Blooded" was my first novel of hers that I've read. I loved the whole thing. It says on the side that it's a Romantic Suspense, but it is practically all suspense. The plot: Talk show host Dr. Samantha Leeds is being stalked. She is receiving phone threats and letters saying that she needs to be repented for her sins and that she will die soon. Sam doesn't understand what this nutcase is talking about until a girl calls up saying her name is "Annie." This frightens Sam even more. (I won't explain about Annie because that would take about a decade in writing). At the same time, prostitutes are being found murdered with a set of rosary beadsk, at the same time Samantha is on the radio. Detective Rick Benz and his partner belive that the prostitution murders are connected to Sam's stalker. This novel keeps up the pace all the way until the shocking finale that leaves room for a sequel, "Cold Blooded," coming June 02. I am now in the middle of "If She Only Knew," Lisa's one other suspense novel.
