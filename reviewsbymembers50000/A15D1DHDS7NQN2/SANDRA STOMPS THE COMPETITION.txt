 My first novel mystery/ suspense novel by Sandra Brown was great! I always thought that she was pure romance but someone suggested Fat Tuesday to be a  mystery and said that there was other non-romance novels by Sandra Brown,  so I tried her out! I loved the whole story a lot. Mrs. Brown had a great  evil nemesis in the story, Pinkie Duvall, who was a drug trader and a very  powerful attorney, protecting the criminals. The other side of the coin was  Burke Basile who vows to get revenge against Mr. Duvall because of the  death of his partner in a drug bust. A wonderful novel the whole way  through. So more MYSTERY novels by Sandra Brown are Unspeakable, The Alibi,  Standoff, and The Switch. I will now read these. I hope Sandra continues to  write more mystery!
