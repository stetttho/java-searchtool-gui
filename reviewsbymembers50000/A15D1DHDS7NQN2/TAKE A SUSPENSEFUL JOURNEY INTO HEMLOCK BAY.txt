 Overall, I would say that "Hemlock Bay" was an exciting, fast-paced, worthwile read. In some ways, I agree with other readers when they say that it wasn't as good as "The Edge" or a few of her previous novels, but it is still a must read for the fans of the Savich/Sherlock series. When FBI Agent Dillion Savich gets news that his sister was in a car accident and that there might have been foul play involved, he immediately travels to California to check on her and to investigate. Unfortunately, Savich and his wife, FBI Agent Lacey Sherlock, have to leave behind a current case he is working on that deals with two killers and ghouls. One escaped and is on the run. While there in California, (Hemlock Bay) is the name of the town, he starts to find a conspiracy between his sister's husband and his parents that deals with art fraud. The Savich's family had a lot of expensive art in their family and when the grandmother died the majority of the art went to Dillion's sister. This would be an interesting novel for you if you are an art dealer or gallery owner. This book is very exciting because it takes on two separate cases and it takes readers across the country and across the world. The conclusion is very satisfying and it leaves the reader feeling like they bought a good book. Catherine Coulter is one of my favorite female authors of suspense! Brad Stonecipher
