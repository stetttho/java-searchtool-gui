 This was my second Phillip Margolin mystery and it was better then the  first one that I read which was The Undertakers Widow. I loved everything  about "Gone, But Not Forgotten." I have read so many murder  mysteries that I know what is good and what is bad. If you like going on a  chase to find a crazy killer, then "Gone, But Not Forgetten" is  your kinda book.
