 I was shocked to read that "A Perfect Evil" was Alex Kava's debut novel! She can write like she is a Mary Higgins Clark and a Patricia Cornwell. I read the whole book in a day. It was hard to put down because Kava kept the twists and turns coming around every little chapter. The characters Nick and Maggie were extremely well developed and interesting to read about. They worked together trying to deduce who was the killer, while at the same time, trying to keep their hormones contained. The killer was identified earlier on in the book but Kava kept casting doubt throughtout the whole novel making the reader reallly wonder. The sequel, Split Second, will be in stores August 1. Everyone has to read that one since the killer got away at the end of "A Perfect Evil." Alex Kava has EXTREME potential for making it HUGE in the writing world. If "Split Second" is just as good then she may lead the female serial killer genre. Brad Stonecipher
