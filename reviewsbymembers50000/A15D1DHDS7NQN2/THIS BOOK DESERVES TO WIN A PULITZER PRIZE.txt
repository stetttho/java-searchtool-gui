 If anyone likes any kind of mystery novels whatsoever, then you will  absolutely love CRADLE AND ALL! I just couldn't put it down! The author  described Kate, the main character, in such great detail, that I could  visualize her emotions and her problems with every word. The author paints  a picture of one of the characters being the murderer, but the ending  shocked me to death! The way the author tied the ending with the story was  amazing. All of the characters were likeable, none to bossy. Chills and  thrills around every corner. If you liked ALL FALL DOWN and WHEN THE WIND  BLOWS, his earlier novels, then you will devour and love CRADLE AND ALL,  because it is definitely the best of three. I hope Mr. Fox continues to  write all of his next books this good because I am greatly awaiting his  next one.
