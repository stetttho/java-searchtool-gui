 The was my second Kay Hooper novel and it was one of my favorite novels that I have ever read. I found it incredibly interesting that the whole book revolved around the "psychic" way of solving crimes. That was so cool! Not many authors have their protaganists, such as Cassie Neill, someone who can predict murders before they even happen. My eyes were transfixed to the pages the whole time. I can not wait until HIDING IN THE SHADOWS comes out on October 3 and for OUT OF THE SHADOWS coming out on October 31. Both of these novels include FBI Agent Noah Bishop from Stealing Shadows. Kay Hooper has definitely made it to my favorite author list!
