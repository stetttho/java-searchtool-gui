 This being my second Michael Connelly was another winner. I liked "The Poet" bet though. I enjoyed Harry Bosch, the main detective, in this novel, along with other novels. Harry is a very strong and likable  character. This book goes into the lives of the Las Vegas Mafia/ Mob group,  which links them to the latest murder. I am looking forward to reading  Blood Works.
