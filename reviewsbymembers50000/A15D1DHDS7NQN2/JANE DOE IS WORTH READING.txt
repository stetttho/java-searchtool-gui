 This was my first R.J. Kaiser novel that I read and I enjoyed it greatly. I discovered Mr. Kaiser in a local bookstore and thought his novels looked interesting and bought all three of his novels. "JANE DOE" is about a police chief, Frank, who wakes up and finds a dead prostitute at his home. Abby Hooper, a friend of Frank's, who also is in law enforcement, can't believe that Frank would do anything like that. Abby and Frank must discover who the real killer is before Frank is convicted. This book takes you into the lives of drug dealers, pimps, and prostitues. Jane Doe also takes you on a trip from Sacramento to San Francisco. R.J. Kaiser is a fresh new voice in fiction!
