 I believe that Sharon Sala's novels would appeal more to the romantic reader other than the suspense reader. It is so hard to distinguish if the majority of the novel is going to be suspense or romance, when they say Romantic Suspense. The suspense parts of "Butterfly" were very slow. The book was good in the beginning, but then it got worse. Boring! Trust me, save your money on this book!
