 To be exact, I would give this novel 3 1/2 stars. I liked the whole novel  a lot. Good characters, great suspense, good action scenes and events. I  felt that Phillip Margolin did a good job describing the scene of the  courtroom in detail. But the thing with the novel that I didn't like is the  ending. WHAT THE HECK WAS MR. MARGOLIN THINKING? The obvious bad guys who  Margolin portrayed the whole way through would have been a much better  choice for the killers than the one he picked. Very bizarre! So to sum up,  the first 3/4 of the novel was great, but the ending could have been a lot  better. But I will definitely give Phillip Margolin another try, because I  loved Gone, But Not Forgotten.
