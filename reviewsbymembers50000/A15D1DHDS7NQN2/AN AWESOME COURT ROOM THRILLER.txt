 This was definitely one of the most complex Phillip Margolin novels, but  it was one of the best. A poor retarded man is on trial for the murder of a  college coed. Peter Hale is the lawyer who is employed to defend the  retarded man. But did this poor retarded man really kill the college  student? Or his he just a spider entwined in a web of drugs and murder that  may include the attorney, the DA, and even the judge? Can Peter Hale  protect his client before he falls to the jaws of a death sentence or life  in prison?
