 I have read quite a few Stephen King novels and well, hated them. I can't think of any that I really liked. So I walked into a local used bookseller and was looking for a new book. The owner recommended that I read "The  Green Mile." I told her that I didn't like Stephen King, but she  insisted saying that this was different than his others. So I bought it and  read it and I was in shock, I LOVED IT!  The only Stephen King book that I  enjoyed. The story was incredible. You felt that you were right there with  the characters the whole time because of the great detail in the story. I  couldn't put this book down, I just kept going and going, getting more  engrossed in it each page that I read. Well, after I finished it (in 2  days), I felt that I was so happy that I had purchased it because it  brought out a different, spiritual side of life that hardly any people have  experienced. If Stephen King would write more novels like this incredible  masterpiece then I will run to get his next one.
