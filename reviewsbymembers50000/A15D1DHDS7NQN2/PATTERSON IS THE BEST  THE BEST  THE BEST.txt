 The saying that I hear from most book fanatics are "Each book by my favorite authors get better and better." That is definitely true in the case of James Patterson. "Roses Are Red," in my opinion, is by far one of the best novels that James Patterson has ever written. Let me just tell you this: THE ENDING WILL ABSOLUTELY BLOW YOU OUT OF YOUR SHOES! I mean the very last page is the best part of the novel. Unfortunately, there is one major sad part in this novel. Alex Cross's daughter Jannie, has a brain tumor, and she is in the hospital for a while. If you haven't read all of Nursery Rhyme novels by James Patterson, then I would start with the first one, so you are more familiar with the main characters and their relationships. YOU ROCK JAMES PATTERSON! I'm looking forward to "1st To Die" in April 2001!
