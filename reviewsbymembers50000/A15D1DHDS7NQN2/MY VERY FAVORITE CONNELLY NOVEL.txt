 I have read every single book that Michael Connelly has written except  Void Moon, and I believe that Angels Flight is his very best. It seems like  that every novel of Connelly's gets better and better. I have noticed a  repetitive pattern of this. I enjoy Harry Bosch VERY much. I think Harry is  the perfect person to be a detective. I finished this one in two days. Mr.  Connelly ranks right up there with the big wigs like Patricia Cornwell,  John Sandford, and Mary Higgins Clark. Void Moon is next on my list!
