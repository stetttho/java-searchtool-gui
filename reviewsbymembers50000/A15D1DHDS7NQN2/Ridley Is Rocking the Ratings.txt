 Wonderful book! It explored the lives of Chinese immigrants and  sweatshops. This book reminded me of many certain movies, but this book  described it in much more detail. Lou Boldt and Daphne Matthews are on the  case. YEAH!! The book is a little slow but concludes in a great way, making  it an enjoyable read by Mr. Ridley Pearson.
