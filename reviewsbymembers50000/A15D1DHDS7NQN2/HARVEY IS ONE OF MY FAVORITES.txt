 James Neal Harvey will always be one of my favorite authors. Dead Game and the other novels he has written, are all spectacular police novels. It is too bad that Mr. Harvey does not write any more. It is probably because he  retired since he is about 70. I will always be looking for Mr. Harvey in  the bookstores, just in case. Dead Game with Lt. Ben Tolliver is a true  winner!
