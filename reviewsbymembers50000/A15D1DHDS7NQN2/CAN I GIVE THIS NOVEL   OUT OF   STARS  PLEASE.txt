 Move over John Grisham, have a seat J.F. Freedman, take a hike Steve  Martini, and clear the way for the best legal novelist of all time, PHILLIP  MARGOLIN!!! Over the course of the past week, I have read all of the  Phillip Margolin novels. I just finished Wild Justice today and was sooo  impressed. Margolin just cannot write a poor novel. It is an impossibility.  Are you ready for the plot? Well, here it is!  Over the past five years  there has been a series of gruesome and hideous murderers streching across  Montanta to Oregon. It hits close to home in Portland, Oregon for defense  Attorney Amanda Jaffe. The suspected murderer is respected surgeonist  Vincent Cardoni. He is on trial for the murders of over six victims and for  the beheading of two others including his so-called partner. Many people  believed that he did it because of his excessive drug usage and his violent  outbursts to his fellow colleagues. Amanda Jaffe believes he is a dangerous  man who should be convicted. Then 4 years later, the same kind of murders  start happening again and after the mysterious disappearance of Vincent  Cardoni, his ex-wife is put on trial. Amanda Jaffe knows that the wife  couldn't have done it and is considering the possibility that maybe she was  wrong the whole time about Vincent Cardoni being the murderer. Amanda, her  father, and the Portland PD is on the case of solving the identity of this  truly deranged and frightening serial killer before time runs out and  before Amanda and the city of Portland lives are put into the hands of a  madman.
