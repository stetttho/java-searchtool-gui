 I've read all of Robert W. Walker's novels and I was greatly awaiting the release of "Cold Edge." This Edge novel was the third in the series. Lucas Stonecoat and Meredith Sanger are back to solve the murders of the Scalper, a brutal serial killer, who takes off his victims body parts and their scalps, and to solve the murders of the Headless Horseman, who likes to cut heads off after raping them. Lucas starts to suspect a well-known psychiatrist, who treats crazy people after they are released from prison in the Houston area, is the key to these murders. The doctor refuses to give any information about his patients to Stonecoat. Eventually after the doctor, gets murdered himself. Lucas must quickly determine which ones of his patient's is a serial killer before his and Sanger's life are cut short. Also Lucas goes off to visit his grandfather who is dying. This takes you on an interesting trip through the Indian culture. This book was an amazing novel of policework. Add "Cold Edge" to your must read list!
