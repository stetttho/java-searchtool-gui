 Aerosmith is back with probably there best album ever! Just Push Play is an awesome mix of great alternative jams. Almost all of the songs are great. My favorites include Just Push Play, Jaded, Under My Skin, and Fly Away From Here, which is the amazing new single that is soon to be released on the radio. I cannot really compare Aerosmith to any other band because they are very distinctive and creative when it comes to their music. Trust me, if you buy this CD, you will enjoy it!
