 I did not like book at all! I was so bored the entire time. There was so much unnecessary Jewish talk that it got confusing. I did not care for the main character's attitude when it came to many of the problems that arose. For example, Peter Decker finds out that his 16 year old stepson his sleeping around and having sex with his girlfriend and doing other bad things and all Mr. Decker says is "well, I hope that you use protection." GIVE ME A BREAK! There were so many crazy people in this book with their strange church rituals that it drove me crazy. Then you find out who the killer is after only 180 pages. Faye Kellerman is not my kind of writer, while on the other hand, her husband, Jonathan Kellerman is fascinating! Trust me I have read thousands of mystery novels and this one is not worth it!
