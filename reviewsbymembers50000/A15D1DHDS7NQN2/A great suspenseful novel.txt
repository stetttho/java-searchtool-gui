 Bethany Campbell's latest work, "Whose Little Girl Are You?" is a spectacular read! It is about a woman, Jaye Garrett, who is trying to find out who her biological parents are and her brother's biological  parents are before he dies of bone marrow disease. They come across a group  of people who will do anything to stop them too! Great work Bethany!
