 Being on a long airline flight, I was desperate to read something and I picked this book up at a local airport. Well, I was kinda disappointed. This book isn't anything neat at all, but it is not bad though. It is a  very predictable novel of tracking a serial killer who is an arsonist and  loves to hurt, burn, and kill people. I would save my money and buy a book  that would make you think for awhile!
