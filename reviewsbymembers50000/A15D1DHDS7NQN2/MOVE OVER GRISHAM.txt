 Lisa Scottoline just has a talent when it comes to courtroom thrillers that no author, including John Grisham, can surpass. I have read every single novel that Scottoline has written and loved them all. Almost all of her novels include her usual characters, Bennie Rosato, Mary DiNuzio, and Judy Carrier. These three women work for Rosato and Associates, a powerful lawyer firm that has an impeccable record for winning the majority of their cases. Judy Carrier is the main character in "The Vendetta Defense." Her dreadful task is trying to prove that Anthony Lucia, (otherwise known as Pigeon Tony), is innocent of the murder of Angelo Coluzzi. Even though Lucia did execute Coluzzi in cold blood, Carrier somewhat feels that the murder was justifiable because of the fifty year VENDETTA between these two Italian families. Coluzzi had Lucia's lover, son and daugher-in-law killed earlier. Judy Carrier must put up with car bombs, threats, murder attempts, and her boss in order to prove that Pigeon Tony should not be convicted guilty. This is an extremely powerful courtroom drama that will leave readers tear-eyed at the end. Absolutely no one can compete with Lisa Scottoline when it comes to courtroom dramas.
