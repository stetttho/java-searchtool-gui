 This being my 4th Michael Connelly novel, was not as good as the other three. I think that it was still a good novel, but just not great! I have read so many books that I get kinda critical. But, if you are a veteran of  the Vietnam War, then you might find it interesting with all the  underground tunnel warfare tactics. It turned out to have a good ending,  but I didn't think that Mr. Connelly needed to have Ms. Wish involved with  the conspiracy, since she was such a likeable character throughout the  entire book. If I were you, buy "The Poet," probably my favorite  Michael Connelly novel.
