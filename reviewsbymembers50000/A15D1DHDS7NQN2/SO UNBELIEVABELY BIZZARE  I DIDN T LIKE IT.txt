 I have read all of Tom Savage's novels except for Precipice and I don't think I'll read that one. I read "Valentine" and I thought it was quite good. In "The Inheritance" I just couldn't get past page 70. That book was very dull. In "Scavenger," the book's ending is just so amazingly and incredibly weird! I can't talk much about it because I would be giving away too much. The whole thing is about a crazy man making this author play a game and going on a Scavenger Hunt to find the truth about a murderer. The ending is just so bizarre! I did not like the way it turned out at all. Sorry, Mr. Savage, but I think I'll pass on your next novel.
