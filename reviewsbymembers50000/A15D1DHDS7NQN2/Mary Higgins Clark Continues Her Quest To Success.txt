 I got this book 10 days before the scheduled release date and boy was I excited. As usual this was another wonderful Mary Higgins Clark thriller.You could never guess who did what and who was the killer because  there were so many twists and turns! Like always,there were so many  characters that you could never guess who did what. But like always, Mary  draws them all together and leads up to a magnificent conclusion. Keep up  the great work MARY!
