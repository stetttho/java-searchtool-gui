 "Doe Or Die" definitely qualifies as a certified classic. From beginning to end: the nicely-crafted beats, the vivid lyrics. This album packs a major punch. Tracks like Gimme Yours, Sugar Hill, and Mo Money Mo Murder (Homicide) are great, but the album's highlight is the Pete Rock-produced Rather Unique. This track is a masterpiece, plain and simple. One of the greatest tracks ever recorded.  If you dont have this album, buy it NOW.
