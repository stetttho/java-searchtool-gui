 This album may not be a "classic" 5-star album, but it brings back memories with every listen, and that alone is worthy of the 5-star rating. Every track is great, but the stand-out is the party track (track 11 I believe). I, personally, still remember kickin back on the porch and bumpin that track way back in the day.  Even the skit on the album is worth more than one listen. If you love old-school hip-hop and dont have this album in your collection, buy it now.
