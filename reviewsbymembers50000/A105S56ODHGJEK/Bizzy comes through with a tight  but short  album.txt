 On his solo debut, Bizzy Bone has himself an album that's tight, but could've been even better.  His high-pitched, almost angelic, voice is put in full effect on smooth tracks like "On The Freeway" &  "Nobody Can Stop Me."  His thuggish side stands out on tracks  like "Waiting For Warfare," "The Roof Is On Fire,"  & "Social Studies," on which Bizzy addresses the subject of  school shootings.  This album's only downside is it's length, which is  barely over 40 minutes.  With a few more tight tracks, this could've been  worthy of five stars, but nevertheless, it's still recommended.
