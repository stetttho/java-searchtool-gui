 There is a legitimate reason why this double CD stinks.  It was being recorded around the same time Cash Money was beginning to take away No Limit's crown.  It shows, as the Miller clan tried a little too hard, and  ended up with only a single disc's worth of good tracks.  Among the VERY  FEW standouts are "Hoody Hoo" and "Soldier till I Die."   Best advice--save your money.
