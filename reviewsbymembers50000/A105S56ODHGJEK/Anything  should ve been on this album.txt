 Why didn't Jigga include "Anything" on this album? It is very out of place on Beanie's album, and I feel if he would've kept "Anything" and the Twista track on here, this album would've been  MUCH better than it is. Who wants to hear "Jigga My N**ga" or  "Girl's Best Friend" for the 1000th time?  Regardless of those  definite mistakes, this album is still quality material. If there were 3.5  stars, I'd give it that, but it's closer to 3 than 4. "So Ghetto"  is the stand-out track on here. The classic Primo beat fits Jigga's  effortless flow like a glove. "Big Pimpin," produced by  Timbaland, is a classic track featuring the underrated UGK. But aside from  those two classics, a group of second-tier, just average trax fill up most  of the album. The beat for "Snoopy Track," featuring Juvenile,  sounds like a constipated elephant. "Things That U Do" is just  downright awful. And "Pop 4 Roc" is just more evidence of Jigga's  hip-hop to hip-pop transformation, which has rapidly been growing since the  classic "Reasonable Doubt." Hidden amongst the mediocre is one  more standout track, "Dope Man," which has an almost cinematic  feel to it. Overall, this album could've easily been a 4 with the inclusion  of "Anything" and the Twista/Missy track, but to include two old,  played-out trax in place of those is just unexcusable. Pick this one up at  the used CD shop and save yourself $5.
