 I can't say enough good things about this album. The Dayton Family is the most slept-on group in hip-hop. From beginning to end, and everything in between, F.B.I. is UNBELIEVABLE. It kicks off wit "79th &  Halstead," a bangin intro which sets the mood perfectly. "Real  With This" features a nice bassline, and a well-crafted beat, which  compliments Shoestring & Bootleg's flows. And the hits just keep  comin--"Killer G's," "Blood Bath," and  "Newspaper" are all BANGIN as F##K! And then we have "Stick  and Move," which was also featured on the Down South Hustlers  compilation (strange, since TDF represents Flint, MI). But the standout  track BY FAR on this masterpiece is "Player Haters," which,  despite the over-used term, is OFF THE F##KIN HOOK! A tight beat, and  murderous lyrics that combine to produce one of my favorite trax ever. It  also features Esham, who lays down a nice verse. But what seperates the  Dayton Family from the rest of the played-out gangsta rap world is the fact  that they mix it up. In the same vein as "Oxydol" and "Thru  A Thang" off their first album, TDF lays down two poignant, deep, and  meaningful trax on this album as well, "What's On My Mind 2" and  "Ghetto." That is why I feel The Dayton Family really needs to  get more props. These brothers are hard for sure, but they ARE NOT  one-dimensional, as most gangsta rap groups are. This album is EASILY a  classic. In my vast hip-hop collection, this CD ranks in the top five as  far as my favorites. Please, trust me, if you don't have this album, BUY IT  NOW. You DEFINITELY will not be disappointed.
