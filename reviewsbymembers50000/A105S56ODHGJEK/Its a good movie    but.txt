 Bless The Child portrays the prototypical story of Good vs Evil effectively....to a point.The acting is hit & miss for the most part. Rufus Sewell portrays the role of a cult-leader nicely without going over the top. Jimmy Smits doesnt seem too inspired in this film, but nevertheless gives an okay performance. Holliston Coleman, the girl who plays Cody, does an excellent job in her role. Kim Basinger comes off bland throughout most of the movie, and the role Christina Ricci plays shouldve been extended to more than just two short scenes.The plot has obvious major holes that drag the movie down if you sit & disect them. And some scenes are ridiculously laughable / over-the-top. For example, a bird flys head-first into a Catholic-school window as Cody looks on. Next thing you know, all of the children are outside gathering around Cody as she holds it, while the nuns and Cody's aunt (Basinger) watch and laugh whole-heartedly, not caring about the health issues that could arise from a 6 year old girl holding a seemingly dead bird she picked up off the ground.Little things..Characters always being in the right place at the right time. Smits' character always finding clues and evidence that the dozens of cops at the scene seem to always overlook. Basinger not handing over key evidence that could save the child 30 minutes into the film, instead opting for the role of superhero and trying to infiltrate the premesis of a cult all by her lonesome. These along with other noticeable things bring down the film a few notches.However, the film is entertaining.If you sit and watch it just for the entertainment value and not for realism or disecting the plot, you should enjoy this movie. Its a solid story of good ultimately triumphing over evil, with a few thrilling moments along the way.
