 Twista had an album out before this called "Runnin Off At Da Mouth," but on that, he was all about rappin as fast as he could. On this album, he steps up his lyrics AND flow to the perfect level. He  enunciates so well that you can understand almost every word he says, even  when he's rapping at his fastest. On the title track, Twista is just  downright amazing. In fact, it would've been better if he were on this  track alone, just tearin it up for 4 minutes. "Overdose" has a  slow, almost lethargical, yet eerie beat. "Mobster's Anthem" has  a beat reminiscent of the classic "Nuthin But A G Thang."  "It Feels So Good" & "Emotions" are both a nice  change of pace. On any other rapper's album, these may sound like 2 sappy  tracks, but Twista's flow saves them both, and actually turns them into  some nice trax. But the stand-out track on this album is one of my favorite  trax of all time, "Unsolved Mystery." Traxster's beat and  Twista's signature flow are just undescribably dope on this track. This is  in my top 15 trax of ALL TIME. Overall, this album has to be considered a  classic. If you're a fan of gangsta rap, fast flows, or even just rap in  general, this is a must have.
