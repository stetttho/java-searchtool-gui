 On their debut album, the Jazzyfatnastees put forth a great selection of smooth tracks that are perfect for any listening mood. The production on the album is solid, and allows the perfect amount of room to let JFN's vocal talents take center stage. The album has no weak spots whatsoever. Unconventional Ways, Sail The Seas, Related To Me, and The Lie are some of the biggest highlights.   The only possible gripe with this album is the length: It would've been nice to see 2 or 3 more tracks included on here. But the 10 tracks it does have are beautiful, and nearly flawless. This album is a must have for fans of soul, R&B, jazz, and yes, even hip-hop. Do yourself a favor and pick this one up.
