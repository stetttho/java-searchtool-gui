 This isn't an all-out greatest hits CD, it's more of a greatest hits / B-Sides collection. You'll find some of Bone's classic tracks like "Foe Tha Love Of $," "1st Of Tha Month," &  "Thuggish Ruggish Bone." But it also has some of their best  soundtrack & guest appearance tracks, like "Notorious Thugs"  with Biggie, & "War."   But the highlights of this album  are "Shoot Em Up" & "Days Of Our Livez." Both from  lesser-known soundtracks, these two tracks alone make this album worth your  money. "Shoot Em Up" is a beautiful blend of a smooth beat and  thuggish, hardcore lyrics. Thuggishness & Harmony at it's best. And  "Days Of our Livez" may be my personal favorite Bone track of  all-time.   The album ends with a new track, "P.O.D." Nice  & smooth weed track.   Bone did a great job of putting some of their  best work on here, but also leaving the door open for a "Collection  Vol 2." Many great soundtrack & guest appearances were left off  here, including "Everyday Thang," as well as some of their  greatest hits, including "Crossroads (Uneek's remix)" & many  tracks off "Art Of War."   If you wanna get a feel of Bone's  sound, definitely pick up this album. And if you're a Bone fan and you  don't have this album, WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?  Pick this up!
