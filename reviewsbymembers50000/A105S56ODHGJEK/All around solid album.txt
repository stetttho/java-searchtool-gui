 On his sophomore solo release, Bizzy Bone pours out plenty of emotion, and touches on a lot of issues.  The Gift is a more well-rounded album than Heavenz Movie (his first album), for the simple fact that it has 13 new full-length tracks: not 8 tracks, an intro, 2 skits, a clip, and a song by someone else. The production on the album is solid, but lacks an extra element on a few tracks.  The album has it's fair share of great tracks, such as "Never Grow," "Before I Go," "Dont Doubt Me," and "Father." And Bizzy ended the album nicely, with the laid back R&B-flavored, Gospel sounds of "Jesus." In fact, there's only one track on the album that isnt good. That would be "Voices In The Head," an awful attempt by Bizzy to sound like Eminem. This track should've been left in the studio. Also, it's curious as to why he chose to include "Fried Day" on the album, which has been out for over a year. It's a good track, but he would've been better served putting on another new track in it's place. Another minor problem is Bizzy's voice, which, at times, can get tiring on this album. Whereas, fellow group member Krayzie Bone has a voice that never gets tiring or annoying to listen to.  Overall, however, any minor flaws are easily overlooked. This is an album not only Bone fans, but all fans of hip-hop can listen to and enjoy.
