 Bone released two albums before this, but this is the album that MADE them, that started them down the path to where they are today.  "E. 1999 Eternal" is a classic.  "Mr. Bill Collector,"  "Budsmoker's Only," "1st of tha Month," "Mo'  Murda," and "Shotz to tha Double Glock" are all straight up  BANGIN.  And what can you say about "Tha Crossroads"?  Even  "Da Introduction" consists of a tight three minute track.  From  beginning to end, "E. 1999 Eternal" is sure to please.
