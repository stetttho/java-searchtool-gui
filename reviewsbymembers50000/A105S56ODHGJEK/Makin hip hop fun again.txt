 This is a great album. From beginning to end, you can play it all the way through without hearing any mention of "b--ches" "cars" "money" "jewelry" etc. that have taken over most of  hip-hop nowadays. You'll think you have been whisked away to 15 years ago,  when hip-hop was about havin fun...when the DJ was actually an important  part of the group.   The 4 MCs each have distinct voices and flows,  which really mesh with the old-school beats to make this album pleasant to  the ears. No loud noise and jibberish mumblings on here. It's hard to pick  out a few standout tracks, because this album is so equally balanced. But  "The Influence," "World Of Entertainment," "Jurass  Finish First," and "Contribution" are definite standouts.    This album is such a fun and easy listen that it's also hard to find  any faults in it...maybe a few less skits? Either way, this is a must have,  especially since it's available [for that kind of money in most stores. At that  price, you can't afford NOT to get this...go pick it up, and prepare to get  a fresh dose of some real hip-hop.
