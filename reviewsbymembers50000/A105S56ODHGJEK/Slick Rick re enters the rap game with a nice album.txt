 There's no doubt about it, Slick Rick was an old-school genius in the late 80's. Tracks like "The Show," "Children's Story," and "La Di Da Di," among others, were classics. But his last two  albums, 94's "Behind Bars" and 91's "The Ruler's Back,"  weren't that good.   Fast-forward to last year, and the Ruler's out from  behind bars. Question was, could MC Rickey D, ten years past his prime,  still put out a bangin album? The answer---a resounding YES.   With  production from Clark Kent, Grease, S&S, TrackMasters, and more,  "The Art Of Storytelling" offers a wide range of fresh beats  which compliment Rick's flow. The best track on the album is "2 Way  Street," which features a tight beat from the Superman producer, and  Rick's storytelling at it's best. "Memories" finds Rick  reminiscing about back in the day, while "Adults Only" finds him  pondering about the back door.   The guest appearances are plentiful,  but most are awefully short. The best collabos find Rick teaming up with  Big Boi of Outkast on "Street Talkin," and Raekwon on the  up-tempo "Frozen." All in all, it's safe to say this time the  ruler's back for real.
