 This is easily a classic album...the album that kick-started Bone Thugs-n-Harmony's careers. This isn't their first album though: they had an underground album out in Cleveland called Faces Of Death before this.    There are only five actual full-length tracks, but all five are BRILLIANTLY  constructed classics. Thuggish Ruggish Bone was the first single, and also  the cut that started it all. This track never gets tiring, and same with  Foe Tha Love Of $, which features one of the most memorable verses in  history courtesy of the late great Eazy-E.   While those are the two  most recognizable tracks off here, the other three are just as good (No  Surrender, Down Foe My Thang, & Creepin On Ah Come Up). And you almost  have to count Mr. Quija as a track, but it's more of a track/skit mix.  Great harmonizing.   The album ends with Moe Cheese, which is basically  a Foe Tha Love Of $ instrumental with an "ecstatic" woman lending  some "vocals."   This album would've been way better as a  full-length LP. We can only imagine 10 more of those thugged-out like  tracks on here...but, then again, we always have E.1999/Eternal.    Bottom line, if you don't have this album, have you been in a coma the last  6 years?
