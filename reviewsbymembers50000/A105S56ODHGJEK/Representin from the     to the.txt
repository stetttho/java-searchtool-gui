 Lil Buddy is one of the few artists that has made it outta Minneapolis and now is finally BEGINNING to get the props he deserves. It's hard comin from a place like this (which is DEFINITELY not known for it's hip-hop talent,  although there are MANY talented rappers up here).   This is a good CD  with nice beats and great guest spots from the rest of the Igloo Knob  family. Hopefully, this album will open the doors for other worthy artists  up here in the Twin Cities of Minnyap & St. Paul (Sandman & Macalot  and Upset Tha Locksmith just to name a couple).   Recognize!   Minneapolis takin over the hip-hop scene in the year 2G baby!   Well....maybe not, but hopefully we can at least get some respect!
