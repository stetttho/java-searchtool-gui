 Young Bleed's debut was hot ta death, no doubt, but there was just something about it that didn't click well. Maybe it was the label it was on, No Limit. While that did catapult it to Gold sales, it might have  turned some people off, thinking it was some more of the same ol' No Talent  BS. Well, Bleed is gone from No Limit now, and his sophomore effort picks  up right where his debut left off. Although short at only 12 trax, it truly  is very well put together. Trax like "All They Lef Me Wuz Da  Streets," A Husla," "A Minute ta Breathe," and "My  Own" are very nicely constructed, showcasing that southern comfort  type feel to the fullest. This album has very few guest appearances, which  is a plus becuz it gives Bleed more time to shine. But Too $hort stops by  for a nice collabo on "Time and Money." But the best track on  here has to be "Trecherous." Clocking in at only 2:28, it's  pretty short, but Bleed makes the most of it and rides the deep bassline to  the fullest. Overall, this album could've been a little longer, as it  leaves you yearning for more. But Bleed has definitely proven that he  doesn't need Master P to be successful. He can do it all on his own.
