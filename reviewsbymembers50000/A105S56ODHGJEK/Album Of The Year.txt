 After years of turmoil, Cormega's album finally officially drops, and it does not disappoint in any aspect. Almost every track is perfect. The production is smooth throughout. Mega's flow is always on-point, and his lyrics are as well, staying true to the streets and real life instead of going for the mainstream crowd with the typical "ice, women, money" raps. The true gems on the album are "American Beauty," a 2 minute track on which he spits a vivid metaphorical rhyme about hip-hop, "The Saga," on which he describes street life masterfully over a great beat, and "They Forced My Hand," where Tragedy and Mega trade true to life rhymes over another smooth beat.  Other album highlights include "Thun & Kicko (featuring Prodigy)," "Unforgiven," and "Fallen Soldiers." There's not a single mediocre track on the album. From beginning to end (including the hot bonus track), "The Realness" lives up to its title. Quite simply put, Cormega has dropped the realest East coast album since "Illmatic."
