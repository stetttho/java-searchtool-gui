 This is easily E-40's best work. "In a Major Way" is top-notch material from beginning to end. The beats provide classic West Coast g-funk, while 40's flows and linguistics are solid as usual. Nearly every track is equal in calibur, but the 3 stand-outs would probably be the classic "Dusted & Disgusted," "1-Luv," and "Spittin." There's not one weak track on here. If you're into the West Coast sound, and even if you're not, this is an album you should definitely have in your collection. The West could use another album of this calibur these days.
