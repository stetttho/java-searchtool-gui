 On his 3rd album, Xzibit seeks to finally break out from the underground and get exposed to a larger audience. It seems he's accomplished that, especially with MTV recently falling in love with his new video. This album will most likely go double platinum, but at what price? On some tracks, he makes you believe he's all-out given in, seemingly wanting to gain the respect (and money) of the millions of mainstream Eminem fans. It's a shame, because X has much more talent than what he shows on this album. The standout tracks on the album would be U Know (featuring Dre), Alkoholik (which features a great verse from Tash that really carries the track), D.N.A., Get Your Walk On, and Best Of Things, which is easily the album's best track. It features a great beat from Dre, and the kind of fierce, grimy flow that makes X head and shoulders above the average MC. This is the kind of flow that he used on almost all of "40 Dayz and 40 Nightz," and more recently on "What's The Difference" and his guest spot on Kurupt's album. It's too bad he didn't stick with it for more tracks. The rest of the album is saturated with mediocrity: watered down flows and beats which fail to grab the listener's attention. Kenny Parker Show 2001 sounds like a track rejected from an early N.W.A. project, with Xzibit sounding like an 80's MC Ren over an 80's beat. It doesn't mesh well at all. Rimz & Tirez is boring....not one of Soopafly's better beats in the least bit, and a horrible chorus that sounds like something they found in Outkast's trash can. And F' You Right would be pretty good: the beat is actually entertaining. Except X blatantly bites the other X from the East (DMX). This may please the ears of the mainstream crowd, but it's not as good as either of his previous albums. If you don't already have "40 Dayz & 40 Nightz" or "At The Speed Of Life," pick those up. Then maybe pick this one up somewhere down the line and compare them: you'll see that it just doesn't measure up.
