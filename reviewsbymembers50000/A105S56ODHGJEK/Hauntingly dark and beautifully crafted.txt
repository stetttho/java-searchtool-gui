 The Mobb's 3rd release may take a couple listens to fully appreciate, especially considering it was the follow-up to the certified classic "The Infamous." But make no mistake about it, "Hell On Earth" is one of the darkest, grimiest albums ever. Havoc does an amazing job behind the boards (and on the mic), while P spits street tales like only he can. The album kicks off with "Animal Instinct," which sets the tone nicely for the rest of the album. The cuts that follow, "Drop A Gem On Em," "Bloodsport," and "Extortion" (featuring Method Man), are all classics, which will have you noddin your head and hittin rewind, as will just about every other track on here. Raekwon stops by on the bangin "Nighttime Vultures." And who can forget the classic title track? It ranks right up there with other Mobb classics such as "Shook Ones" and "Quiet Storm." While the majority of this album is bangin, there are a couple mishaps such as "Still Shinin," which really don't hit hard. But when there's so much other solid material, these mishaps can be easily overlooked. If you're into most of the bling-blingin hip-hop that's out there today, then this album is DEFINITELY NOT for you. But if you crave grimy, street-edged, hardcore hip-hop, this is an essential to your collection.
