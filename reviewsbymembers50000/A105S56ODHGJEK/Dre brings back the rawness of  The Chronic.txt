 As the follow-up to maybe the best hip-hop album in the 90's, "Chronic 2001" had big shoes to try to fit in.  It looks like those shoes were the right size, because this album succeeds in just about  every aspect.  Dre uses the eerie music from the movie Halloween on  "Murder Ink," while Eminem and Xzibit make their presence known  on the bangin "What's the Difference."  The only track that may  bore listeners is "Xplosive," with it's subject natter and beat,  but otherwise Dre and his 25 (yes, 25) guest contributers combine nicely to  make one of the best hip-hop albums of the year.
