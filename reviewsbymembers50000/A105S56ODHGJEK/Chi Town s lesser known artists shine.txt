 This album showcases some of the Chi's hidden talent, with mixed results. There are some bright spots--Quarta Ounce lead the pack with a hot track, along with nice efforts from D. Villa and Triple Darkness. But a lot of this album is filled with mediocre tracks, which is what would be expected on a compilation of this sort.  The album would've benefitted highly with a few contributions from Chi's big names, mainly Crucial Conflict, Do Or Die, and Psychodrama. And while Newsense from Psychodrama does appear on two tracks, it's just not the same without SideKic and the HIGHLY underrated Yung Buck.  They made one good choice on here though, the inclusion of Twista's hard to find Suicide, a dope track on which he disses Naughty By Nature, among others.  Overall, if you're a fan of Chi-Town rap and want to become acquainted with some of their lesser known talent, this would be a recommended buy.
