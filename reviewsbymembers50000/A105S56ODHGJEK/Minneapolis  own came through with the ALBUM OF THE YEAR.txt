 I just wanna say that my man came through on this album. Quite possibly 2000's best hip-hop album.  The album kicks off with one of the tightest Intros in hip-hop history, right up there with E.1999/Eternal and Liquid Swords. Sandman goes off, flowin like he's possessed for over a minute.  On the bouncy "Whut You Gone Do..." he proclaims "(they) say I sound the same as Bone, but man you're wrong, you better recognize Sandman that's my name I'm known for lacin everythang I own."  "Are You A Rider" is a tight track featuring a bangin beat, on which Sandman and Slink Capone trade verses. Their two distinctly different styles mesh nicely on this track, another album highlight. And on "Mental Bruises," Sandman hooks up with Evamo to create yet another gem.  "In The Mood" shows us his passionate side, as he proclaims his love for the opposite sex on one of the album's smoother cuts.  "Darklight" is nearly 9 minutes long, and features many members of his Mackilot click flowin like crazy over an eerie beat.  "Untitled" is a poignant track on which he tells us of the heartbreak he's been through--"I hope it all goes well with your baby, I hope this lover bout won't make you hate me....It's OK I'm not lonely" But the album's standout has to be "Redrum II," on which he almost sounds like a combination of Brotha Lynch Hung, E-40, and Twista. The track is just plain off the hook: the beat, his flows, his lyrics, everything.  Overall, this is an outstanding effort from this young man reppin North Minneapolis. He's definitely on the rise in the hip-hop game, and if he can maintain the level he's at on this album, he should be at the top in no time. BUY THIS! You WON'T be disappointed.
