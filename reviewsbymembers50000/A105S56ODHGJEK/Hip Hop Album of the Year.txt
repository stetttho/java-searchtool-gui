 This is the hip-hop album of the year, no question about it.  Mighty Mos provides a little something for all types of music fans.  His lyrics are poignant, beats on point, and his heart is put into every song on the  album.  No fast forward material available on this album.  He can even make  a dope song about water ("New World Water")!  And he caps it all  off with a nice instrumental (May/December).  A MUST HAVE!
