 Although this album was delayed for a while (losing some of the anticipation many had for it), "Livin in the Scope" turned out better than expected. The album is filled with hardcore tongue-twisting and solid production, even without The Legendary Traxster behind the boards for the majority of the album. The album's highlights are "U Dont Wanna Blaze" and "Kill - Steal - Will," which feature nice production combined with wicked flows. Overall, "Livin in the Scope" is a much better effort than Do Or Die's "Victory." If you're a fan of midwest rap, you should own this album.
