 I've never given an album a 1-star rating before--until now. If any album deserves it, it's this one. Like the reviewer below me said, you always regret buyin soundtracks, but if you buy this one, you'll regret the  decision even more. What a waste.   The big names are there--Mo Thugs,  Daz, Snoop Dogg, DMX, Eve, Luniz, Too $hort, Kool G Rap, etc. But these  have to be some of the wackest tracks put out by all of them, with the  exception of maybe Snoop. I'd say some of his "Tha Doggfather"  & No Limit tracks have been wacker than "Survive," but not by  much! "All My Family" features recycled lyrics and uninteresting  flows by Mo Thugs & Layzie Bone. Same thing with "Ryde Or  Die" by DMX, Luniz, & Drag-On. That's exactly what this soundtrack  does, drag ON and ON. I could describe why every track is wack, but I won't  bore you.   The few OK tracks (VERY FEW) would be the title track  "Turf Stories," "Playa Style," & "Shotgun  Style." Even those are borderline unlistenable.  Bottom line, this is  a complete waste of perfectly usable CDs and CD cases. If there was a  musical definition of wack in the dictionary, a picture of this CD would be  next to it. DON'T BUY! Unless, of course, you're into wasting money.
