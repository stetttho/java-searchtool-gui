 Crazy Taxi is a highly entertaining and addictive game, which definitely qualifies as one of the DC's best.  The graphics are stunning. Gameplay is fun and keeps you coming back for more. Sure, the car physics and other aspects of gameplay aren't realistic, but that's what video games are for: fulfilling fantasies. And while the Arcade course is easier and somewhat funner, the new and exclusive course offers a fresh challenge that will take some time and effort to master.  Bottom line, this is a game every DC owner should have.
