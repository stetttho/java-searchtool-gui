 On "Good Side Bad Side," Crucial Conflict display a slightly more mature style than on their debut "The Final Tic," while elevating with their unique sound. There isnt one bad track on the album. Tracks like Scummy, Like This, Swing It Over Here, Airplane (featuring Do Or Die), and Back Against The Wall can be played constantly and never get tiring.  On Faceless Ones, they create an almost eerie feeling, with a hypnotic hook and crazy lyrics. And on 2 Bogus, flict hooks up with Three 6 Mafia for a good blend of styles. The album's production, handled mostly by Wildstyle, is solid, and never drops off much at all. Overall this is a real nice album, a must have if you're a fan of Midwest rap. Flawless flows, good production, and flat-out enjoyable music. Cant ask for much more.
