 This is Kast's second offering. Their first album,  Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik, was a classic, and this picks up where  that left off, literally "Elevating" them to other-worldly  levels. The title track is designed to get the party crunk, yet still  maintains a smooth feel. 90% of this album is nuthin but stand-out trax,  including Two Dope Boyz (In A Cadillac), Wheelz Of Steel, Jazzy Belle,  Elevators, Mainstream, Decatur Psalm, and 13th Floor/Growing Old. All of  those are beautifully constructed trax, which succeed on all levels. That  being said, the album does have it's low points. Babylon drags slightly  with its lackadaisical beat. Ditto for E.T., which is an odd track in which  chiming noises and heavy breathing comprise the beat. I guess they were  trying to capture that odd "alien" type feeling. Overall,  however, this is a must-have album. With hooks that will have you singing  along subconsciously and beats that will keep your head nodding. Combine  those elements with Big Boi and Andre's stutter-stop flows and lyrical  wordplaying, and you get that signature Outkast sound, which has yet to  produce anything less than classic music.
