 This album isn't nearly as good as their earlier releases such as The End.  "Sippin On Some Syrup" and "M.E.M.P.H.I.S." are the only classic tracks on here. "Sippin..." features a great beat, catchy hook, and worthwhile guest appearance from UGK, while "M.E.M.P.H.I.S." is just an all-out banger featuring the Hypnotize Camp Posse. "Touched Wit It," featuring former No Limit Soldiers Fiend and Mr. Serv-On, is also a nice track. But outside of maybe one or two others, the album is filled with mediocrity. Nothing else stands out, and this ends up being nothing more than an average album. It's a shame too, because this album had a huge build up, and it only ends up disappointing. If you're a die hard 3-6 fan, you might enjoy this. Otherwise, save your money.
