 Mankind.....One of the greatest wrestlers of all time.  Mick Foley.....One of the greatest writers of all time? OK, maybe I wouldn't go that far, but "Have a Nice Day" is a great read, all 500+pages of it.  The  humor ("He looked at me as if I'd just farted in church" is one  example) is great throughout.  The stories NEVER get boring.  You'll pick  it up and a couple hours later you won't even realize you're already half  way through it--IT IS THAT GOOD.  A must read if you're a wrestling fan, a  recommended read even if you're not.
