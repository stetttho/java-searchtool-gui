 On her debut album, Mystic brings forth a beautiful blend of singing and emceeing over a varied soundscape, with a result that can be enjoyed by all fans of good music. She has a great singing voice, and displays it nicely on every track. Just as you're getting drawn into her soothing sound, she busts into emcee mode, spitting meaningful lyrics with a seemingly effortless flow.  The first single, "The Life," is an example of that. On "D Boy" she spits with fire & passion a vivid storyline about a young man caught up in the game. On "You Say, I Say," she slows down the pace on a heartfelt love track with a mesmerizing feel to it. The list of standout tracks is endless, as "Cuts For Luck and Scars For Freedom" has very few weak spots. At its cheap price, you cannot go wrong with this album.
