 For those of you who thought Wu-Tang was dead, this album proves completely otherwise. After lukewarm Wu releases such as Raekwon's "Immobilarity," Ol' Dirty's "N**ga Please," & RZA's  awful "Bobby Digital," (as well as many others) it seemed as if  the Wu had lost their special touch. Then comes the build-up to this album.  Everybody was saying it's on another level, that it's the Wu of old.....and  were they ever right.   Production is handled nicely by several  producers. Surprisingly (or not surprisingly as of late) RZA only produces  two cuts, "Buck 50" & "Child's Play," but both are  definite stand-outs. But the main ingredient that makes this album so good  is Ghost himself on the mic. Dude's crazy! He can go from lyrics that  really get you thinking cuz they're deep, to lyrics that really get you  thinking cuz they make no sense at all! "This rap is like  ziti".....hmmmm, does that mean he's "cooking" up a  masterpiece? Wouldn't that be the Chef's job? How about  "supercalifragilisticespialadoscious,  dosciousalaespilisticfragicalisuper!" LOL, it's times like these that  give this album continuous spins. I personally like his crazy lyrical  style, and he comes at you with so much energy in his flows that you gotta  get amped-up every time you listen.   Definitely a must-have album for  Wu fans, former Wu fans, and Wu haters worldwide. BUY THIS!
