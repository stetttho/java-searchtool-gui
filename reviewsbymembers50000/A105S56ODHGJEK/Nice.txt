 The Nazty North compilation gives us a taste of P Family Records' solid roster of Minnesota and Chicago underground artists, to overall good results. The album succeeds nicely in showcasing many different styles - toungue-twisting, club / bounce, hardcore, and meaningful. All of which maintain that North Coast sound that Midwest rap is known for. The album's production, handled mostly by the artists themselves, is surprisingly strong.  The album's highlight comes when Rif Raf and Don Deedy hook up on "Trip 2 Da Go," a masterfully constructed smooth twisting track.  Although the album has a few weak spots, this is still a nicely done compilation which accomplishes it's purpose: to showcase P Family Records' unknown talent.
