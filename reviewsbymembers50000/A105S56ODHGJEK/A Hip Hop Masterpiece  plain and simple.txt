 While most of the hip-hop coming out nowadays is filled with the same commercialized BS, Outkast continues to step their level up to new heights. Stankonia is a masterpiece, as was Aquemini, as was ATLiens, and as was their debut Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik. Not since A Tribe Called Quest came into the game have we seen a group drop more than 2 straight classics...Tribe managed 3 straight, but Outkast has just completed their fourth. The first two singles, B.O.B. and Ms. Jackson, are both extremely tight tracks, as is just about every track on here. So Fresh, So Clean, I'll Call Before I Come, Humble Mumble, Slum Beautiful. And Gasoline Dreams is so chilling that after one listen, you really will smell gasoline in the air. The list goes on and on. The standout though, if you could pick just one, has to be Red Velvet. The mesmerizing psychadelic beat fits perfectly with Dre & Big Boi's flows.   Overall, this is an album you won't just bump this year and forget about. It's an album you'll bump forever ever....forever ever?....yes, FOREVER.
