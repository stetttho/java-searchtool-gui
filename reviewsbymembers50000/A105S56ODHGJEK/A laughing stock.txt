 Disturbing Behavior is pretty much awful. The plot has promise, but is brought down by downright horrible acting (most notably from Katie Holmes, who provides nothing more than something to look at in this film), and pitiful dialogue.The one saving grace of the movie is Nick Stahl who plays Gavin. He portrays two different roles very well, switching from one to the other halfway through the film. Other than his performance, everything else about Disturbing Behavior is laughable. Need I even mention the ending, which is so dull it makes Al Gore seem like Jim Carrey. This film might please teenagers eager to catch a flick about other teenagers, and maybe catch a glimpse of partial nudity.But I would not recommend this film to anybody else.
