 If not for Black Rob and this album, I would consider Bad Boy a completely dead label right now, comparable to Death Row (which is also being held above water by one man--Daz Dillenger). After Cream Puffy's ever-so-wack  "Forever" late last year, and a series of release dates being  pushed back for this album, I had begun to give up hope. Singles like  "I Dare You" and "You Don't Know Me" were beginning to  get very old and played out. But then Rob drops the hit track  "Whoa!" and my eagerness to get this album was rejuvenated.    And when the date finally came, after months of waiting, I was not  disappointed. The title track is a nice, but yet rugged joint showcasing  Rob's superior lyrical abilities. "Down The Line Joint" must've  been recorded quite a while ago, as it features everybody's favorite former  Bad Boy Mase. But it's still a nice track. Same with "Can I Live"  featuring former Bad Boys the Lox. The lyrics are very out-of-date, as Kiss  spits "we can't lose, cuz Puff set us up properly." But still a  good track.   "Thug Story" is a remake of Slick Rick's classic  "Children's Story." Rob definitely does this one justice, unlike  most remakes. And Cee-Lo stops by for a worthwhile performance on  "Lookin At Us."   Rob is a great lyricist, which he shows over  and over again on this album. And the production is actually very good. The  only minor flaw I find in this is the old tracks, but even those are hard  to look down on. If this album doesn't go platinum, when artists like Hot  Boy$, Master P, and even Puff are going platinum multiple times over,  there's something wrong with the hip-hop world.   Buy this album! You  won't be disappointed!
