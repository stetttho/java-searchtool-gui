 I admit it, I was very late on this album. I just got it two weeks ago. But, as the saying goes, better late than never.   On "Illadelph Halflife," The Roots take it to a whole other level. "Do You Want  More? " was classic material, but this is a far better album overall.    Philly's finest kick things off with the bangin  "Respond/React." From here on, it's nothing but sheer brilliance.  A perfect blend of bangin, street-edged tracks and smooth, jazzy, melodious  tracks.  "Sections," "Push Up Ya Lighter,"  "Concerto Of The Desperado," "Clones," "UNIverse  At War," and "Ital" (featuring Q-Tip), are all bangin,  flawless tracks. Then "Episodes," "What They Do,"  "No Alibi," "The Hypnotic," and "One Shine,"  are all well-crafted smooth, jazzy tracks. "No Great Pretender"  is easily the best track on this album, and it may be one of the greatest  tracks of all time. If not one of the greatest, definitely one of the  SMOOTHEST. The JFN's work on this track is beautiful.   And no Roots  album would feel complete without Ursula Rucker's poetry. This album  delivers there too, with "The Adventures In Wonderland." I love  everything about "Illadelph Halflife." The lyrics (Black Thought  is a genious on this album), the beats, the guest appearances, the  diversity, and every other aspect an album is judged on. If you don't have  this album, I very highly recommend it. You won't be disappointed!
