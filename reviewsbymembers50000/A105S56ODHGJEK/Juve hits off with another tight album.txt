 With "400 Degreez" STILL in the top ten on rap charts a year afer its release, Cash Money knew the faster a new Juve CD came out the better. Some of the track on this CD sound a little rushed, and its not  better than "400 Degreez," but this is still a very good album.  "Guerrilla," the last track on the album, might just be the best  track anybody from Cash Money has put out. Juve teams up with B.G. over a  hauntingly eerie beat while a thunderstorm lurks in the background.  UNBELIEVABLE. Just pure genius. This track alone is worth the price of this  CD. If you like Cash Money or that Down South sound, you'll like this CD.
