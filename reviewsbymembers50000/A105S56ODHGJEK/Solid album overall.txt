 Pun had skills, no doubt. His 1998 debut "Capital Punishment," was a classic. This album does not measure up to that, but it's still pretty good overall.   "Watch Those" is a nice track in which  Pun spits those same kinds of wicked lines he mastered on Capital  Punishment. "It's So Hard" finds Pun experimenting with a  different flow, in which he hightens his voice during the middle and end of  each line. It's also rather sad, as he says at the end of the first verse  "I just lost a hundred pounds, I'm tryna live!"   "New  York Giants" is a hyped up joint, which isn't surprising considering  it features everybody's favorite hyped-up duo, M.O.P. "N*gga  Sh*t" features a dope beat courtesy of Buckwild, but it's far too  short, clocking in at only 1:45. Other standout tracks include "Off  Wit His Head," "Leather Face," and "Laughing At  You."   The album trails off slightly at the end, with a few tracks  (and guests) that fail to justify their being on the album.  Overall,  despite it's flaws and short length, "Yeeeah Baby" is still a  worthy buy.      R.I.P. Pun
