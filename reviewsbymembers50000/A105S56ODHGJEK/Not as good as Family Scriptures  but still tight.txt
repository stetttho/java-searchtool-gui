 This is the second installment of the Mo Thugs family. Their first album, "Family Scriptures," is a brilliantly constructed MASTERPIECE. This album is very good, but not a masterpiece. Standout trax on here  include "Mighty Mighty Warrior," "Mighty Mo Thug" (by  the EXTREMELY slept-on Souljah Boy), "All Good" (despite the  played-out term, this is a nice upbeat track), "U Don't Own Me"  (although it starts to drag slightly, still a nice track), and  "Otherside." "Riot" by Flesh Bone is a well-constructed  track showcasing his slept-on skills. "Ain't Said No Names" is  Krayzie Bone's solo. Although it's nowhere near as good as "Mo  Murder" (his solo on Family Scriptures), it's still a nice track. The  only trax I really could've done without on here are "Believe"  (despite what Krayzie might say, these guys are not the next Jackson 5),  and "The Queen," which features the whiny-voiced Thug Queen. She  has upped her skills noticeably since this, but on here she was a major  ear-bleed. Also, Powder ruins "Ghetto Cowboy," a track that  could've been classic without his ten seconds of nonsense. In the end, this  album is definitely a worthy buy. If you don't already have Family  Scriptures, buy that NOW, then if you have some cash left over, pick this  up. You most likely won't be disappointed.
