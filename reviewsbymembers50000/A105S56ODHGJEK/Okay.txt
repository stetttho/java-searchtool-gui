 This video portrays the making of Bone thug's last album, "BTNHResurrection," in a documentary. It also contains videos for a few tracks off the album, and a performance of "Tha Crossroads."  The main problem with this item is that the tracking on the VHS is horrible. So if you truly want this, the DVD would be the better route to go.  But it is worth picking up, for the documentary, as well as the extended version of the "Change The World" video, which is one of Bone's best videos to date.
