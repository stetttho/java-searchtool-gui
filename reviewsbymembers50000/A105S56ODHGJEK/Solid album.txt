 From the title and sound of this album, you'd never guess it's Double R's  debut. He really does come across nicely on here, and contrary to what some  will have you believe, it's not just his great voice which makes him a good  artist.   "Let's Ride" sounds like a California Love pt.  2...pretty decent track. "Pillow" (featuring Dewayne Wiggins and  Rame Royal) is real smooth. And the Luniz stop by for a great guest  appearance on "Questions."   But the standout cuts are  "Fresh Out" and "Do G's Get To Go To Heaven."    "Fresh Out" features a great beat which blends with RR's flow  smoother than anything you can imagine (I'm not going to throw out an  overused term, i.e. "smooth as silk"...you get the point that  it's smooth, LOL).   "Do G's Get To Go To Heaven" is a  heartfelt dedication to Tupac, who passed just before Double R dropped this  album. One of the greatest Tupac dedications, if not the greatest.    There are a few tracks which could've been left off this album, mainly the  pointless "Touch Myself" remix featuring T-Boz. But overall, this  is a solid debut album which is recommended if you're a fan of that West  Coast sound.   I just hope he hurries up and releases his next album  already...it was supposed to drop in the spring of '99!
