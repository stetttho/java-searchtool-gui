 This is Xzibit's follow-up to his debut album, "At The Speed Of Life." On this album, Xzibit displays growth as an overall MC, his lyrics and raw flow both being improved.   "What U See Is What U Get" is just raw, easily the best track on the album. "3 Card  Molly," featuring Rass Kass and Saafir, is an entertaining track  showcasing the trio's lyrical skills. And "Los Angeles Times" is  another nice track with a great bassline. Other bangin tracks include  "Focus," "Deeper," and "Inside Job."    Where the album falters is in some of the production. Although the tracks  listed above are all well-crafted, others on this album are not. Case in  point--"Nobody Sound Like Me," the perfect example of what you  get when you cross a lame beat with an un-interesting hook.  "Shroomz" features some funny lyrics over an all-out WACK beat,  making it very hard to listen to.   Fortunately (at least HOPEFULLY),  this problem will not exist on X to the Z's forthcoming album, which will  feature mostly Dr. Dre behind the boards. But still, even with a few wack  beats, this is still a recommended album. If you're a fan of West Coast  hip-hop, you should have "40 Dayz & 40 Nightz" in your  collection.
