 "It's Dark And Hell Is Hot" was a very good album, if not classic. But ever since then, it seems as if Dark Man X has been going downhill, as evidenced by "And Then There Was X."   You have  to give it to him for at least one thing on this album though, he did use a  variety of producers (Swizz, P. Killer Trackz, Grease, Irv Gotti, &  others), instead of the usual Swizz throughout the whole album. That  formula has gotten old and very played out. The problem with this, however,  is the variety doesn't necessarily equal better quality.   The album  kicks off nicely with the Swizz-produced "One More Road To  Cross." The first single, "What's My Name," is a booming  track. But the album's standout has to be the ever-popular "Party Up  (Up In Here)." This is one of the best Swizz tracks I've heard in a  LONG while (probably since "It's Dark...").   The rest of the  album is chock-full of mediocrity. On "What these B**ches Want"  (featuring Sisqo), Mr. Simmons reads off a list of women who he's  supposedly slept with, as if we're supposed to be impressed. "Make A  Move" is an all-out wack track with some pretty laughable lyrics. Same  thing with "More 2 A Song," on which X spits "The game is a  lot bigger than you think you know. And if you think you know, then I don't  think you know." Creative stuff (sense the sarcasm).   The album's  token religious track, "Angel," fails to hit with the same power  tracks such as "The Convo" and "Ready To Meet Him" hit  with on his last albums. And he ends the album with a bonus track  ("Good Girls, Bad Guys") which would've been better just left off  the album.   Overall, this is your prototypical album with 2 or 3  bangers and about 10 fillers, with a few totally wack tracks mixed in. Not  too appealing. If you must have "And Then There Was X," pick it  up at the used CD shop and save yourself a few bucks.
