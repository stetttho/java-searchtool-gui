 This has got to be one of my top ten favorite albums in the 90's.  This thing just keeps growing on me the more times I listen to it.  Tracks like "Mo Murder," "Ain't No Reason," "Searchin' 4  Peace," & "Ghetto Blues" are smooth and soulful, perfect  songs to relax and kick back to.  "Killing Fields," "Rumors  & War," & "No Pretender," are haunting with their  melodies.  "Low Down" is an excellent track showcasing Souljah  Boy's strong potential.  Not to mention "Thug Devotion," which is  a nice lil' party track.  I honestly can find NO faults with this album.   Even if you're not a Bone Thugs fan, I'd say this is a MUST HAVE!
