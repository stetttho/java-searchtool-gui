 Krayzie Bone has stepped his level up even more for his solo album.  He can go from a fast-paced gangsta flow (Heated Heavy, World War) to a smoothed-out harmonic flow (Paper, Smokin' Buddha), with ease.  Of the 30+  tracks on this double CD, only two or three are fast-forward material.  If  your a Bone fan, this is an absolute must have.  If you're a fan of hip-hop  music in general, you will like this album.  A GREAT BUY!
