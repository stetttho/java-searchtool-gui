 On his solo debut, Layzie Bone (aka L-Burna) brings to the plate a slab of fresh production, most of which unfortunately goes to waste due to lack of diversity in his lyrics and flows.  The album kicks off with a solid Christmas carol type Intro, but the sad thing is, the Intro is probably one of the 5 best tracks on the album.  The album's highlights are few and far between, but tracks like Time Will Tell and How Long Will It Last combine masterful production with excellent flows, making for a couple pleasant moments on the album. From there, the album takes another drastic downfall until the last 4 tracks, all of which are solid. The second single, Listen, is very well done, and is well-placed as it leads nicely into the last track on the album, As The Rain (which is probably the best track on the album). The rest of the album is filled with mediocrity, and a few all-out wack tracks (Deadly Musicals, Make My Day, Lock-n-Load).  The album also has a few horrible hooks, the worst of which being Still The Greatest. The hook on that track ruins what would've been a pretty good song.  Overall, it would've been nice to see more tracks on this album like Mind Of A Souljah (Layzie's solo on The Art Of War). But, it's not a horrible album. If you're a Bone fan, you should pick this one up, just dont expect to be blown away with awesome lyrics or great harmonizing.
