 On his sophomore album, Fiend mixes things up a little, most notably including only four guest appearances, as opposed to the fifty or so on his last album. On "Ak'n Bad," over a grimy beat, Mystikal steals the  show with the fast paced stutter-stop flow he's mastered. "Heart Of A  Ghetto Boy" is a subdued track on which Fiend slows his flow to match  the sax in the background. The track is a welcome break from the rowdiness  of the first six tracks. On "Walk That Line," he totally flips  his flow. You gotta listen to it more than once to fully appreciate it.  Other standout tracks include "The Rock Show," "Trip To  London," and "Waiting On God."   The album could've done  without songs like "The Truth Is" and "They Don't Hear  Me," as they don't bring anything new to the table. But overall,  "Street Life" is one of the better No Limit releases of recent  memory.
