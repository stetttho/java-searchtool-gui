 First off, this IS NOT a Hot Boys CD, as some of the reviewers may have you believe. The Hot Boys appear on the first two tracks only.  What this is--it is a collection of some of 1998-99's best hip-hop tracks SLOWED  DOWN, or "screwed," for your listening pleasure.  The best track  on here is the screwed version of "In the Middle of the Night" by  Twista feat. Eightball & MJG.  This sounds very dope slowed down.   Overall, this is a great CD to bump in your stereo while you kick back and  relax.
