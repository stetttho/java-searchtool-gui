 Like most soundtracks, this one serves it's purpose, but is nothing special musically.  There are a few nice tracks, like Behind The Walls, I'm Shackled Up, and War Wit Us. But the majority of the album is filled with just average music (the exception being Master P's "Locked Up," which would qualify as just AWFUL music). The album also suffers from a lack of diversity subject matter-wise. While it serves it's purpose as far as relating to the show, it makes for a monotonous listen.  Best advice: unless you're a die-hard Oz fan, save your money.
