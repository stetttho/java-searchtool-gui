 What do you get when two of the best artists in hip-hop join forces? A bangin album, that's what.  "Blackout" succeeds in just about every level.  "Cereal Killer," produced by RZA, is absolutely  NUTS--Literally, as a voice says "This is the sound of a cow" and  you hear a coyote howling out.  It comes complete with a simple, yet dark  and entertaining beat and Meth and Red with some of their best dark lyrics.   "Y.O.U," another standout track, features Redman doing his best  Big Pun impersonation on his second verse, and the "How High"  remix ends the album on a HIGH (ahem) note.  The times the album doesn't  succeed are on the tracks where Meth & Red think just the fact they're  on a track together makes it good. These are few and far between, but they  do occur. Overall, though, this is a very good album, and a recommended  buy.
