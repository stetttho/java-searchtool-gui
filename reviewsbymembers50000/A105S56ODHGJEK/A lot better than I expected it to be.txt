 I bought this album with relatively low expectations, after his lackluster  debut and the early bad reviews for this. But I must say, this is a bangin  album! Most of the beats on here are 1000X better than on  "Can-I-Bus" and his lyrics are as good as ever.   The title  cut is reminiscent of "2nd Round Knockout," except this time he  goes after Wyclef for "spoiling" his album. Piano plucks echo  throughout the significantly improved version of "Watch Who U Beef  Wit," which is another highlight on this album. Bus trades  lyrically-sick verses with Rakim on "I'll Buss Em U Punish Em."  And his 4-Horsemen brethren stop by on "Horsementality," only to  get outshined lyrically by Can himself.   On "100 Bars," Bus  spits nonstop for close to 5 minutes. Definitely a highlight. But the best  tracks on this album come back-to-back at #'s 9 & 10. "Doomsday  News" features Canibus spitting ferociously over a sick beat, almost  reminiscent of RZA at his eeriest behind the boards. And "Lost @  C" has another beat similar to "2000 BC" and "2nd Rd.  Knockout," with the church-choir like vocals in the background. And  just as you think the track is over too soon, Can busts back on the mic  with another ill verse, rapped with pent-up emotion that you can hear in  his voice.   There are a few tracks which bring this album down.  "Die Slow" & "Life Liquid" (both of which feature  Journalist) fail to motivate beat-wise. And as great as he is lyrically,  Canibus is a one-dimensional, battle MC. With a little variety in subject  matter and a few more sick tracks, this album could've approached  classic-status. Nevertheless, it's definitely recommended. Canibus is  probably one of the top 5 lyricists in rap today, and he proves it on just  about every track on here.
