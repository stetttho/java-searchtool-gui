 Despite what some people may say, Chilldrin Of Da Ghetto sound NOTHING like Bone Thugs & Harmony. In fact, if you didn't know who they were, you'd probably swear it was Crucial Conflict you're listening to. To me,  the seven members in the two Chi-town groups have the same exact sounding  voices. But what separates COG from being complete Crucial Conflict clones  is the talented Goldiiz, who not only can flow but he also PRODUCED this  entire album. Definitely some tight beats on here, and he also uses very  little sampling, which is to his credit. It comes out sounding like a  perfect blend of that West Coast, Hoo-Bangin feel and that MidWest,  Chi-town feel. Standout trax on here are the first single "Luv At  First Sight," which is not too sappy as the title might make it look,  "It's Time To Roll" featuring Mack 10, "Better Days,"  "Mistake," and "Hoo-Bangin COG Style" featuring Mack 10  & MC Eiht. On "Lonely," Juvenile drops by for a lethargic,  non interesting verse in which he sounds like he's congested, taking away  from the overall nice feel the track has. The second single, "Wild  Side," could easily be confused as a Crucial Conflict track, from the  title to the flows. But again, it's Goldiiz work behind the boards which  provides the distinction. Overall, this is a nice debut album, showcasing  this group's high potential. A worthy buy.
