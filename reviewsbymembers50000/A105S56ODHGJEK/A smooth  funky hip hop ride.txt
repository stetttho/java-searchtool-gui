 The man with the raspy voice has done it again. On "The Game," Richie Rich delivers more of what we've all been waiting for since 1996: His smooth, pimpalistic style.  The album kicks off with the bangin Strait Mall featuring B-Legit. Definitely sets the tone nicely for the rest of the album. Tracks like If, The Truth, Game Dont Stop, Bring The O, Whose House, How Many Licks (featuring Yuckmouth) and The Game all bring that funky West Coast feel that's unmatched by any other current artist. And he can still take you back old-school style, as heard on tracks like Playboy and Birds. There's not a single track on the album that can be classified as fast-forward material.  But the album's highlight has to be the last track, Time In My Life, on which RR strays away from the sex & street tales that dominate the majority of the album. He describes growing up as a kid in vivid detail over a masterful beat. Absolutely stunning track, and the album is worth picking up for it alone. Overall, this is a very solid album, just as good and maybe slightly better than his 1996 release "Seasoned Veteran." If you're a fan at all of West Coast rap, and you've never heard Richie Rich, you NEED to pick both of these albums up. You dont know what you're missing.
