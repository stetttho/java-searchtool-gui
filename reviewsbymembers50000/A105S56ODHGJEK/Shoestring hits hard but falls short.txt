 Straight from Flint, Michigan comes the Dayton Family's Shoestring.  This album could've been much tighter than it is, but it's still worth a listen.  "Wiggy" starts things off with a high energy track that could  get the party crunk.  It features Madam Dame and fellow Dayton Family  member Bootleg (who kicks a great verse).  "Following a Star"  presents a break from all of the shoot-em-up-gangstafied tracks, but still  fails to measure up to such Dayton Family classics as "Oxydol"  and "Thru a Thang."  To his credit, Shoe has one of the hardest  flows in rap today, but his flow can't shine when it's held back by lame  beat/lame hook disease.  Overall, this album leaves you wanting more of the  old "What's On My Mind" & "F.B.I." days, which we  will hopefully get back with the soon release of the new Dayton Family  album.
