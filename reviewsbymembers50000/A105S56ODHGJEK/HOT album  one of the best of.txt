 Organized Konfusion is not only the group Pharoahe Monch is in, but it also describes his style. His wickedly twisted flow and lyrics might not appeal at first listen, but after repeated listens it grows on you.  The head-nodding, self-produced, ever popular first single "Simon  Says" is just a sampling of Pharoahe's creativeness. He produced five  of his own tracks on here, another of which is "Behind Closed  Doors," a raw, bangin track. On the Alchemist-produced "No  Mercy," M.O.P. and Monch combine for a hyped-up energy overdose,  definitely destined to satisfy the listener (and wake up the neighbors).  And he ends the album with an all-star line-up on the "Simon  Says" remix, featuring the likes of Red & Meth, Busta Rhymes,  & more.  Overall, this album is full of rawness. Maybe not a  classic, but since 4.5 is not an option, I've rounded up. Either way, this  album is bangin, definitely a worthy buy.
