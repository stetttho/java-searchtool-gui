 This album by the Mo Thugs offshoots is pretty good. Unfortunately, it got slept on heavily due to bad marketing, and it didn't even go gold. That may be one reason Poetic has left Mo Thugs to give it a go on their own (along  with several other former Mo Thugs artists). This also may be why the  hauntingly eerie "Still Waters" album by Graveyard Shift will  never be released. Although the death of group member Tombstone played a  role in that, it's still unfortunate that there's not a big enough fan base  for this great album to be released.   As far as "Trials &  Tribulations," this is a rather short album, with only 11 tracks. But  it's a nice collection of smooth beats and good lyrical content. Flow-wise,  PH could've used a little work, but alongside Bone, anybody's flow would  sound just average. Speaking of Bone, Flesh, Layzie, Wish, and Krayzie make  appearances on "Intro & Insanity," "Day &  Night," "Parlay With A Hustla," & "Weekend  Buzz" respectively. These are definitely four of the strongest cuts on  the album, thanks mostly to the guests. "Weekend Buzz" uses a  classic sample and blends it into a smooth weed track. Krayzie drops a  great verse on there. He also produces much of the album, showcasing his  versatility as an artist.   Overall, if you're a fan of Bone or Mo  Thugs, you should definitely own this CD. If not, you should still give it  a listen. You just might like what you hear.
