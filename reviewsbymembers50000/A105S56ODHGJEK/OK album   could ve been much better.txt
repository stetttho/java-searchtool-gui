 As the main producer of the biggest selling group in history, Bone Thugs N Harmony, DJ Uneek definitely has proven he's masterful behind the boards. The beats he supplied for albums like "E.1999/Eternal" and  "The Art Of War" went from eerie to beautiful with ease. So, it  was only a matter of time before he came out with his own album on his own  label.   "Ghetto Street Pharmacist" features many lesser known  talents from Uneek's Kingpin label. It's really hit & miss as far as  they go, either they show their talent or they come off wack on this album.    The best tracks, not surprisingly, are the ones featuring Bone.  Krayzie stops by for a nice guest spot on the "We Come 2 Serve  Em" remix. Layzie appears on the bumpin "Murda Murda," and  Bizzy stops by for just a few seconds on the R&B flavored "Doctor  Doctor" by Gemini.   The rest of the album, aside from the few  slow-jams, consists of hardcore beats and raps. "On The Run" is a  standout. "I Want Cha Lovin" is a nice track as well.   The  problem with this CD is it has too much filler, along with a few  uninteresting beats. This is definitely not Uneek's best work, and no beats  on this album compell the listener nearly as much as his work with Bone.  That may have something to do with the talent: Bone could make any beat  sound classic with their harmonizing and thuggishness, but I still believe  Uneek could've done better on this album.   Although it's far from his  best work, this is still a recommended album if you're a fan of Uneek's  sound.
