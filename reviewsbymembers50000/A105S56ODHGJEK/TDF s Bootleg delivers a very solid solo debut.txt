 Straight outta Flint, MI comes the Dayton Family's Bootleg.  The tightest track on this is "Sideways," on which I.D. (Bootleg) flips his flow and Madam Dame drops a solid verse.  This is a great track.  99% of  this album is pure gangsta, but "Fly Away" is a smooth track  which gives you something to smoke to (if that's your preference).   "No Future," a remix of MC Breed's "Ain't No Future in your  Frontin," features Breed himself.  Even Rass Kass makes an appearance  on "Sophisticated Thugs." This album has its weak points, but  still it's a MUST for gangster rap fans.
