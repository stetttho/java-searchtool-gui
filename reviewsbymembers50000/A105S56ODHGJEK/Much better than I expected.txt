 I bought this album with relatively low expectations, after reading many  average reviews on it. But I must say, this is a much better album than  some mags and online reviews make it out to be.   Standouts on here  include the title track (in which he goes after Wyclef), the much improved  version of "Watch Who You Beef Wit," and the Canibus/Rakim  lyrical overload "I'll Buss Em U Punish Em." On "100  Bars," Bus flows nonstop for almost 5 minutes, definitely an  accomplishment not many in rap could achieve as smoothly as he did it. And  on "Horse Mentality," Can's 4 Horsemen brethren stop by for yet  another lyrical joyride.   But the top tracks on this album come back to  back at #'s 9 & 10, "Doomsday News" and "Lost @ C."  Both feature sick beats and lyrically-viscious flows, sure to make your  rewind button hot.   All that being said, Canibus is one dimensional  lyrically on this CD--it's all about showin off his battle skills. This can  be very impressive, and it is impressive on here, but it does tend to get a  little old after a while. There are no tracks like "How Come"  anywhere on here. No deep, meaningful lyrics. Even just one or two tracks  like that and this album could've been a classic. The beats are far  superior to "Can-I-Bus," and his lyrical talent cannot be denied.  It's just too bad there wasn't a little more variety.   Definitely a  recommended buy though. He proves without a doubt that he's the illest  battle MC in the game.
