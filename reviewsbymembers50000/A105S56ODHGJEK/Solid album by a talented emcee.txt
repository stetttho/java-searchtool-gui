 Tech N9ne is clearly a complex, versatile emcee, and deserves to be commended on that. You could even compare him to someone like Pharoah Monch, except even more twisted. With "Anghellic," he puts his wide array of skills to good use, executing a solid album concept very nicely. The album's highlights come on Psycho ...and This Ring, vivid tracks showcasing true mic skills, and solid production. On Cursed, Tech comes with a concept which is not new, but he executes it to perfection, making it another album highlight. Other solid tracks include the first single Its Alive, and God Complex.Although the album is laid-out very nicely, it does falter on a couple of occasions. Real Killer and PR 2K1 dont add anything fresh or exciting to the overall feel of the album. Other times, on tracks like Tormented, Tech sounds like he experimented a little too much for his own good, resulting in tracks that just sound sloppy. However, even on the album's weaker cuts, Tech displays his complex lyrical skills, which in some cases save a track from being complete trash. Overall, Anghellic's flaws can be overlooked, as this is an album which makes most of today's overplayed hip-hop look like garbage. If you're looking for a complex, diverse album by a talented emcee, Anghellic is it.
