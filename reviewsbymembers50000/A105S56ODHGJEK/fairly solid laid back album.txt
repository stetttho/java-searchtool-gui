 On his sophomore release, Nate Dogg puts forth a plethora of smooth funked-up tracks, many of which are executed nicely, with a few bumps along the way. What "Music & Me" suffers from is an overabundance of guest appearances, some of which dont serve any purpose at all other than to have the name listed on the album and attract that artists fan base to buy it. The album would've been much better with a majority of solo tracks rather than collaborations. The production on the album isnt bad, but some tracks come off bland. Also, Nate doesnt give all his effort on a few lackluster tracks, which really hurt the overall feel of the album. "Music & Me" lacks the diversity and great solo tracks that "G-Funk Classics," his first solo, had in abundance. But its still a good album if you're a fan of his sound, or you're just lookin for music to kick back to.
