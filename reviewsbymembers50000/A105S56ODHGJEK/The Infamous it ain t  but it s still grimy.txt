 Queensbridge' infamous duo of Havoc and Prodigy return with the usual grimy, dark beats and murderous lyrics.  The standout is the remix of "Quiet Storm" featuring Lil' Kim.  This shows the Mobb at their  best.  "Thug Muzik" featuring Infamous Mobb and Chinky, does not.   And the quasi-third member of the group, Big Noyd, appears on only one  track.  Although this album is not a classic, if you're a fan of dark beats  and murderous lyrics, this will satisfy your appetite.
