 This is one of the best debut albums I've heard by a soloartist since Jay-Z's debut "Reasonable Doubt" back in'96. Cap.1 comes RAW from beginning to end. He can twist his tongue as fast as Twista at times, but he also comes with a nice slower-pace once in a while.  The beats on this album are BANGIN as well, and fit nicely with Cap's flow.  Almost every track on here is dope. Thug In Your Life, They Luv Dat, Get Up, Ride & Smoke, and Pure Pressure are a few of the standouts.  Chi-Town's Finest is a nice track combining Twista, Rawshawnna, & Cap spittin flames over an ill beat.  But easily the standout track (and my personal summer anthem) is Pop Dem Collas. This track has it all: sick beat, great flows, and a dope hook courtesy of Dwayne Wiggins. I can't even begin to describe how much I love that.  There are VERY few weak tracks on here, and even the weaker tracks would be above average on any other album. Overall, this is an album that you'll bump all summer...no, all YEAR long. GET IT!
