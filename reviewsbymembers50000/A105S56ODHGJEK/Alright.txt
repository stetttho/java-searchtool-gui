 This album has it's share of high spots, but is brought down drastically by the vast overabundance of unneeded skits. 8 skits on one album? That's getting ridiculous. Twista himself is only on 9 of the 20 actual tracks, and as expected, he turns in the album's best performances. Other noteworthy tracks by the Darkside Ballaz and High Beam also help the album's cause. The best point on the album comes on "Stories," on which Twista and former No Limit soldier Fiend both drop hot verses. Other good tracks include "Ball Wit Us," "Run," and "Peace Of Mind." The album could've benefitted infinitely from some Traxster production, but overall the beats are mostly solid. While this is slightly better than the first installment, it's not a great album by any means. If you're a fan of Twista, however, you should enjoy it.
