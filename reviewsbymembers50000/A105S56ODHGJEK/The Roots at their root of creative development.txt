 This is the "forgotten" Roots album, the one before the classic "Do You Want More? " ever hit store shelves.   The Roots may have been at a developmental stage on this album, but it's still filled  with that classic Roots flavor. "Grits" is a fun track with an  entertaining hook. The self proclaimed "longest posse cut in  history," "The Session" seems to never end. It's well over  ten minutes long, but it's not un-bearable. In fact, it's actually an  alright track. "Essaywhaman," performed live at the Soulshack, is  early evidence of their brilliance in live performances. But the best track  on this album has to be "Leonard I-V." Similar to "Swept  Away" and "Distortion To Static" (off DYWM), this track uses  human voice as part of the beat. Very nice outcome.   Overall, although  the production on "Organix" is not as advanced or thorough as the  Roots newer albums, it still delivers in what's important---providing the  listener with some Good Music to enjoy.
