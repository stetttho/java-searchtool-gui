 F#%K what'cha heard. Obviously some people who write reviews for mags & online reviews just don't get it. It ain't all about harmonizing over soft beats, which some of these so-called "professional"  reviewers might have you think. BTNHResurrection is far more than that.  This is an album signifying the return of the greatest selling hip-hop  group ever. It's also an album which might be the LAST for them as a whole  group. Yes, Bizzy Bone may be gone from Bone now, but he definitely makes  his presence known on this album. The album features stellar production  from DJ Uneek (Ecstasy, Weed Song,  & Change the World, along wit three  others), LT Hutton (Battlezone), JT Thomas (Souljahs Marching,  Resurrection), and Darren Vegas (The Righteous Ones, One Night Stand). But  it AINT just the production that is stellar on this album. It's the fact  that Bone mixed it up. Did somethin different. Experimented. And although  it leaves maybe an incomplete feeling hearin only three members on some  songs, it's different. And it's also nice to see Flesh & Bone get the  kind of spotlight he deserves, bein on almost all of the trax instead of  the two or three he's normally on on Bone's albums.  The standout trax on  this album are Ecstasy (perfect blend of thugishness and harmony), The  Righteous Ones (a beautifully crafted track), Battlezone (Krayzie  absolutely RIPS this), Weed Song (almost sounds like a bedtime song you'd  let your kids listen to before bed. SMOOTH. A lot of harmony), and Souljahs  Marching. And of course, Resurrection (Paper, Paper) which, although he  isn't in the video, features Flesh. This albums only drawbacks are trax  like 2 Glocks & Can't Give It Up. These little dittys don't do nuthin  for me. But, the high points FAR outweigh the low. So forget a magazine  review. Trust this one. Go buy this album NOW! You will NOT be  dissapointed.
