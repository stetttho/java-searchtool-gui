 Noreaga was great on "The War Report."  He was o.k. on "N.O.R.E.," but the tight beats and great collabos made up for it.  "Melvyn Flynt" is "N.O.R.E." without the tight  beats and great collabos.  "Play That S**t" featuring Juvenile  and Lil' Wayne is the lone real standout track.  "Sometimes" and  "Wethuggedout" (feat. Missy) are above average tracks, but the  best overall advice--buy the "Play That S**t" single and leave  the album on store shelves.
