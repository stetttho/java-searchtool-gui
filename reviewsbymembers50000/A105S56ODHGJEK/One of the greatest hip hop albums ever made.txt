 If you don't have this album in your collection, seriously, either you  don't like hip-hop or there's something wrong with you. This is a timeless  classic.   I'm not even going to begin to describe why every track is  dope, cuz I'd literally be here all night. Incarcerated Scarfaces, Glaciers  Of Ice, Ice Cream, Wu Gambinos, Heaven & Hell, etc...they're ALL  classics. But if I had to choose two favorite tracks off of here (I could  never choose just one), they'd be Rainy Dayz and Verbal Intercourse.    Rainy Dayz is so smooth it'll give you chills....I remember the first time  I heard this track, I played it over and over again, and just like the  whole album, it never gets tiring or old.   Verbal Intercourse lets us  hear with our own ears the transformation of Nasty Nas to Nas Escobar, and  Esco fails to dissappoint. Everything about this track is beyond  classic--the unbelievable beat and the flawless flows of Nas, Rae, &  Ghost combine to make this one of my personal favorite tracks of all time.    Now enough reading this review, BUY THIS  ALBUM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! NOW!
