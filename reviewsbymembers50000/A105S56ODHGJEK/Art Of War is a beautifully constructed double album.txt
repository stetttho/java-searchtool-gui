 On the Art Of War, Bone showcases their entire arsenal of Thuggishness and Harmony, resulting in a beautifully crafted double album. This might be the best double hip-hop album ever. Disc 1 brings out many magnificent trax,  such as It's All Real (Krayzie solo), If I Could Teach The World, and  Family Tree. Not to mention possibly the best track on the whole album,  It's All Mo Thug, which even features Bizzy on his only track ever having  anything to do wit Mo Thugs. It's VERY smooth, definitely one of the  smoothest Bone trax ever. Disc 2 features a little more of the thuggish  side of Bone, as displayed on the shotgun-blast filled Thug Luv featuring  2Pac. One of the most hardcore Bone trax ever. Wasteland Warriors, 7 Sign  (Bizzy solo), U Aint Bone, & Evil Paradise also display the  thuggish-ruggish side of Bone. On the mellifluous tip (look it up yall),  Hatin Nation is a nice laid back joint, and so is Mo Thug Family Tree,  which features the same beat as Family Tree, but features Mo Thugs along  wit Bone. And then we have the obligatory weed track, Blaze It, which is  short but still showcases smooth harmonizing, perfect to spark one to. All  in all, this features very little filler, AMAZING considering it's a double  album. A well-crafted DJ Uneek produced classic. If you don't have this by  now, you're definitely missin out.
