 It's been three years since this came out, but if you don't have it, get it!  Flesh is amazing with his flows, though it can sometimes be hard to understand what he's saying.  There's plenty of smooth tracks (World so  Cruel, Northcoast, Sticks and Stones, and Playa Haters are some of the  best), and there are hardcore thug tracks (Mystic Spirits, Coming 2 Serve  You, and No Mercy).  The guests (Run, Fat Joe, Big Pun, Layzie &  Krayzie Bone) all make worthwhile appearances, but it is Flesh and his  unique flow that makes this album.  This is one of the top ten  under-appreciated hip-hop albums of the 1990's.  BUY IT!
