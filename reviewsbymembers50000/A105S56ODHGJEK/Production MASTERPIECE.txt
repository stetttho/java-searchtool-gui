 On his solo debut, Pete Rock enlisted an all-star cast of guests to spit over some of the best work from PR to date.   "Half Man, Half Amazin" features a lighter-than-usual Method Man trading verses with  PR over a classic beat.   "Respect Mine" features the ever  slept-on O.C. over yet another classic PR beat. "Tha Game"  featuring Raekwon, Prodigy, & Ghostface is just ridiculous. Absolutely  unreal. NY's heavy-hitters spittin over another great beat. Ghost really  tears that one apart with his energetic verse.   "Take Your  Time" is a beautiful slow-jam featuring Loose Ends. "Da Two"  is a reunion track of sorts, as we hear the familiar voice of C.L. Smooth  over yes, yet another classic PR beat. "Verbal Murder 2" is just  sick. Everything about it, the beat, & the lyrics courtesy of Noreaga,  Common, & the late Big Pun. "Strange Fruit" features a  different kind of beat from PR, but Sticky Fingaz really shines on that  track.   The album may have been even better (if that's possible) if it  featured less of PR on the mic, but even his less than stellar mic skills  are made up for by his UNMATCHED work behind the boards. What more could  you ask for in an album than some of hip-hop's best rappers flowin over  beats courtesy of hip-hop's best producer?   BUY THIS ALBUM!
