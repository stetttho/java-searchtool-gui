 It's a topic most heads dont like discussing---the dreaded hip-hop soundtrack. But "Next Friday" is actually better than most. "Fried Day" by Bizzy Bone is an amazingly smooth joint  reminiscent of "Buddah Lovaz" by Bone Thugs. "Chin  Check," the first new NWA track in years, is a great track, but its  hard to think of it as NWA with Snoop instead of Eazy. "Shaolin  Worldwide" by Wu succeeds, as does "Murder Murder" by  Eminem, a track which was originally on his Slim Shady EP. Other decent  trax by Pharoahe Monch & Krayzie Bone contribute to the success of the  album. The big (and I mean BIG) downfall of this album is the HORRIBLY WACK  lead single by Ice Cube, "You Can Do It." As you listen to him  chant the chorus "you can do it put your back into it" it makes  you wonder what happened to the Cube of the early 90's that we knew and  loved.
