 This is the Hot Boys debut CD, released in 1997, before the Hot Boys went national.  This CD is better than their most recent release, partly for that reason.  It really shows on this album that they were putting their  heart into making every track as dope as possible.  "We on Fire"  has a beat that's ten times better than the new version.  "Take it Off  Your Shoulder," Juvenile's solo track, is one of his best songs to  date.  Even the intro to this album revolves around a dope beat.  If you  like the down south sound, you'll LOVE this CD.
