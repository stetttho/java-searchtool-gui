 "Unpredictable" is maybe the best thing No Limit has ever released. Mystikal shows why he is the most talented soldier on this well crafted sophmore album (his first was released on Jive/Big Boy). There are  MANY standout trax, one of which is the title track, on which Mystikal  spits that rapid fire stutter-stop flow he's mastered. "Here We  Go" is a nice collabo wit B-Legit & E-40, while  "Gangstas" features Snoop on one of his first No Limit  appearances. "Still Smokin" is his ode to those sticky-green  leaves, while "Dick On The Track" features some clever word play.  But the two STAND-OUT trax on here have to be "The Man Right  Chea" and "Shine." "The Man Right Chea" features  an UNBELIEVABLE beat combined wit Mystikal's signature flow, while  "Shine" is a touching tribute to his sister, who was murdered  while he was working on his first album. "Born 2 Be a Soldier" is  yet another in what was the long running "Soldier" series of No  Limit trax. Not much to this one, basically fast-forward material. But all  in all, the high points on this album FAR outweigh the lows. In my opinion,  this album is DEFINITELY a worthy buy.
