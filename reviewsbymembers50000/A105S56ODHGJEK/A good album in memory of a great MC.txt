 Big L's tragic death was yet another in a line of brilliant MCs who's lives ended far too early. We should consider ourselves fortunate to have this album: an album which turned out very nice.  There are no poorly constructed tracks, with random verses from L thrown together with an out-of-place guest MC (i.e. "Born Again"). Instead, the guests on here all shine right along side L, showing how much they respected him and his talent. The only oddly-concocted track may be Deadly Combination featuring Tupac. But even that doesn't come off sounding cheap.  The best tracks on here are The Heist, Flamboyant, Games, and the ghetto-classic Ebonics. Also, on Casualties Of A Dice Game, L paints a vivid picture over a nice beat: definitely another standout.  Overall, Rawkus did a nice job with this posthumous release. If you've ever heard any of L's work, you should definitely pick this up.  R.I.P. Big L
