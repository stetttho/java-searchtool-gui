 It was just dumb that so many people expected Nas to produce another Illmatic with this album. Artists grow, and thus expand their subject matter. Unfortunately, this album got some bad reactions when it came out (and it still does), simply because it's not Illmatic part 2. It Was Written is a great album from start to finish. "The Message" is just unbelievable: it ranks right up there as one of the greatest tracks of all time. "Affirmative Action" is another great track, showcasing Firm members Cormega, AZ, and Foxy Brown at their best. And on "I Gave You Power," Nas uses a vivid metaphorical tale to describe how he's like a gun. Other standouts include "Black Girl Lost," "Street Dreams," "Nas Is Coming," and of course the hit single "If I Ruled The World." The album falters on a couple tracks that don't really fit in well. But overall, this is a very solid 4 star album. If you haven't listened to it in a while, give it another chance. And if you still don't have it, well, buy it!
