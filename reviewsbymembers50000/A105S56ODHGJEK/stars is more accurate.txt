 This is Flesh-n-Bone's sophomore solo effort, and while it's not nearly as good as the near-classic T.H.U.G.S., "5th Dog Let Loose" is still solid.  The album kicks off with The Last Tru Souljahs intro, which could've been even better with an additional verse. Hero is an okay track, but it's puzzling why they chose to include this as part of track one, making it hard to access (you'll have to fast forward through the intro which is 3 minutes).  Way Back, which was originally included on the Mo Thugs 3 album, is slightly downgraded on this album. The beat is watered-down, and the hook is sapped-up. The album shines brightest when the production comes through tight, as in The Master, Kurupted Flesh, and Come F--k With Me, which is easily the best track on the album. The beat, the hook, the flow--everything is perfect. This is a track you can put on and just kick back to.  Unfortunately, the production is for the most part lackluster on the rest of the album. Tracks like Word To The Wise, Deadly, No Other Like My Kind, and Silent Night all could've benefitted from a better beat.  Another problem with this album is that it's, for all intents and purposes, a compilation. It's well-known that Flesh is currently serving time, which makes it hard (obviously) to put together an album full of new material. Thus, most of the tracks on here are 3 or 4 years old. Tracks like Amen, If You Could See, and Deadly have been available on the net for over a year now. And the rest of the tracks clearly have a '96-97 feel to them, almost as if they just missed the cut for T.H.U.G.S.  Overall, this is a good album, especially considering the adverse circumstances it was released under. If you're a fan of Bone Thugs-n-Harmony, you'll most likely enjoy this album.
