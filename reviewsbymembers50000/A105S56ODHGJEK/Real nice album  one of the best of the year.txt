 On his solo debut, Sticky Fingaz brings forth a solid collection of tracks, meshed into a real nice storyline. From beginning to end, the album suffers from very few weak points. State vs. Kirk Jones features an all-star cast, which creates the perfect courtroom setting on a bangin track, helping to elevate the album's storyline.  Other noteworthy tracks include Come On, Money Talks, and the poignant Sister I'm Sorry. The one real weak point the album has is on What If I Was White, an awful track featuring an unfunny cameo by Eminem.  Other than that, "Black Trash (The Autobiography Of Kirk Jones)" is a bangin album from start to finish. Sticky's charisma and delivery are at the usual peak we've come to expect from him. And the production for the most part is top-notch. If you're a fan of good, solid hip-hop, this album should be in your collection.
