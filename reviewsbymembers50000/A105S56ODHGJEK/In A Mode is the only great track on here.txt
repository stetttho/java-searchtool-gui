 This is easily Do Or Die's weakest album to date. Production is for the most part below-average, and their lyrics have gone south.   That being said, Victory would get just one star if it weren't for In A Mode, which is quite possibly the greatest Do Or Die track ever. This cut is smooth: it can be played over and over again and it won't get tiring. Other than that, there is not much else to be excited about. Already Know is a good track, and If U Scared & Keep It Real are alright. Who Knows has a strong Daz / Whoridas sounding hook, but other than that it's a sub-par track.   Tracks 10-16 on this album are pure garbage. Murderers, Pimps, & Thugs is just flat-out wack. No other word can describe it more accurately.   Overall, this is a very weak album, outside of In A Mode and a few other good tracks. If it's fast-flows and bangin beats you crave, pick up the new albums from Sandman and Flesh-n-Bone, and pass on Victory.
