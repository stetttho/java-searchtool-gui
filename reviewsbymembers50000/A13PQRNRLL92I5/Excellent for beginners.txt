 If you've been lifting for years and reading magazines or other books, then you probably already know most of the book.  If not, get this book because it will make your workouts much more effective.  It teaches you how to perform an exercise with proper technique in order to maximize the effectiveness of the exercise and it explains how to exercise synergistically. (Performing certain exercises in a specified order to increase the overall effectiveness of the workout.)  The book does an excellent job of explaining things in a clear, simple format.  The book does not cover all muscle groups.  The primary ones it leaves out are abs, calves, and forearms.  I recommend reading their legendary abs supplement, it is very informative.  Problem is, for as short as it is, there are two parts to it sold separately.  If you want to take your training to the next level, I suggest reading Warrior Speed.  That book explains how to train to increase muscle performance toward a specific goal, whereas this book explains how to position your joints to increase the effectiveness of the exercise.
