 This book provided me with a very different perspective, one that I had yet to be exposed to in our paternalistic society.  The concept of an all female society, where women do it all and some girls go most of their childhoods without even seeing a male.  Although the society in this work of fiction has it's problems, as it certainly would if it were a reality, it's an interesting concept all the same.  I found it helpful in getting me to think in some different ways.  The sex and violence were disturbing, but an essential part of the story, this book is not for the feint at heart or easily offended.  Creative, memorable,  and well worth reading! -Sharice Lee  Author:  The Survivor's Guide-
