 Ann Jones is passionate about her views on domestic violence.  If there is any issue that needs passionate advocates it's this one.  I found this book very informative, full of case examples and important information on how our justice system doesn't currently work very well to protect battered women or prosecute violent men.  Concerned Americans need the information provided in this book so that we can work together to make the changes necessary in our society to put a stop to this horrendous epidemic.  However, a word of caution to potential readers; this book contains so many horror stories, it is difficult to cope with.  This can cause perfectly logical people to feel overwhelmed, and even be overtaken by denial, simply because it can be to much for the heart to bear.  Well researched and well written, a great resource for anyone working in the law enforcement, medical, or human services fields.    -Sharice Lee, Author: The Survivor's Guide-
