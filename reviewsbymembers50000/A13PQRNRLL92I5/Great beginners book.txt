 This book is an excellent introduction into plyometric training.  It starts with a good overview of skeletal muscle types and structure.  Then it provides easy to understand descriptions and illustrations to develop a jumping and sprinting plyometric program.  The book also has a few exercises designed to develop explosive punches and kicks.  The book doesn't include any exercises with weights and a lot of research has been published since this book was printed.  For example, the research shows that plyometric training is more effective when combined with heavy resistance training and dynamic resistance training.  (Dynamic training involves explosively using weights that consist of 30% of your 1 rep max; eg: bench on a smith machine and toss the bar up.)  I suggest starting with this book and progressing from there. Ted Weimann, author of Warrior Speed.
