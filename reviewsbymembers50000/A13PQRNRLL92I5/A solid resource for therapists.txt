 Ms. Wieland has written a thoughtful, well organised book on doing therapy with abused kids.  She is thourough in covering all of the common internalizations that abuse victims tend to struggle with. Many books make general refernce to these internalizations, but this book delves into each one specifically.  The chapter on using imaging to help young survivors process memories is a helpful technique. I highly recommend this book to any therapist who works with teen survivors. -Sharice Lee-  Author: The Survivor's Guide
