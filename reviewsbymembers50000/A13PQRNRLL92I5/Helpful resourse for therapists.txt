 I was initially hesitant to read this book as I don't use hypnosis in my practice.  However, I am now very glad I read it.  It is well written, and provides helpful instruction in techniques to assist clients who are dissociativeduring the therapy session.  It also detailed some skills one can teach clients to help cope with overwhelming emotional states.  The author demonstrates considerable knowledge of the needs of this population, and great empathy and understanding.  A very helpful resource. -Sharice Lee  Author "The Survivors Guide: for adolescent          survivors of sexual abuse."-
