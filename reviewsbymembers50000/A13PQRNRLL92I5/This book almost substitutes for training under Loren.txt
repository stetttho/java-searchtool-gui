 I've had the pleasure and privilege of training with and under Loren Christensen.  He's one of those rare induviduals who is a truely great fighter AND instructor.  Loren is also an excellent writer.  The Fighter's Fact Book covers a broad area, yet it provides the essentials to just about every aspect of the martial arts.  Loren teaches from a realistic fighting aspect and he does so with a sense of humor.  If you haven't read his other books, you'll finish this and buy his others on Amazon.  If you have read his other books, chances are this will be your favorite. Ted Weimann, author of WARRIOR SPEED.
