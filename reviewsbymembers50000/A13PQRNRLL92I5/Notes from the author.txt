 When I first began working with adolescent abuse survivor's, I saw a need for written information about the effects of abuse to help educate kids about the fact that many of the difficulties they were experiencing were a result of the abuse, not the result of charachter defects or being a "bad" person, as so many survivors come to believe.  In searching for written material, I found a wealth of well written information geared towards adults.  When I tried to use this material to help my teen clients, they complained that all of the examples in these books were about adults, and there were too many big words.  They were right.  Teens need materials they can relate to.  My goal in writting the survivor's guide was to write something specifically for teen survivors, with examples from real adolescent survivors, and written in "normal language."  I have been blessed by a number of letters from survivors who have found this book helpful.  Helping kids who have had to deal with this terribly difficult issue on a personal level is just what I wanted to do.  These strong kids deserve all the support we as a society can give them.  I hope you too will find this book helpful in your journey.
