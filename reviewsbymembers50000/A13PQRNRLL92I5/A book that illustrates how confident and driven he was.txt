 I enjoyed this book thoroughly.  I also developed another level of respect for the man.  This book develops a clear picture of how confident Bruce was in his abilities as a martial artist and an actor.  It also illustrates how much courage and confidence it took to brake away from tradition and take martial arts to another level.  Linda Lee does not address some of the controversies of Bruce's life, but what do you expect.  I learned more about the man behind the legend from this book than I have from any other source.  I highly recommend The Bruce Lee Story for any and all Bruce Lee fans. Ted Weimann, author of Warrior Speed.
