 As a gymnast, I already practiced the techniques contained in this book.  However, I never fully understood the science behind the techniques until reading Stretching Scientifically.  Kurz understands flexibility better than anyone I have met personally or through literature.  He also explains it better than anyone else.  When I changed gymnastics coaches and was taught some of the techniques contained within this book, I had a split within 3 months.  I have subsequently done exhaustive research on flexibility for my own book on fighting speed and have concluded that Kurz' book is the best. Ted Weimann, author of Warrior Speed.
