 Bruce Lee fans or cinematic enthusiasts will find this book interesting.  There is not much depth of the insight into Bruce, however, when Robert Clouse provides it, it's quite revealing.  Examples include Bruce's method of developing his concentration skills and how he practiced for a possible fight against Mohammed Ali.   Most of the book is about the hurdles Clouse overcame producing the movie.  Considering the obstacles he had, which included the budget, lighting, props, gang fights, and challenges toward Bruce, etc., he and Bruce did a remarkable job.  The book is full of photographs, however there aren't any great pictures of Bruce that you probably haven't already seen. Ted Weimann, author of Warrior Speed.
