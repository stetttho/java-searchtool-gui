 I highly recommend this book to historians, law enforcement officers, military personnel, martial artists, psychologist and others.  Dave Grossman presents a facinating history of how soldiers have adapted psychologically to killing other humans.  Wether you're interested in training yourself to have the ability to kill if necessary or in presenting a strong argument against violence on TV, this book is for you.  I have referred this book to many friends and family and they all enjoyed it. Ted Weimann, author of Warrior Speed.
