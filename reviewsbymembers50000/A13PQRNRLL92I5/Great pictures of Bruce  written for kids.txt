 I could only give this book 3 stars because Bruce contradicts his teachings now and then.  Most of the techniques are simple and straight forward, however, sometimes he'll throw in a kick to the face when it would be dangerous to do so.  It makes for a good picture and that's what I like most about the book.  Most pages have 2 or 3 photos of Bruce.  Even in photographs I love to watch him perform.   He was a great martial artist and all his intensity and expertise show through in the photographs.  The book is laid out in a clear, easy to follow format.  Beginners will get the most out of it.  For more experienced martial artists, enjoy the pictures.  Ted Weimann, author of Warrior Speed
