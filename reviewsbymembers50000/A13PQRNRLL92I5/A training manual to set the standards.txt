 This is a must have book for any tactical officer.  Author Lonsdale presents a comprehensive look at the training and tactics involved in high risk warrant service.  More than just a SERT manual however, this book should also be standard training for every police officer.  I started my tactical training under Lonsdale and after 6 schools, I would have to say his was the best.  I use the tactics I learned from Mark when performing ordinary police work.  Regardless of your experience, I believe you'll find the book informative. Ted Weimann, author of Warrior Speed.
