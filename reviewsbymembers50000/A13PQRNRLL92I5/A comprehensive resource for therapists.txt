 John Briere is a leader in the field of child abuse treatment and is therefore exceptionally knowledgeable on this topic.  That exceptional knowledge shines through in this book.  Clearly written and well organized, I highly recomend it to any therapist or human services worker who wants to increase her skills in assisting abuse survivors. -Sharice Lee-  Author "The Survivor's Guide."
