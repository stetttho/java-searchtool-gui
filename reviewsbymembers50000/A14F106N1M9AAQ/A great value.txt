 If you dont own an Xbox yet, then nows the time. For a low price, not do you get the best next generation gaming system on the market, but you also get two of the best sports games, Top Spin and NCAA Football 2005 to boot. Both of them are Xbox Live ready. Top Spin is considered by many to be the greatest tennis game of all time, even better than Sega's addictive arcade smash 'Virtua Tennis'! I have played it and have to say that it is darn good, and even you dont normally watch or play tennis you'll still enjoy playing it. NCAA Football 2005 is a college football fans dream. It is one of the best EA Sports titles of the year, and is the best NCAA Football title of all time. Many people say its worth the full price alone. Now, the Xbox system is excellent. It is easily the best next generation console on the market. It has a large and excellent library of titles ranging from all genres. It has great RPGs. It also has great sports, action, and other titles as well. Xbox also has the most varied game selection - theres even a yoga game (called Yourself! Fitness) for heck's sake! Xbox is also the best value. It has a hard drive built right in, while if you buy a Playstation 2 (which doesent come with any games like Xbox and doesent nearly have as many good ones) it costs one hundred dollars! Plus, you dont have to waste any hard earned money on memory cards, and Xbox Live is easily the best online service around. Heres this value pack sumed up: Xbox - Great console, great games, great hardware, and a great value.  Top Spin - Best. Tennis game. Ever.  NCAA Football 2005- Best college football game ever, and easily one of the best EA Sports games this year.  Controller S - More natural feeling and comfterable than Playstation 2's Dual Shock 2. Its easily the best controller even made in my personal opinion.  So, nows the time to buy an Xbox. This is a steal for such a great system and two great sports titles.
