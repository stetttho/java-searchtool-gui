 This is a little different from 'Dsyfunction'. Its not as heavy, but it still sounds pretty good. I havent heard 'Tormented' though so I am not sure if this is better than that album. I've heard its heavier than '13 Shades of Grey' though, which doesent really appeal to me very much(though I think 'So Far Away' is a decent song). If you've liked the singles, then you'll probably like this cd. I wouldent consider this a legendary album, but its still a alright one. Three outta five stars isnt the worst you can do, but you can still do better. If you liked Dsyfunction, you will also like this. Also check out '13 Ways to Bleed on Stage' by Cold if you like this and their other albums too.
