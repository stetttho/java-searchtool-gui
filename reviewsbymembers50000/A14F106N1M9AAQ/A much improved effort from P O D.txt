 I didn't really like the last album from P.O.D by the name of 'The Fundamental Elements of Southtown',so I was ready to skip Satellite...Well,I just bought this album in 2003(two years after its original release date year in 2001)and while I am happy I waited for the bonus material,I have to say I have waited too long to pick up this awesome album.This is a big improvement over The Fundamental Elements of Southtown.On that album,most of the songs just sounded bland.But here there is a pretty good varity of different types of songs.Heavy and soft songs,slow and fast songs,even some songs with a punk rock and regea feel to them.I am also happy to say that just about every song is great,too.This album is solid all the way through.The bonus materials are great,too.This new version features a limited edition DVD with some live songs and the making of Satellite.There are also three bonus tracks which are an accustic version of 'Alive',a remix of 'Youth of the Nation' and a Crystal Method Remix of 'Boom'.This album is a must own.Don't overlook it.
