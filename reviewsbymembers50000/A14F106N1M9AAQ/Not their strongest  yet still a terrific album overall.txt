 H.I.M. are quite a great band, with a unique sound and great music manship. It is unfortunate that a huge chunk of their fanbase just listens to it because their sell-out idol Bam Margera does, but  that doesent mean you should overlook them. This is their second United States release ('Love Metal' also just came out this Tuesday and is amazing. I have had the import for quite some time now and it has been constantly in and out of my stereo). 'Deep Shadows & Brilliant Highlights' is not for you if you are just getting into H.I.M. I would start with their most popular, 'Razorblade Romance' (which is easily a five star album), and then thier most accessable, 'Love Metal. Most of the songs are great here, and Valo's voice will send shivers down your spine. His voice sounds even better here than it does on 'Love Metal' (though I heard he was sick when recording that album). So, what knocks this album down a bit? Well, it is admittedly a bit too dull at times for its own good, and its much slower and poppier than their other releases. Still, for any H.I.M. fan, this is a must own. H.I.M. has failed to dissappointment me yet. I cant wait for their next album (even if I have to import it to get it early).
