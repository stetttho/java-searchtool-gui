 NHL Hitz 2003 is my favorite hockey game. I bought it because I wanted a fun arcade style hockey game. Its really, really fun, and it hasent gotten boring. Theres alot of action. There are still some rules and penalties. The worst part of the game is suprisingly the fighting portion. Fighting isnt very bad, its just not very fun. I dont hate though and it can be good sometimes(like when you are playing multliplayer and wanna beat up your friend!). The gameplay is addictive, and I cant stop playing. This would be a fun game to play online. The graphics are good. The solid but short soundtrack in this game features Rob Zombie, Incubus, Hoobastank and Drowning Pool. You can also use a custom soundtrack. If you are looking for some great hockey action, then buy this. Its definitely the most fun i've ever had in a hockey game. It hitz hard!
