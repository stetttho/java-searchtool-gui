 ...I have heard the songs on it. All three of them. Heres what I have got to say about them. 1.Unstable  - Okay at the best. I am not too impressed of it, and I wouldent mind if I never heard it again. Its not the most original song ever, either. 2.Immortal - I first heard this song on the Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance videogame for Xbox. Its decent, but really, I wouldent care if I never heard it again. Thats not a very good thing. 3.Giving In - The best song  here. I dont love it, but I think its alright. I wouldent mind hearing it again, but I wouldent buy an Adema cd over it.
