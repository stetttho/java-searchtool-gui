 I have been wanting to buy this cd for awhile now but it wasent released in the U.S. I really didn't want to order it either for some reason. It was kind of pricey. Well, i'm happy its in the U.S. now. This is a really great cd from one of todays most talented bands. I am a huge CKY fan so I heard of them from the CKY videos. I also own Love Metal by H.I.M but this is an even better album. In fact, its H.I.M's  best album in my opinion! The songs are just really meaningful and deep. The lyrics are excellent and among the best I have ever heard. How could I define H.I.M as? Well, as Valo said, 'Love Metal'. Get this album, its is one of the best I have ever heard.
