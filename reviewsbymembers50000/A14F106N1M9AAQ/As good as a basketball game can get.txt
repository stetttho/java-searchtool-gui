 This game is just too good.NBA Street Volume 2 is as good as a basketball game can get.In my opinion,this is the best basketball game ever made.Its really,really fun and you don't need to be a huge NBA fan to play it.There are old school and new school players and all the official teams.This game is very fun in multiplayer too.EA Sports BIG/NUFX should really consider supporting some of the good Xbox features in the future though,like custom soundtrack support or Xbox Live play.That would be great.Nevertheless,this is still an excellent b-ball game that is true to the game.This is how street ball culture is.If you need a very fun basketball game than you can't go wrong with purchasing this game.Theres not really much to hate about it.
