 I have been a Grand Theft Auto fan since the days of the PSOne. It is one of my favorite gaming series of all time. While Vice City, the most recent in the series, is good, its not quite as groundbreaking and revolutionary as Grand Theft Auto III was. Yeah, the PSOne Grand Theft Auto's introduced the concept, but they were not in 3D and Grand Theft Auto III was. Now that the second Grand Theft Auto is here, you might expect another really great GTA game,right? Well it is. This is a very fun game and is actually an improvement over Grand Theft Auto III. The story is improved and the missions are better than before. But it doesn't feel as fun as it did in Grand Theft Auto III. The graphics also aren't very good. There is a huge soundtrack though and it is very good. Of course you know by now that this game is set in the 1980's. Its in Vice City, a Miami clone. There are very awesome cars and the motorcycles and dirt bikes add a whole lot to the game. But like I said, this awesome game is not revolutionary. Its still worth buying though.
