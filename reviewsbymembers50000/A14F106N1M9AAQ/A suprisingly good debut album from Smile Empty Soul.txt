 I didn't expect a whole lot out of this cd when I bought it. The single, 'Bottom of a Bottle' didn't do much for me. I didn't hate it, it just wasent amazing. I didn't think their other songs would sound much better either. That is, until I bought this. This is a great debut, and one of the best cds of 2003. The song lyrics are all very personal. Some of the songs are darn catchy too, such as 'Radio in a Hole'. I personally don't hate a song on this album which means that is really good. This is a great cd and a suprisingly good one too. I would give this the 'Suprise Hit of the Year' award. Go check it out. I wasent dissapointed.
