 Really, if this year's grammys nominees are some kind of joke, please its not funny. I offically hate the grammys after this stupid line up. Christina Agulara is up for a grammy? All those pop artists are horrible! And what is with the horrible rappers on this years grammys? The rock bands like Fountains of Wayne are stupid too. Just because they had one catchy song doesent mean they should be up for a grammy. And Foutains of Wayne and 50 Cent arent new artists. The people at the grammys are stupid. If Coldplay didnt sell a million copies, they wouldent even be on the stupid grammys either. I hate the grammys. If this garbage continues to sell well and win grammys, then the music industry is dead.
