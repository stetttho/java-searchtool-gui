 I'm committed 2 rock!!! Omigod!!! This is such a kewl cd dudes!!! Or not. It sounds corny and I dont even like the songs on it. Its probably from the creators of that stupid idiotic Now Thats What I Call Garbage series. Buy a real rock music complination instead, or the Freddy VS Jason soundtrack.
