 The Unreal series has been around for many years now, and this is the upcoming sequel to the Xbox hit Unreal Championship. That was among the five best selling Xbox first person shooters ever, along with other titles such as Bungie's Halo and EA Games' 007 Nightfire. It wasent quite perfect though, and the best part about it was arguably playing online, but it was a mildly entertaining frag fest. More could have been done though to revolutionize the aging franchise. However, what I have read and seen on Unreal Championship 2 looks really, really good. You can play in first person or third person view. People who have played an early version of this title have said that third person view is fun, and will be more natural feeling than you might think. So dont be skepticle just yet! This time around, Atari also wont be doing the honors of publishing it. Midway will sell the game this time around, though Epic Games is still handling developement. Not that any of that matters, its just interesting to know. The new guns are wicked cool, and cause massive destruction, while the graphics system has been greatly improved (hopefully the frame rate will be better and there will be absolutely no lag this time around). Although I gave this five stars, this is really not a final review. If you are an Unreal fan, FPS gamer or an avid Xbox Live player, though, pre-order this game today... To be nice, I'll give this five stars.
