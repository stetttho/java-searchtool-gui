 I think the CKY videos are awesome. They are funny and they feature really good music in them. The CKY videos also made me find out about one of my favorite bands, H.I.M. Well anyway, this is the latest CKY video. CKY 4: The Latest & Greatest has many hilarious moments. The whole thing is funny. Is it the greatest CKY yet though? Probably. I enjoyed it more than the rest of them. There are many different scenes and stunts. CKY 4: The Latest & Greatest features music by CKY(the best band ever!), H.I.M and Queens of the Stone Age. Go get this DVD.
