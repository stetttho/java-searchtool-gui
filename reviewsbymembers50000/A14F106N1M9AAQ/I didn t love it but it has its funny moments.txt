 I must admit.This movie was a little funny.However,I would not consider buying it on DVD.It makes a fine rentle,but paying over $20 for this DVD is not a great idea.You probably know the storyline by now,and if you don't,well thats just too bad.The storyline has been done several times in some movies such as 'The Animal' (hmmmm...).Some parts of 'The Hot Chick' were pretty lame while others could be pretty funny.This isn't Rob Schneider's most impressive acting but its not too bad.So overall,its what I said it was.A good rentle,but definitely not worth buying.Unless you warship Rob Schneider  and are his absolute biggest fan in the entire world...
