 I dont listen to much radio or really watch cable television anymore, but when I did a few years ago, I heard their first single "Polomorus". It caught my ears because of the catchy lyrics and fun music. I never did buy the album though. When I first saw this in stores though, I remembered the single and had to buy this. I am happy I did; this is one of modern rock's best albums of the year.  The first single is 'So Cold', and when I first heard it I couldent get into it, but after a few listens I liked it. The rest of the cd is good as well, and there is not a track I dislike. It mixes up radio friendly rock, accoustic and even some nu-metal. Its all dont succesfully, with pretty good lyrics. Although there is a 'Parental Advisory' logo on the cover, dont be too worried, this isnt a vulgar album by any means. There are two different versions of this album avaible: the rare version that contains a live ep and the normal one disc version. Obviously get the Live EP version, because it contains extra exclusive live tracks off their last record. So, since I like this record so much, why aren't I giving it five stars? Well, for one thing, while this is a truly great album, it doesent quite "wow" me. Although it is really good, it wont be remembered as a true classic. Rather, it'll be remembered as one of the best cds of 2004.
