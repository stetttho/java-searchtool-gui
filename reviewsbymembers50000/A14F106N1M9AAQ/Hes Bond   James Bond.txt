 Well,Bond is back and...Better than ever?Well,not exactly,but hes back in a good way.This is a action packed film that most fans of James Bond movies will probably dig.'Die Another Day' is not the best Bond movie,and its far from perfect.Some of the storyline could have been improved.However,like I meantioned,theres alot of action to keep you excited at least.I woulden't recomend buying this movie though.Its more like a rental.Its not a classic - far from it.But what is it then?A decent action movie.So,go ahead and rent this to enjoy it the way it should be enjoyed.Oh yeah,and don't forget the popcorn,okay?
