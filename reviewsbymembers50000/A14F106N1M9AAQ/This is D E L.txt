 I am not really a big fan of this type of music, but Del The Funky Homosapien is just too good at what he does so I couldent pass up this great album.This isn't the mainstream garbage that sounds like trash from rappers like Chingy. This is what real hip hop is. No bling bling here. No bragging. Just straight up excellent hip hop. Del The Funky Homosapien also has some of the best beats of any rapper.Plus, Del the Funky Homosapien is a huge gamer. Theres a song on this album called 'The Proto Culture' and its all about videogaming. I am a big gamer myself so I think its great that Del the Funky Homosapien created a song like that. Del the Funky Homosapien is also Ice Cube's cousin, but this album isn't really gangster rap. Its hip hop with lyrics from the heart. This album might've not sold millions of copies, but it doesen't need to. I am not a huge hip hop fan, but if there were more awesome rappers like Del the Funky Homosapien then I might've been a huge hop hop fan. So go get this album. Its great!
