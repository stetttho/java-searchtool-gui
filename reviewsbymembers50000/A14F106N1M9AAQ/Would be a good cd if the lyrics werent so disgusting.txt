 Justin Timberlake is the best death metal singer of the decade. I saw his odd music videos on MTV. I cant believe they would show them. His sick music videos contain tons of suggestive content, and often contain very violent things in them. I will come back to this review in a minute... I have to throw up thinking about them... I am back. I threw up. Thats not disgusting though. Justin Timberlake's lyrics are. I mean, listen to him. His lyrics paint very violent images in my mind. I had nightmares about them. One of the sickest songs on this album, 'I just want to love you',is about a very sick subject that I cant say because I dont want you to throw up like I did. This album is brilliant though. SICK, yes, but brilliant. Buy it instead of the new Slayer album.
