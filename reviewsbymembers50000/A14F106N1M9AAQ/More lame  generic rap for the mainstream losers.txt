 Why are all these horrible rap albums selling like hot cakes? Mainstream rappers such such as Nelly, 50 Cent, Ja Rule, and this moron Chingy are all examples of how hop hop is dead. You may not have liked older hip hop such as Del The Homosapien, Run DMC, or Public Enemy, but at least they were interesting (and in Del's case, talented) or had a message or meaning to their lyrics of some sort. One look at the cover of this album and you know what you are getting into: treating women like objects and rapping about how hard you are (in an 'I'm so tough' kinda way, mind you), or how rich they are. Worse, people are actually buying this. Either they are purchasing it because A) They are brainwashed fools who will buy anthing MTV  plays, B) they think blasting Chingy through their car window will make them true gangsters or C) They are actually enjoying it! Whatever reason it is, if you like this in any way, shape, or form, and you give it a higher rating than one star, then you are a moron and need to learn what true music is. Why not listen to CKY, In Flames, Malevolent Creation, Rancid, Killswitch Engage, or classic Metallica instead of this utter garbage? You can thank me later. Unless you are some loser. In that case, listen to this and all your lame genric rappers. You deserve each other.
