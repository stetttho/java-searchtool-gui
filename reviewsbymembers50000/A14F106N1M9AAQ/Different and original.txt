 This is a very odd cd.Its not really for the faint of heart,which you might of heard someone else say(hey,its true!).But for those who can listein to it,its very different and...Original!This is not the same old garbage your might hear over the radio every day...And theres something interesting about this cd.Every song is in alphabetical order too.Whens the last time you saw something like that?I really like the sound of this cd and just about every song.The lyrics aren't the greatest,but they are nice and strange.If you wan't something original,then go pick this up.I recomend it.
