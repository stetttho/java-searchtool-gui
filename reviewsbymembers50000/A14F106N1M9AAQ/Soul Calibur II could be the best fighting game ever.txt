 Soul Calibur II is looking really amazing.Some people are even saying that it could be the best fighting game ever...And yeah,it might be because this is going to be a big improvement over the original popular Soul Calibur.The original Soul Calibur was released on Dreamcast and in the arcades.To tell you the truth,I have never played the original Soul Calibur,but people who have played it said it was one of the greatest fighting games of all time. Soul Calibur II is a weapon based fighting game.The awesome weapons make it very unique and exciting.You should be able to unlock new weapons throughout the game.This is a 3D fighting game.Their are a few new charectors that weren't in the original Soul Caliburm,too so that is nothing but good. Soul Calibur II's graphics look like some of the best PS2 has ever seen.Some of the levels have backgrounds that are based on real life locations in places of the world like Japan.The charectors have a good amount of detail,too.So this is also a very good looking game. Each version of Soul Calibur II also has a exclusive charector to it.The PS2 version of Soul Calibur II has Heiachi from the Tekken games(The Xbox version has Spawn and the Gamecube version has Link from the Zelda games).Tekken fans might be happy that hes returning. Expect alot from Soul Calibur II,and get it when it releases.Namco has made some of the best 3D fighters in the past,including Tekken,Soul Bade and the original Soul Calibur,so they can't possibly mess this one up(since Soul Calibur II has recieved alot of possitive feedback and reviews from the Japan,where it was released earlier this year).This will be a must buy.
