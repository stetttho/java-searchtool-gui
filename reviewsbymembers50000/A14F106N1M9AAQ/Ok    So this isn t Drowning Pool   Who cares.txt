 I don't see why everyone is complaining just because this isn't an album by the band Drowning Pool.Its by a band called Rumbledog though and its called Drowning Pool,but you don't have to diss them about that!This album came out before Drowning Pool even released their first so don't diss it.Plus this album doesen't sound THAT bad...So I guess its a ok album.
