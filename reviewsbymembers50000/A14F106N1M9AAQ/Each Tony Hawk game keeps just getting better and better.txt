 Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4 is the best in the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater series so far.The games just keep getting better and better!This game is very addictive and full of depth.The career mode is much different and improved from Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3,with much more stuff to do.There is no more time limit.You have to talk to pedestrians throughout the level and they give you a goal to do.The goals get more and more challenging throughout the whole game.This is also by far the most challenging game in the series yet!The graphics are pretty good too(athough nothing shocking).The levels are very large and theres a great soundtrack featuring artists like the Offspring,N.W.A,The Cult,Gang Starr,and over 30 other aritsts.Theres also a custom soundtrack option too so you can use your own soundtrack.This game controls perfectly too with the Controller S.There are no exclusive Xbox features though,except for the obvious things like improved graphics and custom soundtracks.Plus,theres not even Xbox Live online play!But what is here is very fun and addictive and will keep you entertained for a long time.
