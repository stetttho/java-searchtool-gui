 In Grand Theft Auto clone number one million, you control some gangster guy named Nick Kong who has a love for gorillas (hence his last name, Kong!). Mr. Kong steals cars. He shoots people. Nick Kong also does missions, and steals many ideas from the Grand Theft Auto series. In fact, if GTA was never around, this wouldent be either! Thats how much of a creative game it is! I would reccomend Grand Theft Auto clone number one million to people who liked Grand Theft Auto III, Vice City, and San Andreas and wanted to play a watered down version of those games. Happy playing.
