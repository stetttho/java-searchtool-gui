 This is Finger Eleven's third great release to date. I've liked them for awhile now, and it seems as though they are finally getting airplay. You probably  have heard 'One Thing' on the radio or on television. In their native homeland, Finger Eleven are pretty big(thanks probably goes to their airplay). I think in the future that, right here in the U.S. Finger Eleven will become a very popular band too. The first few times I listened to this, I thought it was not very good, but it shortly grew on me in a week or so. These songs will get stuck in your head. The softest song on here is the accoustic track, 'One Thing'. Not that it means that its bad or anything. I got the limited edition version and it had a free DVD, but its really nothing special. Just like any DVD that comes free with a cd, after viewing it once, you wont care. The cd is great though. I predict big things for Finger Eleven to come.
