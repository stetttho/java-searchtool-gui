 What is so funny about this movie?Nothing really,except one part in the whole movie.ONE part.And they call this a comedy?Bleh.The movie doesen't even have a decent plot and is kinda boring,and some scenes just seem thrown in there for no reason(like the one with Britney Spears...What was that all about?!).So this is a horrible comedy and it has one of the worst storylines in any movie ever made.I mean the storyline is just so bad its hard to believe how some people actually like this movie.And it didn't even end correctly.The DVD features aren't that great either.Don't think about buying this DVD - rent it if you have to.I don't even reccomend renting it.Just skip this movie.
