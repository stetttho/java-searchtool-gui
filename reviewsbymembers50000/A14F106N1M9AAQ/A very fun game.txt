 Harvest Moon:Back to Nature is amazingly fun.Theres tons of stuff to do,and its packed with replay value and months of gameplay.In this game you have to take over you grandfathers farm(your grandfather died).You have great memories of it as a kid and now that you can take over it you have to proove to the villagers around you that you can take care of it good and proove that you can put the farm back into better shape(it was in pretty bad shape after your grandfather died).You can raise all types of farm animals,including cows,sheep,horses and chickens.You can do tons of fun things like fishing too.There are also tons of fun village contests,too.Plus,you can cook,get married and make friends with the villagers.I like the graphics style and the music is great too.Buy this game.Its a must own.
