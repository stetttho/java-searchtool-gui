 Superman The Man of Steel seemed like a super game at first. It controls well, has decent graphics, and has all of Superman's powers. However, I didnt even finish this game, since it got so boring and repetitive. It had great potential, but every misson feels the same, and they all are. They are all basically "go to point a and destroy those robots". And after you destroy those robots in point A, it makes you go to point B,and over again. You can fight villans though. If you are a hardcore fan of Superman comics and stuff, you may enjoy this. But I can say that I didnt. It could have been so good too. Its the most authentic Superman game i've ever played, and probably the best one ever. Thats not saying very much though, considering Superman's dark videogame history...
