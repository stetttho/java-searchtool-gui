 Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne is a good game, but its not a five star one. The first Max Payne was even better than this for a few reasons. One of the reasons is the gameplay was unique at the time, and it was the first game that had bullet time, and argubly the only game that didnt use bullet time as a gimmick (i.e. Dead to Rights and Enter the Matrix). Another one of the reasons was the storyline was better. This time the gameplay just doesent feel as fresh either. Its still a fun game though. I'll tell you about the positives now that i've got the negatives out of the way. The gameplay, while not as fresh, is still fun and this is one of the best action games around. The storyline also has interesting plot twists. The bullet time is still here, and its better than ever. It also has pretty good graphics. Its short, but its good while it lasts. You can probably beat it in a weekend rentle. If you were a fan of the first game(like me), you will enjoy this game. If you werent a fan, you wont like this. Its a good action game, and one of the most intense. Check it out. Play the first one first though.
