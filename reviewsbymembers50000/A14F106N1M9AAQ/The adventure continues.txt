 I really enjoyed the excellent first One Piece manga, so of course I had to read this one! Where the story left off is continued here, and theres even more action than before. This is a very fun book to read, and its one of the best manga series of all time. Its sold over thirty million copies in Japan! I cant wait to read part three of this awesome manga. Read this, but read part one first.
