 The Amazing Jeckel Brothers by the Insane Clown Posse is a suprisingly good cd.Most of the songs are good and have some sort of meaning to them and ICP express their meaning real good.This isn't total rap.Theres some rock roots mixed it with it.Shaggy 2 Dope has a cool voice on this cd.I also like the cover of it and this cd comes in a red jewl case.This isn't ICP's best work though,but its some of their best.The Amazing Jeckel Brothers is worth buying.So yeah...Come and withness the light my friend...Of...THE AMAZING JECKEL BROTHERS!!!!
