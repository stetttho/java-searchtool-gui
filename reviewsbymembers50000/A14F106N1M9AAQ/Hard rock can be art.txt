 When I bought this album I didnt get what I thought I was getting into. For awhile I was highly dissappointed listening to it, and to be honest I didnt like it to much. I gave 'The Art of Rebellion' some time though, and it grew on me. The lyrics can be a bit corny and annoying some of the time though, and that brings it down a half point - from a perfect five to a 4.5. Thats still really great, and perfect albums that truly warrent five stars are really far in between for me though. For anyone who wants an album they can listen to years for now (unlike those whiny emo bands who will be gone after the fad wears off), then pick up this album. You cant stop the run away emotions in me, you know... Never mind. Buy the album and you will know what I'm talking about.
