 Fall Out Boy is just another one of those stupid, unoriginal, boring, whiney emo bands that those fruity kids seem to love these days. When will you get tired of this? If you want a great modern rock album, then look no further than 'An Answer Can be Found' by CKY, or try a Malevolent Creation or Brujeria album. They're great bands with great musisians who dont make music to be part of the trend or for money, but because of the MUSIC. Skip this and any other emo filth,please.
