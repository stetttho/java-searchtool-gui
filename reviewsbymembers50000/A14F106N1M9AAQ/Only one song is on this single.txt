 Usually singles have at least three tracks. The three tracks usually include the original track, a remix and a new song. This only has the song Megalomaniac. I own this single, and the good thing about it is that its actually a good song, and the new Incubus album isnt in stores yet. So if you love this song, this is the only way to go till its released in Febuary. But beware, theres only that one song. Its not very expensive though. I think that their new album will be good. This track rocks and it shows alot of promise for it. My favorite Incubus cd so far is Make Yourself. That is a pretty good cd. And their new one is likely to be good too.
