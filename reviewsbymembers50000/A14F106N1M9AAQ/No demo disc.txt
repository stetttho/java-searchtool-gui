 I wouldent reccomend buying this off Amazon because there is no demo disc. The deom disc is one of the best parts of the magazine and its not included here. There are new playable demos of the hottest new Xbox games on the disc, downloadable content and other cool stuff, yet you dont get it here. Anyway, the actual magazine info is good too. This is the offical source. The editors don't have really anything to do with Microsoft though. The features in this mag are the cover feature, reviews, previews,letters, Q&A, Xbox rumors, and maybe some other stuff too. The demo disc isnt the full part of the mag, and actual magazine is good. But you would want the demo. Who doesent want to play the games?
