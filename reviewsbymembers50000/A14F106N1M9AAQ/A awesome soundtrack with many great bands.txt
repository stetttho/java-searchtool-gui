 I am a CKY fan, plus I liked most of the bands on here, so I bought this cd. I think its a terrific soundtrack. Each song stands out, and theres only one song that I dont really love. This cd is nearly perfect. It has many different types of rock on here including hard rock and death metal. New and old bands are on here from New Order and Iggy & The Stooges to Gnar Kill and Unanimated. I listen to this cd nearly every day, because  I love these tunes! Plus it has the best band ever, CKY on here! H.I.M. is also on here too(their cd 'Love Says No' is going to be released March 23,2004). The Haggard soundtrack is one of the best soundtracks ever. With mostly all great songs, and a good amount of varierty, this is a must buy. So buy it!
