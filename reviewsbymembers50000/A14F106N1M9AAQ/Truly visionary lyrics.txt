 "I'm not okaaaaaaaaaaay! I'm not okaaaaaay yaaaaaaa yaaaaaaay you wear me down!". That is proof that whoever writes this bands stuff is a genius, and that My Chemical Romance is not just another whiney emo band. Actually, non of that is true. Just think of the opposite of all that and you will know what My Chemical Romance truly is: another boring, generic, whiney emo band with awful lyrics and horrible musicians. Some of the song titles even made me laugh, but I'm not even going to get into that. If you like this band, then you are probably some trendy loser with a pimply face full of achney and a girly, voice that sounds like you're in the middle of puberty. Oops, your voice cracked! Well, maybe that wouldent be so bad if we didnt have so many popular singers today who, in fact, fit that description. Before you give me a 'non helpful' vote, try listening to real music that will matter in ten years. I suggest these following bands: Malevolent Creation, CKY, Amorphis, Unanimated, Pennywise, or Sepultura. They're much better than this whiney garbage.
