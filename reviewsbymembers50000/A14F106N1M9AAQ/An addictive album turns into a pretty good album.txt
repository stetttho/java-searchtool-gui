 Back in 2001,  when I first bought 'Toxicity', I listened to it alot. It was an addictive hard rock album that lasted for a few months. After that period of time though, while its still a good, enjoyable album, it gets kind of old, and the songs are just too overplayed everywhere. This album also marked a good time in my life as well, so it means alot to me. If you are in for a good mainstream hard rock, head banging, mosh pitting time, then get this. If you want a classic that you can listen to twenty years from now, maybe you should look else where, but this is just too good of a cd to actually miss, so I would suggest that you check it out. Now, I'll tell you more about the album. 'Toxicity' starts with the loud and heavy 'Prison Song', and throughout the album its like being in a tornado of rock. Limited edition versions of this album are also available (The covers are red and blue) if you can find them. They were fairly easy to obtain three years ago, but they can prove to be hard to get today.
