 Song wise, this is a great cd. This has all of the mainstream Sublime radio hits, and they're pretty darn good. Overall though, this could have been so much more. Yet, this is 20th Centure Masters were talking about. The vast majority of the 20th Century Masters cds are under ten songs, and dont do the artists any justice, so I really wouldent reccomend buying these unless you just want a few radio hits. I hope one day we get a proper Sublime collection, though. More like Pure Cult (The Cult's greatest hits cd) or even like '....And Love Said No' by Finnish rockers H.I.M. Even if you're a new Sublime fan, their self titled would be much better if you are just getting into them. Heck, that has more than half of the songs on here and only costs a few extra bucks. You'll thank me later.
