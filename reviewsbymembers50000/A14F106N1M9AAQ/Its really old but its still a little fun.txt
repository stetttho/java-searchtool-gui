 720 is a really old game that has appeared on NES and in the arcades.This version is just like those ones,but for a Game Boy Color game,it still looks alright in the visial department.Sometimes its a little hard and a little confusing for begginers,but once you get the hang of it you will probably have some fun with it.After awhile it can get a little boring,though.
