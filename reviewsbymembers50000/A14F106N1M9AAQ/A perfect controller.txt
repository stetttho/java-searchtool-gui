 My favorite controller of all time is this amazingly great Xbox Controller S.I couldent find anything wrong with it.And yes,I think its even better than the Dual Shock 2 (and much improved over that original Xbox controller that was designed just for NBA players hands).Yes,the Dual Shock 2 was very good,but it wasen't really that great for FPS.This great Controller S works perfect with every type of game on any genre. This controller is greatly designed too.Its also features the best quality of any controller,ever...And I mean that when I say it.Most controllers can break easily if you throw them against something(like the PS2 Dual Shock 2 and Super Nintendo ones)but this one wont because the quality is so good. It also fits well in just about anyones hands(but the original will fit better in your hands if you are a NBA player).Its very comfterable,too.So this is the best controller ever made.Don't even think about getting the original Xbox controller - defiantly get this instead at all costs.
