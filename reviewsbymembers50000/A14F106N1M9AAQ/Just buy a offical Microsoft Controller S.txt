 I dont own this stupid third party controller, but why would I need to? Third party controllers never hold up well and they are never near the quality of the first party controllers. It doesent even seem shaped as good as the offical Microsoft controller-s, and it may have that nasty feel that some third party controllers have. Want to know why this is cheap? Its because its probably horrible. Every one I know who had to deal with a third party controller never liked it. So just dont buy it!
