 This might just be the worst cd of the year. I would say that Britney Spears is a horrible musician but I really woulden't consider her a musician at all. Her music is so bad its pitful. Pop music is the worst type of music in the world. I mean where is the talent? You might be thinking "Well, they do perform live for their fans and she sings her heart out. That is where the talent is!". Well if you were thinking that then you are really wrong. Why is that? Its because she lip sings on stage! That is just sad. I'm sorry, but lip singing is just proof that you have absolutely not talent to sing to your fans. That all prooves that you don't really care about your fans your much. But Britney Spear's fans must not be very old or intelligent because they keep buying her garbage. This makes me sick!!! So don't support bad music by buying this. Unless you wan't to get more garbage from this horrible errr... not musician but... i'll just say this pop person.
