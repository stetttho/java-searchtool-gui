 This is one of the greatest albums of all time by the one and only...Sublime.This is a true classic,and nearly every single song is good!It never gets old either and theres over seventeen really great songs!So theres not much to say about this other than it is a must buy.In my opinion this is the best album that Sublime has ever put out.Even though most of them are good without a doubt,this is my personal favorite from them.
