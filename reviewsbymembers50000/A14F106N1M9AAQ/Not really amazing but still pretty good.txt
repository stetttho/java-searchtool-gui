 Many people think that this album is amazing.I really don't,even though Linkin Park is good band.I'm going to review each song on this album: 1.Papercut- A good start for this album. 2.One Step Closer- This is Linkin Park's first single and arguably the best song on this album.A great song. 3.With You- An enjoyable song. 4.Points of Authority - One of the best songs on this album.Good stuff. 5.Crawling- Eh,I don't like it that much. 6.Runaway- Not half bad. 7.By Myself- I kinda dug this song. 8.In the End- Not bad.I like it. 9.A Place for My Head - I like this song.Its pretty tight. 10.Forgotten- Your average Linkin Park song. 11.Cure for the Itch- Not your average Linkin Park song. 12.Pushing Me Away - A pretty good song and a great way to end the album. I kinda dug this album,but like I said before,its not exactly amazing.Still,this is a pretty good album,and I would give it a 3.5 if  could.
