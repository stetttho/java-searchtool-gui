 Since their debut of 'Hybrid Theory' way back in 2000, I have never really considered Linkin Park a good band. Although at the time many people were calling them simple 'Limp Bizkit' rip-offs, they were more than that. But is that really saying much? This is Limp Bizkit were talking about, and I dont really need to explain to you how I feel about them (in short: they're awful). Well, even though their debut 'Hybrid Theory' wasent too great, it had some interesting elements, and they were somewhat better than most of the lame, generic nu-metal bands at that time period. I gave 'Meteora' a chance anyway, even after not liking 'Hybrid Theory' or 'Reanimation' too much, because I thought they had some potentential, and because countless people reccomended this album to me. Well, its not much of an improvement, and I think the reviews who say that this is the "Best cd ever!1!1!1!" dont know too much about music, and need to start listening to more than what MTV and their local radio stations play. 'Meteora' isn't horrible by any means, but Linkin Park have a long, long way to go before being considered truly great musisians. Some songs on here are decent, but the lyrics aren't too great, and while the musicmanshiop is decent, its really amateur stuff, and I have heard a million times better than this. If you're a brain washed MTV addict who listens to eveything they tell you, then buy this album, log on to Amazon, and write a five star review saying how it is the greatest album of all time and how Linkin Park is the best rock band ever. Ifi you're a free thinker who knows what quality music is, skip this, and listen to something like Malevolent Creation or CKY instead (and dont watch that terrible Viva La Bam show). You can thank me later. This is just a horribly mediocore album from a band that needs alot of work.
