 Insane Clown Posse has made some good albums, such as The Great Milenko and the Amazing Jeckel Brothers, but this one is pretty bad. Its boring,odd, and dull. I dont love really any of the songs, and some of the subject matter is even disturbing(listen to 'Who Asked You'). I only had two laughs during this cd, and they werent even huge ones. I dont hate ICP, like I said, I just hate this cd. I would reccomend the Great Milenko instead. Even the Wraith Shangri La is better than this garbage. This is probably the worst Insane Clown Posse album. Even juggalos might want to buy at their own risk cause you might not like this one either.
