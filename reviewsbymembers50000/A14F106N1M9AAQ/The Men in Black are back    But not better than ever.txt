 I give Men in Black II a score of 2.5 stars out of 5. Well,the men in black are back,but not better than ever.This movie isn't that great.Its slightly entertaining though,and some parts are sort of funny.The storyline is not very great though which means the movie isnt that great.Its not a total disaster but its far from being good.If you don't see Men in Black II your not going to miss anything special but if you do see it then you might have a slighty decent time watching it.I would say you should rent it.Its not worth buying though.Oh yeah,and one more thing,Johnny Knoxville is in this movie.Just wanted to tell you that.
