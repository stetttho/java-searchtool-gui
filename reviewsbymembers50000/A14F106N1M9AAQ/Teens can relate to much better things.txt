 Sorry folks, but I just cant help myself here. I tried painfully, month after month, to avoid giving a one star review to a Simple Plan  cd, despite how annoying they were. Well, they have finally pushed me to the limit. The song "Welcome To My Life", is one of the worst, feel sorry for me because I'm soooo alone in this huge world, songs I have ever heard. The lyrics are terrible, and irritating. Listening to it was embarrasing, and I find it stupid that today's youth and teens listen to that garbage. At least in death metal, if you dont like the lyrics, the hardcore, brutal music makes up for it. It doesent here, because this is just another cleverly marketed boy band with guitars who can barely play their instruments. I doubt these little pop punkers went through anything so bad that they have to write a song about it. Its just the "in" thing to write a song complaining about nothing or their stupid little girlfriend leaving them (also heard in Dashboard Confessional; another awful band). You may say this is something for teens to relate to, but if it is, then they are not very mature and that saddens me. Go pick up a Suicidal Tendencies album instead of this offensive filth.
