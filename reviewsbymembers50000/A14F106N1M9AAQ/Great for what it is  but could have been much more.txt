 I'm a very big Street Fighter fan. When I first heard about Street Fighter Anniversary Collection, I was stoked. You should take the word 'Collection' in the title with a grain of salt though. This is a half baked collection, consisting of really just two games. The two games included here are top notch classics, though. Hyper Street Fighter II: The Anniversary Edition (confusing enough?) is a cool little collection of all the Street Fighter II games in one. However, they're all basically the same with some minor differences, and you'll notice that some of the fun little features found in the original Street Fighter II games, such as the car and brick smashing stages, are absent. Why, Capcom, why? Also, why cant you play these games seperately? And is it just me, or is Blanka's A.I. annoyingly cheap? Still, Hyper Street Fighter II: The Anniversary Edition is great fun, and even more enjoyable if you have a friend to play with you.            The real meat in this "collection"  is the vastly underrated Street Fighter III: Third Strike. Although the first two Street Fighter III games werent included (SF III and Double Impact - again, why, Capcom, why? Are you going to milk us for all us gamers are worth? I guess so). Third Strike is a must play for any hardcore fighting fan, although the charecters aren't as good as the original SF II cast. The graphics are also pretty good for a 2D fighter - its a visual whirlwhind of 2D animation. That is what makes this worth owning.         Although this could have been so much more, its a great buy. You may rather want to purchase the Xbox version instead, though, since that includes online play. Now where is Street Fighter Alpha Collection?
