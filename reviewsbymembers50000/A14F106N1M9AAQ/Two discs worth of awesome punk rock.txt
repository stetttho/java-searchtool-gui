 This was my first Punk-O-Rama cd. I bought it because it was a punk cd with some of my favorite punk bands, it was cheap, and it was two discs long. I wasent dissapointed in buying this. Most of the songs are really good. There are a few ok ones, but I mainly skip those and listein to the awesome rockin' ones! My favorite songs on this cd are:        Dropkick Murphys - Gonna Be A Blackout        Rancid  - As Wicked        Bouncing Souls - New Day        Bad Religion - Who We Are        TransPlants - Quick Death         NOFX - The Idiots are Taking Over
