 You thought Limp Bizkit couldent get any worse than this,eh?Well you thought wrong then.This is by far their worst.Its just a cd full of remixes by artists like P.Diddy...And the songs sound worse than the originals.Plus,why are there SIX remixes of 'My way'?No one needs that.Just stay away from this album.
