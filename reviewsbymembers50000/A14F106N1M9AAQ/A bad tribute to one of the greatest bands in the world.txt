 Rage Against the Machine are an awesome band. They are a very powerful band, with powerful lyrics and a powerful sound.  So you would think they might get a good tribute, right? Nope, they don't. What they get is a horrible tribute by ameteurs(who the hell are the 'Renegadez of Funk?'). They are some rock band. But why don't they mix up different styles of music to Rage Against the Machine songs? Like some punk, rap... Anything that will be a little interesting that this garbage. Some of the songs on here are not even Rage Against the Machine songs. Yeah, they were on the 'Renegades' album, but those were only covers of songs from Rage Against the Machine's favorite artists and songs. Maybe if a LOT more effort was put into this it would be worth buying... or at least useful. Instead, its a worthless tribute that will be forgotten in time(even though its practically forgotten now...).
