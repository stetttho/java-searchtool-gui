 While some people may be skepicle about buying this, dont be. Pick it up today. Its an overlooked gem. Days of the New have come a long, long way from their debut album back in 1997. Back then, critics just wrote them off as another Alice in Chains clone trying to copy the Seattle grunge style. Its a real shame too. Many songs on this album are just different from everything else rock, and the lyrics show real emotion. This is like the journal or blog of Travis Meeks (the lead singer). While the album Days of the New II was highly experimentlal, and the first was just decent, but not highly original, rock, Days of the New III takes it all, perfects what they have been trying to do all along while adding a fresh new sound to it. It all works out here. By listening to this, you can tell Travis Meeks was a perfectionist, and this was the bands last album. The rest of the group just couldent get along with the lead singer and went on the form the unoriginal, generic rock band Tantric, which in my opinion is highly dissapointing. All in all, a great album. I wish I could hear more from them. Although this is about perfect, they had even more potential, and more experiments to go. This will do for now, though.
