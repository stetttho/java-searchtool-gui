 When I first bought this album, I thought it would be a new type of food product. I thought it was going to be a pack of chocolatate starfish with some hot dog flavored water to wash it down. Well, I was slightly dissapointed because I didn't get what I wanted. I mean, Limp Bizkits '3 Doller Bill Y'all and Significant Other' were better than this! For some reason though, I didn't confuse those albums with food products. Maybe it was because they had way better name for the titles of their albums. I mean, why kinda name is Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water?! Limp Bizkit shouldent confuse us like that! This album is kind of boring too. Theres not many good songs here. Even some songs that are supposed to be serious (like "Boiler") have some silly lyrics like "No eating no sleeping just giving into you and i'm dumb". Why are you gonna starve yourself out, Fred, when you can eat chocolate starfish and drink hotdog flavored water? I just don't undertstand. My favorite song on this album is 'Hold On'. This was very dissapointing. Buyers beware: this product might not be what your looking for. Get it expecting a not so great Limp Bizkit album. Don't get it looking for chocolate starfish and hot dog flavored water. Hey, at least I know why they don't sell it in super markets...
