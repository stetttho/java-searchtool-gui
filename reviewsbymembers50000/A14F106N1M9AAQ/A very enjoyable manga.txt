 This was the first One Piece manga I have read. I started here cause' its the first in the series. It is excellent. I couldent put it down till  I finished it. It is exciting and creative, and has a good story. Theres action, theres adventure, and theres excitement. The animation is also top notch. Its over two hundred pages long. Overall, its one of the best mangas around.
