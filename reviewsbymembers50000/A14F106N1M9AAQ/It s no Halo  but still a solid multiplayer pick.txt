 Unreal Championchip was looking to be a wicked awesome game in the previews of gaming mags I read. Its not really amazing though. I still think its a decent shooter. Its not as good as Halo(what is?), but it has some great features that Halo doesent have. You can play with bots on multiplayer maps, modes and levels. Playing with real people is still more enjoyable, but if non of your friends or over or you are a complete loser or hermit, you'll still like. Single player is just alright. The story line is utter garbage. Some balony thrown together stuff about how you have to fight for your freedom and bla bla bla. Unreal games aren't about the story; they're about the action, and Championchip has it. Its one of the best Unreal games ever made. So why am I only giving it three stars(I'm actually giving it a 3.5 but its stil not a 4 you know)? Thats the single player score. As a multiplayer or Xbox Live online title, its great. As an offline, its not nearly as good. Try it if you want a frag fest. If you're skepticle, rent it first.
