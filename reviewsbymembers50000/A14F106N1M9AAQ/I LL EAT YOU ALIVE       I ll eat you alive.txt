 Haha! Wan't a nice, tasty meal in the morning, afternoon or at night? Well, this song will help you decide which to eat, which is EAT YOU ALIVE!!!!!!! Mmmmmmm tasty!!! Nah i'm just playing around (although I do like eating...). I think that this isn't a great song and Limp Bizkit'z 'Chocolate Starfish and the Hotdog Flavored Water' was really flawed. It was not very good. 3 Dolla Bill Y'all and Significant Other were much better. 'Results May Vary', their new album is now out but I don't know if its good or not. I probably won't buy it though.
