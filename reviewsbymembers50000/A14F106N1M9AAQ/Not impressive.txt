 The Yeah Yeah Yeahs don't impress me. I bought this cd because it was cheap, and I thought it would sound like the D4 but with a female lead singer. Well, the lyrics arent nearly as good as the D4s, and I wouldent really say the D4s had the best lyrics in the world. It seemes like anyone could've wrote this album, and some of it is irritating, especially when the lead singer says noises like 'tick' and 'chop' a bunch of times in a row. Musically, the band doesent show that great of musicmanship. The bass and guitars, as well as the drumming, arent anything special. I have heard it plenty of times, but much better. This band has alot of energy though, but I dont really like listening to this cd that much. I dont really like a whole lot about it. If you consider this punk, theres much better punk avaible, like the Distillers, Rancid, among many others. Take caution buying this.
