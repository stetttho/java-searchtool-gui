 This is not my favorite from Cold, but thats not a bad thing since all of their albums are great. This is still a good debut, and it earns a solid four stars. I would reccomend buying '13 Ways to Bleed on Stage' first though and then 'Year of the Spider' and than this. Each Cold cd has their own sound. This is the heaviest Cold album. Its not hardcore like a death metal album, but its still hard. There are accustic songs on here too like 'Strip Her Down'. Some of the lyrics are sad and depressing. They are also angry. Another thing on the accustic songs. I dont like them as much as the none accustic songs, but they are still decent and not bad. Give em' a listen. I think that this is a pretty good cd. Its not the best Cold album, but still a good album.
