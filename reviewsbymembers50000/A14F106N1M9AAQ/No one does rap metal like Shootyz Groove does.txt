 'High Definition' by Shootyz Groove is an incredible album.It totally blew me away!This is one of the few albums were every single song on it is really good.From High Defininions explosive begining to its awesome ending,its never boring at all.Instead of filling their albums with vulgar lyrics and trying hard to be offensive like some other rap metal bands,Shootyz Groove has intelligent and thoughtful lyrics.This album has has some good songs to chill to too,like "Blow Your Top".There is also a message behind this album.Am I going to tell you what the message is?No,I am not going to tell you.Listein to it yourself and figure out what it is.But anyway,this is an absolute must own album.It also takes some getting used to,but its worth the time getting to know.Go out and buy this album.Its one of my favorite cds ever.
