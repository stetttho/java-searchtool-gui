 Aside from Halo 2 on Xbox, one of the most talked about games thats going to be released this fall is Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. Many new features have been added from previous games in the series. Its going to be a much larger game. You're not just stuck in some small cities, you've got a much bigger area to explore. The graphics look improved from what I've seen in screen shots, and I doubt they're will be any pop in, because for a next generation game, pop in would be pathetic this far into PS2's lifespan. You can steal new vehicles, including trackters, and my friend told me he saw a screen shot of a guy mowing a lawn. You have to eat in this game to keep up, but, like in real life, if you eat too many fatty foods like donuts and you dont exercise it off, then you're charecter, Carl, will become a fat guy. This game will be set in a ghetto type area in California. Early rumors said that the next Grand Theft Auto would be set in Las Vegas, but those were false... its set in California (that would have been cool, though). In the past four Grand Theft Auto titles, it was annoying how you couldent swim. You could rob a store, you can steal a car, but you couldent swim. Well, this time, like in the recently released (and dumbly titled) "Driv3r", you can now swim. Woo hoo! If Rockstar North (previously DMA (Doesent Mean Anything) Design Games) can add exciting missions and enough new gameplay to keep this fresh and fans happy, then it'll have yet another hit on its hands. This is not a final review.
