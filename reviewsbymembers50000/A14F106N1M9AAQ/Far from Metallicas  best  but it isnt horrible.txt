 It seems like 'St. Anger' is hated by many people(on this site at least). Its not Metallicas' best album. Most of their others are much better than this(except for ones like 'Load' and 'Reload'). Yeah, so its not classic material. I still think some of its pretty good. You can headbang to this, and rock out(or something like that). Some of the lyrics are decent. The actual recording quality here isnt that great though. Its especially noticable on headphones. This album should have been worked on more. It needs to be remastered, despite that its not very old yet. Its rought around the edges, but its enjoyable to listen to sometimes. Its not classic material though.
