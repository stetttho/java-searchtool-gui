 'A Crow Left of the Murder' may have only taken five weeks to complete in the studio, but it sounds so good, you wont even notice it. I was actually kind of suprised by this album. I didnt expect it to be this good. You may have read some negative reviews saying stuff like 'Its dissapointing' or 'Its no 'Make Yourself'. Its NOT dissapointing. Its also not just another Make Yourself, no, its its own record. The first two times I listened to it I didnt think it was very amazing. But around the third time, I thought it was really good. Plus, you can even plant a tree in the Incubus garden. Incubus is growing enough trees to replace all the trees they used by creating this album. It tells you how to plant a tree and the info in the booklet. This is also one of the rare cds where the free DVD included is actually good. I like all the features on the DVD. I would reccomend that Incubus fans buy this cd. Enjoy Incubus!
