 CKY Volume 1 is a really great album that never gets old.I never get tired of listeining to all of these wonderful songs,and this is hard rock at its best for sure.Every song is good on here.Yep,I like every single song on here and I like  CKY's guitars.CKY is a very talented band and this is a sweet album.And if you have seen any of the awesome CKY videos(shame on you if you havent ;-) But seriously,go check em out)then you have likely heard some of the excellent songs from this great album.You should also check out music by H.I.M and CKY's other great albums.A must own.
