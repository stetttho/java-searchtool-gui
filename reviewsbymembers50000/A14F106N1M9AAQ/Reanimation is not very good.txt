 I seriously dislike this album.Maybe its because I am not very big into this type of music on Reanimation,who knows.But all I know is that this isn't really good.Almost everything on here is a remix,and I prefer new work than just remixes.The new songs aren't that great,either.I'm not a Linkin Park hater- far from one.I thought 'Hybrid Theory' was pretty good but this is just garbage.Don't waste any money on this.
