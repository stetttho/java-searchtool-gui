 Halo is a awesome game,and a definite must own for any Xbox gamer.This is one of the best games ever,on any system.This is also possibly the best FPS of all time,too.I doubt that any FPS could top it except for Halo 2,which is going to be the ultimate FPS of all time.The gameplay in Halo is extremely awesome and the multiplayer matches are addictive.It also has perfect controls.I had no problem with the controls at all.Every thing handles fine,from the weapons to the vehicles.The graphics are also some of the best the genre has seen.Halo 2 is going to look even better,but for now these graphics are amazingly good.I think the music is great too.This all comes down to a must have game.Its perfect.
