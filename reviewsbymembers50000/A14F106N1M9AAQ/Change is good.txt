 I like how (hed) Planet Earth is changing around their sound alot on each album.Some bands just do the same formula over and over again and it gets boring (I'm not going to name any bands). Their last truly great album, 'Broke' had alot of rap and rock mixed together and was rap metal done right.'Blackout' is mostly just "alternative rock done right",and its solid all the way through.Some songs have lyrics that are medicore though,but the good outweighs the bad on this one.Also,while its a change for (hed) Planet Earth,its not exactly groundbreaking.This is still a very good efford from (hed) Planet Earth and I look foward from hearing more of them in the future.
