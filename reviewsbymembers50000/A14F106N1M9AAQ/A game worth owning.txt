 Max Payne is a man with nothing to loose, and with his mind set on revenge... Really, this is a great game! I enjoyed it from beggining to the end. This game features bullet time and its not just a cool feature. It helps you out during the game and is essential to your success. Max Payne also has many different types of weapons including grenades, guns and a baseball bat. The story isn't really amazing but the main focus here isn't on the story. Its on the action, baby! This game has plenty of action. The storyline isnt all that bad and Max Payne faces some stunning revelations in it. The length is under fifteen hours, but that isn't too bad considering the price of Max Payne. You can get it for under $20 and considering DVD's cost as much as that and they are usually only about two hours, its a good value. So go pick up this awesome game.
