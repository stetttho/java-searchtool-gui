 I enjoyed this great movie. I usually enjoy the movies that Vin Diesel stars in ( like xXx and the Fast and the Furious). All those movies were great and this is no exception either. 'A Man Apart' also has a storyline that has more heart than those other movies. The storyline is also more enjoyable and much deeper than before. Even if you didn't like the other movies Vin Diesel was in and just dismissed him as a strong bald guy who stars in heartless action movies, this is different from those. There is still action and stuff, but its much much deeper. Check out this great movie sometime soon and be sure not to miss it.
