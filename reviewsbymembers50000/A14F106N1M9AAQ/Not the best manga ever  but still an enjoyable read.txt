 I havent played the .hack PS2 games, but I wanted to read this because it seemed interesting. Its not very long, and its not the best ever, but I enjoyed it and I think its a good read for manga fans. Its interesting. In the beggining I thought it might be a confusing book, but it ended up non confusing in the late beggening and in the rest of the story. Its a little short and it ended before I expected it to, but it makes up for that with its great humor, action and style.
