 I don't see whats wrong with this album.Its very good.Most of the songs are great.I don't own Infest,but I heard that there was alot of rapping on there and on here they canned it.Thats a good thing.I don't wan't to hear 'The artist formely known as Dick' rap alot on here(the only song that he raps a little on is the single, "She Loves Me Not").Yeah,they are kinda mainstream...But they are still very good.Yes,I would recomend this album if your a rock music fan(and try to get this limited edition version,too because the extra tracks are awesome!).So,go for it.
