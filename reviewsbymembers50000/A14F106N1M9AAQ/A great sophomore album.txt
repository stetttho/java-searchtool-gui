 Finger Eleven is three albums in their career right now, and they have yet to dissapoint. This is my favorite from them. Its dark, but if you dont like evil stuff, dont be worried! This album isn't like Cradle of Filth or Dimmu Borgir or anything. If the first album you heard from them was their self-titled release "Finger Eleven" then, while this a bit different and, in a way, darker, its not like you wont notice its them. The songs are also very catchy with good lyrics, and even though they're popular in their native homeland of Canada, it still sounds much better than most of tonights generic rock clogging up radio and MTV *shudder*. I don't hate or find a single song on here boring or annoying or just plain stupid. Hopefully they'll become bigger in the United States and other countries, but they're doing decently here; and their most recent single "One Thing" is getting alot of air play. This album is short but sweet and a great record to have. So go off and get it.
