 I wasen't a huge fan of Slipknot's first major label album (I'm pretty sure they had cds released before that one). I thought it was decent, but I've heard much better. It left plenty of room for improvement, but at least it was entertaining. Their follow-up, 'Iowa', is just a total disaster, from start to finish. In fact, the only song on here that is even listenable is the pretty good 'Left Behind', which is the only reason I'd ever pop this into my cd player agian. It all sounds like a big mess. I can never listen to it through all the way at one time because its so boring and unoriginal that I skipped each track. I must admit that the cover design with the holigraphic silver goat is pretty damn cool looking, but this is a review for a cd, not an album's cover. Its hard to believe this crap sold so well, and it didnt deserve those great sales. I still plan on buying the new Special Edition of 'Volume 3', though, since I heard it was much improved. 'Iowa' is so awful that it makes the debut seem like a classic.
