 I think that Past,Present & Future by Rob Zombie is a really great cd, and I also think that Rob Zombie is one of todays greatest musicians! All of his songs sound awesome. Usually I don't really like a cd a real lot until I listein to it a few times. But this is one of the few cds I liked alot the first time I listeined to it! Yes, 'Past,Present & Future' is that darn good! Like I meantioned before, all of his songs sound awesome and they all have a nice dark feeling. The first song doesen't really set the mood for the whole cd, but its great nontheless. Mostly everything is good here. In fact,probably everything is good here! This even came with a free bonus DVD too with some music videos on it.That was a nice little extra. I highly recomend that you buy this terrific cd by Rob Zombie.
