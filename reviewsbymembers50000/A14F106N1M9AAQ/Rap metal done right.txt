 This is actually good rap metal.I am not a huge fan of rap metal,but I did enjoy this.If you are a fan of rock music,you should still give this a chance even if you are not a huge rap metal fan.I am going to give you some information on the songs: 1.Killing Time - Eh,its ok.At first I really didn't like it that much,and while I still think its probably one of the weaker songs on this ablum,it has grown on me a little bit. 2.Waiting to Die - This is a awesome song!This is one of the best songs on the whole album,and the intro of it starts out in a cool way. 3.Feel Good - This song features members of System of a Down and Kittie.I have mixed feelings on this song.While I think its a ok song,some of it just isn't that great. 4.Bartender - Bartender is the single.You have most likely heard it.I think its a pretty good song,one of the good parts of this album. 5.Crazy Legs - Theres alot of rap in this song.Its not bad at all though. 6.Pac Bell - Sometimes I think its good,sometimes I don't...It depends on which mood i'm in to enjoy this song.And thats that. 7.I Got You - A very great song.Sounds awesome.Blast it on your speakers with the volume all the way up,the way its meant to be played. 8.Boom(How You Like That?)- Its alright. 9.Swan Dive - A good song.Its nothing but good.Good,good good.Very good.Even better than good.Good,good good.So now you know its good. 10.Stevie - Its all good... 11.Jesus - Not bad...So its good... 12.Meadow - The other single.A good way to end this great rap metal album.Not the hardest rock track,and theres not alot of rapping on this one.Plus,theres the phone call at the end of it. So get this if you like rock or rap metal.
