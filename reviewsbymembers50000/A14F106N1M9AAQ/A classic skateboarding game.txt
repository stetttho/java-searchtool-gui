 Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 is one of the best skateboarding games ever made.Its just totally amazing and addictive...Plus its always hella fun.The controls are perfect and its easy to pick up and play.The graphics are also nice.I think the soundtrack is pretty good,it has some artists like CKY,Alien Ant Farm,Redman,Del The Funky Homosapien,Motorhead,House of Pain and more.Theres also some incredible new tricks that were not in the previous Tony Hawk's Pro Skater games.To top it off,theres really great multiplayer modes and online play to boot.At its great price,theres no reason why you shouldent own this fantastic skateboarding game.
