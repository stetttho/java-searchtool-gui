 I really don't care for Smash Mouths new sound. They are probably making more money now from all the pop fans but this is how they should have stayed. Anyway, this is a pretty good album. Its not incredible but its fun to listein to. The songs aren't that deep, but like I said, they are just fun. 'Fu Yu Mang', this album, has a more punkish sound than the sound they have today. Todays fans of Smash Mouth really might not love this. Just about every song on here doesen't sound like 'Walkin On The Sun'. Even if you hate Smash Mouth now, you might want to give this album a try because this is a pretty good album that has sort of a punk rock sound.
