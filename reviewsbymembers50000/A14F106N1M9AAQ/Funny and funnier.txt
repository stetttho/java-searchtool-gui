 I havent seen the first Dumb and Dumber. This was a very funny movie though. The plot isnt the greatest, but there are many funny moments. The first time you see this movie is the best, and it probably gets old after awhile, so those are the only reasons I wouldent reccomend buying this. But remember, its funny and great for anyone with a sense of humor. At least rent it. Now I will probably go off and see the first one.
