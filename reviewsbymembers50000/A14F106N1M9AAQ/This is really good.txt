 The Cult's 'Pure Cult' is an album featuring all of the Cult's greatest hits.Most of the songs are really good on this album...There are some true classics.My favorite song on this album though is 'She Sells Sanctuary'.That song is amazingly great.Go buy this album if you wanna know about the Cult or just wan't to listein to a great cd.
