 This is one of my all time favorite cds from one of my all time favorite bands.Every song on here is good,and these are just about some of the best songs Nirvana has ever made in their career.They could have put some more songs on here,sure,but whats here is really,really good.If you are a fan of Nirvana,then you can't go wrong with buying this.Even if you only heard a couple Nirvana songs on the radio or something,you should should most defiantly own this.This is one of Nirvanas best cds and one of the all around best cds ever.So,theres nothing but good on this cd.Its by...The one..And only..Nirvana.
