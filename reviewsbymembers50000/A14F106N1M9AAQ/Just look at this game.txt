 American Idol could be the worst game of the year, just by the looks of it.. Look at how bad it is. The grapics are horrible. They are some of the worst graphics ever seen on Playstation 2. I saw some screen shots. There are many Dreamcast games that look better than this. I bet its boring too. I heard it took only ONE hour to beat. ONE hour. ONE HOUR!!! $50 for one hour! Are you people insane? Spending $50 for one hour of gameplay, probably with no replay value either. The show may be horrible, but I have a feeling this may be worse.
