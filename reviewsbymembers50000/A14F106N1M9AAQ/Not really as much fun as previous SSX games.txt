 SSX3 is an improvement over the last SSX games. It has more stuff to do, its deeper, and is improved in sound and visuals. The gameplay seems to have lost its charm though. Its not really thrilling or exciting anymore. Its still slightly fun, but not really worth owning. I'm glad I rented it. If you havent tried SSX or SSX Tricky though, then you should definately play this. You will probably find it to be one of the best snowboarding games avaible. The new conquer the mountain mode is set up good, but gameplay is where it counts, and you know how I feel about it. The graphics are good. I found one slight glitch, but its nothing to really worry about. You may never even come across to it. In fact, I am gonna stop talking about that stupid little glitch, alright? Alright then. The soundtrack features songs by many different artists like Finger Eleven and X-Exutioners(too bad some of the lyrics have been taken out of 'Good Times' the featured Finger Eleven song here. The album version is better.). I dont love all of the songs on here. There are some new snowboarders here this time along with the others(I think a few might be missing that didnt return for SSX3. The good ones returned though). The loading isnt too bad. Its not a really hard game to pick up and play either. You do get better with practice. Its a decent snowboarding game, but not worth buying if you've played the other SSX games. Rent it first.
