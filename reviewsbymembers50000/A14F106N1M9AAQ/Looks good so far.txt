 The PSP (PlayStation Portable) is Sony's first handheld gaming system. This is not a final review, nor have I played the version that is out in Japan now, but I will write a preview to help out some future buyers anyway. The graphics, from what I have seen in screen shots, look much better than the Nintendo DS's visuals. Titles like Tony Hawk's Underground 2 Remix and Ridge Racers really show off its graphical muscle. Heres the launch game line-up: Ridge Racers Need for Speed Underground: Rivals Untold Legends: Brotherhood of the Blade Ape Escape NBA Twisted Metal: Head On Wipeout: Pure MVP Baseball MLB 2005 Tiger Wood's PGA Tour Metal Gear Acid Tony Hawk's Underground 2 Remix Mercury NFL Street Unleashed One of the future games that I am excited about is Hot Shots Golf. That is a terrific game series. Anyway, the PSP looks good so far, and the game line up isn't too shabby. Should you buy it over the DS? It depends on your gaming tastes, but so far the PSP has a much looking line up that the recently released DS games (which dissappointed me terribly, hold for Warioware Touched! and Feel the Magic). In Japan though, 50,000 units were returned due to a faulty square button, and Sony doesent seem to be very helpful on that matter. Oh well. Hope this helped you out.
