 Harvest Moon games are always fun and addictive. My favorite one was 'Back to Nature' on PSOne. I coulden't stop playing that for months! It was a truly unique gameplay experiance. Friends of Meneral Town looks like a handheld version of the amazingly great PSOne game, Back to Nature! That is a great thing because you can play this on trips and stuff. I havent played this yet but i'm sure its going to be awesome. What can they mess up? We need more series like Havest Moon. More unique games that stand out from the rest. Support good gaming and buy this game. Its gonna be great!
