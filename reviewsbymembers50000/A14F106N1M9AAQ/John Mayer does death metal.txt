 This album is called 'Heavier Things' because its a death metal record. It is a little too heavy. His heaviest song ever was your 'Body Is A Wonderland' though. That definitely should have been on here. They could have at least included a B2K remix of it. That would rock. Maybe he should go touring with B2K. John Mayer stars in the movie 'You Got Served'. B2K should have though. Buy this cd for hardcore heaviness. B2K rocks too dudes!
