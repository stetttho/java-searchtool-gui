 I didn't really like P.O.D's 'The Fundamental Elements of Southtown' that much.It just wasen't anything special and most of the songs just sounded bland.However,this is a  great improvement over The Fundamental Elements of Southtown,and a great buy if you are in to rock music.Some songs are very memerable and not really forgettable.The bonus tracks are alright.There are three bonus tracks.Two are remixes of 'Boom' and 'The Youth of The Nation',while the other bonus track is a accustic version of 'Alive'.Plus,this comes with a great DVD of P.O.D playing live.If you havent been to a P.O.D concert,its a great way to see what its like to be at one.I think the bonus DVD is cool.If you have the original version of Setellite,though,I don't think you need this one.The minor upgrades are cool,but not worth spending [any more]  on.I am happy I bought this album,because I was ready not to because I didn't like their last album that much but I still gave this a chance.And I like it,too!So yeah,its worth buying. 4 Stars is what I rate it.
