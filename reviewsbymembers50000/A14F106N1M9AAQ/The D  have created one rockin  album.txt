 The D4 have created one album that simply just rocks!Yeah,this is a very rockin' album that most people will probably enjoy.The lyrics aren't really anything special,but their guitars sound pretty damn cool.Most of the songs are really good,and this cd also contains a video for their song 'Get Loose'.And,if you have never heard any music by the D4,they sound like a regular rock band mixed with punk.This is good stuff,and I reccomend it.
