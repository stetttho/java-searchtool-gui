 The Grammy award show doesent really celebrate whats good in music. It just celebrates whats popular and mainstream, and most popular/mainstream music is garbage. The Black Eyed Peas, Usher, Evanescence, and numerous other acts shouldent be at the grammies. Why not put on talented bands such as CKY, Malevolent Creation, or Cradle of Filth? You may not think those are the greatest bands ever (although in my opinion they are very good), but at least they have alot of talent. Dont support this garbage.
