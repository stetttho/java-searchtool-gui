 Deus Ex: Invisible War came out last year(2003), and it was one of the best games of last year. Its an open ended delight. This is not an action game. Sure, there are guns in it, but its an RPG at heart. The great thing about this awesome game is that you dont have to do something one way like a Final Fantasy game. You can complete thing mutiple ways. It feels like you're creating the experiance instead of it feeling like a "just there" type of thing. There are multiple endings, and no, I wont spoil anything. I also found some rather interesting secrets, and the more you play this, the more new things you will probably find out. The only real fault is sometimes not so great computer A.I. and a dissapointing frame rate. Dont expect the prettiest game ever, though its not really ugly(the graphics are like a 3.7/5). I dont think the PC version of the same title is as good though, because there were alot of bugs I heard of in the home personal computer version that I didnt find in the Xbox version. I would say to get the Xbox version if you get the choice. Get this game, its quality gaming, and even a breath of fresh air in some ways.
