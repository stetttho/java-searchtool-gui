 Midtown Madness 3 is not your typical racing game.Its just not all racing in this game...In fact there is less racing in this game than anything else in it.So,what else can you do besides racing?Well,you can do all types of pretty fun missions.The missions are great at first but do get repetitive later on.I mean,some missions are the same thing you did before earlier on but explained a little differently(but the same thing,nontheless.).There are two citys to choose from in Midtown Madness 3,one set in Washington D.C. and another one set in Paris.They are both very large and you can explore both of them in a free run mode without any time to distract you.The racing bits in Midtown Madness 3 aren't that great though.I mean,they are good,but they are nothing really special.I think the visials are ok,nothing spectacular but are still very good looking.The music is just bland.Midtown Madness 3 has many high points but isn't really spectacular,but is still some of the best mindless fun you can have(and its even a step up ahead of games like Crazy Taxi,too).Plus,theres even Xbox Live play to boot.If you wan't a fun online game or just some mindless fun then go pick this up but don't expect a masterpeice or anything.
