 P.O.D is back, without guitarist Marcos, but with a new sound. This is a different sounding album than their previous, 'Satellite'. That was(and still is)my favorite P.O.D album, but its good that P.O.D tried some new stuff. Payable on Death has more of a rock reggae sound than before, but this album doesent have such a big chance that you wont notice them. This is still P.O.D, but there are no heavy songs. Sonny also has a different accent (Hey Mon) but you can tell its him by his voice. I dont really hate any song on this album, but non of them are really classic meterial. They are mostly all good though. I would reccomend this cd to old or new P.O.D fans. Even though Marcos is gone, P.O.D is still alive with a new, but inperfect sound.
