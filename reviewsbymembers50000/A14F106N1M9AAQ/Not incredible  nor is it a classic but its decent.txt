 This is the debut album from Godsmack. Its okay sometimes, but at other times its not. The lyrics get repetetive. Lyrics like "Go Away" can be probably found on almost every song here. This cd also isnt the most original stuff I have ever heard, and its lacking a whole lot that makes it interesting. I wish they would have tried something new than just doing the same ol' rock formula. Not every song is good on here. The best songs are the singles. I usually dont think that the best songs on cds are the singles heard on the radio or TV or somewhere else, but thats the case here. That is dissapoiting. It doesent last long either and its not a classic. There are some good songs here though that I have enjoyed and this cd is not the worst thing I have ever heard. Godsmack is actually not a bad band in my opinion. There sound is good too. Some lyrics are okay, athlough most are repetetive. So, if you buy this, you may like it, but if you dont buy it, dont worry. You wont be missing out on much.
