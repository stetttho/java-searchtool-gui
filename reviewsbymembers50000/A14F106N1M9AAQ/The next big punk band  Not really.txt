 I have heard about this band, and I was lucky enough to recieve this album for free from someone spreading the word about them. The band members say their biggest influence is Rancid, but this doesent really sound a whole lot like that. I do give the band Odd Man Out some credit though. Their budget isn't the biggest, and they are not even adults yet. Its kind of hard to really take them serious though, but at least they're not just whining about how life is so tough fot them and all that. Most of the lyrics are you're typical pop punk fare, but with more spark, and some of it more thought out. Odd Man Out still has alot more maturing to do, but at least its not as goofy as old Blink-182(a band I dislike) stuff. Non of the songs sound alike on here, which is a good thing, but I dont really enjoy them that much. This cd also needs better recording quality. I'm sure this band will appeal to some people, but it doesent appeal to me. Odd Man out arent a Rancid.
