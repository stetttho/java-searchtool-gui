 The King of Fighters 99 is not the best fighting game in the world, and it is flawed, but it is kind of fun. It is also priced right (its value priced so it should only run you under $10.00). If you are used to 3D fighters like Dead or Alive 3 or Soul Calibur II you might think this is a little slow paced. Button mashers will not get alot out of this game. This quality isn't very great and the sound isnt either, but its a fun little game that wont run you much money. Check it out if you are a fan of the King of Fighters or are a just a fan of 2D fighting games in general.
