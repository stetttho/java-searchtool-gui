 I havent really used these controllers, so dont listen to the score I gave it. I'm just reporting to you that Xbox versions of those lovely controllers are coming soon. They will be available on the release date of the Xbox version of Street Fighter Anniversary Collection, which will feature the whole Playstation 2 version of the game along with Xbox Live play. The confimed charecters are Akuma and Cammy so far, but there are a few others. If I only waited for the Xbox version... For any true Street Fighter fan, this is a dream come true! Available in February.
