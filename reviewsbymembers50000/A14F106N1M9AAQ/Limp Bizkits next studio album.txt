 I wouldent expect much from 'Bipolar',the next studio album from Limp Bizkit.Their most recent work,'Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water' and 'New Old Songs' weren't really good,so maybe this will go downhill the same way some of their other albums went.Who knows though,maybe Fred Durst is right and this will suprise everyone,but I highly doubt that it will.I'm not too excited over this album.I don't really like Limp Bizkit anymore so the only way i'll buy this album is if its really,really good and its not as bad as their last two albums that werent really good.
