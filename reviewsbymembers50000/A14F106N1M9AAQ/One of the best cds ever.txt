 Aaron Carter rocks! HE IS THE BEST SINGER EVER. This cd has lots of variety. This is how I would describe this cd: Sick death metal with some black metal lyrics with some hella tight rap and R&B mixed in with a little pop sound. I love pop. It rocks my world. I was slightly dissapointed by the sickening lyrics though. Like I said, there are black metal lyrics, which are sickening. And the death metal part made me feel dirty. The rap part? He just cusses too much, but I like his gangsta style. Move over, Dr. Dre! This is the new gangsta in town. Hes a thug too. 2pac aint got nothing on this new thug! Hes living the thug life. Slayer, Cradle of Filth, Dimmu Borgir and Molevolent Creation better move over too. And hes an AWESOME pop star. Go buy this cd, but be warned that its a sickening experiance. I cant believe what I heard. But I like it.
