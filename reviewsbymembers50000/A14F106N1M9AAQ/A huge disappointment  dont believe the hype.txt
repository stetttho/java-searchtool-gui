 I really enjoyed the first Spider-Man film. It was one of the best movies of 2002. I liked it so much, in fact, I went out and bought a personal copy for my home collection. I was thinking of doing the same for Spider-Man 2 before even watching it, since I have heard its surpasses the first from most of the people I have talked to. Instead I rented it, and I was expecting something amazing. What did I get instead of that? A corny, bubble gum piece of fluff. Spider-Man 2 was just a very predictable movie without much of a well played out story, unlike the first one which unfolded really well. Kirstein Dunst, Tobey Mcguire and the rest of the cast can hardly act. They were horrible, with goofy, cheesey lines that I felt embarresed to even listen to at times. I also didn't like the plot very much, even though I really dig comic book films and I love the art style. Needless to say, the special effects were top notch, and the action wasen't too shabby. The rest of the movie falls flat though, unfortunately. I want the two hours and ten minutes of my life back! Well, this was another lousy 2004 movie and another Hollywood big name box office cash in. I'm telling you, only rent it if you must see it! Do NOT purchase it for any price. You'll be sorry. Now I wont be excited for Spider-Man 3, if they even make it.
