 I wasent a huge fan of the movie M:I-2, but the soundtrack is good. There are some great bands on here, including Rob Zombie, Metallica, Foo Fighters, Buckcherry, etc. There are even some non mainstream bands on here like The Pimps and Butthole Surfers(whens the last time you heard about em? Years ago?). Its overall a good soundtack, and even the Limp Bizkit song is decent. Not every song is great, but thankfully most of them are and there isnt really anything on here that is horrible. Some tracks are only found on this soundtrack too(like Metallica's 'I Dissapear'). This is a good soundtrack thats better than the movie.
