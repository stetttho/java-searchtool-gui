 Need for Speed Underground is a pretty good racing game. Its not bad. I would reccomend renting it first before buying it. There are better racing games out, such as Project Gotham Racing 2, but this is not a real bad choice if you are looking for a street racing game. There are many different types of racing in this game though, like drag racing too. The "go underground" mode is the main mode and the best mode in this game. You can completely trick out your car to make it the most stylish and famous ride on the road. Plus, you can make magazine covers and gan respect and street cred. The graphics are pretty good, and there is a good framerate and sense of speed. There is a style points system, a little similar to the kudos system seen in Project Gotham Racing 1 & 2, but truthfully, its not as well done.  It just seems tacked on. I don't like every song on the soundtrack either and some annoy me, but there are some decent songs, such as the ones by Rancid and Rob Zombie(two awesome bands). So, if this game is so good why only a 3 out of 5? Well, it just doesen't seem extremely fun and its not the most original game ever, and it is annoying sometimes. But, its still decent and at least worth renting. When will the never ending quest of gaining street cred ever end? Not any time soon, apparently.
