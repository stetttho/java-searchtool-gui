 I have played the demo of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time and it was pretty good. The demo wasen't amazing, but it has some cool features. You can run on walls and pull off some bad arse moves. It felt kind of slow though, and defeating ememys isn't very exciting at this point. The graphics were alright, nothing to brag about but they weren't bad at all. I hope the full version is better because this game has alot of potential. I'm sure there will be some improvements in the full game. I have a feeling this is going to be Ubi Softs next big hit. Ubi Soft also published games such as Ghost Recon and Splinter Cell. So this should be good.
