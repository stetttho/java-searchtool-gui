 This album will forever be an all time classic.This is almost my favorite album of all time.Every single song on here is amazing.Its also hard and heavy too.I would rate each song,but I don't think you need to know the ratings on the songs because every song is probably 5 out of 5 stars.I will forever like this album because,no matter how much you listein to it,it just never gets old!And if you are a new fan of Metallica,get this instead of their new album "St Anger" because even though you probably might like it,this is far better.Every fan of metal or rock music should most defiantly own this masterpiece.A must have.
