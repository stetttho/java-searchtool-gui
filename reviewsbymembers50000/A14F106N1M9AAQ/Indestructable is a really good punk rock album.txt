 This was the first Rancid cd that I have bought. No, I didn't buy it because of the singles. I have heard of Rancid before this album. I just never bought any of their albums for some reason. Anyway, I will buy more of their albums after hearing something real good like this. This is a great punk rock album with nineteen songs of pure punk. Not every song is fast and some of the lyrics have meaning to them. Buy this instead of that fake pop punk garbage like Simple Plan and Good Charlotte. Those bands disgusts me. I bought the limited edition version of Indestructable. The cd is the same as the non limited edition but it comes with a cool Rancid T Shirt and Rancid patch. Go check out this cd. Its a very great punk album.
