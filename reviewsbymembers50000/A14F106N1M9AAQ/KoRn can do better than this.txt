 'Issues' by KoRn just might be their worst album to date.While its actually not bad,its not very good either.Its medicore.Theres a few standout tracks that are awesome,but then there are some annoying ones that you will skip each time you listein to this album.I don't really consider anything on this a real classic either.Its hard and heavy though and it features no rap like their last album(which I didn't mind but other people seem to complain about it).You can go on in life skipping this album - its nothing really special and its a little annoying.Buy the other albums by KoRn instead.
