 When many people think of hip hop today, they think of boring, annoying mainstream rap artists such as 50 Cent, Chingy, and Nelly. I cant stand any type of rap played on MTV or the radio. In fact, I dont really even consider myself much of a hip hop fan. My cd collection is mostly just rock, and filled with cds like CKY, In Flames, H.I.M., Killswitch Engage, Malevolent Creation, etc. Still, Del the Funky Homosapien is not a rapper to ignore. Although this isnt as good as the masterpiece 'Both Sides of the Brain', its still a must have with great songs. Although this is a bit of an old album, it was ahead of its time, and holds up remarkably well even today. In fact, its one hundred times better than the junky hip hop being played today. No wonder why it has had such an awful repetutation lately. For anyone with an open mind, though, this is a must have. I would check out 'Both Sides of the Brain' first, though.
