 If I could pick the top three best KoRn albums, they would be their self titled debut (KoRn), Take A Look In the Mirror, and this one, Follow the Leader. This is one truly awesome cd. Some songs are dark with sad lyrics(Check out the song "Pretty Face") while others have humor in them (The song "All In the Family", anyone?). There are special guests artists on this cd. You might be suprised that they are hip-hop artists like Ice Cube, but they sound suprisingly good on this cd. This is one of the heaviest KoRn cds. Most of the songs are great, if not all. The cover art is also very good too. Its also interresting that the music starts on track 13... Actually I wish that it was normal and just started like the rest of the cds, and I don't see the point of that, but whatever... Go out and get this cd. Its one of the main reasons why I like nu metal.
