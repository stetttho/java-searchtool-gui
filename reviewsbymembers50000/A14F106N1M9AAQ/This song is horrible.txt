 How lame does it get? This is one of the worst songs this year. The lyrics are just bad, and not really even creative.And don't get me started on anything else about Fountains of Wayne... Everything about them is probably bad. Please, don't support this awful band by buying their album or even this single! The mainstream seems to dig this garbage though, which is not good.
