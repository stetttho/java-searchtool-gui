 This is a terrific cd, and KoRn's best cd since their debut. I havent been impressed with some of KoRn's past albums, but this one is really good. Theres not one bad song, and this is the heaviest album from KoRn. This is KoRn in their true form, and it could be KoRn's definining album. The singles you might have heard arent the best songs though('Right Now', 'Did My Time' and 'Y'all Want a Single'). In fact, I think the single 'Did My Time' is the worst song on this album. The DVD included here is pretty lame though. A one star for that. At least it was free with this. The only good thing about the DVD is the 'Right Now' music video, which is even medicore. Its not the usual one you see on music TV channels. Still, you must own this cd, but if you dont get the limited edition version, dont worry too much. The cover of Metallica's awesome song 'One' was a nice suprise too(athlough the Metallica version is still better.).
