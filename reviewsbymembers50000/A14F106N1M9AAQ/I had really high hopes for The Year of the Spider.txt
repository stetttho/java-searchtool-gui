 My first Cold cd was '13 Ways to Bleed On Stage'. I really, really liked that album alot. I would consider it nothing really short of a classic. Also, it had a really cool dark sound. That was one of the best things about Cold in my opinion. When this cd, 'The Year of the Spider' came out, I got it the second day it came out ( I would have got it the first day it came out but I was really busy that day). I rushed to the store to get it and I had really high hopes for it. I liked the single, 'Stupid Girl' so I thought this would be another classic from Cold. Well, although this is a pretty good cd, its not a classic and it wasent as good as I thought it would be.  Don't get me wrong, its not horrible but like I said, its not a classic. Cold's dark sound is gone and now its replaced with a lighter, more mainstream sound. New Cold fans might dig it, but a fan like me dosen't dig it as much as the darker sound. The lyrics are pretty good, but again, not as dark. They are very personal, and maybe even more meaninful I must admit. But for some reason I don't feel like listeining to this cd as much as their last one. The bonus DVD isn't bad though. I might be making this cd sound a little worse than it actually is. Its probably because I was a little dissapointed with it.
