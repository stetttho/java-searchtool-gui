 Stand By Me is easily one of my favorite movies ever. It just never gets old, and this DVD is a must have. The kids in this movie are your adverage twelve year olds going on a journey to find a dead body. The storyline might not seem like much, but once you see it, you will like it. The acting is great. Even though this movie is rated R due to profanity and strong language, young kids may still even like this movie. I saw it when I was young and I still love it. The special features are good. This DVD version is remastered. Its in widescreen. I would reather it be in full screen, I prefer that, but whatever... Theres bonus trailers, too, and more special features. Just go buy it.
