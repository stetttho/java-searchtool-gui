 Todays mainstream pop is the absolute worst type of music avaible. I don't even know why I said its the worst type of music since I really don't consider it music. What I DO consider it though is garbage and overrated trash. I mean, these songs are not even deep or anything! This cd is for the idiots who buy every cd they hear on the radio. I hate you people who support this type of garbage. I mean, music is supposed to be an art form. How are these lame songs supposed to be considered art? They are killing the music industry for crying out loud! Not only are their lame pop songs on here, but more mainstream garbage from two other genres, rock and rap. These are the absolute worst rock and rap songs avaible. And all the stupid new rappers now a days are dumb mainstream idiots with cds that have lyrics as deep as 'Chillin' at tha holidae inn'. Yet every idiot who bought this cd probably buys that kinda garbage too. I wish you idiots would hear Del The Funky Homosapien. He is a good rapper whos cds will unfortuantly not sell better than a idiot named CHINGY. I hate him! This might be the worst cd of the year. I hate pop and mainstream rap and rock. Buy this if you like bad music. And buy Britney's new album to go along with it, you idiot!
