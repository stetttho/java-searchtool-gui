 KoRn are a great band. They created nu metal and made a sound of their own with this terrific debut. If there were three of the best KoRn albums avaible, this would definitely be on it. At the time, this was very original sounding. Maybe not today(since there are so many nu metal bands). This one stands out from all of nu metal and all of KoRn's albums though. Every song on this album is great. The lyrics are depressing, emotional, and thoughful. This album is like Johnathon Davis's(the lead singer of this bands)dark life story. Listen to the lyrics. The musical part of this is very good too with, like I said before, a nu metal sound that may be familiar, but still stands out from the rest. Each song on this album speaks out from one another too. I cant pick a favorite song since they are all good. Pick up this album.
