 That editorial review is full of crap. While the games 'Tony Hawk's Underground' and its sequel sold very well, they did not sell 'tens of millions of copies world wide'. Now for this album: its pure trash. What could have been an awesome soundtrack full of awesome 80's punk bands is just some crappy emo bands covering punk classics. Skip this trash.
