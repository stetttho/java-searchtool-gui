 I'm a person with a sense of humor. I like comedy, funny movies and pranks. I also joke around alot. I didn't find Scary Movie 3 really funny or enjoyable though. There are parodies of horror movies such as the 'Ring' here, and even non horror movies such as '8 Mile'. The plot seems barely there, just thrown together. Its unrealistic, but thats not a problem(its a movie for crying out loud). The only remotely funny part was probably the Michael Jackson scene, or some of the 8 Mile spoof(kind of). If you're a complete moron, you might this this is a hilarious movie. You'll be rolling on the ground laughing! If you have at least an I.Q. over 5 though, you're bound to hate it.
