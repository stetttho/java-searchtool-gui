 I heard 'Intil the Day I Die', and I hate that song. Just look at their other song titles and they dont sound very good. This is probably a garbage cd, and since  I didnt like 'Until the Day I Die', and people have said thats the best song on the cd, then I will most likely hate the other songs. Its all too boring. 'Until the Day I Die/I'll Spill My Heart for You'. I hope I never hear that song again.
