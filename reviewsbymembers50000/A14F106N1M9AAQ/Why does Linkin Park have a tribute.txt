 Linkin Park hasen't really influenced any bands or have been around long enough to do influence any.So why do they have a tribute album?Maybe to rake in more dough?I don't think so,because this hasen't really sold that well...So why?!?!The world may never know.Plus,if you have ever listeined to these songs,they sound absolutely AWFUL.Some underground bands created the songs on this tribute,and they made these versions of the songs sound worse than the original versions.So,this is a little rediculous. 100% rediculous.So don't buy this or Linkin Park may just create another tribute album by todays hottest underground hip hop stars who were influenced by Linkin Park!
