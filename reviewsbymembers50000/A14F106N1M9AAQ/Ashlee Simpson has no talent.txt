 There are actually some music artists out there (mainly underground ones) who actually produce good music. They don't rely on their family member's success, they're not friends of another band to get signed, and they're not good buddies with the label. Those bands, or artists, actually play good music to get signed. True artists sure don't lip sing either, then blame it on their band or lie about an illness they have *cough acid reflex disease cough*. Ashlee Simpson was never a good artist, and she only became popular because Jessica Simpson is her sister (thus putting her into the spotlight), MTV played it all day (while the brainwashed masses ran to the stores to pick up tihs album immediately), and the radio stations and media didn't tell people that she has "talent" and that shes "punk" (actual quotes from an AOL music guide). Ashlee Simpson was always a truly bad artist with no real talent before, and only got signed because of the reasons I have already told you about, but now she just dropped the ball. She got CAUGHT lip singing, in public, on Saturday Night Live (SNL), then later on she blamed it on the band! She obviously coulden't think of a better excuse at the time, so after a few sleepless nights and worried filled nights, she told sources such as MTV and Yahoo! that she had acid reflex disease! Actually, she probably just paid someone like she does to write her songs! I bet she could never think of any of those lyrics herself, even though they aren't really that good and are not from the heart. Ashlee Simpson disgusts me, and even her band thought it was funny when she lip sung in public and was caught! This is whats truly wrong with the music industry today, and if you buy it, you are promoting a fake, a liar, and a truly horrible "artist". Thats my word.
