 CKY is my favorite band,and this album is possibly my favorite album...Yeah,its really amazing.Its even improved over their fantastic 'Volume 1'.Each song is great,and this album is just solid all the way through.There are ten overall perfect tracks,and its hard to pick three favorites out of them...But my three favorite tracks on Infiltrate-Destroy-Rebuild are:Flesh Into Gear,Escape from Hellview,Sink Into the Underground,and Close Yet Far(yeah thats four,but 'Close Yet Far' is a honerable meantion...).Plus,if you put this into your computer,you can see some music videos for some of their songs on this album.So go buy this now!Its amazing!
