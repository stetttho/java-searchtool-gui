 CKY Volume 2 is a  very great album to buy if you are a big fan of CKY. If you are a newbie to CKY though and want to buy one of their albums, you should start off with Infiltrate Destory Rebuild or Volume 1 first. Not that this is bad or anything, but its more for the hardcore fans. Now, this is a great collection of prank phone calls, remixes, b sides and rare songs. It is over two hours long and it is all on two awesome discs. My personal favorite is the prank phone calls disc. It is absolutely hilarious! This is easily the funniest cd I have ever heard. Theres also some good music on here too. Some songs included are Bran's Chinese Freestyle, Santas Coming, Drunken Freestyle, and of course, over 60 (woah!) others. This is worth the money. I listein to it every day! So go check it out. Wow, CKY has never disapointed me yet.
