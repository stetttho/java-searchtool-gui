 Soul Calibur II is awesome. It is the best next gen fighting game to date. Yes, its even better than Dead or Alive 3. The fighting system is very fun and it is also pretty deep. There are good combos. You can also do well with button mashing though... Their is a great amout of cool charectors, and there are also many awesome weapons. My favorite part of the game is the 'Weapon master' mode where you do goals. I have completed that. It was very addictive even though that mode could get a little repetetive at times. Soul Calibur II is also a great multiplayer game. You can probably play it for a few hours if you want to on multiplayer. This is also a pretty good looking game, and athough not the best looking Xbox game ever, its pretty darn good. The sound affects are good and so is the music. Go on and purchase this excellent game. There is tons of replay value too! Oh and it is the best version of Soul Calibur II out of the three console versions. The Xbox version has the best graphics, sound, control(the PS2 control is also very good too but I prefer the Xbox controller) and there is also a exclusive Xbox charector (Spawn).
