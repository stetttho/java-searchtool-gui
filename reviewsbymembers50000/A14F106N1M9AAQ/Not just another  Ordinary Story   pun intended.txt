 In Flames are quite an amazing band. 'Colony' is one of my favorite albums in my huge collection, and it is great all the way through. Colony is a rare must own, one of those albums that you'll never get sick of. From the kick arse opening of 'Embody the Invisible' (which was featured in 2003's hit video game, 'Tony Hawk's Underground') to the awesome 'New World', you'll be listening to this every day. The songs are complex, and they show great musicmanship. You'll love the energy, the passion, the vocals.. its all great. Kids, forget about your crappy nu-metal cds for awhile and pick up this classic. You wont regret it.
