 After reading the review by "A Reader from the USA," I must add to my own review an objection. As another reviewer here notes, "USA" made numerous mistakes in her tirade, even more than were caught. USA"  in fact, has not written a review, but a personal attack on Ms. Shields for NOT writing precisely what USA thinks she "should" write. What chutzpah! USA demands that Sheilds write only about the elderly, since she imagines that the author is  older than she is! Even if she were, every writer has the right to write about any subject she chooses. Has USA never heard of imaginative experience?  If she so much needs to see a book written about her own pet topics, then USA ought to write one--she will soon enough discover how difficult it is to write a novel as beautiful and compelling as "Unless."
