 t 60 Bob Dylan has produced one of the best collections of his long and prolific career. These songs rock! Ya gotta get up and dance to some of them, that's how rockin' they are. Other tracks are poignant, all are haunting in one way or another. This is a showcase of the variety of musical forms Dylan has mastered: from rock to blues to sweet old-fashioned crooners. Just superb.
