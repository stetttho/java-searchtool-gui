 I've read a lot of books about India by Indian authors. This one is by an American woman, and it shows: none of the joyous complexity of Indian culture comes through.  the characters are flat, their motivations elusive and undeveloped. The main character is difficult to like. A very disappointing reading experience. Anyone interested in Indian novels should read "A Suitable Boy," or "Life Isn't all Ha Ha Hee Hee." They're the real thing.
