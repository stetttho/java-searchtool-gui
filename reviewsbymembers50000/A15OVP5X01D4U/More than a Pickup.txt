 The Pickup is a really wonderful story. The character of Julie is thoroughly engaging, as she changes from a flighty bohemian to a seasoned woman. This novel would make a wonderful, timely film, and were I a filmmaker I'd do it in a flash.  The reviewer above who criticized Gordimer's writing does not know what he's talking about. What he perceives as grammatical errors are mostly matters of style. There were, however, a few editing slips--and it probably is because editors are timid when confronted with a writer of Gordimer's stature. Unfair to the author; Doris Lessing once noted that she has to be extremely self-critical because she gets little editorial support.
