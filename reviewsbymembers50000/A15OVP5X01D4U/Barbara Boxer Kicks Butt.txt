 I'm a big fan of  Senator Barbara Boxer: the woman doesn't hold back, whether she's scolding energy corporations for bilking California  out of millions of dollars, or relentlessly confronting candidates to the Supreme Court. So it was with great curiosity that I opened up her novel, A TIME TO RUN.  At first I stumbled a bit over the awkward writing, but after some fifty pages or so the story becomes so compelling that the lack of literary polish fades into the background. In this sense A TIME TO RUN reminded me a bit of Marge Piercy's earlier work: no matter how clumsy the prose, it's the subject matter, the STUFF,that makes every word, every page, worth reading. I know of no other book that, like this one,  so vividly portratys the real lives of our representatives in Washington.  Boxer approaches the subject of fictionalizing Washington politics with the same no-holds-barred attitude she employs as a conscious and moral representative of her constituents.  She paints a realistic picture of what it's like to be a Senator, particularly of the female gender, and lets her readers in on the back-room deals and media machinations that contribute to the sleaze of today's governmental processes.   How much of this novel's heroine, Ellen Fischer, is Boxer's alter ego? It's impossible to know for sure, but Fischer consistently rises above the sleaze, and if just a smidgeon of Ellen Fischer's character is drawn from Ms. Boxer, we've got a friend indeed in Washington. Kudos for the Senator from California.
