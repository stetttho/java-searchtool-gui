 Don't buy this book if you want to help a toddler cope with stomach aches brought on through no fault of his or her own. This story is about Clifford and friends pigging out and making themselves sick--probably a useful message for kids, but not particularly well done. My grandchild, 2 years old, adores Clifford, but in my opinion these books are not terribly well written. I'm sticking like honey to Pooh for life's little lessons.
