 ... This essay of Woolf's, were it printed on normal-sized paper with normal sized margins would probably take up half the space it does--which is already a mere 28 pages. That might, MIGHT be all right if the substance of the piece was as mind-boggling as the promo claims--but there is very little of use here, certainly nothing memorable. I'm one of those who've not only read the work of Virginia Woolf, but also a lot of what's been written about her (a cottage industry in itself), so I'm likely to normally cut her a lot of slack. I don't know who rakes in the profits now, but they'll probably keep rummaging through the poor woman's files, filling in the blanks and publishing pieces likely to make poor old Virginia roll over in her grave.
