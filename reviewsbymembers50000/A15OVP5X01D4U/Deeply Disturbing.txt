 Don't believe the reviewers who call The Nanny Diaries "hilarious" or "fun." With a subject like this, one naturally expects  satire, and that there is--but eventually the plight of the children being cared for by nannies in New York  gets under your skin. Though the plot makes for page-turning suspense, the authors would have done better to choose a more  ordinary family situation to explore rather than the  tragic relationship between Mr. and Mrs. X. Mrs. X in particular is painted so one dimensionally that she becomes mere caracature .  The subject matter here is ripe for exploration, but the authors blew it with  exaggeration. The children they portray are the next generation of the Masters of the Universe--and if what these authors have to say about their upbringing is true, we're all in trouble. In the end, your heart breaks for Grayer and all the poor little rich kids like him.
