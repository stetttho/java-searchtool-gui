 Susie's long overdue book about her insights and experience in the world of writing and editing erotica is a welcome addition to the genre. For this editor of erotica it all rang true--the pitfalls, the joys, the rewards. And her section on the publishing industry is right on target. Susie generously shares her considerable experience writing and editing erotica, as well as other kinds of writing, with no holds barred. I read and see Susie Bright speak for inspiration and validation, and this book did it for me again.
