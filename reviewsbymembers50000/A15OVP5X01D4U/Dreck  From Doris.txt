 I gave The Sweetest Dream ifour stars only because, compared to most fiction, it deserves it. But compared to the body of Lessing's work, it really rates a 2, or even a 1. Doris Lessing is my writing guru: for me, no other writer, past or present, comes as close to telling the truth about life and the universe as she does, and in a compelling way that sucks me in from the first paragraph. So for me to say that her latest book isn't so hot is pretty unusual. To tell the truth,  I'm getting the feeling that, since Lessing is getting on (she's in her 80s and not in such great health) her publishers are rummaging thru her files of ideas and character studies, asking her to fix up a transition here, an ending there, and creating books from scraps.It saddens me to watch my beloved Doris capping off a lifetime of superb literary output with this kind of dreck.
