 This book is one of the most badly written pieces of fiction I have come across in a long time. Shiva Dancing is a prime example of writing that tells rather than shows the reader what's happening. I had to stop reading after 40 pages, the writing was so awful. Publishers should be more discriminating and realize that not every single book about India is a treasure. This one belongs in a writing class as a bad example for students.
