 "Back When We Were Grownups" is Anne Tyler's best book since "Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant." As in all of Tyler's work, this novel is populated with eccentric people who intermingle  intenselfy in each other's lives. The overall atmosphere of the book is a genial acceptance of individual quirkiness, a love of humanity rendered with humor and grace.
