 I've stopped short of five stars only because I take issue with Kingston's efforts to find happy resolutions to terible events. The stories that emerge in her veterans' writing workshops tend, not surprisingly, to be painful, and to revive painful memories. Rather than accept that some situations can never turn out positively, Kingston tells her students to keep on writing until they can "write a happy ending."  Where none exists, she invents. Maybe Kingston, at 62, feels she's faced enough pain and wants to focus exclusively on finding peace now. But the dishonesty of a forced happy ending can leave the reader feeling betrayed by an otherwise honest writer.  Still, Kingston deserves high praise for maintaining her focus so tenaciously that, ten years after her book was destroyed, she was able not only to recreate the original story, but to surround it with material that deepens its meaning.
