 I haven't read a book like Carol Shields' new novel "Unless" in something like 30 years. This is a novel that reminds us how intensely  true is the old feminist adage that "the personal is political." Through her  believable and likable narrator and the women in her life, Shields continually makes connections between the tragedy of one teenage woman's circumstances and the global powerlessness of women. Shields is refreshingly  insistent in her view that women are just as powerless now, despite surface appearances to the contrary, as they were back in the day. This book touched me on a deeply personal level. It  pushed me into a week-long state of  the famous "Click!"  (if you don't know what a Click! moment is--and it's got nothing to do with computers-- I suggest that you read this book, and then every feminist novel published from roughly 1965 through 1978.) Suffice it to say that there's nothing like a "Click!" to pull a woman out of the isolated individual doldrums and into a state of collective rage. Rage, we are repeatedly told these days, isn't good for our health; but as Marge Piercy noted in an old poem, "A just anger' acted upon is as healthy as apples and carrots. I have one critical reservation about "Unless," and that's the ending. I found the resolution of the daughter's situation entirely too pat. We don't actually get to see a happy ending on the page, but we know it's coming. If the world really is as oppressive to women as Shields seems to think--and I agree with her that it is--the individual solution, especially of the nuclear family happily-ever-after variety, is an impossible dream.
