 Peter David hasn't disappointed me yet with his New Frontier series.  I've been reading the adventures of the Excalibur crew from day one, and this story is certainly a fine addition to my collection.  While we do not get  to hear much from Mackenzie Calhoun himself, we DO get to fight the good  fight with a woman who just might be Si Cwan's sister.  Even *better,* we  get to see the battle from the Bad Guys' point of view, something I find  very entertaining. I only regret the Dogs of War were not pictured on the  cover.  Though my imagination does them fine justice, it would have been  cool to see an artist's rendition of what Peter had in *his* imagination!   And if you think this is the end of it, ha.  Not hardly.  I'm glad I bought  #8 already, because I'm cracking it open this afternoon.
