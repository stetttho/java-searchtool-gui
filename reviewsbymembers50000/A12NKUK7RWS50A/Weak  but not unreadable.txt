 Let me start by saying it would be just plain impossible for me to give a bad review to Christie Golden.  Sorry, but I just can't do it.  As an added bonus, she used the word "gibe" correctly.  This alone was worth the read.  (An inside joke, to be sure, but it still counts for me.) Unfortunately, I could give this one only three stars because the story itself is pretty watery, though I don't necessarily blame Christie for it.  She wrote a VOY novel set prior to the series end, as part of a crossover series of stories.  I wouldn't wish for a worse set of parameters!  No way can a VOY story with these kinds of limitations ever hope to be anything more than a swift ride with Janeway at the helm. And that's just what this one is.  Strange gateways open in Delta Quadrant space, spilling out all manner of ships, containing friend and foe alike.  Janeway herds and leads.  Things happen.  Up pops a dangerous nebula.  Janeway leads the caravan through.  More things happen.  In the end, we find Janeway herself going through a gateway on a planet and disappearing - thus the set-up for the conclusion, contained, together with conclusions of the other five books in this series, in Book Seven of the Gateways series.  One thin thread keeps this story bound together, but it seems a bit far-"fetched."
