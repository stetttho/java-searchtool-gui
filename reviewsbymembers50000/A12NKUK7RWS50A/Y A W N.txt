 I wanted to like this book.  I *really* wanted to.  And I tried.  I struggled through the first 75 pages, and then even skipped ahead to the Monica stuff (page 439) in a desperate effort to find something readable.  Nope. Okay, this isn't a spy novel or my precious Star Trek, but I expected at least *some* daring writing.  Not a word.  In fact, the only three bright spots I noticed were: 1) The photos, 2) A few pages describing getting Chelsea to Stanford (pages 419-421), and 3) Five paragraphs on page 438 about the "swimsuit photo."  Beyond that, I wouldn't know, because that's about all I read. The Acknowledgements are 6 pages long, and the Index is 28 pages!  I'm not sure what I was expecting from this book, but I'm pretty sure "deadly" wasn't it.  Sorry, Hillary.
