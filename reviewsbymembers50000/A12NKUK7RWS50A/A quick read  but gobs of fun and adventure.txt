 I don't know about you, but I'm having a big ol' ball going back and reading some of these earlier Trek novels (See "The Murdered Sun"). Greg Cox and John Gregory Betancourt penned a wonderful, two-plot early adventure that ties in canon information about the Hortas with newer information about the Cardassians.  This novel just sizzled with all that lovely hatred the Bajorans had for their (former) oppressors. This one's also chock full of early Bashir attitude, before we learned about his enhanced genetics and certainly *well* before he got over himself about being a ladies man.  Quite entertaining, I say, and darned amusing, too.  In fact, this story abounds with perfect early characterizations of all of them - Kira, Dax, Odo, Quark, the O'Briens, Sisko, Nog, Jake, and Rom, and was a pure delight to read, this long after the series ended. But don't worry about the Cardies or the Hortas - Our Man Bashir comes through in the end.  Wait a minute, what am I saying?  *Everybody* comes through in the end - of COURSE they do, this is Star Trek!  And there's nothing wrong with that. A-plot concentrates on a daring Kira/Bashir/Dax rescue of a mama Horta from the Cardies, and when you stir in the almost-goofy b-plot about 20 accidentally-hatched baby Hortas on DS9 (mmm...who managed that, don't ya wonder?), you've got a what amounts to a mighty grand escapade in the finest of Star Trek tradition.
