 It was nice going back to read this story.  Copyright 1996, it shows beautifully the Voyager crew as they were at that time.  Certainly, we've learned new things about the characters as the seasons progressed, and later novels reflect this, but these first efforts should not be dismissed just because they may not fit what we now know. Besides, this one was chock full of references to Chakotay's Native American heritage, which was, in fact, integral to the plot - something sorely lacking in the show after about the second season.  For this reason (and also because it's still a Kes-inclusive story), it's worth the read. Okay, so the plot was a teensy bit predictable (two alien races at war, with a big secret between them), but why is that bad?  This is a Star Trek tale, ferheavensake, it doesn't have to be the world's greatest novel.  It just has to be a lively and entertaining ensemble story that makes me feel good at the end.  Spot on for me, my friends!
