 First, I recommend you read both "imzadi" and Joe Zika's reviews and know I agree with them both.  (On to my review.) After having just read "A Hard Rain," I can only say I'm glad I saved this one for last.  This was one story that needed to be told.  It's fast-paced and meaty, and packed with real-life decisions and hard truths about less-than-ethical compromises that must be made in times of war. Though this is going to sound perfectly ridiculous, the one thing that satisfied me the most had nothing to do with the battle but with a bit of continuity I applaud:  We learn about the existence of Barin, Deanna's two-and-a-half year old half-brother. ...And this time, halleluia, the cover art *does* have something to do with the plot!
