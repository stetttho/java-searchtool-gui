 After having read all the Gateways novels (except TOS, which I skimmed), I was *so* ready to read this book, so ready to learn the fates of all my favorite characters and to learn once and for all what happens with the gateways!  Oh...(heavy sigh), well, I *did* learn fates, and I *did* learn what happens with the gateways, but...but...it was all just so, so - not to put too fine a point on it - dull.  The individual novels were *much* more entertaining than these little "conclusions." I agree with other reviewers who've said these stories might have been better received had they stayed with their original novels, rather than gone into their own book (hardcover, no less).  An ugly little marketing ploy, methinks, and one I shall be on the lookout for in the future. While all the stories contained the predictable amount of adventure, humor and hijinks, and the TNG installment sewed up the Iconian connection, none of them were what I'd call keepers.  We got some good Bajoran history, a goofy Q story, some ice and snow, time jumps and dead people, and an impressive amount of continuity, but for the most part, yawn. Some advice:  *Definitely* read the individual novels first (TOS, too, if you're into it), but don't read them exactly in the order they are numbered.  Save TNG until last, instead of in the Book Three spot it's in.  That's the order the final stories appear in this book (TOS, CH, DS9, VOY, NF, TNG), and it made more sense that way. Also, don't bother buying it unless you absolutely *must* have an entire set, and even then, wait for the paperback at the second-hand book store, which shouldn't be long in coming.  That having been said, another reason you might want to have this particular book in your collection is for the pretty darned incredible "Pocket Books Star Trek Novel Timeline" in the back.  Twenty-six pages worth, including everything from Strange New Worlds stories to audio and ebooks through December 2001.  Mighty impressive, I must say.
