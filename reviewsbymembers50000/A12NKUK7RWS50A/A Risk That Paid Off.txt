 I understand there was some trepidation over 'giving' Peter David's New Frontier characters to others to write, but after reading the stories contained in this anthology, I believe there was no need to worry. That these were stories written *prior* to the characters' becoming a team on Excalibur did, I suppose, lessen the pressure, but still, it was a task that couldn't have been done without minding the 'future' David's already written.  Each author picked a character and wrote a story - and each did so with flair, not some little humor, plenty of continuity, and an obvious love of the New Frontier universe in the first place.  I noticed one or two errors that smacked of haste in putting this book together, but those in no way diminished the overall enjoyment of it. Go ahead and buy this book - and then test your mettle at next year's Shore Leave convention by getting as many authors as you can to autograph the thing!
