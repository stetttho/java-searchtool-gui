 Whoever says this recording is no good should have  their hearing aids examined! I've always been an Emmylou Harris fan, though I never went in much for Linda Ronstadt or Dolly Parton.  However, the combination of these  three voices makes a fan outta me.  Each woman has an opportunity to sing  lead in different songs, with the other two harmonizing to perfection.  I  must admit, I DID chuckle at their nineties version of Neil Young's  "After the Gold Rush."  Having spent most of my Wonder Years  listening to Neil & Co., the lyrics to this one had been engraved on my  brain!  But the update does not ruin the song, merely provides a new way to  interpret. Do not hesitate.  Buy this one.
