 I forced myself through the middle four novels in this series ("New Earth"), and I can't really say I'm sorry I did, though it was a struggle.  Book One, which introduced us to a literal "wagon train to the stars," was a clear winner, but the books in between had me thinking "Oh, no!  Not AGAIN!" Nevertheless, I fell in love with those poor, beleaguered colonists on Belle Terre, and I'm sincerely glad I made it through to this last novel.  Not only does it help tie up loose ends from the previous novels, it's a rousing story in its own right, introducing us to a whole new band of misfits, not unlike Peter David's "New Frontier" bunch.  Once again, I applaud Diane Carey's writing style, most especially her portrayal of non-regulation-boot wearin' OTC Nick Keller and his cobbled-together ship, the U.F.P.F. *Challenger.* She speaks well, too, of the starship *Enterprise* in one of the finest paragraphs in the whole book:  "Holding her much-reduced family in the petal of her cupped hand, the starship that had protected them for years, extrinsic proof of their high-priced wins, streaked through space pretending there wasn't a strain on her bones at this (warp nine) speed.  *Enterprise* gracefully turned her shoulder to the insult, proving herself once more not just a jumper but a workhorse."  You just can't get any better than that. But wait, you can!  *Challenger* has bled into yet another series of novels, "Gateways."  You'll find the reluctant OTC (NOT captain) Keller and his intrepid crew in Book Two, "Chainmail," written by My Girl, Diane Carey.
