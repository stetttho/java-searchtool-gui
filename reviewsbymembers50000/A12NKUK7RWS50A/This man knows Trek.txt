 Anyone who's pooh-poohing the "Gateways" series just ain't paying attention!  This is the best so far, and I'm not quick to give out the kudos for series.  In fact, for the most part, I hate 'em - but Gateways grabbed me, and Robert's TNG installment is simply a fabulous cog on a great big wonderful wheel. I'll admit I was lost at first as to what the heck was going on, but once I understood that different races had already been approached by the, uh, Iconians, about purchasing the gateways tech, I immediately understood the reason why Picard and his mighty ship was summoned to the task of organizing everyone into a united front to meet with the Iconians. What follows is not quite united but certainly surprising, and full of enough references to just about everything TNG Trek that's gone before to cause me to rush to my tapes!  Robert Greenberger is just plain amazing in this capacity, and I'm betting he had it all in his own little head. Add to that Troi's successful stint as captain and loads of Riker/Troi not-so-subtext, and you've got what amounts to - not to put too fine a point on it - a GREAT read. And yup, this one ends with a go-through-the-gateway cliffhanger set to finish in Book Seven of the series, "What Lay Beyond."  And who else goes through but our great Iconian master, Jean-Luc Picard.  Much, much too much fun.
