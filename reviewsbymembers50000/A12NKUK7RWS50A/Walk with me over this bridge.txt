 I call this story a bridge, because that's exactly what it is.  Aside from McHenry, we don't see a lot of forward movement for any of the characters.  But without this story, we couldn't easily get from the events of "Restoration" and "Cold Wars" to the *next* one.  I only hope #13 comes out soon - and preferably *not* in hardback! If you're following the NF bunch, you already know McHenry was an odd duck, but this story will give you the real dirt on his past.  If you enjoy it when a writer takes a thread from TOS past and sews it into the present, then you'll just adore Mark's backstory.  Heck, even if you don't care for that sort of thing, you'll still like the story.  It'll even answer a question or two about McHenry's abilities in a past NF novel. Much else is resolved and some things more thoroughly explained herein, but don't let that worry you that the end is near.  Not hardly.  Be on the lookout for more about Our Favorite Brikar, Calhoun's adopted son, Moke, and the quicksilver offspring of Burgoyne and Selar.  Oh, did I mention Si Cwan and Kalinda?  No?  Well, if you think *everything* has been resolved with McHenry, I'd say think again.
