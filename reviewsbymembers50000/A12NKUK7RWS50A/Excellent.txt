 First of all, no need to be misled by the cover art this time.  It's as true to the story as the artwork is beautiful.  Applause to Cliff Nielsen, and I hope to meet him some day. Second, allow me to make yet another point or two regarding how wonderful is the DS9 re-launch:  This book clearly shows that more was going on in the universe during the Dominion War than just the war.  While Starfleet might have you believe *everyone* was directly involved in the war effort, if you think about it, that could hardly be the case.  I also enjoyed the continued idea that everyone doesn't use Federation lingo.  You could never quite tell that from the show, but it certainly makes a whole lot of sense. I'm also enjoying the running Morn joke, and I laughed right out loud at the reference to Vash.  Too rich!  Okay, onto the review: Anyone who thought Jake Sisko should have been given better treatment as the series came to an end can take heart with the re-launch and with this book in particular.  And I mean take heart.  S.D. Perry has captured the true soul of this deep-thinking, honest young man.  Ben Sisko raised his son well, and evidence of that can be read on every page. Back in one of the first of the re-launch books, Jake left DS9, ostensibly to visit his grandfather on Earth, when in reality he was going to check out a prophecy revealed to him at B'hala.  The story of what happened to him is told here, and, my, what a story it is - delightfully complex and containing ingredients guaranteed to keep you turning pages well after you should be asleep so you can make it to work on time the next day. I would take up far too much space trying to explain every detail and nuance in this novel, so let's just say...in it, Jake Sisko comes full circle. And so does Kai Opaka. And we are all the better for it.
