 I agree with one reviewer who said his ballads were weak, but "Livin' La Vida Loca" and "The Cup of Life" more than make up for it.  I mean, how many CD's do you buy that you like *every* song?  Out of  14 tracks, I like 8 of 'em.  Pretty darn good, I'd say. As for the  ballads, the best one is his duet with Madonna, "Be Careful."   His voice isn't strong enough to carry a ballad by himself.  He's  definitely better on the rowdy tunes. ...
