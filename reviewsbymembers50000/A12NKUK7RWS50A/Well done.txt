 You know, when I picked up the first Titan book ("Taking Wing") and saw that every other paragraph introduced an otherwise unheard-of species to the crew, I thought "okay, too much."  But as I continued to read, I realized how important this was.  Too many reviewers have said it should be "taken for granted" that the Federation would employ beings from many species, and that all this mention in the Titan crew is overdone.  While that's fine to say, the truth of it is, "taken for granted" has largely been defined as "not mentioned hardly at all," so I loudly applaud Andy and Michael's work to actually get it on the page.  Okay, so it requires a scorecard to keep track.  Big deal.  At least you can be sure it's not the "same old Star Trek" aboard Riker's Titan.  This goes not only for the species diversity itself, but also for their relationships and discussions (homosexuality, human bias, and genetic engineering, to name a few).  The Red King once again lifts up and celebrates all that diversity, while at the same time delivering a believable, fast-paced story that remains entertaining right to the end.  I'm really looking forward to the next installment.
