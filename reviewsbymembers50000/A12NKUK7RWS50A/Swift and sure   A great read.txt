 I picked this one off my local library's shelf because of the Star Trek books I have read by these authors.  I wondered at first about that, though, because the cover also states the story is "by" Rand Marlis and Christopher Weaver.  But I'll put that on hold for now and hope perhaps sometime in the future I'll get that wonderment solved. Meantime, not to sound like a cliche', but this story's a real page-turner.  I finished it in two days and was delighted to realize there are two more books in this series!  It's filled with uncomplicated tech, peopled with humans *and* aliens whose names one can pronounce without a Universal Translator, and has just enough romance and human interest to keep it all feeling very "real."  In some respects, it's very "Independence Day"-like, but not in all.  We get to hear the alien's point of view, something that can be lacking in "alien invader" stories such as this.  Highly recommended.  May have to make this (and its sequels) a purchase!
