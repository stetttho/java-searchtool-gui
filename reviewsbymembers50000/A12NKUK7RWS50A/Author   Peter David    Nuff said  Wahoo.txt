 I've read the eight reviews here already, and there's just isn't much more I can add.  I gave this book a 4-star rating instead of a 5, simply because I wanted more right away!  Thankfully, I'm getting it as I read book #10 ("Renaissance"), but I fear I'll be left hanging until "Restoration" comes out in paperback.  This is not necessarily a complaint. I love everything about the New Frontier universe.  The characters (and their complex develoment), the lack of worry about TV canon, and the fiendishly delightful plots. Peter's got me on this series, but good.
