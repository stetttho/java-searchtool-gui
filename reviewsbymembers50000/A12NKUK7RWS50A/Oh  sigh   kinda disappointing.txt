 I'm not exactly sure what I was expecting from this novel, but I'm pretty sure it didn't live up to my expectations, if that makes any sense.  Dean Wesley Smith is one of my favorites, and the book's certainly written in his familiar style, but I think he fell short of the mark on this one.  I kept waiting for the story to grip me, but it never did, and I figured it out way before Dix did. I did, however, LOVE the cover.  As I have said in the past, I *do* buy books for their covers, and having met the artist, Sonia Hillios, at Shore Leave at the very time she had finished painting this one, well, I just had to have it when I saw it for sale. But unless you simply must have a complete set of TNG paperbacks or adore the covers like I do, you can skip this one and not be any worse for it. That having been said, I hope Dean gets a chance to try again, because I like the idea of Dixon Hill, and I'm sure Dean does, too.
