 I've been reading some of the other reviews, and I gotta tell ya, I'm wondering just what it *is* people expect from Star Trek!  I'm not saying my bar is set low - though I AM easily entertained, which is something else entirely - I'm just saying some folks have a tendency to nitpick *quite* unnecessarily.  This story is by no means the be-all and end-all of Trek tales, but it IS a decent read - nevermind that bitchin' picture of Seven-of-Nine on the cover!  (Okay, so I buy for the covers as well as the story - this is wrong?) I will admit I have the distinct impression the Section 31 thing is just a trumped-up Paramount ploy to sell books and merchandise, but I'm not going to fault them for that, since it's probably true.  The "aliens in trouble" plot was pretty basic (but the aliens themselves were *purple,* an added bonus that B'Elanna got a unique kick out of) and so was the whole Section 31 plot to kill Seven, but still, I didn't find it an unacceptable story.  And the biggest bonus of all, Dean and Kristine name those rotten alien experimenters from "Scientic Method."  After all they did to the crew, it's about TIME they got a name.  Hey, I'm calling that name canon.  Where's the harm in that?
