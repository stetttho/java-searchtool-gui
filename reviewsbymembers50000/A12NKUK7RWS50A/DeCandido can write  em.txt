 Oh, the beauty of the backstory, the prequel, the whatEVER you want to call it, especially when it comes to novel vs. television.  It gives a writer a goodly amount of space to supply the characters with all the depth and strange habits that make for meaty personalities - something TV viewers might have to wait a long time to see, if they *ever* get to.  And, as has been the case with pretty much every one of Keith DeCandido's novels, the man doesn't disappoint, providing us an excellent and plausible look at how it came to be that Beka Valentine should rescue Dylan Hunt in the pilot episode of "Gene Roddenberry's Andromeda."  Of course, now I really wanna go back and watch that pilot again, armed with this new information.  Nice job, oh Great Hairy One.
