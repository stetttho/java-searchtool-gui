 Peter David gets to do what we all love to do:  color outside the lines,  AND get full approval from The Powers That Be to do so.  While Mr. David  can be a big pompous windbag in person, he sure knows how to pen a  wonderfully satisfying story. When I read a Star Trek novel, I wanna be  entertained, and Peter David's stories entertain me "Rakash."   Oh, sorry.  To discover what "Rakash" means, you gotta read the  book.   Anyway, because of David's outstanding ability to write the  words, I'll forgive him his "windbag-ness" every single  time. For those of you following the New Frontier adventures of Captain  Mackenzie Calhoun and the intrepid but rather whacko crew of the Excalibur,  you will certainly remember the many references to the incident aboard the  U.S.S. Grissom. Well, this here little paperback describes that incident  in full detail.  And believe me, it ain't for the faint of heart. Once  again, the Captain's Table bar sets the stage for Star Trek storytelling,  and Peter David is one of Trek's finest tellers.  Action, adventure,  heartache, revenge, death, destruction, humor, sex, and scandal - this book  has it all and then some.
