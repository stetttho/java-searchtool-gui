 I'm pretty stingy with my stars, so to give this a 5 is saying something, for sure.  And the something I want to say is:  buy this CD. The only reason I bought it myself was because of the *introduction* to "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" I heard on the Ebay commerical.  Turns out the entire CD is magnificent.  You fall into Iz's music without ever knowing you stepped off the edge.  It is worthy of thousands of replays.  I was very sorry to learn this wonderful musician is no longer with us.
