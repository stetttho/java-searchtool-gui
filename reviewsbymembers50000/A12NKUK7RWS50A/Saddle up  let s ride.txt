 I went right to this book from Book Six of the "New Earth" series, because I couldn't wait to read more about OTC Nick Keller and the *Challenger.*  This story did not disappoint me, though there were moments I had trouble getting my head around.  The aliens from the other side of the Gateway were introduced rather abruptly, so it was tough reading for a while.  But I stuck with it, and it was well worth it.  This story has substance and purpose, and it reads like a breeze (well, sometimes a breeze through a stable, but a breeze nonetheless).  You can't beat Diane Carey's writing style, and with this one she's pulled off some mighty good ones. Don't know exactly what it is about Keller, Savannah, Zane, Zoa, and Shucorion, but I'm connecting better with this crowd than I did the New Frontier crew.  Sorry, Peter! The only disappointment for me, I guess, was that the ending made me think I should be reading the "Gateways" series in order rather than skipping around.  No matter, I'm still skipping around.  If it looks like I'm missing something by doing that, oh well.  Won't be the first time. Two warnings:  1) Anyone still hunting for familiar Trek characters (or even familiar Belle Terre characters) will not find them in this book.  On the other hand, if you loved Keller & Crew in Book Six of the "New Earth" series and are looking for more adventures from them, this is definitely the one to read.  2) This apparently ain't the last we'll be hearing of *Challenger.*  And to that I say yee-haw!
