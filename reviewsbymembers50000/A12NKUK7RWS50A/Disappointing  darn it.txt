 Someone once told me Star Trek on television is "fact," the  novels are "fiction," and the fanfic is "fantasy."  That's worked for me - up until Jeri Taylor's novels.  Being a former  executive producer of the show, I was under the impression that Jeri's  novels became "fact," and "Mosaic" did.  This one  canNOT. The set-up, while perfect for storytelling, is woefully unlike  anything Janeway would do.  That is, she leaves her ENTIRE senior staff on  a planet and takes Voyager to negotiations with an alien race.  Of course,  the crew is promptly gassed to unconsciousness and carted off to a squalid,  outdoor prison full of thousands of other poor schmucks.  It is there, in  between their making plans to escape, that they tell each other their  histories.  The ending is typically Trek - too much, too fast. Don't get  me wrong, it's a *great* read.  You just can't consider much of it canon.   Jeri does not seem to take into consideration many details we already know  to be true.  I would think, if you're gonna write about a Trek character's  history, you would be sure to include canon.  But no. Inconsistencies  abound.  This is fiction.  Fiction, fiction, fiction. I guess the only  reason I can think of for why she strayed so far from canon was because she  included healthy, well-adjusted homosexuals in her story - and everyone  knows there are none like that in Starfleet...
