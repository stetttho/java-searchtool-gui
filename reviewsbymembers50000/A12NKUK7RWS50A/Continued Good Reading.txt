 I can't say much in this review of Book 2 of the Starfleet Corps of Engineers that I didn't already say in my review of Book 1.  That is, it's great!  Well-written, believable, and very entertaining, with nods to continuity throughout.  If you're not reading these, or the DS9 re-launch, then you're missing out on some great stuff. An added bonus in the back of this publication is the S.C.E. Minipedia, written by one of the good ones, Keith R.A. DeCandido.  Set up like the Star Trek Encyclopedia, it contains all you'll need to know and more about the persons, places, and things in the S.C.E. universe, which includes, of course, plenty of the canon stuff we've come to know and love.  And for those of you who favor nitpicking, there's an e-mail address where you are invited to send in errors, corrections, or comments if you wish. Win-win, if you ask me.
