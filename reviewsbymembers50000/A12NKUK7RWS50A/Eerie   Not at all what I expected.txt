 I'm a big Gary Larson fan, but I thought this book was a bit much, even  for him.  I understand the point he was trying to make (that is, 'tug at  one thing in nature and you'll find it is connected to everything else'),  but he was waaay too severe with driving it home, particularly that ending.   This is not a bedtime story! On the other hand, if his goal was to set  readers thinking about what we are doing to the environment, even with the  best intentions, and how it may come back to haunt us, then  touche'! Nevertheless, it gave me the willies, and I'm no hothouse  flower.
