 I adore Diane Carey.  She does what every good writer should do, she  "writes what she knows."  She's a sailor, and it shines through  every novel.  Living in Baltimore as I do, where everything's nautical, I  enjoy her stories very, very much.  I know I'll never become a sailor  myself, but it sure is fun reading about sailing in her books!  Who said  you can't learn anything from fiction?  HA! The "Captain's  Table" bar is a good backdrop for this swell Janeway romp through  space unknown, in a ship unknown, with Janeway serving as little more than  deckhand (Ms. Carey told me the exact job title, but I forget what she  said!).  Written from Janeway's point of view, this book allows the reader  to fall right into her head - and heart.  Delicious.  Fun.  Good Stuff.
