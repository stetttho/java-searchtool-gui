 Having little bad to say about anything Star Trek, my review will be biased, but if you watch the television episode and then read this book, you will realize what readers have always known: Books are much better than TV! While the entire script (pretty much) is in this novel, Michael Jan Friedman's and Jeri Taylor's story goes into so much more depth about the aliens and their motivations that you find yourself at least *understanding* why they acted as they did.  A sub-subplot reveals another slice of the Holodoc, and his on-going quest to augment his programming, which is totally absent from the TV episode.  Of course, the Tom & B'Elanna plotline will certainly keep the attention of all the Paris/Torres fans, but that's not all there is to this story.
