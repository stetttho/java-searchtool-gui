 Printed in two-column style, little this book is packed full of goofy but fun references to Destructo Beams and Imagizers, Giant Trundle Spiders and Beings Not From This Universe. And, of course, Constance Goodheart's very good screams. I was disappointed in the photographs, taken as they were  from Voyager's only Proton episodes, "Night," and "Bride of  Chaotica!" and used over and over (all at least twice and several more  times than that). But if you're looking for a harmless bit of sci-fi  fluff and don't mind the $$ for it this one's for you.  Me?   I got mine with a gift certificate!
