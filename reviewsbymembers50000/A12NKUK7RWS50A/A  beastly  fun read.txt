 I must immediately add Doranna Durgin to my short list of favorite Trek authors, and I hope she writes a few more in this universe.  Her writing style is casual and humorous ("Worf Lite," for example.  Read the book to learn what that's about.), and she sticks very close to canon with her characters, particularly with Worf and Riker.  But...that doesn't mean she's afraid to step out of the box and have Picard do something surprising and refreshingly *un*-diplomatic to get the job done.  I was impressed. I had a very nice time visualizing all three kinds of aliens and the various flora and fauna encountered on the great hunt the Tsorans called the "kaphoora."  Add to that plot twists involving sabotage on many levels, and to *that* add Geordi's struggle with alien technology and another one of Data's goofy "experiments" in humanity, and you have a swift and entertaining Next Gen tale.
