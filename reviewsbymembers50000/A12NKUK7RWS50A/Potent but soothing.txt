 If you like the sound of a Native American flute (as was heard in the song "Colors of the Wind," from Disney's "Pochahontas"), then you will enjoy anything done by Burning Sky. Add to it (among other  instruments) percussion, acoustic guitar, rattles and rainsticks, and the  unique sound of the Aboriginal didjeridu, and you'll want to own  "Creation."
