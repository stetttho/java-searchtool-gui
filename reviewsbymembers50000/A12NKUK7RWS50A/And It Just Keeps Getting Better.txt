 Well, here I am again, the rabid fan. But you know what? This story is worth every bit of my foam-mouthed praise, and that's *not* just because it has Roxann Dawson's name on it. Okay, to be perfectly honest, I've never been one for attack strategies and bloody battles, or gory details of survival on inhospitable planets, but I *have* been one to read books with strong female leads. This one fits that profile perfectly. In Andrea Flores, you have an unbelievably strong woman, driven by her grief and her anger to discover why her husband and child were brutally killed before her eyes, turning her life inside out. Now a member of the Tenebrea, an elite fighting force formerly made up strictly of the non-human Jod, Andrea finds the support and the strength she needs to find her answers, and she finds good friends and mentors, as well. But some answers only bring more questions, not only for Andrea, but for readers, too. Add to that the gory details and bloody battles mentioned above, sprinkled liberally with a clone resistance movement, betrayal, and dark secrets from the past, and you have a distinctly *fine* bridge to what is bound to be an incredible ending. I was a little disappointed that Dan Curry didn't do the artwork for this cover, but you can't have everything. Besides, Baltimore is mentioned more in this book than in the first, and that tickles so much, it *more* than makes up for the cover art, which is splendid in its own right, anyway, so what am I going on about?
