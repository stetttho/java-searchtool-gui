 Since most of the other reviews are wordy, I don't have to be.  Yay!  I adore this movie.  I'm a huge ("yooge") fan of The West Wing, and since this film is essentially The West Wing (with a few characters in different roles), I really had no choice.  Hee!  Granted, there are some continuity errors and a couple of "What the. . .?" moments, but what movie doesn't have those?  C'mon, it's Annette Bening and Michael Douglas, ferheavens sake!  I could watch this one 20 times in a row and still not tire of it.  Then again, don't ask me how many times I've watched my West Wing DVD's, okay?
