 Can't say enough about what a good idea was the Starfleet Corps of Engineers.  Heck, since the beginning - since *before* the beginning - even *I've* loved the engineers, and my life is so far removed from engineering as to be laughable, nevermind the fact that I couldn't write technobabble if you paid me. But I'll tell you what, the adventures they find themselves in make for highly entertaining reading.  And the beautiful thing about it is, there really could be no *end* to the adventures.  Certainly, there's going to be an S.C.E., and even more certainly, there's always going to be a situation or two where they will be sorely needed. In this, the first of the eBooks in print, we get four very different stories from five different authors, including three of my all-time favorites:  Christie Golden, Keith R.A. DeCandido, and Dean Wesley Smith.  We are introduced to the flagship of the S.C.E., the *da Vinci,* and its intrepid crew, which includes, in a wonderful nod to continuity, Sonya Gomez, the painfully-green ensign from The Next Generation, who unceremoniously spilled hot chocolate all over Captain Picard in the teaser of the episode, "Q Who." In the ensuing decade or so, Ensign Gomez did, of course, mature into Commander Gomez, first officer aboard the *da Vinci.*  As such, she does her job very, very well.  This, however, makes little difference to those around her, who still tease her at every opportunity about what has come to be known as "the incident."  The fact that this is carried over at all is one of the reasons the S.C.E. is so believable.  You already feel as though you *know* these people - that the S.C.E. has simply always been there. I'll leave it to other reviewers to tell you about the rest of the crew or describe the specific adventures if they so desire.  As for me, I'll just say I'm LOVING these stories.  I've already bought Book 2 and look forward to future editions.
