 I see by past reviews that it's been a while since anyone new read or reviewed this book here at Amazon... I recalled seeing Susan Garrett a number of years ago at Shore Leave, but, like a dunce, I did not purchase her book at that time and have it autographed.  (Hope springs eternal that she will return someday to Shore Leave.) As to the story itself, well, as we know, Detective Knight has been searching for, what, 800 years, for a way to regain his mortality.  He is given quite an interesting way in this finely-written novel - but these things never come without a price.  I found the storyline difficult to follow at first, but once I got the hang of it, it proved to be incredibly intense and very, very clever.  Whether you buy from the bookstore or from the Goodwill, go ahead and get yourself a copy.  You won't be disappointed. And in the meantime, I'll watch for Geraint Wyn Davies in the SciFi Channel's new show, "Tracker."
