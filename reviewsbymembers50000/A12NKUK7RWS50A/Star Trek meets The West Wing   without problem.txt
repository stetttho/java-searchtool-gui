 You're gonna think Keith bought my vote on this one, but I assure you he didn't.  This book clearly shows how much DeCandido adores both Star Trek and The West Wing, and how his bottomless pit of Trek knowledge served him well by giving him the foundation he needed to build a strong, believable story about the politics of the Federation.  (You should realize that not everyone could write a story like this.  In fact, Keith may be the *only* one, and if you've ever had the opportunity to hear him spouting Trek trivia, you'd understand what I'm talkin' about.)  There are no space battles here, so if that's what you're after, you're gonna need to look elsewhere.  Instead, here is a highly-entertaining book full of the complicated political hubbub we LOVE about The West Wing, folded seemlessly into the Star Trek universe - without losing a single thread from either.  (Shout out for Nan's "Big Block of Cheese Day," there, too, Keith.  Well done.)
