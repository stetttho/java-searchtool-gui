 Just gotta gush!  Jeri Taylor is my absolute favorite, and I know her  writing style will be missed on the new season of Voyager.  I hope she  continues to pen the novels, because her stories are magnificent.  We are  given a clear view of Janeway in this book.  The story may make a few  leaps, but the path is still direct from child to captain - to television,  in fact, because some of the "facts" in the book have been  related on screen.  I shall re-read often.
