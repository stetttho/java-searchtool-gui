 I had such hope for this two-book novel, if for nothing else than the delicious cover art.  Unfortunately, it fell short of the mark.  The cover art was pretty much the best thing.  Now, I *know* the story was about characters from the Mirror Universe, most of whom we hadn't ever met before, aside from Intendant Kira and Regent Worf, but I still could not get my head around the characters as written.  This is not necessarily Susan Wright's fault.  She is limited, like all the pro-novelists are, by canon. Some things just *cannot happen,* even in the Mirror Universe. But still, the thing that disappointed me the most (and I guess this *is* Susan Wright's fault), the novel ultimately turned out NOT to be about "the strong women of the Mirror Universe," but was instead a thinly veiled story about Our Girl Not A Borg In This Universe But Still A Mighty Well-Stacked Terran Raised By Cardassians Member Of The Obsidian Order Seven-of-Nine. Sigh...even in the Mirror Universe, she gets top billing.
