 I believe I've said this already, but I think this S.C.E. idea was about the best ever (you GO, DeCandido!), and this next batch was no exception to that idea.  Waiting for the paperbacks puts me woefully behind the eBooks, this I know, but my patience has been consistently rewarded with each new publication. In Book Three, we get eBook stories 9-12, and each one is a separate little thrill ride into the S.C.E. universe.  And I guess what I'm most impressed with is the continuity of character development and growth throughout each author's writing.  That can't be an easy task, especially when the authors are also charged with writing a compelling plot. If you're like me and don't really care for the eBook format, but are interested in learning about the Starfleet team that goes in to clean up the messes, I *highly* recommend these books.  Fast-paced but complex, with great character development and depth. Good job, I say!  Don't stop!
