 The man neatly finishes stories begun in "The Quiet Place (NF #7), and then sends us into a tidy "talespin." In this story, we learn all about Si Cwan's sister and Calhoun's son.  We're also introduced  to a couple of right nasty pieces of work; one called a High Priest and the  other the Black Mass.  Set mostly aboard the starship Excalibur, we are  also treated to much more of the antics of the intrepid crew than we were  in #7, including - but not limited to - love and laughter, joy and hate,  and a certain time-honored function of nature. Let's just hope #9 is  being printed even as I write this.
