 The person from Durham clearly missed the point of this book.  Certainly, Dr. Seuss did not set out to write specifically about "Equality and Justice, "Diversity," or "Activism," but he didn't have to! (Mmm...but upon deeper thought, I think he *did* set out to write about these very issues!)   This is a great little compilation, and doesn't feel forced or faked or "context-less" at all.  If you are upset and if you find this particular book to be simply a marketing ploy, then you're not heeding the Good Doctor: "So be sure when you step.  Step with care and great tact, and remember that Life's A Great Balancing Act." Certainly, I'll buy books by Dr. Seuss.  But I'll buy this one, too, several times.
