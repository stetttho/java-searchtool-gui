 I got myself through this book, only because I kept thinking the next page would draw me in.  But it never did.  Nothing flowed very well, and about the only thing that really held my interest were the essays by the authors at the end. But try as I might, I simply could not envision the inside of this Sphere or what was happening to it, and the story narrative did nothing to help, nevermind the stilted, choppy dialogue. And Scotty, where the heck was Scotty??!!!  Too many mentions of his poor ship, but no sign of my favorite engineer.  I didn't check the timeline, so I don't know if he was already with the Starfleet Corps of Engineers by the time this book was written, but maybe not.  Doesn't matter, he should have been part of this story.  Heck, the S.C.E. should have been here, not the Enterprise! If you ask me, the only characters with any depth at all were made of rock.  Better you simply watch the TNG episode, "Relics," and be done with it.
