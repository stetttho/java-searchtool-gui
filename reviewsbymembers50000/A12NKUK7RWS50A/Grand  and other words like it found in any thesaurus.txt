 As I have been reading this re-launch, it occurred to me (duh) that my beloved characters are growing and changing - some, perhaps, in ways I would prefer them *not* to - but certainly none of them are at the place they were when we last saw Deep Space Nine on the tube. I count this as a good thing, whether I agree with the changes or not.  And that's the whole point of this effort, I believe:  To lengthen and re-shape characters and situations, *not* to have them lie fallow in our memories, but to continue to move forward into events that might not have fit the mold a few years ago. For one, the idea of Bajor actually becoming part of the Federation was like a pipe dream when the show was airing - a dream not everyone embraced.  Now it's a reality, but this brings a new reality to people like Kira, Ro, and Quark, as well - and still, as you would expect, the idea of Bajor being part of the UFP has not been welcomed by everyone. As for the Defiant's mission in the Gamma Quadrant, I can only say here is where the book's title really hits home.  Three (well, four) crewmembers are decidedly changed after being scanned by an alien artifact, and what they must go through to return to their former selves involves leaps of faith and trust that you or I might never dare to attempt. And throughout this novel are hints and whispers of things to come that tug uneasily at the heartstrings.  Too sappy for you?  Too bad!  You're missing a good series if you're not reading this one.
