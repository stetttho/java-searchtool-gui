 Hooray for Christie Golden!  As much as Jeri Taylor strayed from canon in  "Pathways," Golden sticks like glue to it in this book.  Canon  references abound throughout, and there's even one delightful reference to  Seven's role in the WW II simulation during the Hirogen takeover  ("Seven's holodeck stint as a cabaret singer when the ship was under  the command of the Hirogen was something of a legend on Voyager.  The role  had been so out of character for her, it had made more of an impression on  the crew than Tuvok's bartender or Chakotay's American soldier.")  If  you enjoy this sort of thing - which I do - then buy the book! Canon  aside, the story is a completely original Seven tale, with a compelling  plot that weaves hatred and a desire for revenge around a twist that  includes Seven and *real* memories from her time as a Borg drone.  These  memories assault her so viciously that she attempts suicide to stop them.   Ravens also appear, but to learn whether they are good or evil, you gotta  read the book!
