 I don't know enough of the right words to describe this book.  It is a  visual masterpiece, accompanied by glimpses into the twisted mind of Harlan  Ellison via his interpretation of each picture.  Jacek Yerka and Harlan  Ellison:  a perfect match, if you ask me. If you have trouble getting  through some of Ellison's longer works, try this book.  And even if you  HATE Harlan Ellison, try this book.  Nowhere have I seen such hauntingly  wonderful illustrations.  They stick with you.  And sometimes, sometimes,  Ellison's story sticks, too.
