 I think I'll provide the gut-response review, and leave the more cerebral efforts to other reviewers. And what does my gut say?  WELL DONE! The biggest advantage I see, not only in this novel, but with the re-launch itself, is the fact that things can happen without the worry that the next television episode will turn a well-written story into an a/u.  I know, I know, the pro novels were never meant to follow canon, but there were always constraints - constraints that are absent from this series. While some events in this novel are similar in many ways to events I've read in other Trek novels, at no other time has my heart entered in so fully.  That's not to say there's not a goodly amount of destruction and betrayal, but the moments that resonant for me are the ones that involve the tragedies and triumphs of the heart.  I speak of Andorian bondmates, a young woman's posthumous gift of peace, and baseballs in the forest. Applause, applause to Heather Jarman in her first pro effort (though I've  read her before, but I won't say where) and look forward with great expectation to the next in this series.  In fact, I look forward to more pro stuff from Heather, too.
