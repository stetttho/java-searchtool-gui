 It's very interesting, this Captain's Table series, in that each book begins in the bar, but then basically goes the way of the author who wrote it.   I was at first annoyed with all the interruptions (both from  'beings' in the bar listening to Sisko tell the story and by Sisko's own  thoughts), because that's not how the other books are written.  Once I got  over myself about it and just let myself fall into the story, I was fine.   In fact, I found that one alien darned amusing. There were a couple of  editing rough spots, but I dismissed those because it's just silly to  bother. This is a paperback novel, not brain surgery. The Mist are an odd  bunch, and you'll just never guess where they live.  Once again I can  say, the Captain's Table bar is the perfect backdrop for fine Trek  storytelling.
