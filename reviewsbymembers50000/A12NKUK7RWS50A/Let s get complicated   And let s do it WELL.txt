 Would someone just bang me in the eye when I start griping about the Trek "series" books *before* I even crack one cover? I've got to say without doubt the "Gateways" series has been the best so far. While it's not *that* important for you to read them in the order they are numbered, I have found doing so could help to keep sense of the goings-on.  However, since I am *not* reading them in order, I have also found you can still make sense of things, especially if you're familiar with the Big Picture That Is Star Trek. But if you've been needing lessons on how to keep a thousand plot threads in the air at the same time, just ask Keith R.A. DeCandido!  Thanks to the Gateways and a boatload of cleverness, he's all over the galaxy in this novel, and it's a good thing the chapters tell the locations, or otherwise you'd need to make notes. This novel abounds with fine characterizations of the people we love the most (Kira, Nog, Quark, Bashir, Dax, Laren, Yates), a few new ones (Shar, Vaughn, Taran'atar), several we love to hate (Hirogen, Orion, Malon), and a whole host of people on the outside edges that I hope we'll learn more about. Grand adventure awaits, with some mystery and downright confusion thrown in for good measure.  Read the book.   One daring aside:  If you're *really* interested in the re-launch of DS9, don't start with this book.  Go back and start with the two "Avatar" books, then read the DS9 installment of the Section 31 series, titled "Abyss," and THEN read this one.  I guarantee you won't be disappointed.
