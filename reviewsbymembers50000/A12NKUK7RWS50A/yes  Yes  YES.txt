 When I first learned that one of my favorite Star Trek actresses was co-writing the first of a trilogy, I couldn't wait to own it. Didn't matter her writing style or the book's content.  Now that I've got my own autographed hardback copy, my feelings about it have not changed, except to say I *like* her writing style and the book's content.  She and Daniel Graham make a spectacular team. The cover art, by Dan Curry, features the heroine, Andrea Flores, and is dark and quite suitable to the story.  It also happens to be a little-disguised picture of Roxann herself, capturing perfectly the entire feel of the story, which counts for a lot to me.  Yes, I *do* buy books for their covers! I don't know if it was intentional or not, but the similarities between "B'Elanna Torres" and "Andrea Flores" were too numerous to mention (including this rhyming-name thing, which I just now realized).  Others might snort at this point and call me a rabid fan and, well, they'd be right.  But that doesn't diminish the page-turning intensity of this novel. The story opens on Baltimore's Inner Harbor - right where I work.  While it turns into the site of the grisly murders of Andrea's husband and child right before her eyes, it is also the beginning of a very fine tale, one that not only follows Andrea on her rage-filled quest to find out *why,* but also drops clues and promises of much more to come in the next two novels. Consider planetary Alliances, human cloning operations, and something called a "wilderness cloak," and you've got yourself the beginnings of a sweeping story that I can't hardly wait to finish.
