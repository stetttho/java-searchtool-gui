 Just add me to the pile of people shouting praises to this latest work by the Divine Miss M.  Though I'll admit to being a "fair-weather" Bette fan ("The Rose," "Beaches,"), this CD may have  turned it around for me.   A delightful mix of raucous, in-your-face  tunes and soul-wrenching ballads, this CD is a keeper, for sure.
