 Set after the events of "What you Leave Behind," this book makes me glad DS9 ended!  No, no, maybe that's too strong a sentiment, but this novel is sure a long way from some of the other pro Trek novels I've read, and it gets an A+ for continuity.  This one contains resolution on many levels - something the pro novels have notorioiusly lacked up till now.  We learn what became of Worf's brother, Kurn.  We get to feel some of Worf's grief over the death of Jadzia.  We even get to taste the heartache he still carries for K'Ehleyr - even as he now tackles his first job as Klingon Ambassador to the Federation.  Why, this little story is just *packed* with tidbits of continuity and resolution, at the same time delivering a sturdy, believable tale about a race of beings who simply want their planet back.  Not only that, but there's a Glossary of Klingon Terms in the back.  Who could ask for more?  I could!  More, I want more!
