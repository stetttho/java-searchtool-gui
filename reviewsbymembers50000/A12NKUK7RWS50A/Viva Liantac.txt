 ...This slim novel reads just like an episode (an episode *with Zhaan,* BTW), which works fine for me.  For those playing the home game, it's set between "Won't Get Fooled Again," and "The Locket" and is packed with continuity and references to the show - with the added benefit of being privy to everyone's thoughts.  Heck, there's even a nice, obscure little Trek reference in it...P>Rygel loses Moya in a card game on a gambling planet, and Crichton, Zhaan, and D'Argo are forced to work off the debt in order to get Moya back.  Crichton sings Elvis and Aeryn gets blotto.  Mmmm...I daresay there's more going on than meets the eye.  Swell little romp in the Uncharted Territories.
