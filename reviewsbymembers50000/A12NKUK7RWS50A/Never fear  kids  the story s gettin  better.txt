 I *really* enjoyed getting not only some backstory on Kathryn Pulaski, but also some knowledge of what she did *after* she left the Enterprise.  It's nice to have some blanks filled in so expertly! This story increases the  complexity not only of the plotline, but of the virus itself.  Great  character interaction between Dukat and Pulaski.  Good insight into life on  Terok Nor before the Feds stepped in. Another step further along the  twisted double helix of this story.  Let's hope the next one is just as  intriguing.
