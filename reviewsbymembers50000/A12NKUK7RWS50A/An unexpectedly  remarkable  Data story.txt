 Before you open this book, I'd recommend you first brush up on your Trek history by watching your copy of the TOS episode, "Requiem for Methuselah."  Or if you don't own the episode on tape, like I don't, go instead to your handy TOS Companion and the Trek Encyclopedia to read up on it.  You might also want to do the same for the TNG episode, "Measure of a Man," just so you'll have a better list of who's who for this novel.  (Of course, I only had to go as far as the ruthlessly-organized bookshelf upstairs for my tape of "Measure of a Man," but that's something else entirely.)  It's *very* satisfying the way this novel ties these continuity threads together, while at the same time providuing character...growth and change, shall we say? As I glanced over the other reviews, I noticed Joshua Macy's first paragraph - with his comments about it being a mystery, a meditation on immortality, a romance (yup, *romance*), and a bang-up sci-fi adventure all rolled into one - pretty much sums it up, including that part about giving him the shivers. There was a hauntingly-delicious moment for me, very near the end, when Data comes to understand why Picard insisted he not deactiviate his emotion chip.  If it were anyone else, you might yawn with the obviousness, but it's not anyone else - it's *Data.*  He's not supposed to come to these kinds of understandings. Is he? I'd say this book is worth it just for that, but it's not.  It's worth it for FAR more.  Go with your gut:  read this one.
