 Diane Carey *does it* for me.  She spins a great tale, a sidebar to the Double Helix plotline - but, wait a minute, no, it's not a sidebar at all. Much character development in the form of a young ensign who starts  out determined to do everything by the book and then ends up learning that  "by the book" might not get you very far. Great interaction  between our old favorites, Spock and McCoy, and some mighty fine Crusher  moments, as well.  (Her scene with Data and the Romulan guards is  priceless.) Meantime, the plot thickens, the virus twists again, we've  already learned there's a "bad guy," and we're all hating like  heck that he keeps getting away!
