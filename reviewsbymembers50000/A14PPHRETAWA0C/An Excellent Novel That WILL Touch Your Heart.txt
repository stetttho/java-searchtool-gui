 I could not put this book down.  The story is interesting from the first sentence until the very last.  A touching story of a girl that came into the world with nothing but had EVERYTHING in the end.  The book has some comedic appeal; however mostly a life story of an amazing human being.  The novel portrays the difference one human can make to another human, with a little caring involved.  I recommend reading this heart warming novel by Billie Letts.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I did, and always will.
