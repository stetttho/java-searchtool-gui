 John Irving's 'The Cider House Rules: A Screenplay', is not only very enjoying to read, but masterfully written.  It opens the heart of an old doctor, and a young boy and shows what life does to those hearts.  The  characters are equally enjoyable, amusing, and touching as well.  It's hard  to explain such a delight of a book with mere words.  Read it for yourself.   I highly recommend it!   "Good night you princes of Maine, you kings  of New England."
