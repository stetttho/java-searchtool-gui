 Kate Winslet who also starred in Sense and Sensiblity lent her beautiful  voice for this great story.  The story of two sisters who find love and  heartbreak, but also find a stronger friendship within themselves.  If you  liked the movie you'll most likely enjoy this audio book.  It is a MUST for  Kate Winslet fans like myself!!
