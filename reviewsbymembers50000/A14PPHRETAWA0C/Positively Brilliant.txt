 This movie is a must see.  It's absolutely thrilling.  And is also beautiful.  The plot is good, although somewhat confusing if you don't pay  close attention.  The actors are also excellent!  Annette Bening is superb!   Aidan Quinn and Robert Downey Jr. are equally good in this thrill ride of  a film.  If you want to see a great movie, take my advice and watch this  one!
