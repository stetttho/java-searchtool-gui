 I watched this (and bought it) movie recently.  It's very cute indeed.  I must confess the reason I even watched was because the WONDERFUL Kate Winslet lent her beautiful voice for this film.  Though I am glad I checked it out!  If you have young kids, you may want to check it out!  It's brilliant!
