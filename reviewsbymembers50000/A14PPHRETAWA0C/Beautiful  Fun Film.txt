 This movie is fully  enchanting.  They really topped off a great plot when  getting two of the most beautiful actresses available (Sandra Bullock,  Nicole Kidman) to play the parts of Sally and Gillian Owens.  Dianne Wiest  and Stockard Channing play their fun loving aunts.  This movie is excellent  for the whole family.  I recommend this film highly.  It's practical  magic!!!!
