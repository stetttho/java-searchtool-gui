 I first watched this movie in my history class.  The movie is in fact  historically accurate.  There were actual "swing kids" who were  sent to work camps because they listened to swing music.  Swing music was  actually sung and composed by Jewish and black people, who Hitler opposed.   And that is why he and the other HJ (Hitler Jugen) often raided dance  clubs.  At the end the viewer sees Peter at a dance club, dancing alone,  while a beautiful young woman sings in the background.  The song she is  singing is 'Bei Mir Bist du Schon' which was written in Yiddish (a  variation of German) the man who wrote it was in fact Jewish.  This is  Peter's way of saying "You haven't got me!" and that he will not  give in to the Nazis.  I would recommend this movie to all.  Especially to  those who are interested in Nazi Germany.  It has a powerful message.  This  movie includes a younger Noah Wyle and Christian Bale.  See this film!
