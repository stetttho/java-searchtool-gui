 As a native of Pennsylvania I must say that Tawni O'Dell has expressed the true "back road" atmosphere of this beautiful state.  The character development in this novel is excellent.  We are introduced to Harley, who is left to care for his younger sisters while his mother is in jail.  One can easily feel for this boy who is just that; a boy that has not had the chance to actually LIVE.  Every amount of his energy has been given away.  Hopefully you will enjoy this story.  Ms. O'Dell is a brilliant author, and I am anxiously  awaiting her next piece of literary genius.
