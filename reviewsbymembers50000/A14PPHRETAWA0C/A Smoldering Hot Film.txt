 This film is amazing!   The story begins with Ruth (Kate Winslet) who joins a sort of Indian cult.  Her whacky family then hires a very expensive  American deprogrammer, P.J. Waters (Harvey Keitel) to "set her  straight".  Ruth is steamed.  Ruth and P.J. then shack up in a hut in  Australia.  During the 3 days that they're there Ruth and P.J. sleep with  each other (numerous times), and P.J. begins to be deprogrammed by Ruth.   It is a very interesting plot.   Kate Winslet mastered the screen again,  and Harvey Keitel was also brilliant.   I suggest this movie to anyone who  likes to be shocked and thrilled.  SEE THIS FILM!
