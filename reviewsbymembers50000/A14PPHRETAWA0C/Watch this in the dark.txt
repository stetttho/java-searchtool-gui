 This is a great movie to watch while you're alone, and in the dark!   The actors in this creepy film are great.  Geoffrey Rush easily pulls off the  roll as a rich amusement park owner.  Famke Janssen plays his spoiled wife  Evelyn.  This film sends chills up your back as you begin to realize that  this innocent birthday party may turn a funeral party quickly.  If you want  a good spook, watch this film, but remember alone and in the DARK!
