 I really enjoyed this film.  It's a great little romance.  Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant were fabulous, as were the other supporting actors.  The plot was fresh and very cute.  I was either laughing or smiling.  See this  great film.  It is a break away from the "norm" romantic comedy.  Hope you enjoy it as much as I did!
