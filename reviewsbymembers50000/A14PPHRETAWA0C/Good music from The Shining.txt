 I bought this c.d. because it had the song, 'Midnight, the Stars and You', from the horror masterpiece 'THE SHINING'.  As far as I know this is the only album that has the song.  The original soundtrack kept the song out  and replaced it with a song called 'Home'.  Any 'SHINING' fan would  appreciate this find.  'THE SHINING' theme is redone, so it is not the  exact recording from the film.  However, it does sound like it.  The many  other Kubrick films' songs are also very nice.  I believe some may also be  re-recorded.  But it is a very satisfying album indeed.  To any  "hard-core" 'SHINING' fan, I believe this is a true must.   Considering the song 'Midnight, The Stars and You'.  I recommend it for  that reason as well as the fact it's pretty good.
