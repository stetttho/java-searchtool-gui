 Welcome to the world of Tim Burton!  This beautiful film (in message and appearance) stars Johnny Depp and Winona Ryder.  A story of love that could never be; Edward is introduced to a world unlike his own.  Where everyone's house looks the same, and everyone has hands.  This movie lives on in many hearts all over the world.  A tear jerker that will touch you.  Amazing performances add to this great story that you will never forget.  I recommend this film highly.  I would have gave it 10 stars, but unfortunately 5 is the limit.
