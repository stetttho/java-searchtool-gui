 Man!  That Jane Austin knew what she was doing!  This film is beautiful.  Starring my personal favorite; Kate Winslet as Marianne Dashwood.  Emma Thompson and Hugh Grant are BRILLIANT as well.  Alan Rickman plays the timid Colonel Brandon.  A must see for all romantics who thought all was lost because of rejection by a lover.  This is an amazing film!
