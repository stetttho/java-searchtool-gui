 I read this novel about 3 weeks ago.  The novel is about a middle aged woman, dealing with divorce and trying to keep her sanity through it all.  She is trying to hold a job, and also her pre-teenager son's heart.  Beautifully written by Elizabeth Berg.  Excellent portrayal of a real woman.  This novel is worth your time.  Enjoy!
