 We were lured into this restaurant by someone on the street and it turned out to be a great dining experience.  The restaurant is on the 2nd floor and is well-lit, clean, with nice decor.  Service is courteous and prompt and someone is always waiting to clear an empty plate or bring another beer.  The food is very good; the spicy dishes have the right amount of spice.  Particularly good is the lemon chicken and the beef chow fun.  Rice is extra however, which is the first time I've encontered that.
