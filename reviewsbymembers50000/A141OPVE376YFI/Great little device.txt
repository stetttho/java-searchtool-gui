 I'm not going to bore you with the pros and cons of this device.  It's easy to use, sounds great, and the battery lasts quite a while.  The big selling point for me was it could be used with subscription music services, in particular Yahoo Music Unlimited.  It will hold your ripped music.  It will hold your downloaded music.  Where it really shines, though is paired with a subscription service.  No more wondering if the tracks you downloaded are genuine or the fake anti-piracy tracks out there.  Just pick your favorites, legally, and copy them onto the player.  The subscription/DRM (digital rights management) portion is completely transparent.  Once you connect the player to the software the first time you never have to do it again.    A great player with a great music service means a great listening experience.  What more could you ask for?
