 Mom had doubts but Dad (me) thought it would be really cool so we got it.  The kids (toddlers) love it.  It's taken a beating (like the one year old that walks into the walls or yanks on the door flap) but it has held up well.  In fact, the only damage (which isn't really damage) came from Mom trying to fold it up (see below).  Since the design is generic, the house is a great springboard for the kids' imaginations and can be a house, spaceship, submarine, or just a place to fall asleep in. It can be difficult to fold up and it took me a while to get the hang of it (once you do it's a snap).  Mom still can't do it (or refuses to learn - I'm still not sure which) so whenever the kids are done with it I'll find it collapsed but not folded in our home office awaiting my "skills".  The directions are unclear, though a visit to the Playhut website helped a little. A worthwhile purchase - light, portable and durable.  It can't take the abuse of a snap-together plastic house, but it's easily stored and small enough to take on a trip to Nana's house.  The kids love it and it has greater replay value than most of their other Christmas gifts.
