 There should be a description for this product.  Let me clue you in on what you'll get if you buy this.  This is a 256MB upgrade, but it contains 2 128MB RIMMs.  I should have tried to decode the part number. RIMMs need to go in as pairs.  Order one of these and you'll get 1 pair of 128MB RIMMsfor a total of 256MB.  If you want 2 256MB RIMMs (as I did, for a 512MB upgrade) this product is not what you want.
