 Have you gone to the store and priced a 6ft cable?  This cable is the best deal I've seen in USB cables.  I use one of these to connect a computer to a wireless network adapter.  The length of the cable allows me to place the adapter where it gets good reception.  I haven't had any trouble with this cable (or network connectivity) in the months since I bought it.  In fact, I'm on this page buying another one for a printer.  A repeat customer - what better recommendation is there?
