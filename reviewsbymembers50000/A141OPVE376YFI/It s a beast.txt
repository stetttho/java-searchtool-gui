 This is the monster truck of pizza cutters.  Heavy, solid, sharp, it cuts through pizza better than anything I've seen before.  This is a man's pizza cutter.  You could edge your lawn with this thing.  In case you're worried about losing a limb or ruining all the other gadgets you put in the drawer with this, don't be.  The blade guard covers it nicely and fits securely.  Throw away whatever wimpy device you're using now and get this - you won't be sorry.
