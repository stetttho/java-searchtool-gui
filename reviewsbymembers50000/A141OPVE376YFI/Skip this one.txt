 This book does not live up to its potential.  Sure, it had its moments of excitement, but there were little things that kept dragging me out of the book and back to reality.   First, while reading the book I kept thinking, "this reads as if the author is thinking about a possible movie version".  You know those "based on the movie" books?  This reads like one of those, only there is no movie!  A quick search of the Internet turned up a note that the author wrote the book in mind with Harrison ford as the protagonist, David Elliott. Second, the dialog is horrible.  The leader of the group trying to kill Elliott talks in this stilted pseduo-intellectual prose that is ridiculous.  You also have your run of the mill comically idiotic bad guys.  I guess this point covers two flaws: silly dialog and stereotypical characters. I know many people have raved about this book so let me offer some advice.  If you're going to read this book, read it at the beach or on an airplane.  The laundromat would work too.  This books is suited for that sort of time killing mindless reading.
