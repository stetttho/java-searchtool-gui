 I was looking for a thermometer with a remote readout and was reasonably priced.  This one is just what I was looking for.  I've used it on the grill and in the kitchen and it has improved the quality of my finished product.  Before I bought the probe I would overcook the food (erring on the side of safety) and end up with meat that was too dry.  With this thermometer that's no longer the case.  I'm going to address complaints raised by other reviewers.  I haven't had any trouble with the probe.  It's worked fine and the temperature is more accurate than I expected.  It indicates room temperature correctly and when put in boiling water (with the probe not touching the bottom of the pan) it reads 212F.  The food I've cooked using it comes out appropriately done.  The range is a little shorter than I expected but not so short that it's a problem.  In short, I would buy this product again.
