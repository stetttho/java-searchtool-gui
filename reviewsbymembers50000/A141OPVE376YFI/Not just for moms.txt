 I bought this book for my wife for Christmas.  By the time I wrapped it, I had read the whole thing.  I'd pick it up, read a little, laugh a lot, put it down and do other things.  I kept coming back to it and eventually I found I had finished it. Rosenthal's notes are dead on and she writes with a style that makes the most mundane things humorous.  Sort of a Seinfeld for parents, except as parents you'll really understand what she's talking about.  You may even get a little absolution from the book - for example, in a list of confessions she admits she has let sucking the toothpaste off a toothbrush pass as "brushing".  Having kids myself, I can completely understand and picture that situation... Great stuff...it was a perfect stocking stuffer.  Guys, this would be a great book to surprise your wife with for no reason.
