 I needed a mouse to use on my laptop for gaming.  The cordless mouse that came with it just didn't cut it (couldn't transmit fast enough to keep up).  I looked online but couldn't decide so I went down to my local computer superstore.  I spent a considerable amount of time testing the feel of the mice and I ended up with this one.  I went into the store thinking I was going to get the 5 button Logitec MX300 but I walked out with this one (after paying, of course). Why go with the less expensive mouse?  Comfort.  I was willing to pay up to twice what I paid for this one but once I had this one in my hand I knew it was the right one.  The rubber grips on the side and the buttons are very comfortable.  The ridged wheel rolls with just the right effort and has nice positive clicks when spun.  The shape fits perfectly into my hand - I never have to arch my palm to perform any function (like using the scroll wheel).  I just rest my hand on the mouse naturally.  The resolution is 800 dpi so it's very sensitive.  The included software has many nice feature for mapping button presses (for example, left and right together) or key + button press (alt-left click, e.g.) to different functions. The mouse feels sturdy, the cord is long, and it comes with a PS/2 adapter if you don't want to use a USB port.  I'm very happy with it.  Great design + good software + low price = excellent value.
