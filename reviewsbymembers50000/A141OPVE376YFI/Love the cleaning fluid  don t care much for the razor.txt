 I have the Braun 8585 razor; see my review there for my thoughts on that.  I do love the cleaning fluid despite what I think about the razor.  It works great - I've opened the razor after a cleaning cycle and the inside is spotless.  The smell is pleasant too.  Best of all, it lasts.  One cartridge lasts me 3 months.  I only clean my razor when the "normal" light is on, or every 2-3 shaves.  The cost to clean my razor works out to less than $20/year.  That's a bargain to me.  No more brushes or hot running water!  Now if only the razor did a better job...
