 This book had so much potential; interesting ideas and concepts are plentiful in its future world.  Unfortunately, the authors did not develop those ideas and as a result the book reads more like a romance novel. The reviews and descriptions would lead one to believe there is an element of excitement to the book: war, riots, ninjas, pursuit.  As one review put it, "Lenore is in a race for her life against a truly formidable foe."  Well, she's not.  She's largely ignored by the foe except for a brief section.  In fact, there is very little tension throughout the whole book.  There's a lot of exposition and discussion of the characters flaws, too much in fact (the whole thing about Kato's 1st wife could have been removed with no affect on the story or on his development as a character).  It's as if the authors spent so much time on setting up the story they forgot to actually write the story itself (except for that parts that read like a romance novel).   The writing is a bit melodramatic as well...in places I felt the descriptions were worthy of entry in the Bulwer-Lytton fiction contest.   To sum up: no interesting action, over-characterization, occasionally ham-handed writing = avoid this book.  There are too many better books that need to be read.
