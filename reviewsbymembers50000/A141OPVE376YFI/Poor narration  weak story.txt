 I cannot recommend this audiobook for a couple of reasons: - The narrator is horrible.  I listen to audiobooks frequently (I have a long commute) and Harrow sounds as if she just came back from root canal surgery - she cannot enunciate.  I had to listen to one passage several times because I couldn't believe the doctors had been in surgery for 93 hours.  I finally realized she said "nearly three hours".  The audio engineering is poor as well, with uneven sound.  Turn up the sound to hear a soft passage and get blasted when the narrator decides to yell something (Harrow does not realize it is possible to convey shouting without actually shouting).  For the record, I have the CD version and my car has a very nice sound system, so it's not the equipment. - The story is ok to start, but grows implausible as it progresses and gets downright silly at the end.  I'm a fan of "suspension of disbelief" when it comes to fiction, but in a story like this there has to be some grounding in reality.  I don't want to give away any crucial plot points so I can't elaborate...sorry! If you're a Palmer fan or like medical thrillers, pick this up at the library.  Save your money and try something different, like Steve Martin's Shopgirl (read by the author).  There's a great story!
