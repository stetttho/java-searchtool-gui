 I bought this drive as a 2nd drive for video editing.  Installing it couldn't be easier.  The hardest part was opening the case up to screw the drive into its bay.  After the included 4 screws were in, I connected the included SATA cable, plugged in the power connector and closed up the computer.  Maxtor's included utility CD quickly (in less than a minute) got the drive ready to use and I was in business.  The drive has performed flawlessly and the data rates are more than enough for video capture and editing.  I have no complaints about this drive and highly recommend it.
