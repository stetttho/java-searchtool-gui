 For years we had a stovetop popcorn popper that had a handle to turn which stirred the kernels.  It made great popcorn but it finally fell apart.  I bought this to replace it.  It's been a huge hit in our house.  Not only does it make great popcorn but it's great fun to watch it work.  It's so much fun that the movie doesn't start in our house until the popcorn is made.  I tell the kids, "go start the movie and I'll bring in the popcorn."  They won't go - they'd rather watch the popcorn pop first, trying to guess which kernel will be first to pop.  (My oldest son always says he gets it right...amazing!)  The popcorn comes out tasting great - no complaints there.  It's fast too, faster than doing it on the stove.  The unit is easy to clean (with one exception - see below), even though no part of it is dishwasher safe.    Here are some tips on getting the best use from this.  First, as soon as the popcorn is done popping flip it over and remove the base.  Even if you unplug it the base remains quite hot and the popcorn will quickly burn unless you do this.  Second, don't bother melting butter in the top compartment.  It doesn't all melt and it just makes the lid/bowl that much harder to clean.  We butter, salt, and serve the popcorn in separate (dishwasher safe) bowls which really makes this unit easy to clean.  So what are you waiting for?  It's inexpensive and works great.  What more could you ask for?
