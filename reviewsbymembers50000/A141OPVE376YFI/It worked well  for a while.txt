 I bought this to connect a computer in a wireless trouble spot in our house.  I used this item for over a month and finally returned it.  It worked great for the first couple of weeks, but then I started losing the connection.  I couldn't figure out why the signal strength would go from "Excellent" to "Poor".  It didn't coincide with any electrical device being used in the house - in fact, sometimes the connection would disappear late at night when everyone else was sleeping.  There was no way to bring back the connection except wait.  I tried resetting the passwords on them, unplugging them for a while, even swapping them.  No luck.  The connection would be restored...eventually.  IOGEAR's website is not very helpful at all either, so I just returned the product.  I still needed a network connection so I went with a Linksys USB wireless adapter with a 16' USB cable.  The length of the cable allowed me to find a spot where I could maintain a solid wireless connection.  Since I've done that, no problems!
