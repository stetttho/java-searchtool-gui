 I've paired this headset with a BlackBerry 7100t and they work great together.  The headset is trivally easy to use.  Hold the button to turn it on.  Press the button to answer or end a call.  Hold the button to turn it off.  The volume control adjusts the volume on the BlackBerry itself so I can hear the other party just fine.  A previous reviewer stated the headset and handset have separate volume controls which is not the case, at least on my phone.  I have not had one single complaint from people about the volume of my voice.  I just speak in a normal conversational tone.  The microphone is so sensitive my wife can hear when I have the turn signal on in the car.  The "windstop" technology seems to help too, over wind or air conditioning.  I haven't tested the range out to 30 feet but I regularly go 15 feet away from the handset without issue.  Battery life seems fine.  After talking for a few hours I just recharge it overnight.  The headset is comfortable enough.  I wouldn't wear it all day, and after a couple of hours it's nice to take off.  It is a little tricky to figure out just how it's supposed to go over your ear, but once you get that down it's secure.  I think the reason some have complained the headset won't stay on is impatience or a child-sized ear.  For the price you're not going to find anything better, and this is certainly better than products costing much more.  Low price + good performance = value, and that's what you get with this headset.
