 Let's cut to the chase:  This is a great little TV.  Here's why: - It mounts very solidly under the kitchen cabinet, with 4 screws that go through the bottom of the cabinet.  You can't see the screw heads if you have shelf paper.  You can also mount the unit vertically (on a wall like a picture) if you'd like. - It's unobtrusive.  Our cabinet has a 1 1/4" lip and the TV doesn't extend much below it. - Many input options.  There is a coax jack for cable or antenna, and 2 A/V inputs (3 RCA jacks each) for connecting a VCR, input from a wireless security camera, baby video monitor, etc. - 12V DC input means you can, with appropriate adapter (not included), use this in the car.  It also has a 12V DC out jack so you can daisy chain devices. - Picture is very sharp and bright; I was watching a hockey game and could see the puck from across the kitchen.  The viewing angle of the screen is a bit narrow, though the screen pivots in all directions so it is easy to adjust for best picture.  I have no complaints about the screen size. - Remote has all the features you'll need, except velcro.  We use velcro to store the remote under the cabinet next to the TV. - Sound is adequate; it's about what you'd expect from 2 small speakers pointed down at the counter top. The hardest part of setting this up was running the cable to the TV.  Fortunately we have crown moulding and I was able to tuck the cable under that.  Total installation time from unpacking to completion (including running the cable) was under 2 hours. This is really a cool little device and one of the best birthday gifts I've had in recent memory.  I was lusting after it all during football season; now that I have it I'm not disappointed!
