 Pastor Hagee has done it again!  This book doesn't include his opinions; his words are from the Word of God.  The book clearly reveals that Israel is the absolute center time piece to Bible prophecy.  It uncovers many of the myths about Jews that Christians have believed for so long.  The book distinguishes between Israel and the Church.  Neither replaces the other as many are falsely teaching.  I may receive criticism for this but I'm not here to be applauded by people.  This book clearly reveals that the Church does not go through the tribulation.  I agree with the Pre-Trib position because the tribulation is a time when God deals with Israel again, not the church.  God picks up with Israel again where He left off before the Church was born when Christ was cut off (crucified) but not for Himself.  Once the church is raptured, God will deal with Israel again so the Jewish people will finally recognize their Messiah. This book is a must read if you're wanting to know the truth.  Don't pass this one up!
