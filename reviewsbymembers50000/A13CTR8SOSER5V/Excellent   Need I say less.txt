 Pastor Hagee gives a clear understanding of the book of Daniel, a book in the Bible not everyone has a clear understanding of.  He clearly outlines end time events and defends the Pre-Trib Rapture of the church.  It brings hope and glory.  For the believer, the best is yet to come.  If there's a book to read this year, "From Daniel to Doomsday" is it.
