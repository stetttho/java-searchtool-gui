 David Jeremiah has done an outstanding job in his book "Escape the Coming Night."  If you don't understand the book of Revelation, this book is a must-read for you.  Even if you understand Revelation, you're not wasting your time with this book because you still get many things out of it you never thought of before.  Don't pass on by the book shelf without passing this one up!
