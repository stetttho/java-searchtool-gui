 "His Glory Revealed" picks up where Pastor Hagee's book "Final Dawn Over Jerusalem" left off.  "Final Dawn Over Jerusalem" briefly reviews the seven feasts of the Lord while "His Glory Revealed" fully opens up the meaning of the feast of the Lord and how they apply to the Church.  I have a greater love and appreciation for the Jewish people after reading this book.  Afterall, Jesus said "Salvation is of the Jews."  Read this devotional over and over (It takes seven weeks to read it) and pass it on to others or buy another copy to give to others.  If you're confused about end time events or hold an incorrect position on the end time events, this book clears up the confusion, provided you're willing to change your false view to the truth.
