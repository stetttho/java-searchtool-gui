 Tim Lahaye's "Rapture Under Attack" gets it point across as it's intended to.  There are many revisionists who are rewriting America's history and sad to say, there are revisionists who are rewriting some past Bible scholars' histories.  These past great men of God lived in a time when there were not as many false teachers, at least they hadn't come out of the closet yet.  You owe it to yourself to read this book and get on track that the church does not go through the tribulation.  The purpose of the tribulation is for: 1)God to deal with Israel again, to pick up where He left off before the church was born, 2)to punish the wicked or ungodly, and 3)to give millions of people who haven't heard the Gospel of Jesus Christ a chance to be saved.  No one gets to hear the Gospel twice until they've heard it once.  The 144,000 Jews from Israel will be proclaiming the good news.  There's no reason for the church (true born-again believers) to go thorough the tribulation, otherwise known as hell on earth.  Glory!  Buy this book.  If you're still not convinced, well, I don't know what to tell you.
