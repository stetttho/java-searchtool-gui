 When I first started reading Pastor Hagee's book "The beginning of the End", I must admit it was a little slow in the beginning.  However, it picked up rapidly after that and I couldn't put the book down.  This book will give any reader a clear understanding of events of the end times.  For believers it brings great hope to know the church will be taken out before the horrible world events take place.  Glory!  I highly recommend this book; I recently bought this book for someone else.  If you're into reading books, don't overlook this one!
