 Of all the the books I've read on Revelation, this is by far the best one yet.  Tim Lahaye has done a fine job of making the book of Revelation simple.  There were some finer points in the book I couldn't agree but at least he's willing to admit that not everyone will agree with those finer details.  If you don't understand Revelation, get this book!  Revelation is a favorite of mine in the Bible.  Stephen King couldn't put together the horrors that will happen in the end times!  Accept Jesus Christ as your personal Savior today and begin your walk with Him, not just to escape the coming world events but because He will change your life.  Tim Lahaye stresses that in his book and I couldn't agree more.
