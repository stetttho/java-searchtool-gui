 This book is a follow up to Pastor Hagee's book "The beginning of the End."  The book immediately grabbed my attention as Pastor Hagee parallels our government with Israel's kingdom 2300 years ago.  It's sad but true!  The book covers all the witchcraft from the White House to the Church House and everything in between.  The final chapter closes with what you as a believer in Jesus Christ can do to stand up for what's right.  It's a must read for today's society.  Most Americans are simply not aware of all the deception that is rampid in this country.  Like Pastor Hagee's previous book you don't want to overlook this book!
