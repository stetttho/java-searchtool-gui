 I disagree with the viewer from Cambrige Ontario. I found this version lovely! Samantha Morton was excellent (I need to see "Emma" now), reserved, thoughtful, just as Jane was in the book. Jane had high emotions  but did not strike out often...the childhood was a small part of the book,  and though important, it is not the major part of the story. The  relationship with Bessie and Helen and Mrs Reed are important as well. I  found this version to be just fine, and I am going to buy it!
