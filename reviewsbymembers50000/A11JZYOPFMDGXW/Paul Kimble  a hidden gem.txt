 I gave this a 4 because I have not yet heard all of the songs -- only 5 or so of them. I like "Crawl"'s folk feel and Paul's voice sounds great! The best thing though is the production that's so reminiscient of GLB's Mighty Joe Moon and Copperopolis that apparently Grant Lee Phillips rejected once Paul had split ways with them. GLB turned more pop and lost that heavier quality that I loved so much. But then, here it is, resurrected! Paul really delivers on the sound. I really like "Candy" -- it is a bit more gritty but there's that wonderful piano in the background that just sounds so deep and ominous. I'm not as much into 70's sounding tunes overall, but I liked Paul's efforts on the Velvet Goldmine soundtrack. I disagree with the review which says he's selfish here: no, I think he's talented and has a very distinct sound which I've never heard anywhere else. He's never really had the attention he deserves. Maybe he's an acquired taste for some, but he's always been delicious to me.
