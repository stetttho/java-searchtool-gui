 When JOC debuted I was totally hooked on their songs, playing them over and over again. I felt a spiritual awakening as this Christian music wasn't like the old boring stuff of yesteryear but had an alternative edge and great message.  Much Afraid was less of a delight for me, and I found it somewhat depressing. Some great tunes shone through, like "Weighed Down." If I Left the Zoo was a disaster, and like the reviewer below, I vowed I could never enjoy JOC again. This was a sad day for me as I'd hailed JOC as the greatest Christian band of its time. I even saw them in concert during their "Bubblemaker" tour in 1997 and they were very cool to see. So it was with great hesitence that I gave this CD a listen. I admit I have a very critical ear toward JOC now. The songs were good, but nothing amazing. I didn't get chills from any of the tunes or find any enlightenment in the lyrics. The music is simply good -- not bad, not great. All in all, disappointing, but mostly disappointing because the lyrics could be about anything or anyone. There is no Gospel message here. While listening to this CD I got the distinct impression that JOC was courting mainstream radio and seeking mainstream hits and acceptance. Whether or not it's true, it was my impression.  Their lyrics used to be far more powerful, insightful. They made you think, and they had basis in Scripture. I don't need for a band to mention Jesus every three seconds, but JOC seems to have gone too far off to the other side, a more neutral, non offesnive, yet also non interesting realm.  It's fine for a nice rock album, but I need more meat with my potatoes.
