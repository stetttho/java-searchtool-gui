 This little book is so much fun to read I could not put it down. One after another the chapters kept me going. After all, I wanted to be SuperWoman just in case any of these situations should arise. I had always wondered how to performa tracheotomy and now I know how! It's not all that difficult if you have a pen on you:) Some items weren't life-threatening or life-saving, like how to do a wheelie with your car, but all were extremely interesting. What a wonderful conversation piece. Who hasn't wondered about at least some of these situations? I feel much more informed and ready to take on an alligator...
