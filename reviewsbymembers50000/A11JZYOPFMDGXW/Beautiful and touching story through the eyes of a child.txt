 I just finished reading To Kill a Mockingbird and found it both gripping and moving. I could not put it down. It is said that "it's a sin to kill a mockingbird" because mockingbirds don't hurt anyone, they just  sing for you. This title and theme is weaved throughout the novel: when  Scout is about to kill an insect and Jem stops her because "it's not  bothering you"...when Tom Robinson is on trial and his self esteem and  his humanity is killed by the ignorant members of the towneven though all  he ever did was help people..and finally the resolution of the story  surrounding Boo Radley. This is a fantastic read. I recommend that  student take the time to read it instead of renting the film because it  isn't hard to get through, the language is very straightforward and you  won't find yourself frustrated and tearing your hair out (especialy if you  dislike reading).
