 The title of this book really caught my eye when I was perusing store shelves this evening and I ended up in a cozy chair in the back of the bookstore totally absorbed in this fantastic read. Mary Newton Bruder is a natural at writing about the importance of grammar without making the  reader feel like a big idiot for not knowing all there is to know. She  provides humour, like "Typos for the Weak" (those little  weirdnesses that happen with spell-check;-) and she helps the reader  strengthen their chops by featuring fun quizes throughout the book. The  bottom inch or so of almost every page is dedicated to a Weird Word: a word  that a reader didn't know the correct spelling, meaning, or pronounciation  of and had to ask the author to clue them in on it. I enjoyed Mary  Newton Bruder's style, it was very laid back and humourous, forgiving and  understanding, while that it IS important to have decent grammar in today's  world. I admit, I need this book! I don't think anyone will feel they are  being lectured or put down in any way, or made to feel stupid. This book  embraces people at all levels of skill and encourages all of us to make an  effort to improve communication and honor the English language while  keeping the tone light and fun.
