 I have owned this film on video for about 10 years now and I NEVER get sick of watching it. I own the soundtrack as well which is just gorgeous. What a completely perfect film. My favourite scene is where George Emerson  is running back to the Pensione in the rain...ahhhhhh! On clear days I  think of him in the tree screaming "BEAUTY! JOY!". This film  endures, it is one of the most lovely films I have ever seen, if not the  most lovely. It always makes me feel good to watch it, and it is so  romantic!
