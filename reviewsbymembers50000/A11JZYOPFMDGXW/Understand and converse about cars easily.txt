 I got this book from my local library and soon decided it MUST be added to my collection. A great reference book, "Everything Women Always Wanted to Know about Cars..." speaks to women plainly and frankly without  making us seem "stupid" or "girlie". There are pictures  and diagrams of under the hood shots showing what the parts are called and  where they usually reside. The author tackles the area of car buying and  how salesmen relate to female buyers, what tricks they use, how society in  general feels about women who drive. There are quotes from real women about  how they feel about and in their cars, what cars they like the most, what a  car represents to them, how cars aren't just for guys anymore! Some women  name their cars and love to joyride; some women take on mechanical areas  with ease and great interest. Women tell it like it is on everything from  what a car says about its driver to how to get men to take you seriously  when buying, selling, dealing with mechanics etc. This book covers just  about everything you need to know (hence the accurate title!) as a woman  and a driver. It answers the questions you just felt too insecure to ask  your father, brother or boyfriend about cars. The colors and organization  are attractive but not "too feminine" and the author presents not  only a woman's perspective of the automotive world, but lots of technical  terms and information as well. You are going to understand cars and be able  to hold your own in conversations about cars after you read this book! I  have searched far and wide for a book such as this and it's a one of a kind  find, an absolute GEM!
