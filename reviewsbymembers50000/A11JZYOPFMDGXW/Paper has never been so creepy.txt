 I checked this book out at a local bookstore and when I got to the page with the spider I was so terrified I was rooted to the spot. I actually was so scared I could not move for a minute. I had to close the book, breathe deeply and relax. I didn't expect to have that happen as I am not especially terrified of spiders (I just don't enjoy them, really) -- so watch out! If you don't already have a phobia when you open the book, you may have when you put it down. It's a well crafted book, fun and thrilling.
