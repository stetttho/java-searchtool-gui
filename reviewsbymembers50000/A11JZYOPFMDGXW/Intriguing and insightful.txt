 I have Anne Lamott's book, Bird by Bird. It is trulyinspirational, and I love the way Annie sounds like she is sittingdown to tea or coffee with you. I saw Traveling Mercies in the bookstore and picked it up and ended up standing there in front of the display, totally captivated. I love Anne Lamott's writing style, the way she expresses just what she thinks and feels but you never feel like she's forcing it on you or teaching you a Lesson. It's simply who she is and she is sharing it for those who are interested. I can find myself agreeing heartily on some points, shaking my head no on others and laughing all the way through. I saw a clip of her reading a part of this book and it was just delightful to hear her inflections, her little lisp at times, and the comforting sound of her voice. It truly was like sitting across from her, sipping that latte or whatever and being completely enveloped in the grace of a great storyteller and the honesty of one of God's eloquent children.
