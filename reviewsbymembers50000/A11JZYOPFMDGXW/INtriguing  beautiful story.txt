 I admit I rented Bumblebee because Janeane Garafalo and Elijah Wood are in it. I wasn't sure what to expect, but was soon absorbed in the story of Barney Snow (Wood) a teenager with no memory who has agreed to participate  in experimental therapy administered by Garafalo and a group of doctors at  an Institute housing terminally ill young people. Barney is the only person  there who is not dying, but he is having haunting visions of being in a car  accident. He befriends a couple of the patients who turn out to be as  vitally important to Barney and the audience as Barney himself. We are  drawn in and held tight as this movie slowly opens doors for Barney and  reveals the truth about his past and his identity. I found the entire last  quarter of the film gripping and poignant. I am sorry I did not get to  experience this film in a theatre properly, but it translates well on video  nonetheless. It blew me away. My only complaint is Rachael Leigh Cook as  Barney's love interest and teh sister of a patient at the Institute. She  does not seem to have much to do with the story at all, which is mildly  annoying. I would have liked to see her character have more depth and  purpose especially since she interacts with Barney closely in the last half  of the film. Overall, The Bumblebee Flies Anyway is a sweet film that stays  with you long after the credits roll and I am going to purchase it as soon  as the price lowers from 100 dollars:)FYI: The title refers to the  bumblebee's ability to fly even though it should not be able to due to its  body size and tiny wing span.
