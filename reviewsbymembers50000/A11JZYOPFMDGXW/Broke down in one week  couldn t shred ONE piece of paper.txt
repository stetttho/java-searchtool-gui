 I cleaned out all of my old financial statements and needed to shred them. Sounds simple enough, right? This shredder should be able to handle say, 3 pieces of paper at a time? Nope! This shredder handled 2 at a time with complaints and I finally gave up and fed it one sheet at a time until 2 days later, it got so clogged it stopped working all together. I have been trying to clean out the cutterhead and make it work again, but no dice. The shredder is strange: it "groans" as you use it, like the motor just can't handle the paper. It also "snaps" and "pops" because as the cutter turns, the plastic top gets pushed upwards and then "snaps" and makes a big popping noise as it goes back down. I kept wondering if the plastic was going to break. The safety flap broke off when I was emptying the can, as well. This is my second shredder and I'm not a power shredder. I try to be gentle with it, I don't even put as many sheets as the manufacturer says it can handle. I let it rest (it will get very hot after about 5-10 minutes of use and stops working until it cools down), I oil it. I think this is just a shoddy shredder and I strongly recommend you simply buy from another company. I actually feel weird complaining about it but hey, it's a shredder -- it's *supposed* to shred things. I don't think I should feel like I abused it by simply asking it to do what I bought it to do.
