 I'm sure we're all well aware of the reason most of us buy or rent this movie so I won't spend too much time there.  Needless to say, that was the reason I saw it and I was reasonably surprised at what a fantastic movie it was. In all honesty the nudity is a good device to reel you in but never reaches a level that I would call gratuitous. All parties involved do a great job here including Hugh Grant in the first role I've actually liked him in.  Sam Neill as the libertinous artist Norman Lindsay is the perfect foil to Grant's sexually frustrated Rev. Anthony Campion.  Seeing these to go up against eachother is hilarious in a dry sort of way.  It doesn't take much to push Campion's buttons as Lindsay discovers and you can scarcely imagine what he does with this newfound knowledge. The story is kind of dry and slow-paced and at times deeply introspective in that way that art films can get.  But these things aside, it was surprisingly good film.  Rent it for the Elle Macpherson factor (or Portia de Rossi whichever your preference) enjoy it for its irreverence.
