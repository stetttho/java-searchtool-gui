 To say this movie was a disappointment would be a colossal understatement. Truthfully, I didn't hold high hopes going into it but I've been surprised before. Needless to say "Blair Witch 2" was not one of those scenarios. My reasons for having faith in a sequel were the amazing legacy of its predecessor "The Blair Witch Project" and the news that documentarian Joe Berlinger would direct this time around. Outside of those two things, however, the outlook looked pretty bleak. That's the one area in which this movie didn't disappoint. What's so bad about this movie? Answer: Whatta ya got. I couldn't possibly chronicle all of its sins in this space but what I will do is run down some of the more obvious ones. First of all there's the acting, which, say what you will about the first film, but this new cast makes Heather, Josh, and Mike look like Academy award material. Then there's the writing which is bad enough on its own but coupled with the acting it sounds even worse, if you can imagine such a thing. Now onto the plot, which is all over the board. There's no direction so in that respect playing chutes and ladders offers more structure. And lastly, it has a rushed feeling which is perceptible to everyone who watches it. It is painfully evident that "Book of Shadows" was pushed through production as fast as possible to insure that it made it to theaters before the gravy train that was the "Blair Witch Project" came to a halt. In summation, there is absolutely no redeeming value to "Blair Witch 2". Don't buy it, don't rent it, don't even look at the lobby card.  This movie is deplorable!
