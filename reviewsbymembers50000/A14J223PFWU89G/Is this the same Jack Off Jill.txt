 Hearing "Clear Hearts Grey Flowers" and "Sexless Demons and Scars" back to back one would be hard pressed to tell they were even recorded by the same artist.  Where "Sexless Demons" is a stripped down, raw, punk rock album "Clear Hearts" is a more soulful pop oriented offering.  And by pop I mean the kind of music you can still chop the heads off your Barbies and scrawl pentagrams on your notebook to. Jessicka has refined her vocal range and displays it nicely here. Her bloodcurdling screech and sickly sweet innocent little girl purr are still present but they take a back seat to more plaintive, sorrowful vocalizations.  With the expressiveness of her voice and the intonation she puts on the lyrics she manages to wring every little bit of meaning out of her words. Their lyrical content doesn't seem to have changed much between the two albums but, again, there's a more desperate/futile quality to it.  As yet more evidence of this new tone is their cover of The Cure's "Love Song" which appears as a secret track. All of this is still backed by their telltale hard driving rythms but at the same time they too convey this melancholy. "Clear Hearts Grey Flowers" is a crossover hit for Jack Off Jill which should appeal to goth fans (think Switchblade Symphony) and mainstream pop-punk (those of you who buy into Hole)lovers alike.
