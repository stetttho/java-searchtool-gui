 Sonny Barger has lived the life and "Hell's Angel" chronicles it all.  From the moment I began reading I found it hard to put down.  Few other books have inspired that much anticipation in me. While never truly romanticizing the 1%'er lifestyle it still holds an appeal that is undeniable, which is to say that those close to the subject will understandably get the most out of this while the rest of us will still find it a remarkably engrossing read.  I was surprised to find that not very many books on the Hell's Angels and other associated clubs have been written, and of those that have most are of the expose/tabloid variety.  Sonny on the other hand lays it all out in a very plain, unapologetic manner.  He doesn't seek your approval just tells it how it is without ever acknowledging the right or wrong of his actions.  "Hell's Angel" is not an indictment of his personal values or those of the Hell's Angels themselves. At times, though, "Hell's Angel" has a tendency to meander out of chronological order and which gets kind of confusing but it usually becomes obvious after a few minutes of reading just exactly where the event in question took place.   This is a must have for any Americana lover out there so do yourself a favor, don't wait, go out and buy this book right now.
