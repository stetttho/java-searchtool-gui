 This is one of the most distasteful films ever made. Having said that, its reputation is legendary even beyond the scope of the sexploitation label under which it falls. "Ilsa" from start to finish is a collection of gruesome but highly inventive (if improbable) torture sequences held together by the thinnest of plots. The scenes in question would have been tasteless enough on their own but all of this is conducted in a Nazi concentration camp under the guise of medical experimentation. It leaves one to wonder if the bad breast implants that Thorne and several of the other actresses were sporting were the experiments that they were trying to perfect, but I digress. Just the thought of using the holocaust as a vehicle for a sexploitation story is enough to turn most people off, but in truth the events in "Ilsa" are far removed from the realities of WWII era Germany. The filmakers went a long way in making that distinction. If you're completely jaded, such as myself, and think that nothing is too sacred to make fun of then you'll probably find a lot of entertainment in "Ilsa". There's enough camp in it (intentional and not so) to offset the horrors onscreen. Ultimately, this is a perfect film for guys night, but if you're the slightest bit squeamish rent a "women in prison" movie instead.
