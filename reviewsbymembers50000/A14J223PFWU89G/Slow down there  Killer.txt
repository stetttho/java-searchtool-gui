 There are no words to describe how sensationally violent this film is.  I've heard a lot of critics try to attribute some sort of social commentary to it to justify their love of this movie.  In truth, "Man Bites Dog" is only a black comedy.  No pertinent social or psychological implications, no lampooning of sacred cows, just a simple comedy that happens to have a serial killer as its protagonist. Shot in black & white this mocumentary-style comedy treads ground where few others have dared and fewer still have done so with as much intelligence as Belvaux and Poelvoorde.  "Man Bites Dog" showcases some of the most genuinely shocking moments ever committed to film and presents them in a very matter-of-fact deadpan style.  Some may find this to be the most disturbing part of this film, even more so than the acts themselves. Along with having the honor of being one of the most unrepentantly brutal films of all time it also provides more than its fair share of hysterically funny moments.  A perfect example of this is when Ben's film crew runs into some friends of theirs who happen to be documenting a rival serial killer. It's classically comedic moments like these that make this such an incredible film. In short, "Man Bites Dog" has the distinction of being one of only a handful of intelligently written films of this sort.  For further explorations in this vein try McNaughton's "Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer" but whatever you do skip Oliver Stone's "Natural Born Killers" unless watching a three hour music video is your idea of a good time.
