 "Die Toten Weg" is some of the most beautiful gothic music I've heard in a long while. I've been waiting for this CD for some time now and was quite frankly worried that it wouldn't live up to my expectations. Thankfully my fears were unfounded. The musicianship is amazing with precise darkly toned compositions. Their sound is reminiscent of early eighties synthpop. The influence is undeniable right down to the heavy use of synth, electronic percussion, and complete lack of guitar or bass. All elements taken into account, I can see why some people may have given Fockewolf a negative review. The songs here are kind of samey, but my thought is if the songs are good to begin with then similarity isn't really a negative. I think the problem with a lot of music is the lack of this kind of consistency. Severina's vocals are hauntingly familiar too, evoking images of Souixsie Souix or Beth Gibbons. Her range is something of wonder as she spans from lilting highs to smoky cabaret-style tones.  In short, "Die Toten Weg" is one of the most impeccably tight darkwave albums to come out in a long, long while. If you're into heavy synth infused goth music then Fockewolf is just your style.
