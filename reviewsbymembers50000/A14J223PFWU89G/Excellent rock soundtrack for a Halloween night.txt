 I am lucky enough to own most of this material on their "Trick or Treat" 7" but if you aren't one of the 1000 to have either this or the subsequent "promotional" CD version, then "Empathy" is just what you've been waiting for. The material on disc one is comprised mostly of covers culled from various tribute albums put out by Cleopatra records over the years. If you're strictly an EHC fan and aren't fond of the gothic/darkwave genre then here you go, all EHC covers put onto one convenient little disc. It also contains a little sample of their latest release and the previously unreleased cover of INXS's "Devil Inside". The second disc is a Halloween medley containing the previously hard to find "Trick or Treat" stuff. Their cover of the theme from "Halloween" is spot-on and blends seemlessly into the rest of the songs on this disc. I would have preferred that this disc be divided into individual tracks and not just one big medley, however. Their cover of Type O Negative's "Black No.1" is one of my favorite songs here and I can't skip ahead to it without holding down the fast forward button on my CD player. Also, this disc comes minus the Leaether Strip remix of "Incubus" which was on the original vinyl release. All in all "Empathy for the Devil" is a great collection of songs predominately for EHC's fans and it's a great display of the sense of humor and fun that this band possesses.
