 Heed the editorial review above if you're big on high quality picture and sound.  Otherwise, I imagine this film to be in much the same condition now as it was for audiences in the 60's.  The DVD format doesn't really bring anything to the final product but I would think owning a copy that is almost guaranteed never to ware out would be reason enought to purchase it.  If it's not, then the extra features such as the deleted scenes, theatrical trailers to coming attractions, and gallery of exploitation art and radio spots should suffice to cement your resolve. Okay, now that I have gotten past the technical mumbo jumbo I can move on to the good stuff.  The story here is a tried and true vehicle.  People go to castle to take sleazy pictures, owner of castle believes he's the reincarnation of a 17th century executioner, begins bumping off models in increasingly inventive ways, and hilarity ensues.  Mickey Hargitay is outrageously over the top as Travis Anderson (aka the Crimson Executioner).  His acting here, if you can call it that, makes William Shatner look subdued by comparison.  The dialog is characteristically naive, which is to say that people's reactions to situations are a bit unrealistic to say the least.  You'll also get a kick out of the supposed Inquisition era torture devices that the Crimson Executioner uses to torment his unwitting victims. All around this movie is superb.  Its sub par acting and other shortcomings are incidental to its sheer entertainment value.  Something Weird video has done a great service in digging up these forgotten films and revamping them.  For that they should be commended.
