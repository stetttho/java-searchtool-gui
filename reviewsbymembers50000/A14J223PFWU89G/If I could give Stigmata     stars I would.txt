 There aren't enough words in the English language to describe what an atrocious piece of crap this movie is.  To call it a monumental disappointment is an understatement. First of all it was promoted as an "Exorcist" styled psychological chiller.  Naturally I was psyched to see it based on that but in truth "Stigmata" is nothing like the "Exorcist" in story, style, or quality.  After seeing it it was obvious that this comparison was merely a shameless promotional scheme meant to deliberately deceive the viewer. Furthermore, and not the least of its problems, was the casting. Gabriel Byrne was fantastic, as usual, even with the dull material he had to work with.  I swear the guy must be an alchemist but instead of turning lead into gold he achieves the same result with garbage.  Patricia Arquette on the other hand could suck the life out of an Ed Wood production.  She's the only actress I can think of that's guilty of underacting and here she is with top billing!  All the while they had Portia de Rossi in the cast who's an extraordinary and capable actress, despide credits the likes of Ally McBeal and Scream 2, and she's in the movie for less than twenty minutes.  I defy you to find the logic in this. So what we have here is a miserable addition to the "end times" cadre of films that experienced a mercifully short life in '99.  It had a few chilling visuals but in the end it utterly squandered any potential it may have had.  You can bury this right next to "End of Days" for all I care.
