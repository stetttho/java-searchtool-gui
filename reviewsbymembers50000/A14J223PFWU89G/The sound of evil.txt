 "Burn Baby Burn" is the debut album from this self professed Satanic "electro-glam" band and to date it's their best effort yet. Where subsequent releases have been nothing less than excellent, "Burn Baby Burn" just has that special "something" that keeps me coming back. "B3" is steeped in themes of psychedelia, sadomasochism, and Satanic doctrine to name a few. Heavy synth, danceable beats, and eighties metal style solo guitar alongside Rev. Thorne's razor edged vocals give the EHC a sound the likes of which I've never before heard. All this is delivered in their trademark brand of black humor. The music at times seems almost to belie the nature of the songs. This paradox defines the very heart of the Church of Satan and in this respect Thorne and company make the most logical choice for the Church's musical mouthpiece. So what you have here is a masterful collection of delightfully evil tunes with enough of an infernal edge to keep them from becoming too kitschy. "Burn Baby Burn" is definitely their strongest outing but don't write them off completely. I would suggest listening to their albums in order, as listening to them out of chronological order sort of dilutes their musical progression and may even turn some people off.
