 What more can you say when you preface a review with that title. Murder City Devils are pure old-school punk at its best, which is to say, three minute or less in-your-face, snotty, drunken, chaos fueled anthems. "In Name and Blood" is the latest release from the Seattle based six piece and the quality hasn't faltered a bit on any of them.  The ever present rebel-rock attitude is still strong with them and in that respect is reminiscent of 50's rock and roll on a certain level while Leslie Hardy's work on Farfisa adds kind of a New Wave feel.  All of this is wrapped up in Spencer's frantic rantings at the helm. The instrumentation is tight (as well as punk can be) on all three CD's by the Devils so one would be hard pressed to choose a favorite.  My advice: don't try, just get them all.
