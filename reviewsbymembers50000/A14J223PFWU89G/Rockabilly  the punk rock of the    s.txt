 It's as I've said time and time again: Punk was to the eighties what rockabilly was to the fifties, and this compilation proves it.  True, punk was more politically fueled and the social mores of the two decades are in stark contrast to one another, but rebellion is rebellion no matter what label you put on it. In actuality "Whistle Bait" covers the 50's through the 60's and in so doing represents some of the finest artists in this genre as well as encompassing the changing attitudes from one generation to the next.  In the course of one CD you hear from such household names as Carl Perkins, and Ronnie Self to slightly lesser knows like Larry Collins.  Crossover artists such as country legends Johnny Cash, Joe Maphis, and Werly Fairburn are also fairly represented here. In total "Whistle Bait" is the most comprehensive collection of Rockabilly tracks on one CD.  There's something here for everybody, from the edgy and rebellious to poppy and upbeat.  This CD is so complete in its focus I almost thought Rhino Records was responsible for it.   If you love, or even like, 50's rock you absolutely must buy this CD.  Also make a note to check out the companion piece, "Ain't I'm a Dog".
