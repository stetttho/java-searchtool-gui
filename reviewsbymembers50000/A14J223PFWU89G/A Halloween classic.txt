 Part of the appeal of "Midnight Hour" is that it's a good, fun Halloween film for the entire family but also enjoys an almost cult status among the adult set. Though not ultimately destined for a place in the Horror Hall of Fame I look at it like this: "Midnight Hour" is like that baseball player who's a hometown hero but never achieves recognition outside those who grew up watching him. Hope that makes sense. The story is pretty cliche. A bunch of teenagers find a scroll in a museum that will raise the dead when read aloud in a cemetary on Halloween night. They do and hilarity ensues. I hung out with a pretty diverse bunch in high school but I never knew anyone who's idea of fun was getting together to read musty old incantations. Anyway, what follows next is B-movie actors getting zombified for the duration of the movie until the curse can be broken. What I love most about this movie, though, is its encompassing of age old tradition and classic seasonal imagery. This is partly why it has become inextricably linked with my memories of Halloween. If you're looking for an enjoyable movie with a fun, if a bit formula plot, for your Halloween party then it doesn't get much better than "Midnight Hour". Thank Anchor Bay for bringing this rare Halloween gem back to prominence.
