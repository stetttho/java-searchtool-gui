 Based on the scant extra features shown above I would have to guess the answer is "nothing". I would say freeze frame but that comes with your DVD player already so it doesn't count. "Little Witches" is little more than a two hour stream of unimaginative fluff, bad acting, bad writing, bad editing, gratuitous nudity, and even more bad acting. This movie is so bad that one so inclined would find it hard to last long enough to see any of the aforementioned nudity, which I assure you is no reason to buy this movie.   I find it hard to find any redeeming factors in "Little Witches". I can't even bring myself to make any up. There are some performances by noteworthy B-list actors such as Jack Nance, Zelda Rubinstein, and Jennifer Rubin in roles they'd probably rather forget about. Unfortunately this movie held the distincion of being the late Jack Nance's last performance.  On a more amusing note, indie actress Clea DuVall (of Girl,Interrupted fame) has a few memorable scenes which she'll have a hard time justifying now.   I've watched a lot of bad movies for sheer entertainment value but "Little Witches" had none of that.
