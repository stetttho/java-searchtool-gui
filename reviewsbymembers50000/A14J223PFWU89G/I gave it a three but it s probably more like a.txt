 Well, you get what you pay for when you purchase a title like "The Curious Dr. Humpp". That said, it's not a terrible movie as it does achieve the number one goal that every film should aspire to and that is to entertain. The problem with "Dr. Humpp" as I see it is not with the movie itself, as it is with the American distributer, Jerald Intrater. When the production sought American distribution Intrater picked it up but wasn't confident that it could stand on its own as an exploitation flick so he filmed a whopping SEVENTEEN minutes of additional nude footage so it could be shown on the "adult" circuit. The liner notes credit Intrater with bridging these new scenes nicely with the original product but they are far from flawless. It also doesn't help that nearly thirteen of those seventeen minutes come right at the beginning of the film. You get about two minutes of setup before being launched into thirteen minutes of sex scenes with no dialog! This aside, the main body of the film is still intact and is, as I mentioned, rather entertaining. Aldo Barbero does a fantastic job as the sexually domineering Dr. Humpp, and Ricardo Bauleo is shockingly blase as the investigative reporter on the case. Something Weird Video makes "The Curious Dr. Humpp" a worthwhile DVD acquisition for those who enjoyed it on video. It's packed with extra features. More than I've seen on most recent movies even. It is evident that they've gone out of their way to bring the viewer the most comprehensive representation of this film so far.
