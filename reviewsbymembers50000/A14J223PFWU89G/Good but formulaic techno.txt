 My title pretty much sums it up.  Don't get me wrong, I love the Lords but their brand of techno is pretty standard fare. The tracks on "Voodoo U" are typical of the Lords' cutesy/naughty subject matter with plenty of songs about drugs & sex.  I can't, however, help but notice a departure from the slightly more edgy tone of prior releases such as "Lust".  They seem to have downplayed the hard edged techno feel of their subsequent albums in favor of a more accessible dancepop bent.  Their lyrical content seems to have lightened up a bit too but not by much.  Always intent on dwelling on the raunchy end of things, the Lords have taken it a step further here and entered into high camp.   All things considered, "Voodoo U" is not a bad effort.  It's a little cheesy and mainstream but still nasty enough to insure that it will never make it to alternative radio.  The songs, like I mentioned, are pretty textbook but when it comes to sex-music the Lords are second to none.
