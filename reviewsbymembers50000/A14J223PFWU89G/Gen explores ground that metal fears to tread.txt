 While not the most auspicious start "120 Days.." at least puts the Gen's on the map. Indeed, those who bought "Sin City" first will notice a vast difference in style. While the latter is more of a full, well rounded sound, the former of the two has a stark, minimalist quality. In simple terms it is pretty much just straight metal. Not particularly innovative musically, "120 Days.." strengths lie in thematic elements which are heretofor virtually unheard of in typical metal circles. Gen sets her band apart from the herd by infusing their sound with elements of TRUE fetishism, not the typical adolescent sex/death fantasies that riddle the lyrical content of countless other metal acts. In short, metal fans will hate this album, goth fans will hate this album, and Genitorturers loyalists might not love it but they'll learn to like it. It may be of little interest to the detractors of this release but their sound has matured a lot in the five years between this and their latest effort as "Sin City" can attest, and their potential keeps expanding. And as far as live performances go the Genitorturers are unparalleled so don't write them off until you've seen them in the flesh (literally).
