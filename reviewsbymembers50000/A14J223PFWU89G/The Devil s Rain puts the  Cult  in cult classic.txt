 God, I remember seeing this movie as a kid.  The next time I saw it was about a year ago curtesy of Joe Bob Briggs.  I had forgotten what a great movie this was.  Great in the cult sense that is. "The Devil's Rain" has a good, if somewhat trite, story.  But it's a tried and true formula so how can you go wrong with that? The performances aren't all that bad given the motley crew of actors they've assembled here.  Even Bill Shatner adds a splendid understated performance, not often giving vent to bouts of dramatics.  And what can you say about Ernest Borgnine as the Devil's disciple?  Priceless!  The only actor I didn't get was John Travolta.  He gets billed in the credits but he's not even a really a character.  Indeed, you don't even see him in the film unless you're specifically looking for him. All this from the guy who brought us the classic "The Abominable Dr. Phibes".  Though "Devil's Rain" doesn't quite live up to the standards of the aforementioned flick it's still a decent movie and is genuinely entertaining.  You'll even notice Anton LaVey in the credits under technical advisor.  Hard to imagine,though, since he criticised "The Exorcist" that he'd want to jump on board for this. It's good to see that such a great,yet, virtually forgotten film can see new life on DVD.
