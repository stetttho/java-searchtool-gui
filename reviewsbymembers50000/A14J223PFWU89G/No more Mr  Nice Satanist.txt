 "Witness.." was a far cry from what I was expecting of EHC's latest release.  That said, it was still pretty good but suffers from poor production due to the shoddy conditions of Venom's personal recording studio.  Even Rev. Thorne complained of the archaic equipment which, as I understand it, is one of many mounting problems which  has led to the current rift between EHC and Venom.  What that means to the listener is that it is hard to find an acceptable listening balance on this CD.  I usually turn the treble down a little so that the bass is just slightly higher.  This will cut down  a little bit on the tinny quality.   On the upside, it is a more raw direction which may please those with a predilection more towards the oldschool days of black metal.  It is however completely lacking any sense of irony that most fans of the EHC have come to expect from them.  This is the most serious I've ever know them to be, even more so than the darkly malevolent "Kiss the Goat" release.   On the whole, "Witness the Millenium" is not a bad effort, especially for a CD whose slated release was postponed almost a full year.  To fully appreciate where they're going with this new sound my advice would be to start at the beginning with "Burn,Baby,Burn" and work your way up.
