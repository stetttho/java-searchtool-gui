 I just bought this CD off of amazon and have been listening to it in my car for the past two days. While they are no Misfits and not really as edgy as Dinah's first band 45 Grave I would still consider them a four star band. Musically speaking they aren't very innovative and I can see how Dinah's discordant vocals might not be everyones bag. But then if this kind of music wasn't your thing I really doubt you'd even be faced with the dilemma of buying a CD by a band under the dubious moniker of "Penis Flytrap" anyway. I guess people are calling this kind of music Horror Metal or Death Rock now. Jeez five years ago these guys would have just gone under the label of punk. Their sound is much more Christian Death than Samhain. Anyhow, they have enough campy Creature Feature references to keep a pop culture fiend such as myself satiated and whenever I listen to them I feel like I'm in the eighth grade watching Faces of Death at my friend J's house all over again. Good times, good times.
