 What Marilyn Manson lacked in musical direction they made up for in glitz and sheer screw-your-conventional-opinions attitude. This is, in my opinion, their finest effort. It's a shame that a year or so later they would abandon all of the elements that set them apart in the first place. "Portrait" is a muddled beast, never really punk, not quite metal, but it succeeds thematically in spite of its shirking of categorization. It takes a rather insouciant approach to themes of child abuse, drug use, and Satanism that they haven't touched on since. It was exactly this type of ribbing of sacred cows that got people to take notice and affix a label to this new movement. Thus "Shock Rock" was born. These days Mr. Manson is still about attacking popular opinion but in a more serious manner. Their latest effort has a couple of songs that hark back to the sensibility of "Portrait" but they never completely give themselves over to it.  "Portrait of an American" family has a carnivalesque feel to it largely due to influences ranging from the obvious, Anton LaVey, to the strange, Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory, and on into the cliche, Charles Manson. The allure of Marilyn Manson was that no one before them had drawn upon these sources all at once. Love him or hate him, Marilyn Manson plays the Devil's music and unlike a lot of bands today who pilfer the imagery and feign anti-christian sentiments for popularity, HE actually pays the Devil his due.
