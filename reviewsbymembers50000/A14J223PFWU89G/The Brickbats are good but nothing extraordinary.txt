 I feel I must first preface this review by saying that I have been searching high and low for this CD for the past two years or so.  Given that, maybe there was no way possible for it to achieve the level of my expectation.  I'll let you decide that, but I wasn't all that impressed. All the write-ups I've read about the Brickbats boast a blend of surf-rock and gothic musical influences.  Upon listening to "Creepy Crawly" these elements are only hinted at really and not plainly evident.  In other words you really have to listen for it or already be a fan of either genre.  I just didn't find the mix exceptional.  In fact, there is more of a pop-punk atmosphere here than anything else.  This mentality coupled with their embracing of horror movie themes and stereotypical gothic attire might conjure up images of The Misfits but the music on "Creepy Crawly" puts them more in the neighborhood of bands like Doppleganger. All things considered I didn't dislike "Creepy Crawly".  Sure I was a little let down but there are still some decent songs on the CD.  "Undead Rock & Roll Music" for instance is an ripping good punk anthem that stands out from the rest of the tracks.  Brickbats provide a good soundtrack for an all ages Halloween party. But if you're looking for more intelligent, richly textured horror-rock I'd suggest to you Stiffs, Inc. over the Brickbats.
