 It's kind of hard to be objective about a CD when it's by one of your favorite bands so here goes.  "Sin City" is one of the tightest collections of songs I've heard in a long while.  Not to sound too much like a professional reviewer... but, you know, sometimes you'll buy a CD by a band and though most of the songs are pretty good there's one or two that sound like they half-[effort] it.  You'll have none of that here. This new release is a vast improvement over "120 Days..." not that there was anything inherently wrong with it, but it was much more straightforward metal.  "Sin City" definitely benefits from better production values and just generally has more texture and depth to it. The sound, for those so inclined, is hard to pin down as it doesn't fit neatly into any category but Darkwave/Industrial is a stab in the right direction if a bit quaint.  Generally speaking, if you're a metalhead the Genitorturers may not be hard enough for you, and if you're a batcaver they're probably too heavy for your sensibilities.
