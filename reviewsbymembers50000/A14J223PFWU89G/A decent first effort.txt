 I have to first start out by admonishing the politicking by both sides in the reviews of this book.  It's unprofessional, very misleading and ultimately doesn't have any place here.  And I'm a member of the site in question which is why I'm equally disappointed by the fellow SG-ers who've taken it upon themselves to throw off the grading curve by unobjectively praising the book when the request that was made by the site was simply to review it, not wax poetic about it.  Anyway, that said I liked the book.  But I'd be lying if I said I loved it.  The photography was all well and good.  Good lighting, etc.  But as one reviewer stated before me it was just pictures of naked girls.  There was no real visual panache to it.  In a way it seemed like somewhat of a self-congratulatory piece.  Especially since all the photography was taken by Missy who's actually done some spectacular work that wasn't included here.  Not to mention that the site boasts the visual talents of Lithium Picnic.  As such this book left a little to be desired.  And it may just be a gripe exclusive to me but what is with the postcard size, one image to a page format?    I did however really like the interviews and journal excerpts in the last section of the book.  I might have interspersed them throughout the book scrapbook-style, but that's just me.    All told it was a laudable first effort.  Improvements could be made, sure.  But I think it sets a good precedent that I hope they expand on with additional works in the future.
