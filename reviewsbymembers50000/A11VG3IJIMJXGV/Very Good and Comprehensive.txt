 There's a sea of girl's books out there, and I'm determined to weed through each.  Katie Meier's book has a long title, and surprisingly covers a lot - spirituality, body image, peer pressure, and more.  Very similar to most non-fiction girl's books, Meier gives the advice in a big sister way.  What separates this book from others?  It actually goes into scripture and is not afraid to be frank about religion, as well.  That in itself, unlike a lot of girl's non-fiction books which shy away from one of the most important aspect in a girl's life (their emotional and spiritual side), makes this book true to itself and 5 stars.  Other girls books that do not shy away from being true - the Gifted Girls Series and the Gutsy Girls books.
