 Like many, I'm just an amateur photographer.  If you are using the standard 18-55mm lens that accompanies the Canon EOS Digital Rebel kit, you've probably discovered how slow the lens is.  With a f/3.5-5.6 aperture, the lens is better suited for outdoor photos where natural lighting is available.  With indoor photos, I've found myself using the built-in flash repeatedly, thus drowning out a lot of the natural color.  This was particularly true with photographs of people.  Thus, I sought out a high quality lens, high speed lens -- this is definitely one you'll want in your lens collection.  The 50mm size best simulates a person's visual perspective, so it tends to avoid the type of distortion apparent in wide angle photos.  The distortion is rather minor, but more pronounced when you use 28mm or wider.  If you are accustomed to using a wide angle lens, you need to be forewarned that your perspective appears extremely narrow when using a 50mm lens.  Be sure to take a look at a 50mm lens in person and make sure that you are okay with it.  Overall, Canon quality is unsurpassed and my photos come out clear and much brighter as a result of the lens' speed.  I've tested other brands and occasionally, you face incompatibility problems.  Often, you end up wishing that you didn't buy an off brand anyway, so I've learned to avoid long term regrets about why I didn't buy a dedicated Canon product.  Life is too short -- save up your money and buy top quality equipment.  You won't waste time second-guessing your decisions!
