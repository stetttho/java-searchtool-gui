 While I love the American Girls, this doll was so small, it doesn't compare to the regular American Girls dolls that American Girls are known for.  The book on the making of the movie was not very informative.  It's better off being a dvd or being part of the dvd.  I don't know why they made a book on the making of the movie nowadays when this is usually in the dvd itself.  As for the doll, get the larger version instead.
