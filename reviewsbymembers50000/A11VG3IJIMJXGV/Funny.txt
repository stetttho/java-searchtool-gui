 If you didn't know it, Jenny Carroll is Meg Cabot.  1-800-Where-R-You is funny and the main character, Jess, sounds like a grungy, tougher Mia from Princess Diaries.  It's written like a mystery, but Jess narrates.  She's a wise-cracking unpopular girl who lives in Indiana with her best friend Ruth.  When she gets hit by lightning, she beomes sorta psychic.  She can locate missing children.  That's the basis of the series.  I love the writing, and the characters come alive, but at times, I felt this could use more action.  In other words, the pacing is slower and longer than I would like.  It reminds me of girl's books/tv series like Tru Calling, Fearless, the Mediator, and the Medium.
