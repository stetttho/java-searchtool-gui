 Smallville's 3rd Season is full of ups and downs.  The episodes here are among the very best in terms of emotional challenges.  I recorded all the episodes on TIVO, but have to have the DVD collection, too so I can hear the commentaries and special features.  I especially loved hearing about the director's commentaries in this DVD for 2 episodes.  You also get to hear the colorful commentaries from Michael Rosenblum (who plays Lex) and Allison Mack (who plays Chloe).  There are a lot more deleted scenes to see in this DVD than in Season 2 and 1.  Disappointing to not hear from Tom Welling or Kristin Kreuk (my absolutely favorite actor) in this DVD.  But, and I say, but, there are a lot of commentary by Michael, Allison, and the directors about Tom and Kristin, especially wonderful things to hear about Kristin.  There is a particularly long segment on the Chloe Chronicles, which had a particularly long and confusing (almost boring) sequence completely in silence and as a comic book.  This part did not make sense at all, and seemed corny.  Not as well-done as in Season 2 (with the segment on special effects a real treat), but if you're a Smallville fan, this is a must-have in your personal library.
