 Through anecdotes and interactivity, this workbook helps girls realize how beautiful they are just as they are.  In God's eyes, they are as beautiful as Cinderella.  At times poignant, this book delves deep into sensitive issue, but they are handled nicely.  Very positive and affirming like the Gifted Girls series and Let's Talk.
