 Tim Burton's Nightmare Before Christmas is imaginative and sweet.  Not too frightening so that children under 5 will not be able to enjoy this movie, but exciting enough to keep the attention of all ages.  The cgi artists did an excellent job creating the entire style and look to the story.  It is like watching a storybook come alive in 3D.  A real treat for this Halloween piece is the music and voice of Danny Elfman as the well-intentioned, but innocent Jack.  Enjoy this film anytime you want a treat and add it to your collection of children's films like James and the Giant Peach, Toy Story, and A Bug's Life.
