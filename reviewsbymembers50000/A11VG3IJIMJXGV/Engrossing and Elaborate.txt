 The first book in Tamora Pierce's Daughter of the Lioness book, Trickster's Choice tells of Aliane or Aly, who lives in Totall, and is taught swordplay and code-breaking at a royal court.  A long novel, complete with maps, Totall historic deeds, and a story or a saga full of adventure, romance, and mystery.  At first, it may take a while to learn the map and people in this engrossing world, but once you do, the world is as alive as Earthsea by Ursula Le Guin.  A great fantasy series with strong girl protagonists, Daughter of the Lioness is a good read for anyone who loves Lord of the Rings, Eragon, and of course Earthsea.
