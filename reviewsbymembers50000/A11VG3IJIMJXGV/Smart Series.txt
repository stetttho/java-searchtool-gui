 If you can revisit a town full of smart colorful, quirky characters every single week, you would watch the Gilmore Girls.  If you missed any of the episode or would like to watch the episodes over and over again (like I do) so you can catch the witty dialogue, you would get this DVD collection covering the first two seasons.  And it is well-worth getting the DVD just to be able to feel transported into that small town cozy banter anytime you feel like it rather than wait for a rerun.
