 How can Smallville's producer's disappoint their loyal fans?  We kept watching, drawn to the original basis of the series - Clark and Lana, his relationship with his parents, changing friendship with Lex, and his development into a superhero.  Instead, they bring in out of nowhere an annoying Lois Lane, cousin of Chloe.  Lois starts off coming to Smallville to find out about Chloe's "death".  Turns out Chloe is alive, so Lois, who thinks she's so much better than hick town Smallville, decides to live in Smallville.  She ditches college and pushes herself on the financially struggling Kents, who are bent on keeping Clark's superpower secrets.  Instead of living with her cousin Chloe, whom she is so close to, she moves in, uninvited, into the Kent's farm and kicks Clark out of his own room.  How can anyone believe this?????  The core of the series still lies in Clark and Lana.  Lana has a new boyfriend, and Clark gets involved with a psycho ex-convict.    Some strong episodes like Lex getting split into Evil Lex and Good Lex, Lana becomes possessed by a powerful witch and fights Clark with superpowers, and the season finale.    Not at all up to Smallville's standards because the storyline is dragged way down when they brought in Lois.  Who cares about Lois anyways?  It seems only the now fat and less creative producers.
