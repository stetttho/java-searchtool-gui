 I'm a drama major and belong to my church's acting group.  We're going to be ambitious this year and try to perform parts of all Shakespeare's plays.  Rather than getting a bunch of plays at the bookstore, it was easier for us to download this ebook version since it allows printing and marking up of pages.  This ebook is easy to read and contains links to lots of critiques, Shakespeare facts, whatever that helped us understand the play.  A Midsummer Night's Dream is a delightful play with several characters.  A play within a play makes this Shakespeare play full of fun and fancy.  If you intend to mark your play or would like to get interactive in studying of Shakespeare (like I do) I recommend the Sparklesoup Classics version of Shakespeare.
