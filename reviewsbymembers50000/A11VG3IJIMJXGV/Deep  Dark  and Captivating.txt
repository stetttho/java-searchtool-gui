 Thora Birch and Scarlett Johanson shines as recent high school graduates who are undergoing a transition to the "adult" or grown-up world.  Scarlett Johanson has moved onto working at a coffee shop (like Starbucks???) and getting her own apartment.  Meanwhile, Thora Birch as Enid is still playing pranks on unsuspecting strangers and stuck in art class she must repeat in summer school.  A case in character study, Enid, a lost ghost in this world, who view others as "losers" ultimately gets a dose of her own medicine and finds out her cynical, critical views had made her one of the biggest losers of all.  Wonderfully told film of a story that appears dark and cynical itself, but is really a morality lesson.
