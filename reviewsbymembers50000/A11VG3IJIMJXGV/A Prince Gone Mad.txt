 I love stories with princesses and princes - usually they're like Cinderella.  Shakespeare's Hamlet is the opposite.  It is about a prince whose fairy tale life is turned upside down from bad to worse.  Hamlet is a classic, and a play most high schools, college theaters, and regional theater will produce.  It seems any actor, willing to challenge their acting skills will tackle the complex role of Hamlet.  You can download and print some of the best monologues for actors from this play.  Along the best tragedies with Othello, Romeo and Juliet, Julius Caesar, and King Lear.
