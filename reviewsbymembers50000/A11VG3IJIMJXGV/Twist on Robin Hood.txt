 Rowan Hood, the daughter of legendary outlaw Robin Hood lives in Sherwood Forest just like her father.  Just like her father, she cannot stand when a big rich king bullies someone poor.  In this case, it is her new friend, Princess Etty.  A pretty good book by Nancy Springer, Outlaw Princess showed good promise for a new twist on Robin Hood.
