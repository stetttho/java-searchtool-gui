 There is always a place you want to call your own.  In this film adaptation of a beloved children's classic, that place is a garden hidden away on the estate of a bitter widower and his sickly son.  With the arrival of a young orphan to the estate, the long neglected garden becomes the sanctuary for the young orphan and soon her care of the garden brings new life to those around her.  Beautifully filmed and acted.  The garden appears magical and as scenic as any pastoral painting.
