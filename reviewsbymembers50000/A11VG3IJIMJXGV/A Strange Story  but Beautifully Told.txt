 One of Tim Burton's earlier films that showed the budding filmmaker's unique style and voice, Edward Scissorhands also featured a young Johnny Depp and Winona Ryder early in their careers.  The start of Johnny Depp's choice of quirky characters and collaboration with Tim Burton, Edward Scissorhands told a story of a lonely boy born with scissors for hands.  Of course Johnny Depp brought much sensitivity and vulnerability to a role that barely had any dialogue.  Winona Ryder is pretty and sweet as the girl next door who befriends Edward.  Quirky but cute.  If you are not a Johnny Depp or Tim Burton fan, you will be after seeing Sleepy Hollow where years later, both Depp and Burton has developed more of their talent.
