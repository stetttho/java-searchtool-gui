 I have all the Smallville books, and I found this book one of the weaker ones.  Set in the beginning of Smallville (First Season), Colon has almost completely ignored the relationships forged in the first season television show.  Yes, Clark and Lex are friends, but that is the extent of anything Smallville.  In this book, Clark runs away and lives in the city with a ragtag bunch of runaways.  He gets involve in their criminal ways, and falls for one of the runaways, a grungy tough street girl.  There is very little mention of Lex, Chloe, Lana or Pete.  But worse, Clark seems out of character.  In most cases, when Clark is out of character, he is affected by red kryptonite or even kryptonite.  Here, there isn't kryptonite to affect him, but he acts reckless and irresponsible.  For Smallville fans, this is a letdown.
