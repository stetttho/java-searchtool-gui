 You will be suck into this self-involved book series if you are into gossip.  You don't get a sense of depth in any of the characters, but at the same time, you don't care to.  They are the object of gossip, so you only get the superficial surface-level information about each character so they are meaningful only in their use.  As a reader, you become part of a "Mean Girls" culture, reveling in the juicy and not very nice gossip of others.  But, it is entertaining, if you like to hear gossip about and from the superrich, superspoil gossip girls who would befriend you only to gossip behind your back.  Maybe a good gossip magazine like People would be better.
