 I remember coming across a picture of the famous painting of a Dutch girl with a pearl earring.  I didn't know the story behind the painting.  Like the Red Violin, this film gives you an appreciation for the object of art by going behind the scenes to its origins.  The set and costumes are appropriate for the period, similar to the paintings of the times in color and tone.  The acting by Scarlet Johansson as the Dutch servant girl who becomes the muse to Colin Firth's artist is subtle, but powerful.  Not much is said between the two actors, but you can feel everything their characters are feeling.  I must admit I have not read the book so I wouldn't know how true it is to the book.  However, for a film, this is a treat.
