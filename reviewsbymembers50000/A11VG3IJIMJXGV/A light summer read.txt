 Phil Doran's dry humor is evident in this light-hearted romp under the Tuscan sun.  The story sounds predictable with an American writer escaping to Italy impulsively buying a fixer-upper in the country.  Sounds familiar?  Sounds like the plot for Under the Tuscan Sun, only this version is from a man who has the knack for comedy.  Doran is the writer and producer of the tv hit Wonder Years.  The Reluctant Tuscan has the feel of Peter Mayle's travel diaries but with more story than diary.  Would be great for a light summer read.
