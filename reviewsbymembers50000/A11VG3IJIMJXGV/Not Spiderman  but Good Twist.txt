 Spiderman as a father?  And his offspring is a daughter?  Can a father be more protective?  An interesting twist on the popular Spiderman comic books and now movies, Spider-Girl is a logical sequel for the next generation crowd.  Like Spiderman, she has all the powers, and like Spiderman, she has all his problems, too - including his old enemies.  Maybe this may get more girls to read comics, graphic novels, or books about strong superheroines, but maybe it may cause diehard Spiderman fans who want to see Spiderman forever youthful without a child to cringe.  Nevertheless, with few really good superheroines out there besides Wonder Woman, Buffy, Queen B Superheroine, or Elektra, Spiderman's daughter may just catch on.
