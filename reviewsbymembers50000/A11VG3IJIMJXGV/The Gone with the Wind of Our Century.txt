 I read the Lord of the Ring Trilogy back in high school.  It was one of the longest books around.  I could not imagine how the books would be like as a film series.  This LOTR is beyond imagination.  The sets are majestic, and the storytelling is not disappointing at all.  While it is difficult to adapt an epic book series into a film, this version is an engrossing eye candy, made by a master filmmaker.
