 Before you purchase anything larger, you should consider at least 3 key factors:  (1) determine your actual capacity needs; (2) look at the speed of the Compact Flash card; and (3) choose a reputable brand known for high quality.  I use a Canon S500 camera, which takes 5.0MB pictures.  I thought that I needed a 1GB card, but after going on vacation, I found that this card holds plenty of photos to fulfill my needs.  Generally speaking, it can hold about 190 photos on one card, possibly more if I decrease the resolution.  I purchased 2 of these cards to be safe, just in case I either lost the card, damaged it, or if it somehow malfunctioned.  Having 2 separate cards, I won't lose my all of my photos if something goes wrong.  I can take nearly 400 photos on 2 of these cards.  I can't remember the last time I ever took that many photos on one outing.  Also look at the speed of the Compact Flash card.  This one is amongst the fastest available on the market, even faster than the Ultra II series.  Transfer rates on other cards are approximately 25% slower, yet cost about the same.  This card is not only a good value, Lexar is a high-quality, reputable company.  Generic brands pose a real risk of malfunctioning, which is the last thing you'd want to leave to chance with your prized digital photos.
