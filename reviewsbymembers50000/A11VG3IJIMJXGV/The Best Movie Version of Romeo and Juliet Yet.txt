 Romeo and Juliet has been remade over and over on film, but this version with Olivia Hussey as Juliet is the one that embodies the play as classically as possible.  The sets appear authentic, filmed in Europe, and the actors close to the age and description as the play.  Olivia Hussey as Juliet is lovely and sweet, just as we imagine Juliet to be.
