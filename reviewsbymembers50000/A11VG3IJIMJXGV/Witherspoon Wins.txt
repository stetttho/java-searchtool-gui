 In Election, Witherspoon shines as an uptight overachiever who is intent on winning the class election.  Matthew Broderick as the teacher who holds a grudge against Witherspoon for getting his best friend fellow teacher in trouble, is well-cast.  These are not glamorous characters, and they live in a bleak environment of black and white, but the story carries this well-directed, well-acted movie.  Wonderful.
