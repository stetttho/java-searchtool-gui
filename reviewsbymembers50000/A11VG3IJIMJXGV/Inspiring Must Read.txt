 Saddleback Church's pastor Rick Warren's book captures what I have felt and believed in for a long time.  We are here for a reason.  When I was on Orange County, CA, I attended one of his services, and he is as down-to-earth as anyone.  His message is direct, but loving.  And the book is an affirmation of a belief system we probably can all benefit from.  Even for those who do not believe, this book is inspiring.  Better to have hope than no hope at all.  A wonderful book for our times.  Wonderful reference reading that goes on your must-have bookshelf along with Victoria London's fictional Gifted Girls series books for girls, which follows the purpose-driven theme.  These books are important for nourishing the soul.
