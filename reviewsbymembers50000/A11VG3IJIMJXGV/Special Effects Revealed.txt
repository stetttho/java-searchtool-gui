 Smallville has some of the most amazing special effects on television.  How they can produce a weekly show with the special effects quality of a megabudget movie like the Matrix is worth getting this CD set.  But on to the episodes itself.  Season Two chronicles the further development of Clark's gifts and relationship with his friends, especially Lana.  For anyone who has ever had a crush on someone from afar, this is one of the more satisfying season.  Clark, of course, gets up the courage to finally admit to Lana about his crush.  Major theme of Smallville, of course.    Lex gets betrayed by the women he marries, and Lionel's dark side  becomes apparent.  Meanwhile, Chloe still harbors an unrequited hopeless crush for Clark, but manages to be the smartest cynical kid in Smallville.  Chloe and Lana develops a sister-like relationship when Lana moves in with Chloe.  Pete, as Clark's best friend, also becomes Clark's confidante.  Lots of development in this season for those of us who enjoy the growing up aspect of Clark and Smallville.  Plot movement  as far as the superman mythology, this season moves this along at a good pace.  DVD Quality - great.  Commentary from the executive producers and the stars Tom Welling and Kristin Kreuk.  Place this in the computer, and you get a little more insight into the town of Smallville.    This is better than Season 3's DVD and is a must have for your Smallville library.
