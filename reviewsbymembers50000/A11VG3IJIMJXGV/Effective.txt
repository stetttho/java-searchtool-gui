 I didn't think this would work as well as it does.  Be prepare for tough kneading.  The shiatsu rolls feel as good as a massage lounger that is five times the price.  Because this is a mat, it is portable.  Not heavy at all.  It weighs as much as any chair mat, but the shiatsu motions are heavy duty.  The only suggestion is for it to go all the way up the shoulders and neck.
