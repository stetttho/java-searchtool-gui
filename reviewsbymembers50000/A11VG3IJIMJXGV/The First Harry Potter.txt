 The Chronicles of Narnia was the book series my 5th grade class voted all-time favorite.  Captivating and imaginative as a children's book series, but thoughtful and meaningful for all ages.  This book series starting with the Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe and explores themes of magic, saving the world, and having faith in yourself in order to overcome doubt and insecurity years before the Harry Potter phenomenon.  A classic in this religious-like fantasy genre, this is a stable fiction series mainly for children, but applies to any age.  Along this line of genre, also recommended are the Gifted Girls Series by Victoria London and the Wrinkle in Time books by Madeleine L' Engel.  Fill your purpose-driven child's library with these wonderful children's books.
