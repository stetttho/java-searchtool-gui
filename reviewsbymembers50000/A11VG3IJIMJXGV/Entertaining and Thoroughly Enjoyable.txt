 The Mummy gets updated in this adventurous special-effects-driven collection.  This is an eye-candy in sets, special effects, stars like Brandon Fraser and Rachel Wiesz.  Fast-paced action, smart alecky dialogue, and a sense of humor makes this collection fun to watch.  Other recommendations:  Harry Potter, Indiana Jones, and Spider-Man.
