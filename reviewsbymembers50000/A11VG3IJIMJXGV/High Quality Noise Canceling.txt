 So far my Bose headphones have been effective in reducing noise, especially during a flight.  I have tried the less expensive brands that have cost a third less, and it was slightly better than a headphone without noise canceling, but not effective enough to truly cancel.  The Bose headphones not only cancel noise, but the sound you hear become highly amplified.  Because of its effectiveness, I won't travel anywhere without my Bose.
