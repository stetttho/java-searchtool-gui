 Roald Dahl has always been one of my favorite children's book authors. His books often are slightly dark, but triumphant in a way that remind you of Lemony Snicket and Harry Potter. In this tale, however, James is an orphan living with horrible aunts. He escapes his horrible existence when he climbs aboard a peach that keeps growing and growing. Delightful in that he gets to live in a peach, and everything in the peach including a worm gets to become James' size as well. Also recommended are Lemony Snicket's Series of Unfortunate Events and the Emily Cobbs Collection.
