 Who says Drew Barrymore ruined this adorable Christmas story?  Her voice was appropriate for the insecure, but sweet dog name Olive, who believes Santa needs her help to save Christmas.  Hearing an announcement that Santa needs all of the other reindeer to help him, believing it meant "Olive, the other reindeer", Olive sets off to the North Pole to find Santa.  So begins this little dog's journey.  The illustrations are simplistic, but charming, especially when you see the flying sleigh being pulled by the reindeer and a little dog, being dragged along, flapping her pizza box wings.  Sure to be a classic like Rudolph the Red-nose Reindeer, Miracle on 34th Street, and White Christmas.
