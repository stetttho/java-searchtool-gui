 The color of the film, the mood, and acting of Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci, Miranda Richardson, and the legendary Christopher Walken adds to the stylish rendition of Washington Irving's short story.  Although there were more added to the original story such as the backstory on Miranda Richardson and the romance between Christina Ricci's character with Johnny Depp, this is one version of Sleepy Hollow that sends chills down your spine and still manage to entertain both genders.  A date film?  Yes, definitely.
