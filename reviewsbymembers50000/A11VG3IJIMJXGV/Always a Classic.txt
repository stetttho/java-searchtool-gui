 Cary Elwes and Robin Wright delights in this fairy tale comedy that tells of a young man in love with a Princess, who must masquerade as a thief/pirate.  Through harrowing trials and tribulations, the young Princess Bride is saved by her one true love before her marriage to an evil Chris Sarandon.  A colorful cast, including Billy Crystal and Carol Kane as an elderly couple and Andre the Giant make this film a classic.
