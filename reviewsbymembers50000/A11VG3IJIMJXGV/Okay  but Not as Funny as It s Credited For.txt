 If you can call being a clutz funny, you will think this movie is hilarious.  Instead of clever wit, situational comedy, this movie relies on the constant clutziness or maybe clumsiness of the main character Princess Mia to sustain the story.  She's a nerd, yes, and a fish out of water at high school, but so what.  Instead of celebrating her unique heritage and who she is, she is completely transformed into what her grandmother wants her to be - a princess like Cinderella.  Yes, she likes to listen to music, and dances like a teenager, but she is a teenager.  Even royal teenagers are known to dance and listen to music once in a while.  Worse, when they mingle with the commoners, like attend public school, they have a hard time fitting in.  In this film, they made it seem like you have to be born a Princess in order to find happiness, in order to fit into school.  Not so.
