 The Camden sisters go on adventures of their own in this 3-story book.  Ruthie goes to Hollywood, The Best Oktoberfest, and Sisters Through the Seasons are all enjoyable and is a good extension of the Camden family saga, that has become a hit long-running television show.  Other recommended books:  Wedding Memories (7th Heaven) and the Gilmore Girls series.
