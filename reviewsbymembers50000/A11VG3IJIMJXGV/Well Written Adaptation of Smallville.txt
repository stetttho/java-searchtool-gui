 Arrival starts off the hit television show Smallville in a readable, visually-written Smallville book tie-in series.  Though it is based on the first episode, Michael Teitelbaum was able to capture the episode into a teen book that still entertains, is true to the television show, and manages to give you more insight into the background of each character.  If you collect the Smallville book series, you should have this one.
