 History is full of women who made a difference in the world.  This book profiles several.  Focusing on women in history who were extraordinary before they turned 20, this book highlights heroines such as Cleopatra and Phyllis Wheatley among others.  A good collection since the greatness of these women have always been played down throughout history.  Cleopatra, who is one of the world's most fascinating women and my personal favorite, especially.  An inspiring book.  Also recommended if you enjoy reading about important historical female women - Lucy and the Beauty Queen (a fictional book about a young Cleopatra) and the Emily Cobbs Collection which references a young Queen Victoria.
