 Drew Barrymore in not slight, nor is she a pushover as Daniella, the real Cinderella.  In this twist of the fairy tale as we have come to know, Ever After has made the fairy tale more realistic without the fairy godmother and the magic.  Instead, this girl uses her smarts and courage to win the heart of the prince.  I was not a Drew Barrymore fan until I watched this film, and although she had received criticism for the accent used in the film, soon you forget and accept the accent as part of Daniella.  This is now part of my chick films and lit library.  What else is in this library?  Roman Holiday, Prince and Me, Bridget Jones Diary, Princess Diaries, Diary of a Discount Donna, A Cinderella Story, and Pretty Woman.
