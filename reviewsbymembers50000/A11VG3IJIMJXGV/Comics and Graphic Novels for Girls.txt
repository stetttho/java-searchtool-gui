 I'm one of the few girls I know who actually collect comic books or read books about superheroes.  That's because my parents, who were Wonder Woman fans of the TV series, gave me a Wonder Woman doll.  I was hooked.  Now I'm glad to see a new series of books and comic books cropping up on Wonder Woman.  She has always been an inspiration, and girls need superheroes, too.  If you know of any girl/woman who enjoy reading about female heroes, here are a few of my favorites:  Wonder Woman (of course), Queen B Superheroine (newest superheroine on the block), Elektra (from the Daredevil fame), and Buffy the Vampire Slayer.
