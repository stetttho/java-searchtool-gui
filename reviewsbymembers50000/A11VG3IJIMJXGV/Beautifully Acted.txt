 Pleasantville is like a colorized movie version of Twilight Zone.  A modern day boy (Toby McGuire) dreams of going back to the innocent days of the 1950s.  When he gets his wish via a magical stranger played by Don Knotts, he and his sister Reese Witherspoon steps into a black and white world of Pleasantville, a town stucked in the 1950s.  As the town's innocence is wiped away with the introduction of books and knowledge, color replaces the black and white starkness of the town and its people.  Beautifully acted and filmed, this movie has heart and a brain.
