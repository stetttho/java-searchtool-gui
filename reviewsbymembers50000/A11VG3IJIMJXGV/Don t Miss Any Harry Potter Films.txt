 Although the books are much more imaginative, the Harry Potter films are a treat.  Beautifully filmed in old creepy English schools, playfully acted by a host of British veteran stars like Maggie Smith and other BBC movie regulars, this film collection is delightful to watch with the family.  You don't have to be 13 to enjoy it.
