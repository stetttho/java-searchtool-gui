 Cherie Bennett has written a beautiful story about a girl who, normally would be a freak-of-the-week, is portrayed as just another teenager who has problems.  But the interaction between Lana, Clark, and the whole "Scooby Doo Gang" Chloe and Pete, even Whitney with the girl gives this story a soft touch.  The story of a girl who has wings, but is afraid of flying ties into Clark's fear of flying.  Cherie Bennett wrote a satisfying Smallville book, and books this length, though some consider "short" are not a distractor.
