 If you want a good escapist movie, this is it.  It's silly and funny, without much complicated issues to think about - except that Josey and the Pussycats must save the world from being brainwashed by advertisers.  The parody of boy bands is hilarious, and the Pussycats - Rosario Dawson and Tara Reid are cute and sweet.  A fan of quirky Parker Posey, I'm not disappointed by her steady performance as an advertising executive bent on brainwashing the world into thinking that orange is the new black.  If you have a sense of humor, the silliness in this film will make you laugh.  If you are looking for Oscar winning fare, then look elsewhere.
