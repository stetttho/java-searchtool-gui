 Now you can own your own copy of the television animated series that have updated batman.  The color is crisp, and the dialogue witty.  Not at all like the movies with live actors and cheesy costumes, this batman is as you picture him, and the voice acting is just as good as any celebrity actor's acting.  With cartoons this well-done, you might like watching cartoons just as much as your little nephew.  Other recommendations:  Wonder Woman, Superman, The Gargoyles, Queen B Superheroine, Power Puff Girls, and Batwoman.
