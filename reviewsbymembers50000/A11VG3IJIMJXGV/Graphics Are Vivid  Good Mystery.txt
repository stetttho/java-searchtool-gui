 Nancy Drew as an interactive game works because of the good mystery and graphics associated with the game.  Enter Blackmoor Manor and you enter a labyrinth of detailed halls and rooms.  There are ghosts, mysterious characters, and danger lurking everywhere you turn.  Slower than games geared toward boys, but great for girls.
