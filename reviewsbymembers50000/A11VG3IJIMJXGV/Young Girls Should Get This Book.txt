 I've reviewed hundreds, close to thousands of books, and I see the same thing in most books, be it large publishers or small publishers, best-selling authors, or new authors, I've always managed to find one or two typos.  So, it is very very petty for a reviewer to trash a book based on finding a few typos in the book.  As far as this book is concerned, I found very little.  Now focusing on the more important issue - what does this book teaches - positive belief in yourself.  This is combined with activities that help develop self-esteem and creativity.  There are some detail instructions and recipes, besides suggestions on what to do.  The fact that it ties back to the Gifted Girls Series is an added bonus.  Young girls should get this book more for the message and for the activities.  It is a fun book that is written, designed, and meant to be taken in fun.  Highly recommended.
