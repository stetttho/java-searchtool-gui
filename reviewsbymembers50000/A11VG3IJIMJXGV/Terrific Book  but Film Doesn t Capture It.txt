 I wanted to see a film version of A Wrinkle in Time so badly that I was rooting for this film all the way.  However, it must be difficult to capture a book of this imagination if you do not have a big budget like the Harry Potter films or do not have a script that matches the book.  The acting by the children are fine, but not stellar, and the beloved characters Mrs. Whatsit & Company were too bumbling and comical for the story.  Perhaps a darker, less comical version would have been better.
