 One of the more intellectual films out there that tries to make you think about peace, war, and consequences.  Base on a chinese folktale, this is a thoughtful story filled with plot, character, imagery, and action.  Not overly dramatic like most kung fu movie genre, but smart.  Zhang's use of colors is artistic, and the kung fu movements are acrobatic.  Why this did not get a 5 is because the ending leaves you unsatisfied - i.e.  Hero should have been less tragic.
