 Like a repeat of Gossip Girl, but not as biting.  Gossip Girl has superficial characters you don't care about, but at least they are entertaining gossip about.  The A-List is like reading about an overexposed A-list celebrity on a reality TV Show, who hams it up on tv as though they're in a show.  In other words, not very realistic teen fare.  But not without redemption, this series will find an audience just like reality tv shows have.
