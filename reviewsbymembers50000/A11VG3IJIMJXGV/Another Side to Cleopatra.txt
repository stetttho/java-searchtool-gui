 Lucy and the Beauty Queen, the second book to the Lucy series in Gifted Girls, shows another side to the mysterious Cleopatra.  This is a side imaginatively told, of a young Cleopatra who must rise to lead a weak Egypt.  How does this relate back to Lucy?  Lucy is in a quest to find her explorer father.  Through her gift and through her journey back in time to find her father, Lucy learns about bravery and courage.  This is not your typical girl's book where everything is sunny and bright, but a book that reminds you of a shorter version of a Wrinkle in Time.  And it is charming.  Mrs. Potter and her dog Mr. Smithy is vivid and lovable.  Lucy is spunky, and Nellie Ham is funny.  When I read the Emily Cobbs Collection, another character in the Gifted Girls Series, I was compelled to read the Lucy books.  In Emily Cobbs, the Explorer Society becomes more prominent, and there is more of a backstory on the Gifted Girls.  A wonderful new series that have been under the radar, but has caught the attention of schools and parents since it is among the recommendation lists.  My younger sister loves this series.
