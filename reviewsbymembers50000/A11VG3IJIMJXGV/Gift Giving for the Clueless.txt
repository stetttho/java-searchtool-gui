 I can't say how often I've gotten gifts that are very off the mark.  It seems as though no one has put any thought into the gift when I get a thermos lunchbag printed with someone's company logo or a memory book in a pastel southwestern theme (not my personal favorite taste).  I put a lot of thought into gift-giving, but unfortunately, some people are just clueless.  In any case, a gift certificate is the best gift to give if you don't have any clue whatsoever what they want.  If you have to mail your gift, mail a gift certificate.  Better yet, email a gift certificate.  It's less expensive, and you don't have to wait in line at the post office.
