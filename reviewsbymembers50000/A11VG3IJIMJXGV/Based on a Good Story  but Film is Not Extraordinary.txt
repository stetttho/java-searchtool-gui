 The story of a team made up of fictional characters from different stories - Captain Nemo, Mrs. Mina Harker, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Dorian Gray, Invisible Man, and so on who are called to save the world is a good premise.  It got me to see the movie, but the movie fell short of expectations because of an unbelievable plot twist and a disappointing ending.  It was such that a good pre-screening of the film to an audience about the ending may have saved this film from being a so-so film and elevate it to one of the more memorable action films of the decade.  But because I love the original characters from the classic books they have sprung to life from, the movie is fun enough to see if you put aside any thread of criticism.
