 I have to admit this play is very tragic.  Things just get worse and worse for Othello, a Moor in Venice.  He's a formidable man, married in an interracial marriage to a white woman.  Because of this and because of jealousy, Iago, Othello's right hand man, lies to Othello about the infidelity of his wife.  Jealousy, love, deceit, betrayal of friendship, prejudice, and murder is all in this tragedy of tragedy.  Since my group will be performing parts of this play, this printable downloadable version is just the right version for our group.
