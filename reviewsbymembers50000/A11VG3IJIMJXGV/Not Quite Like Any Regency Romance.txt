 A fan of Meg Cabot's Princess Diaries, I expected to get the same or similar type of writing or style in Meg Cabot's other teen romances.  But this is like reading a book by someone else.  It doesn't have the bite or wit of the Princess Diaries, and sounds like any of the many regency romance novels sold at supermarkets.  I hate to feel this way about any of Meg Cabot's books, but even as a regency novel for teens, it was not as good as other regency novels.
