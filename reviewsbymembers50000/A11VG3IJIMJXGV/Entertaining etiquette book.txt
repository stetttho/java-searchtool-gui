 What an entertaining book. Essential for understanding victorian way of life.  If you are stuck reading plays like The Importance of Being Earnest or anything by Thomas Hardy, I would read this book to get a feel for the characters' lives.  Entertaining because the book is written as if it was for a victorian reader.
