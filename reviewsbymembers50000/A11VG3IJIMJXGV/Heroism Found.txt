 It's been a while since September 11, and many would like to put it behind.  But we're constantly reminded of it when we go through security checks at the airport and watch the news.  Lucy and the Liberty Quilt takes place at the time of September 11, detailing the event from a 12 year old's point of view.  At a time of crisis and chaos when grown ups are reduced to a state of shock and helplessness, Lucy and her family find hope and safety through prayer.  Although she is just a 12 year old, Lucy is empowered by the discovery she has a role to play as one of the Gifted Girls.  Through imagination and through symbolism, Lucy's self-esteem and confidence is strengthen so that she can be propel into action and not let fear control her.  Though some may not get the subtlety of this smart series, Lucy and the other Gifted Girls books are deeper than other books for girls, but has adventure and enough issues like friendship and growing up that would keep the interest of any girl up to age 13 or 14.  Other recommended books is the Emily Cobbs Collection.
