 A delightful musical about an unrefined teenage Gigi who learns to become a lady in a spring Paris.  Sweet and extravagant.  The costumes are magnificent, the songs are playful, but most delightful is Maurice Chevalier.  Leslie Caron is plucky, and Louis Jourdan is affectedly bored.  Reminds me of My Fair Lady, another wonderful musical made of the same time with Audrey Hepburn.
