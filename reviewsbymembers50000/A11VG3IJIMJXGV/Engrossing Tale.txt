 The Pilgrim's Progress remind you of wonderful tales of journey like the Chronicles of Narnia and the Gifted Girls Series where the characters go through challenges where they learn, grow, and triumph.  Very engrossing and kept my attention, John Bunyan  has written an engaging book, that will probably become a classic.
