 If you want to stand out from the crowd, this comfy sweater in dark orange is electric and cool.  I'm already getting compliments when I wear this with my jeans and boots.  My closet is full of regular looking sweaters from relatives throughout the years, so this is one that breaks up my winter doldrum.  Thanks Aunt Lucy for this gift!
