 I thought this would be a cool laminator to have for my club.  Boy was I wrong.  My documents were wrinkly.  I even ran the documents through a few times.  The last time, it ate the carrier.  The binder part wasn't very good either.  You have to use special folders.  I can't believe the manufacturer intended this for the office when it can't even support my little club's laminating needs.  It goes to show a good looking product doesn't necessarily delivers.
