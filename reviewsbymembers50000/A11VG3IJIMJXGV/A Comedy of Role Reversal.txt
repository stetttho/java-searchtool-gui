 Shakespeare's comedy As You Like It tells of a girl name Viola who disguises herself as a boy to get close to the man she loves, but things get complicated.  Funny, and clever, one of the best role reversal plays ever written.  Viola is a great part to play for any actress.  Other great comedy by Shakespeare:  A Midsummer Night's Dream.
