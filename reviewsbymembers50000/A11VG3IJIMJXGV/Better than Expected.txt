 I was expecting Cinderella, and this film delivers.  Cinderella is in the form of a pre-med in Wisconsin, played by down-to-earth Julia Stiles.  When the Prince of Denmark (no not Hamlet) flies to America looking for girls he imagined to be like wild girls, he sets his sights on Julia.  Completely different than any girl he has ever met, Julia soon teaches the irresponsible prince a lesson about growing up and finding love.  Beautifully romantic if you love princess movies, but updated with modern concerns.  Reminds of a few good princess books/movies:  Princess Diaries, Ella Enchanted, Diary of a Discount Donna, Pretty Woman, and Ever After.
