 A good drawing book for drawing Manga characters, but it is pretty beginning level.  This is very good for learning from the start because of the level of details in the drawings.  With the easy-to-understand drawings, you can feel confident that you can draw one manga character.  In color and glossy paper.  Nice, but wished this was longer.
