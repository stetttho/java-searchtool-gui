 I must admit, I got this after a couple of girls in my dorm wearing this.  It's cute, and it works well with my jeans.  Best of all, it's for a good cause - fight against cancer.  More expensive than any black t-shirt should be, but it's mostly for the charity.  If you want to wear something cute and stand for something admirable, this is a good simple t-shirt to have.  This definitely belongs to my list of "What Popular Teens Are Buying".
