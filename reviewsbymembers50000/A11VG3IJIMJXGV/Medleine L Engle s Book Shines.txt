 A book which deals with the gifted Austin family, A Ring of Endless Light shines with its handling of growing up issues:  death, first love, and discovery of your purpose in life.  A completely different book from A Wrinkle in Time, but has the same magical quality.  Recommended along with A Wrinkle in Time, The Gifted Girls Series, and The Chronicles of Narnia Series.
