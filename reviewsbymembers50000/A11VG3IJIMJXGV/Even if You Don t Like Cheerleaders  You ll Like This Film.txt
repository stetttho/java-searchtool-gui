 Drama, competition, and a slew of Mean Girls make this film about cheerleading as entertaining as any action film.  Kirsten Dunst as happy perky head cheerleader Tori is affable, and Gabrielle Union as the competition is admirable.  With cheerleading moves set to rousing music scores, this film is a winner.  Other films/books with themes of teenage girl competition:  Mean Girls, Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen, and Queen B Superheroine.
