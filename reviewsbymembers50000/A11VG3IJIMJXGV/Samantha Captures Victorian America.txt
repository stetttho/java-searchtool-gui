 One of my favorite American Girls books, Samantha captures the story of victorian america.  Although I missed the tv making of the book, I find the Samantha book a near classic for Christmas.  The victorian times is among one of my favorites so this series by the American Girls became my favorite.  This series is very innocent and sweet about the daily life of a normal victorian girl, but it touches on the authenticity of the victorian era just as the Emily Cobbs series in the Gifted Girls books, but without the mystery and adventure.  Samantha is a little young for my 13 year old sister because of its simplicity in story, but alright for younger readers up to 10.
