 One of the few disappointing stories in the Smallville Series for Young Adults, Buried Secrets introduces a new Spanish teacher who can read people's minds.  She has this ability, but hates using it, and doesn't do anything spectacular with it that warrants it as a freak-of-a-week episode.  Clark and Lex falls for this Spanish teacher (although there is nothing really amazing like special powers through kryptonite to get everyone to fall for her), and have Clark (who is hopelessly in love with Lana) fall for her is unbelievable.  Having built up Clark's strength of character to have him go after his Spanish teacher, despite the way he feels about Lana, is unbelievable.  He even gets into a fighting jealous rage when Lex falls for the Spanish teacher, too.  Anyone who has watched Smallville, even for one season, knows this is nonsense.
