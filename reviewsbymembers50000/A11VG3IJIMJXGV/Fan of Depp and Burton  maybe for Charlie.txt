 When Tim Burton and Johnny Depp teams up, they usually provide a darkly entertaining, but enchanting film.  Depp somehow looks great in Burton's dark blue lighting and macabre shapes.  Edward Scissorshand and Sleepy Hollow are some of their signature collaborations so far.  But, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory in dark blue and bebop music???  It may work, thanks in part to a very talented Johnny Depp, who was over-the-top in Pirates of the Carribbean.  The technicolor-crazed bright look of the Wilder film  and a too subtle Willy Wonka gave the film a family, almost toy-like feel.  Burton and Dep may just get older audiences like teens to 25 year olds to become fans of children's book author Dahl, who has created some of the most quirkiest characters in literature. On the other hand, it may be a horrible remake like Scooby Doo.  But looking at Burton and Depp's track record with Big Fish and Pirates, I think this film will do just fine.  And Burton is the director to provide the magic to this perennial children's favorite.  Other recommendations:  Lemony Snicket and Harry Potter.
