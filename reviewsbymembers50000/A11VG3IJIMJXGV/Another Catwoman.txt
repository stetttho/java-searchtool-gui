 Chloe King is a girl with cat-like powers (sounds familiar???) that also includes having 9 lives.  As part of an ancient European species called The Mai, she is now a target of an organization called The Order of the Tenth Blade, out to destroy the Mais.  Good pacing, but the cat woman idea has already been played out.  Not the best super power books for teens, but alright.  For those who like super power teen books like Buffy, this is recommended along with Queen B Superheroine and Fearless.
