 As a film student, part of my curriculum includes screenwriting classes.  I've taken a few and even seminars in Los Angeles.  Repeatedly, Syd Field's books are the ones we use as textbooks.  My instructors are all writers who have sold screenplays, even screenplays that have become blockbuster movies starring stars like Sandra Bullock.  I've written a few screenplays, and have followed along with this book.  They're not movies, yet, but because I've at least gotten the structure down, I've gotten A's on the screenplays, and are on my way to being a good writer/filmmaker.
