 James and the Giant Peach in this production using entirely computer animation is exactly how I picture the classic children's book.  The voices of Jane Leeves, Peter Dreyfuss, Paul Terry are among the cast of talented voices that make this bizarre, but lovable book come to life.  Recommended with this movie:  Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Lemony Snicket, A Wrinkle in Time, and the Nightmare Before Christmas.
