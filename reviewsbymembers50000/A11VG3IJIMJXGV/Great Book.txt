 Great book with real live advice about survival techniques.  Similar to the other Survival Handbooks with First Aid-type illustrations, this is handy for those who would like to find out how real live people like stunt doubles, firefighters, and police officers survive perilous situations.  Other recommended books:  The Action Hero's Handbook, Queen B's Guide to Being a Superheroine, Worst-Case Scenario Handbook, SAS Survival Handbook, and Spy Survival Handbook.
