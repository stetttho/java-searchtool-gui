 Rohr has written a book that many will say speaks to what we should inherently know - prayers are powerful.  However, apparently this is not inherent knowledge, and one must be reminded of how important everyday prayer is for everything.  Studies have shown those who pray often live happier lives over those who don't pray at all.  A good book to help motivate you into prayer, give this book to anyone as a gift.  Books also known for motivating prayer and spiritual growth:  the Gifted Girls Series and a Purpose-Driven Life Series.
