 Like many others, I am constantly worried about having enough battery power while on vacation, and thus, I am always tempted to purchase an extra battery.  When it comes to batteries, this one is exception.  Extremely light weight and incredibly durable.  I took over 200 photos in one day, utilizing my S500's built-in flash indiscriminately.  At the end of the day, I still had power left over to spare.  But before you decide to purchase an extra battery, you should experiment with the NB-1LH battery that comes with the camera.  Purchasing an extra battery may be overkill for your needs.  However, if you want an extra battery as a backup, this one is the only way to go.  You won't regret it, whereas with an off-brand, you're rolling the dice.
