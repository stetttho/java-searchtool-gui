 I purchased this along with my Canon EOS Digital Rebel. Probably the most versatile lens you could buy, covering about 95% of the range one would ever use.  The quality of this lens makes the 18-55mm lens almost obsolete.  Although this is somewhat pricey, it is well worth the money.  Canon lenses are always top-notch and compatibility with your digital camera is assured.  Be sure to purchase from a reputable retailer so that you get a USA warranty.   You should never compromise quality, otherwise you'll regret getting something that wasn't the best.  Your camera is expensive, and your memories are priceless -- why short change both with a second rate camera lens?
