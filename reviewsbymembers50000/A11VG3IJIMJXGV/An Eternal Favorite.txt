 One of my favorites, this book about an orphan girl who finds love and acceptance in the most unlikely place is heartfelt and warm.  For anyone who has ever felt like a fish out of water or has an individual streak, this is a wonderful book about acceptance and learning to love yourself.  Highly recommended.
