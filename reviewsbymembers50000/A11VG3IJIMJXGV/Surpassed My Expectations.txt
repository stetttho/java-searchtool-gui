 This is one of the best things I have bought.  Not only does this cleaner scrubs efficiently, but it dries incredibly fast - literally within seconds with the dry mode.  You push it like a vacuum cleaner on floors, but it is lighter and easier to push.  You can use it on hardwood.  I used it on my hardwood floor, and it felt smooth and polished afterwards.  Very helpful for anyone with a back or hand injury or a messy dog/pet!
