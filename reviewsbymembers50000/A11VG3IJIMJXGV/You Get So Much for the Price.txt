 So far this is the least expensive printer I have bought, but it has performed the best.  I had only used HP or Lexmark, but found after a few performances, these printers would break down.  I still cannot believe that for under $80, you can get a printer like the Canon iP3000.  It prints photo-quality photos, is compact, and prints duplex (2-sided) so you can save on paper.  The footprint is smaller than most printers because of its ingenious design - everything folds into itself.  The best part, though, is the cartridges - the ink colors comes in their own individual cartridge so you don't have to replace the entire cartridge when one color runs out.  The cartridges can be found for less than $10, too.  Canon has listened to what consumers like us want- a printer that works, does not take up too much space, and is economical.  It makes you wonder how other printer brands can charge so much for the printer and the ink cartridges.
