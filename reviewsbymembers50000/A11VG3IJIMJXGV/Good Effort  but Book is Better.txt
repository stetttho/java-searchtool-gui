 This is a good dvd for a remarkable book that will pull at your heartstrings.  A good remake of the film version that will make you want to read the book.  It's too bad this film did not make it to the theaters and went straight to dvd.  The classic story of a boy and his beloved dog should have been released.  Solid storyline with lots of emotional impact, great for family.  At least the dvd will get more people to read the book.  Hurray for Disney and other studios/filmmakers who care enough about books to bring it to screen.
