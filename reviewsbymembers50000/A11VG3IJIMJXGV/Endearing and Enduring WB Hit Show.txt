 From the start, 7th Heaven was different.  Not a show that followed the same formula of Spelling's other works (Beverly Hills 90210 and Dynasty), 7th Heaven was about a minister's family.  The Camdens are like any family with its problems and crisis, but this show also celebrates the simple things in life - births, weddings, school, friends, things that happen to real family.  The writing is crisp, and the style is easy-going, with a sense of humor.  Like a friend of the Camden clan, we are sucked into their everyday concerns until, we too, share tears at the wedding and laugh at babysitting accidents along with the Camdens.  Catch missed episodes and beloved episodes in this excellent first season.  Other recommended series that deals with family relationships:  Smallville, Gilmore Girls, Queen B Superheroine, and Everwood.
