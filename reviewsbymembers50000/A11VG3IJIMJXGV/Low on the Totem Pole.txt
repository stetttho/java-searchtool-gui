 Lindsay Lohan is a very good actress, but she is stuck in a role that lacks depth and a plot that wasn't really a plot.  Aside from a great title, the book/film did not have much confessions, nor much drama. It consists of Lohan's character competing with the reigning popular girl to become the lead in the school musical.  Not one of Lohan's better works, but it did get her more attention than the much better Freaky Friday where she was convincing as her mother.  Mean Girls was better than Confessions, but Freaky Friday was the best so far.
