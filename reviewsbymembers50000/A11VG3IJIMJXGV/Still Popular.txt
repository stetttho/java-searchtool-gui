 After half a century, the Twilight Zone stories are still relevant to our society.  Unlike other black and white films of the time that have been colorized, these episodes are in black and white (thank goodness!) which makes the stories more dramatic and bold. In this first season, some of the most well-known episodes are included such as the Maple Street neighbors, the mannequin, and Burgess Meredith as a man who loved to read, but never had the time.  Includes commentary from those who worked on Twilight Zone, this is a true collector's item for those who would like to have the Twilight Zone marathon run on and on.
