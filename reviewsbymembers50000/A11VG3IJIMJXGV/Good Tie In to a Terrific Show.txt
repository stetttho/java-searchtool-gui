 Lucy is one of my favorite characters in 7th Heaven.  I've watch and have grown up with Lucy on the show.  Now she's balancing her role as a police officer's wife and a student of ministry.  Now you get to read how Lucy feels about her whole experience, from her wedding day, til her struggle with her new roles.  Fans of the 7th Heaven show will enjoy this book.  Well-done book tie-in.
