 Carr knows victorian mysteries.  Now he tackles the most famous victorian mysteries of all...Sherlock Holmes.  Imaginative plot written in Doyle's style, Carr evokes the feel of a true Holmes mystery.  The addition of Holmes' brother is uncharacteristic of Holmes mysteries, but does move the plot along.  A good read.  Carr fans shouldn't miss this one.
