 Emily Cobbs is no ordinary girl.  She's an orphan who lost her parents in a bizarre and mysterious way.  She lives with her great aunt who lives in a cottage on the Cambridge University campus.  But most of all, she has an unusual gift.  She paints paintings that are magical.  Not only is she a Gifted Girl, but she discovers that Great Aunt Nell belongs to a secret society of explorers whose works expand across time and place.  Truly imaginative and reminds you of Harry Potter and Lemony Snicket.
