 After seeing Smallville and Earthsea with Kristin Kreuk, I have become a complete fan of hers.  As Snow White, she exemplifies the innocence, grace, playfulness, and beauty you imagine Snow White to have.  She is Snow White.  She is the perfectly cast princess in a beautifully filmed, wardrobed, and luxurious rendition of the classic fairy tale which reminds you of classics like the Wizard of Oz.  Miranda Richardson is at her best as a wicked   stepmother turned witch.
