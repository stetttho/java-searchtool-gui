 This collection of Books 1 and 2 gives you more of an insight into the saga of Mia, an awkward teen, who suddenly finds herself a Princess of a small country.  I saw the movie before I read the books, and found them different from one another.  The movie is very Disney, while the book is filled with more angst and depth.  While I enjoyed the movie, the books themselves are worth reading in order to get the real sense of Mia's inner thoughts or "diary".
