 SEPTUAGINT comes from the greek, meaning 70. Due to the complexities inherent in the hebrew language, greeks desiring a comprehensive version of biblical texts hired seventy Rabbis to translate a definative greek version. It was assumed that out of 70 differing versions, some sort of concensus version might be arrived at-- a synthesis based upon the most common interpretations of the material. To their utter shock, the greeks discovered that all 70 translations were exactly the same, word for word. AN AMAZING WORK, & not at all like what you've read in the past.
