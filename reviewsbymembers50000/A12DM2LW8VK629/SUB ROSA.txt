 Ginzberg has, in these volumes, assembled & organized a massive selection of Rabbinic texts that might not otherwise have been open to public scrutiny/appreciation. You'll recognize the stories from sunday school perhaps, but the details are much more esoteric than what you're used to. These were passed down in an oral tradition in which  those transmitting the knowledge were sworn to an oath not to change so much as "a single iota". They didn't, & the result is as bizarre as it is symbolic & fascinating. Not a Christian or a Jew? No matter. These volumes will be of interest to all who consider themselves mystics. PURE GOLD.
