 This story of strange young girl from out of the past who brings inspiration to an artist down on his luck exhibits the kind of full on romanticism one rarely encounters these days. This is a novel of pure mysticism, yet you needn't be a mystic to thoroughly enjoy it. An excellant film was made from it starring Joseph Cotton--- also very worthwhile to the true romantics amongst us.
