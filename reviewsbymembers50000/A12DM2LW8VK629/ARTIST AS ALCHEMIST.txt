 Duchamp was not an artist, but an alchemist. As a teen I had the opportunity to see Arturo Shwarz give a lecture on Duchamp, called "archetypal alchemical iconography & the work of Marcel Duchamp". Though much of what he said was lost on me, the bits I could make out spoke directly to my soul. A favorite artist of mine thus took on a far greater significance in my estimation, & the way I looked at life was never quite the same. This has got to be the definative work on Duchamp, from a man who was both his greatest protagonist,& a close personal friend. Shwarz was a great documenter of the 20th century avant-garde, & i feel very lucky to have known him.
