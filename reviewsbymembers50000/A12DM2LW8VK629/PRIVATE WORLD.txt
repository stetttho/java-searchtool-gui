 I saw The Dolls the first time they played the west coast, at The Whiskey. I bought their first album the day it came out. This is the worlds greatest rock band, bar none. So I love TOO MUCH, TOO SOON because it gives me a look inside the private world of these guys who were such a comfort to me during my years in teenage wasteland. I missed the Shangra-Las, but The Dolls more than made up for it!
