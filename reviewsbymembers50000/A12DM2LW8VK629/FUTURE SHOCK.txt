 At age 17 I wrote to Rudi Gernreich, imploring him to let me work for him & sending him my own futuristic fashion designs. I never heard back, of course; why would an iconoclast need imput from a teenager? This man prefigured so much that happened in later decades that most of what he did still looks cutting edge today. He saw himself as being a few years ahead of his time. More like a few deades. David Bowie's Ziggy Stardust owes more than a bit to Rudi's unisex designs, up to & including the shaved eyebrows. The look was startling & alien in 1973, imagine how it looked in psychedelic era 60s! Peggy Moffit's book is a godsend, & she is a Pop Icon extraordinaire. The future hasn't been nearly as groovy as Gernreich envisioned, but this book offers a glimpse of what it might have been. He was a true visionary.
