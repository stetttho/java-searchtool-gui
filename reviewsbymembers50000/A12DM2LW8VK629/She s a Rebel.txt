 The Mitford bio Hons & Rebels was thusly titled for a reason. Many of the sisters WERE rebels. Unity rebeled against the conventions of her time. She took her pet rat to the debutantes ball, played 5 radios tuned to different stations simultaneously (turned up full blast), & generally did as she pleased. Had she not fallen in with Hitler, it's doubtful that anyone other than rabid anglophiles would know or care about her. BUT, had she not fallen in with Hitler it's also possible that she would be a feminist icon of sorts. This book captures Unity in all her paradoxical complexity. Hitler hated lipstick, yet Unity refused not to wear it in his presence. He hated women drivers, yet was delighted to see Unity zooming about Munich in her sports car. She was a unique woman who refused to bow down before anyone, up to & including her "idol", Hitler. Read this bio & you'll find a woman that, like most fascinating figures, was wildly out of step with the times in which she lived; & as a result will continue to be misunderstood by most. Nonetheless, it's a great read, however you feel about Unity and/or her politics.
