 I lived on the same street as Jim Jone's People's Temple, & I got a hell of a lot of warnings from relatives  to steer well clear of the guy! Not like I cared--- I wasn't a Christian, a communist, or anyone even remotely susceptable to his message. Still, the warnings came. He seemed almost comedic in the news, in the Glide Church... then came the news of the deaths in Guyana. A week later a paperback was on the newstands in Safeway at Church St. & Market in SF. It was all very nuts. "Six Years With God" seems to be the most definative book... & the most lurid. What more can you ask for?
