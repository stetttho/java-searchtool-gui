 Though The Wizard of Oz is a beloved classic, the utter popularity of Baum's work has blinded the public to just how rare a talent this man actually was. Ozma of Oz would be seen as a great work of literature but for the fact that it was a best selling childrens book. It is every bit as bizzare as Raymond Roussel's "Impressions of Africa", & Baum was doing this AGES before his more seriously taken European counterparts. It's loaded with imagery both charming & creepy--- talking hens, an evil princess with a room full of living severed heads, a race of men with wheels instead of hands--- stories so strange that no one today has matched them. Baum concocted these tales purely to amuse the children who hung out around his general store. His wife suggested he write them down, and suddenly, rather late in life he became a bestselling author. Ozma of Oz is the basis of the Disney film "Return to Oz", a movie that Roger Ebert warned would give children nightmares. Indeed. The actual book is far stranger still.
