 This slim volume is worth it's weight in gold. A glimpse into the life of a man who inhabited his own self-created world, a man out of step with the modern world of his own age. The author has done a masterful job of researching his subject, & this volume can only be described as lavishly produced. Like it's topic, the book itself seems to harken back to a bygone era. Dr. Nixon would no doubt be proud of this testament to his life, & despite it's brevity, it paints a very vivid portrait indeed. But for the research of Mr. Wittelsbach, Nixon may have become lost in the mists of time.
