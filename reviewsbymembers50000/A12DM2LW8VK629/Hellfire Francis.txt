 This popular paperback was most people's introduction to Francis Dashwood & The Hellfire Club. A painting of Dashwood still hangs in the National Portrait Gallery in London. He was a rake, a libertine, & a man who most likely colluded with Ben Franklin to help create the US of A. Franklin told friends he was going to a "Franciscan" retreat, while participating in debauchery at Dashwood's Hellfire Abbey at High Whycombe. Back at  home, he preached the virtue of clean living in his Poor Richard's Almanac.
