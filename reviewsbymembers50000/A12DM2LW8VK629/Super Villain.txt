 This super villain captured the imagination of early 20th century France in a big way. He starred in a long running series of best selling novels that polite society refered to dimissively as "penny dreadfuls". Though considered trash by most educated folks, such fiction was extolled by the French surrealists as great reading. And it is. Look for work as bizarre or well crafted in bookshops today, & you'd be hardpressed to find it's equal.
