 Lawrence Welk, mild mannered purveyor of MOR pop, right? Wrong. In this strange volume Welk puts aside the batton, takes off the gloves & reveals his own ironclad strategy for putting America back on the path to greatness. Welk draws on his own humble beginnings, his personal hardships, & hard won victories, to present a schematic for how anyone willing to work hard & stay the course can ultimately prevail in a country such as ours. Welk had a reputation as a harsh taskmaster. Read My America, Your America, & you'll understand why.
