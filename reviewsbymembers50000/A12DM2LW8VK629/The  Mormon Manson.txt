 Mr. LeBaron was dubbed the "Mormon Manson". This study is fascinating insofar as it reveals that within a sect often misunderstood & viewed as "extreme" by mainstream America, there lurk even less understood factions. LeBaron felt that the modern Mormon church was betraying it's pure origins, that he had inherited a messianic right by birth to redress the situation, & that bloodshed alone was the means to accomplish this. He executed rivals such as Ruland Ahlred, & set about on a crime spree that went on for many years. This is a page turner, intriguing regardless of if you have any particular interest in Mormonism or not. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
