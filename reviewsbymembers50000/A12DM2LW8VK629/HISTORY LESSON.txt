 The theme of this book is quite simple: that HOMO SAPIEN means "wise man", but that a look at the history of man reveals him to be anything but. This tome is harsh & elitist to the max, but GBL parts company with his contemporaries in this mileau by basing his notion of elitism purely on intelligence & achievement. "Cream always rises to the top" he observes, & every ethnic group will have a handful of natural born leaders who will excel in everything, & an excess of those who Stalin refered to as "the stuffing in the mattress". Still, many readers will find this a bitter pill to swallow. Even though he avoids the usual sweeping generalizations based on race, a lot of "stuffing"-types may not like what he has to say.
