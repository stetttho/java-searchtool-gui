 This is an art book like no other. Every possible star of stage or screen decked out in nazi regalia, from Ronnie Reagan to Peter Lorre & beyond. Not so much as a single word by way of explaination, thankfully. Art demands no explaination. If any were offered, it would undermine the effects of this mindnumbing panorama. This is the realm in which POP culture confronts & embraces the UNpopular. Get it while you can.
