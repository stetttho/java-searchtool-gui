 Written by D'Annunzio's personal secretary, this is perhaps the definative biography of The Poet. It's an insiders look at a man whose private life was even more excessive & flamboyant than his public persona. He slept in a coffin, had his own private army, & bedded the most famous women of his day. The author obviously has a great deal of reverence for his subject matter, yet never shys away from documenting D'Annunzio's foibles (of which there are many). In twenties era Italy, this man was the equilvalent of a rock star. Read this book & you'll see why.
