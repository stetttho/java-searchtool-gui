 If you're a stranger to trucker music, or have maybe only heard Red Sovine or "convoy", you're in for a treat with this album. Big Red has chosen the very best of the best trucker songs, rockin' boppin' ditties that will leave you longing for the open road. Songs about Americas unsung heroes, the pill-popping, coffee chugging MEN who make it all happen. This ain't for no three legged beavers, Good Buddy!
