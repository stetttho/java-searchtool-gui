 La Vey was a friend of mine, & this book is a repository of special memories. He dictated it during our late nights together, & I heard all these stories first-hand. I always wondered what Blanche was scribbling down so furiously in shorthand--- only later to learn that his annecdotes about Dr. Nixon, et al, would be source material in the story of his life. Still, these stories are inspiring, & I'm grateful to have been a participant in this project on whatever level. La Vey represented what is fabulous about America--- that you can prevail not DESPITE being an outsider, but because of it!
