 In "Dr. Mabuse, Der Speiler", Mabuse said that nothing was interesting anymore, except for "playing with people & with the destinies of people". Mabuse may well have been describing the life of Guy Grand, protagonist of The Magic Christian. Though Grand is no doubt a less mean spirited figure than Mabuse, his humor is no less misanthropic in nature. If you enjoyed the Peter Sellers/Ringo Starr movie, expect to be stunned. The book is above & beyond anything you saw on the screen. If you're like me you'll find yourself rereading it on a yearly basis--- it's THAT funny! Really.
