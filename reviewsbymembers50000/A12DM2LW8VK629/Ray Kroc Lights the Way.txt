 Ray Kroc was more than just a successful entrepeneur, he was a man with a vision. In Grinding It Out, that vision is clearly evident. If you want to succeed in virtually any field, read this book & pay attention to his approach & attitude. This is more than a business biography, it's a "how to" book.
