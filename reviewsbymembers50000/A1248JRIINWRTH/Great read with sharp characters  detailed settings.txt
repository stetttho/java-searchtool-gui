 The characters come to life in LOVER'S LANE, a turbulent tale of a young woman running from her past and desperate to keep custody of her son. I'm usually not drawn to books like this one, where it's more a story than suspenseful, but I simply fell in love with it, the characters, the town and the emotional pitfalls faced by Carly, Jake and Anna. I couldn't put it down after the first page. And I actually want to read the second, HEAT WAVE - and I'm not one to get caught up in a series. But it appears they are written as individual books in the same town, which I can handle. I'm not going to go into details of the plot, but I will tell you Landis' effort is well-written and captures your attention from the get-go.
