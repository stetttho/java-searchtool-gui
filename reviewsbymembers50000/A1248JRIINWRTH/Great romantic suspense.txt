 Now You See Me is tightly written, with twists and turns that will keep the reader guessing whudonit. Characters Max and Olivia battle their own demons - and desire for each other - as they search for a kidnapped girl. They are fallible and brave enough to admit to their fears and hopes for the future to each other. Their feelings for each other are secondary to the main plot, but woven so carefully into the prose that it becomes part of the main plot. This book was amazing. I'm keeping this general so I don't give away any of the fantastic secrets between the covers.
