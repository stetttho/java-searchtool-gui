 I had a really hard time getting into this one. And that really stinks since I had it on back order for so long. For some reason, I just couldn't get into it, or get a good feel for the characters. It seemed really boilerplate in places. And frankly, the ending was really obvious. I mean, it's been done before (like just about everything else out there). I finally skipped a good chunk of the front and moved on and was able to read the mid section. Then, when it dropped off again, I just skipped to the back. (I did go back and read those skipped sections to make sure I didn't miss anything. It was like returning to a soap opera after two years to find the exact same plot line.) Trite and obvious prose in places, this is a story that has potential but falls short of what I expect from this normally fantastic author. (sorry Miss Kane!!)
