 In MIDNIGHT RAIN, the writer deftly weaves a tale of paranormal romance and sinister earthly deeds that will leave your spine tingling - and make you check your locks and doors just one more time before bed. This was my first Holly Lisle. When MIDNIGHT RAIN first started, I was a little creeped out - OK, a LOT creeped out - by the tarot readings, ghostly sightings and bizarre happenings with Phoebe and Allen. But I stuck it out - and was glad I did. If you're adverse to books with occult happenings, you probably won't appreciate this effort by Lisle. But for everyone else, this is DEFINITELY worth the read.
