 Body Heat is more romance than suspense, but it will leave readers tingling for more from this author. Tucker Fields is a fire investigator who has no ties - especially to women. Andrea O'Rourke is a woman who also has no ties - especially because she is one of the few female fire chiefs in the nation. When these two meet over a case, their chemistry is combustible. But they have to work through their inner vulnerabilities before they can be together. The arson investigation is less than a subplot, but details of it are nicely woven into the main story of Tucker and Andi's relationship. The author also leaves enough open to start a romantic series featuring the O'Rourke family. The writing is tight, bright and flows naturally. This is a GREAT read and I would more than pay full price. I look forward to more from this author.
