 Rules of Thumb has a neat layout and odd size that makes it a great coffeetable book. Unfortunately, that's not what I was looking for.  This is not a book for specifics on the craft. The 73 notations by published authors in this book are everything serious writers will hear at writing meetings, conferences and critique groups. They are, in some cases, inspirational, but don't offer the specifics new writers need for structure and development. This might work as a nice, general gift if you have a friend who is a writer and you don't know which books on structure they might like. If you are a serious writer, I recommend spending cash first on Plot and Structure by James Scott Bell. It's much more specific and incredibly witty.
