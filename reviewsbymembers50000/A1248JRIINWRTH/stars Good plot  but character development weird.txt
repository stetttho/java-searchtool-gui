 This was a good book, though what confounded me was Nick's character. This is an ex-Army Ranger who is totally obtuse in some instances where our herione, Danni, has to fill in the blanks of the mystery. His Army training doesn't seem to be a apart of him until - oh it's that time! - he absolutely needs it in the end. He went into the Army after high school. Those eight years would have shaped him, molded him, into a harder, more intelligent man than presented in this book. Not to give anything away, but Nick apparently was the last surviving member of his team during some secret mission and he feels guilty. Well, if he had the same intelligence level on the field as he had during the investigation, it's no wonder his team died! The writer only hints at what happened, gives you enough information to be interested in this tragic event that shaped Nick's life, but she never finishes it. It's dangling out there without a resolution at the end of the book. The author did wrap up the emotional turmoil involving  I hated that the characters had so many casual relationships in their past (that's a personal thing though, so it really won't affect every reader).
