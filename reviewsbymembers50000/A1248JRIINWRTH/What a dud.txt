 JUST PAST MIDNIGHT has a great concept - erotomania, a subject not tackled in other "stalker" books. Unfortunately, it is a slow-moving book with two-dimensional characters that leaves the reader wondering why they wasted an afternoon on such a dud. While the writer does make it difficult for some readers to figure out the identity of the stalker, she fails to build the tension between Richard and Darian. One minute they are rivals. The next, they're in love. What happened in between? We'll never know.
