 I must be the only person who DID NOT find the story "Scent of a Killer" engaging, thought-provoking and a great romatic suspense.  I was really disappointed in the development of a relationship between Jenna and Frank. It's like, one minute he's a friend and the next, she's in love with him? I thought this needed a little more development, as well as the reasons why Frank was such a butt when he was younger and didn't fight for the woman he loved. It might have made all the difference. The plot involving the Russian mob was a little... well, I guess it wasn't my style. Interestingly enough, I normally love stories involving the mob.
