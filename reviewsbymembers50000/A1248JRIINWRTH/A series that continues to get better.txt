 Nora Roberts, aka JD Robb had me riveted to the latest installment in the LT. Eve Dallas series. Thought it's not terribly difficult to figure out the who in whodunit, it's the why and how. Roberts leaves clues for avid readers who may or may not pick up on them and weaves a tale that will keep readers on edge. A former foster mother of Eve's is murdered in this installment. And Eve is the primary on the investigation. With minimal help from Roarke - unusual compared to the past few in the series - Eve wraps up the case in her usual cool, cop-like fashion. I love how Roberts has developed the relationship with Eve and her husband, Roarke and hope that in the next few books they have a baby. A pregnant Eve and expectant Roarke would give this series an added zing. And likely push the herione to pursue Captain status, a desk job she isn't quite yet ready for. For those who have not kept up, you can read these out of order. Roberts is deft with sentences that clue you in on the past cases that have tied the relationships of Eve and Roarke and their friends and coworkers throughout the series.
