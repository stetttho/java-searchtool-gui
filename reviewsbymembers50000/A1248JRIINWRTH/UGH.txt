 OK, I love Nora Roberts - most of the time. Her romantic suspense novels usually have a great plot, characters that are human, but likeable, and are an easy read. But this book STUNK! The sappy female lead totally drove me to the psych ward. I couldn't even finish the book because it was obvious what was going to happen. Frankly, if the characters were likeable, I probably would have finished it. But they weren't. So the book is out the door.
