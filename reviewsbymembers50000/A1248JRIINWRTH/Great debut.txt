 This action-packed thriller from Allison Brennan will leave you breathless as you turn the pages. Rowan Smith has a stalker. A former FBI agent, Rowan's former collegues, the movie studio she's working with and her adoptive parents get her to hire a bodyguard. And that's where the fun begins. There are plenty of twists and turns in this book, but not all of them keep the reader guessing. Still, Brennan wraps up her story of Rowan Smith and Smith's romantic counterpart while opening the door to book two (The Hunt with herione Miranda Moore) in the last few pages.
