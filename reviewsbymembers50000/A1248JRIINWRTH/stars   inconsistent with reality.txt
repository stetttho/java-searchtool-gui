 This would have been a great story except for some fatal flaws that left me scratching my head thinking, "Where the heck was the editor on this one?" first of all, Sloan Reynolds is a cop  who was recently on television and in newspapers following a daring rescue of a toddler down a well. And the people of Palm Beach, who live only an hour away, haven't heard of her or seen her on the tube? Highly unlikely absolutely NO ONE would have recognized her. Highly unlikely that her father would NOT have done a background check on her before she came. Some of the police procedures were off the mark. And the epilogue fell far short of drawing everythiing together. Where was Sloan? Was she still a cop? What happened with her relationship with Paul, now her brother in law? What happened to Sloan's father? What was the final outcome of all that undercover work? What were the repercussions to the Reynolds name and business interests? Too many unanswered questions. It's too bad, too, because the characters were likeable - except Noah, who really curled my fists sometimes with his view on marriage and children and casual relationships. Of course you grudgingly fall for him like Sloan.
