 Well, after reading good reviews for this book, I bought it hoping for the best. And was disappointed to find a story with a weak female character, sexual tension and attraction that is non-existent between characters who supposedly fall in love, and a ludacrious ending that had me sitting back in my chair going, "What?!?"  WHITE MOUNTAIN starts off strong, but the lack of character in Isabella and the secrets revealed at the end are a joke. Don't get me wrong, the idea/concept is great, but the final product left something to be desired. McCall's STORM WARNING is a beach book worth the effort. Get it instead.
