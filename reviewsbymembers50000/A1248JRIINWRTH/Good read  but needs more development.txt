 This is my first Beverly Havlir. I really enjoyed "Bodyguard." It's not a new concept - cop has to watch over hot girl 24/7. Cop and girl get it on, bad guy comes after her... I enjoy this particular storyline, though, so it's all good for me. But I can't give this a total 5 stars because, while Paige and Nick are developed, there is just something missing from their relationship that makes me wonder if it's sex and not love. I think with a little more development on an emotional front - and not just in the bedroom - the book would have been fleshed out. The ending was also a little too rushed. But the writing is solid and I'm willing to check out more from this author.
