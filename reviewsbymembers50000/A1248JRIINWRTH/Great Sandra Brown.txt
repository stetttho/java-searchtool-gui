 "Chill Factor" is a fast-paced thriller that will keep on edge while reading about small town secrets exposed during the hunt for a serial murderer.   Folks in the town of Cleary are locking their doors in light of the disappearance of five young women in two years. Lilly Martin, ex-wife of the town's top cop, and the ever-sexy Ben Tierney are caught in a deadly snow and ice storm in the mountains while authorities have to call off their search for missing woman No. 5. The two stories are tied inexorably together by the crafty Brown. The romance is not as hot and tempestuous as in 2005's "White Hot," but still convincing in a love-at-first-sight way.   The plot falters near the end with a lot of action that will make some readers skip over what is obviously going to happen to the characters to see whudunit. And Lilly's trust issues in Tierney will become a bit tedious to some.   Brown is great at deflecting readers from the culprit until the end, but those intimately familiar with her work will hand pick the killer in no time.   Still, Lilly and Tierney's relationship, small-town gossip & secrets, a hothead ex-husband and the search for a killer make this colorful tale a keeper.
