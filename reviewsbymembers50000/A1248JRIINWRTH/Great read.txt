 This was my introduction to Robards and I plan to check out some more of her romantic suspense titles. It's fun, fast-paced, has characters you can LIKE and a great plot. I didn't give it a full five stars because I felt like the "killer' aspect wasn't developed enough. While the rest of the story ebbed and flowed with great detail, Robards finished the "killer" plot in such a hurry I got whiplash. Still, it's worth checking out.
