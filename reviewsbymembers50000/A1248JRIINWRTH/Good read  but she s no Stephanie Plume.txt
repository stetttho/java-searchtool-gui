 I initially picked this book up because I adore the Stephanie Plume series. While Dixie Flannigan is no Stephanie Plume, she is still a fallible character than any woman in her 30s or older can relate to. Quit her career for a new one, but it's not exactly her dream job. Has a man, but he's confusing the heck out of her and doesn't like her job. She wrestles with keeping herself so under wraps that she never gets close to people. That's what I like. This was my first Chris Rogers and I will definitely try the next one. Parker, her love interest, is a cad. If he doesn't straighten up and see what a great woman he has and stop trying to change her into what he believes he wants, then he has to go. Maybe kill him off and have Dixie solve the case while meeting the true love of her life...
