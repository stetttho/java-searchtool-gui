 Cheyenne McCray's Wildcard is more of an extended plot summary than an actual book.  Tracilyn McLeod comes back home after living in England for four years and falls hard for ranch hand Jess Lawless. She has issues of vulnerability from growing up on the plump side. Jess wants to get in her pants and, oh yeah, he's a secret DEA agent trying to take down a cattle rustling operation that's a front for drug smuggling. Of course his mind is rarely on his job in this book.  Most of this book is dedicated to Trace and Jess' sexual exploits and, in the beginning, her need to decide if she wants to throw away a career and two-year relationship in England for this rugged, cliched cowboy.  The book lacks a certain substance that was actually present in book 2, Wildcat. And in this installment, the mystery of who is behind the cattle rustling is almost an afterthought.   Ellora's Cave isn't always the place to go for great reading, but it's worth it when you find some gems like Woman on the Run and The Protectors.   There are too many substantial issues in this book for them to be dealth with in a few sentences. Wildcard could be a great book with more development.
