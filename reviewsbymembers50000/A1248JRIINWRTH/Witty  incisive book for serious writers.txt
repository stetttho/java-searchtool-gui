 I've read several books on writing that are so, well, BLAH. And many of them repeated confusing things like story arcs that I've head more times than I care to count at writing conferences.  James Scott Bell has nailed how to plot and structure a novel and he's sharing his knowledge with wit and clear-cut language that anyone can understand. Sometimes these books use terms and give definitions different from what they give at writing conferences and vice versa, which is terribly confusing. Bell cuts through the crap and gets to the heart of the craft. This book is incredible! I couldn't put it down and even highlighted important portions (which was most of the book). This book is worth paying full price. Get a copy for your library.
