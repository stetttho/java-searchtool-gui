 Thompson did a fabulous job of outlining a complex plot and keeping the reader guessing "Who Done It" in this suspense novel about a girl who goes missing three years ago only to be found after a flood upends her body. The book was fast-paced, witty and detailed accurately police procedures (a big plus in my eyes). My only regret is that the romance was buried within the plot and wasn't developed more. There was a budding sense of connection between Michael and Christine, but it wasn't brought to life, giving it tension and solid reality.
