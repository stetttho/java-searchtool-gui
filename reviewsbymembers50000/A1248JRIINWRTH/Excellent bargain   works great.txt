 When I purchased this item a year ago, I could not believe itworked. Seriously.   I have cats and with hairballs and precious little "accidents," I have a very hard time keeping the carpets clean. I bought this little ditty at a Target store and used it to clean some tough spots on carpet in my former apartment. I worked like a charm!  It's really easy to handle, to change brushes and refill cleaning solution. It works great on stairs, where it's tougher for me to vacuum. It pulls out dirt and other yucky messes - including color spills - and leaves the carpet fresh. You can also use your own solutions to clean, including bleach or peroxide and water and it doesn't hurt the machine.  I purposely waited a year to review this item so see how it was with wear and tear. It use it A LOT. And it's still going. For a purchase in today's cheaply-manufactured economy, that's a real plus.
