 This book is, overall pretty good. Not as suspenseful as Flash Point, but a good read. I was a little underwhelmed by the herione and her relationship with the hot bodied Josh Logan. There were times when the writing hit the mark on their relationship and other times when it came off a little flat. The ending was predictable. I wish the author had gone a little bit beyond the predictable to show us a flash of the future. If you want to try Hingle, get FLASH POINT definitely. THE WAGER, though secondary, is a good read for a quiet Sunday afternoon.
