 In this second in Brennan's trilogy, the deft, creative twist to words breathes life into an unimaginative plot and characters with internal and relationship flaws that are too common in serial killer fiction.   Miranda Moore and a friend were once captured and tortured by a serial killer. Miranda survived and fell in love with an FBI agent working on her case. Their relationship ends badly, but after 10 years, the two people who never forgot each other are thrown together as the killer murders the seventh known victim.  The serial killer in this book tortures his victims, then releases them into the woods and hunts them down, shooting them or using a hunting knife to cut their throats. This has not only been featured in several fictional crime dramas, but also the focus of a killer in Australian Tara Moss' "Split" and other novels.  Miranda and Quinn Peterson, the FBI agent, are well-rounded, well-written characters, though the details of their relationship is stereotypical to this plot line.  Also, I had the whodunit figured out pretty quickly, but please note that I read a lot of suspense and faithfully watch CSI and Law and Order.  Though the plot and charactes were unimaginative, I could not, in good conscious, give this book less than 3 stars because the writing is THAT good. If you are unfamiliar with this serial killer method - and cannot pick out killers as quickly as I can in books - you will likely enjoy this installment.
