 This is my first Eileen Dreyer thriller and what a ride it was. Molly, a 52-year old Vietnam vet, is an emergency room nurse in St. Louis who begins to get messages from a serial killer - likely someone from her past. The thing is, she isn't sure who it is.  With the help of her collegues and a love interest that Molly isn't sure she's interested in, Molly tries to piece together the mind of a killer in the hopes of discovering who it could be.   With elegant twists and turns, Dreyer's prose weaves a tantalizing tale of emotional disfuction, obsession and abuse into an intriguing novel that will keep readers turning the pages.  And Dreyer's technique - not so heavy on medical terminology that it gets dry -  allows the author to join the plot and subplot with a twist at the end that will leave some readers gasping.  This review is deliberately vague because I don't want to give anything away. Dreyer is dead on in her description of a serial killer's thought processes and the measures law enforcement - and one desperate woman - will take to catch the killer. (speaking as a former journalist who covered crime)
