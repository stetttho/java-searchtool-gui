 This story is not nearly as good as Beyond Control, York's latest. I really had to work hard to finish Crimons Moon. The werewolf and his "mate" just didn't have any chemistry. The plot was convoluted and there were too many convenient coincidences to make it suspenseful. The bad guy, Ethridge, was crazy and twisted - I would have liked to see his character developed a little more.  Sorry to say, but this one is going to the used book store. If you want to give it a try, buy it used.
