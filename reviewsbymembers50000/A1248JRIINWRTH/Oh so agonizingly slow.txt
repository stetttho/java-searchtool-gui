 Sorry Ms. Anders. I just couldn't get through it. I got to page 100 and was ready to pull my hair out with the slow pace and the flat, two-dimensional feel of the characters. The story seemed forced at times and it was all I could do not to scream.  And come on, this is a woman living alone and she just ignores all the signs that people have been in her house? No self-respecting woman living alone would be so careless - and not immediately call a cop friend to get some reassurance. From the parts I skimmed over, it appears Carolyn finally got her game on, except for the marriage.  Since I figured out "who done it" pretty quickly, I just skipped to the end to see if the led heroine finally got her stuff together. Thankfully, she did,but not in time to save my sanity.
