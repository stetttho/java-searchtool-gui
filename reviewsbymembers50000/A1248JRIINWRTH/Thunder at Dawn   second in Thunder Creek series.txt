 This follow up to "Thunder Creek" wasn't bad, though I must admit it has this feeling of being the second part of a trilogy, which is not so much concentrated on its own story, but laying the groundwork for Part III. The characters didn't seem as... developed, I guess. It was like everything just fell into place. I don't know how to explain it. I saw the words on the page, the emotions of the characters written right there, but I didn't feel it.  The mystery was pretty good, though a bit predictable when it comes to who's planting bomb threats at the McCallem construction site. One thing I had a problem with... The sheriff's little sister, heroine extraordinaire Faith Barclay, finds a dead body - a dead body is an unusual occurance in this little Wyoming town - and he stays away with his wife in New York - even as more fishy stuff starts happening in his quiet little burb. He leaves it up to his deputy sheriff to solve the case.  That doesn't make a lick of sense. No matter how devoted he is to his wife, he's a lawman. Of couse, based on the groundwork laid in this book, I see that becoming a plot device when the overzealous deputy sheriff runs against Ty Barclay. But that's a story for another day. Perhaps Part III?
