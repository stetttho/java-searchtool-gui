 "Fetish" has a great cover and intriguing intro on the back cover, but the story is not original. I gave it a higher rating because of author Tara Moss's use of psychological terms and understanding of profilers and stalkers.  The romance is okay, though you see what's going to happen from a mile away. The killer is a bit formulaic - he would have been good in the early 90s, but today we are far more gripped by the ones that play with our heads. We get in his head some, certainly, but not to a degree that leaves goosebumps on the flesh. It is a solid read, though, even with these problems. And I am curious to read the follow up to this, which I can so far only find on CD. I just want to know what happens to our intrepid heroine, Mak.  If you want something that's not too hard on your brain, get this one used.
