 Linda Castillo's characters in "The Shadow Side" start off looking like they might be interesting. The classic anti-hero: a cop on disability unsure if trusts his own judgment anymore. The Heroine: a brilliant scientist who has devoted her life to her work because of personal tragedy. Neither are looking for love.  But as the book wears on, they stay stagnant and somewhat two-dimensional. I've noticed a lot of repetition when it comes to the thoughts of the characters - especially when it comes to their attraction for one another.   Now the plot is somewhat unique and interesting, though the characters themselves seem to drag it down in the prose.  If you buy it, get it used. Don't pay full-price
