 This book is a futuristic romance full of really hot guys. But it just seemed like some of the plot was not developed enough. I don't want to get into too many details for those who want to read it, but I can say that there didn't seem to be enough development of our hunk's devastating past, or our lovely heroine's link to the future through her parents. The book ended too abruptly for my taste. If you want to check it out, get it used.
