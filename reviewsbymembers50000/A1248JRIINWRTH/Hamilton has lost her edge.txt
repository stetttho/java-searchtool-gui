 I recently started on this series and was hooked after book 2. Now, with Killing Dance, Hamilton has introduced so much lust with herione Anita Blake and Richard, the werewolf, and Jean-Claude, the vampire, that it simply takes away from any plot. I'm sorry, but a menage a trois between then was simply too much for me - even if it didn't go all the way. The series was good when the sexual tension was the backdrop to intriguing mysteries. Now, it's the focal point, with plot and substance running a far cry behind. I doubt I return to this series. I went ahead and read the reviews for the next six books in the series and I'm not impressed. Sorry, Hamilton, you've lost me on this one.
