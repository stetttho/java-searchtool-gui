 This was my introduction to Julie Garwood and let me say, I can't wait to tackle more of her books! I'm not going to go into details on the plot - you can get that above - but I will tell you that it's focused, though not necessarily original, and the character development is phenomenol! I actually liked all the characters featured here - even the deranged serial killer. It was a little disappointing that they gave away so much on the jacket - it took the reader more than 100 pages to catch up to what they already knew from the jacket summary. But this is definitely worth it - and worth a full-price buy.
