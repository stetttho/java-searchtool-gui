 After reading rave reviews, I decided to give this a whirl. It was good, but in places was lackluster and not very imaginative. I felt like at times I was reading the screen play to "Van Helsing" or "Silver Bullet." Some things were very scripted in traditional werewolf form. I liked the Native American twist, though I must admit I've seen it produced before in a variety of romance books.  And the German guy who was the werewolf hunter - smacked of the Van Helsing character from Dracula with Keanu Reeves & Winona Ryder years ago. I think it was Anthony Hopkins who played him. Old dude with cool weapons to down the enemy. Exactly like the author's character. The difference? The author's guy hunted werewolves, not vampires. If you can't keep your hands off any werewolf fiction written in first person, you will probably like this book better than I did. I enjoy fantasy fiction occassionally - I just like tales that are more unique. If you want great paranormal romance, try "Beyond Control" by Rebecca York instead. It totally rocks the house - and will be better bang for your buck.
