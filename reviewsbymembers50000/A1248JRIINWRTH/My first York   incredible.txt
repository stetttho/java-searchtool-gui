 I've looked into Rebecca York for a while, but I'm not much into werewolves and vampires, so I shied away. BUT I was in Borders the other day and couldn't resist the pull BEYOND CONTROL had on me. And I'm glad I gave into temptation. I couldn't put it down! The story flowed, stayed fast-paced. The characters were real, fallible and communicated with psychic powers they truly discovered when they met. The romance is hot, the suspense thrilling. This book is a keeper. And it's definitely worth full price.
