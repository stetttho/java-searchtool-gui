 Ginna Gray captured my interest with "Witness," and I eagerly snatched a copy of her latest, "Fatal Flaw," when I saw it at the bookstore.  Total dud! While the serial killer plot is well-developed - though I figured out within the first few pages who the killer was - the book seemed to deteriorate at the end. It was as though the author was pulled in too many directions - from family scuffles, to births, to shootings, to chasing a serial killer and - oh, yeah - two people, like, falling in love or something. The last five chapters seemed disjointed - they just didn't flow like the beginning of the book. And sometimes it was like just reading words on a page - the characters somehow became sterile, cookie cutter, and reading their dialog was like watching a really bad school play. And don't even get me started on the lack of development of the killer. It would have been good to have a few sections from the killer's POV, so we could see into his sorry, black soul. Instead, we just sort of happen on the information about him at the very end of the book. The author does try to put a few red herrings in there, but they really weren't that effective (but I read a lot of mysteries, so that may be the case). And I couldn't relate to the heroine's love interest, Doc Mark Adams. Unlike FBI agent Sam Rawlins from "Witness," Adams doesn't seem as well-developed. He's hot, he loves his family and is in love with Det. Casey O'Toole, but we see these things as though through a dirty window. We don't get a "feel" for the doctor, his inner-most thoughts and feelings, his soul. If you want to check this book out, make sure to get it used - don't pay full price.  ang
