 I wasn't into the vampire genre with Hamilton made her debut. Now, thanks to some hot stuff from Ellora's Cave, I'm exploring the genre more thoroughly. A friend bought Guilty Pleasures for me and while I liked it, it wasn't the greatest. Still, I liked Anita Blake and wanted to know more about what happens to the petite animator. The second book - I couldn't put it down. I can't wait to read through the series and see if anything ever developes with Jean-Claude, the sexy Master of the City she desires, but will not pursue because he is the Undead that she has sworn to kill.
