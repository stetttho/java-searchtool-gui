 Pefect Weapon is several cuts above Fetzer's last, Naked Truth. Dr. Sydney Hale escapes a terrorist attack on a top secret government facility. A world-weary Marine (who could be stereotypical, but isn't) is hot on her trail to find and protect her. This fast-paced read will leave your heart pounding. The developing relationship between Hale and Marine Jack Wilson is woven nicely into the plot, but doesn't overshadow the events that really make this book rock. Fetzer has got her groove on with this taut romantic suspence, much like one of her short stories in Tell It To the Marines (also a great read). I was a bit confused when Special Agent Cisco, a man who tries to protect government secrets at any cost, discovers ... whodunit. It was as thought Cisco pulled his conclusions out of thin air. Perhaps I missed something earlier in the story, but I read that section four times to make certain I got it right. Other than that, this book is well worth paying full price - and those who have read my previous reviews know I do not say that lightly. Looking forward to Fetzer's next read.
