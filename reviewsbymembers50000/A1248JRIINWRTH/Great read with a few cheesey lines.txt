 Overfal is my first David Dun and it was a fast-paced thrill ride. Sam Wintripp rescues actress Anna Wade as she is running from corporate crazies who have altered her brother's mental stability. Thus lies a tale with some cheesey dialog, scenes that are totally unrealistic - and a great plot that will keep the reader going. There are some scenes that I simply couldn't hold back the laughter, but the writing is so good - and the plot interesting enough - that it kept me hooked. Dun gets a little long winded with explanations of overfals and brain activity (those parts I tended to skim), but I liked this book enough to want to read more. And, like the female I am, I hope Sam Wintripp finds a woman to give him the balanced harmony his Indian mother says he lacks.
