 Jedidiah Glaze is a covert government agent running from internal demons. Amelia Slater is a writer dealing with demons of her own. When Alpha Jed and precocious Amy become more than friends, each must help the other deal with their private demons.   The plot from this 1987 JAK is clich?d, but entertaining and well-written. JAK's attention to detail of the off-the-beaten-path island of Orleana and the emotional reality of murder and blackmail on the main characters is potent.   Amelia - Amy - is strong for a female character written at this time, though she does have bouts of feminine temper that remind me of the books where it was OK for a male character to threaten to beat the female.   Still, this work is a good read - and one of JAKs greatest early works. It's been republished, so check for used copies before you purchase new.
