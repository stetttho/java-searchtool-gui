 Lt. Eve Dallas is catching killers once again in this installment of the In Death series. The story is great, with two identical murders of father and son body sculpters. It's up to Lt. Dallas - along with her amusing cop sidekicks and, of course, her hot husband, Roark, to find out whodunit. The book starts off great, but toward the end, begins to drag with so many details about cloning, illegal experiements and politics. The ending is a bit over-the-top (not giving away any details, kids) and so unrealistic that it took me a while to get through it - an unusual occurance for me. Still, this is a well-written read and certainly worth a turn of page.
