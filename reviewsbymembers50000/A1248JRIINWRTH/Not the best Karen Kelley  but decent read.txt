 I was waitng for this book to come out after reading Southern Exposure. It wasn't nearly as good as the previous book, but it's still a worthwhile read. The character development isn't as solid and Jessica Nelson will get on your nerves with her I-want-to-be-a-cop, I-don't-want-to-be-a-cop thoughts. Buy it used.
