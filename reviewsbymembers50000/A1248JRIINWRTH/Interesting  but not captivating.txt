 This was my first Lisa Gardner, and while I do plan to check out The Perfect Husband, this book (Alone) left me forcing myself to try to finish it. I gave it three stars, however, for the following reasons:  Police sniper Bobby Dodge is a character with depth and street smarts. Catherine Gagnon has dark, hidden depths to her soul. And the chemistry between the two - intensified by Dodge's inability to see the truth in her eyes - was simply stunning.  This book was well-written, the plot was intricate, but for some reason, I simply could not get into it. I skipped some and went to the end to see if my suspicions were correct, then put it down for something else.  I'm not sure why I wasn't taken with Alone. There are so many positives to this novel, I'm surprised it didn't suck me right in and leave me breathless. Instead, it left my mind wandering.  If you get it, try it used and see if it's your style.
