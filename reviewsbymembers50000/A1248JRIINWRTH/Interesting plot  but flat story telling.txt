 Oldests Kind of Magic is a story that never fulfills the plotline's great potential.  Daria Morgan is a magic practitioner who doesn't believe in a soul-mate imperative, a cliched version of the romantic storyline of finding Mr. Right. She's a virgin and will be until she meets him. Bent Benthausen is the stereotypical CEO who needs Daria's special consultation services.   The problem with "The Oldest Kind of Magic" is that the characters fall flat on the page. There is no life to them. Instead of being them, feeling with them, like a reader should, the reader watches them float through convoluted talk from Daria's family about soul mates and magicians and the subplot of sabatoge on a company Bent is trying to turn around - which could have been better developed.   The dialog is archaic - not conversational - and very distracting at times with it's formality. Bent's character isn't believable and Daria is, well, the same in some instances.   That said, there is potential with author Ann Macela. It might be worth it to read her next book to see if she gets her groove on a a paranormal romance author. Of course, I won't test that theory at full price.
