 The Anniversary was filled with so many twists and diversions, readers can't help but keep turning pages until the end.  Three women tied to a serial killer executed five years ago are once again stalked - this time by someone close to the killer. Gutman uses incredible detail, revealing dialogue and stark contrasts between the lives of characters (particularly the three main women) to weave a stunning tale of suspense. There are many red herrings in this book, and while some familiar with legal thrillers may guess whodunit rather quickly, others will be stumped until the very end.  For me, it was a toss up between characters and I was surprised. That's very unusual, as I read scores of suspense novels a year. The Anniversary is a full-price buy - and a keeper.
