 No, the book wasn't perfect, but it will peak your interest. I'm not into Vampire series' - I am the romantic suspense queen - so for me to say this is a good start says something. Give it a try. Remember: This is the first book in the series. You're not going to know everything. After all, why have a series if you solve everything in the first book? I agree that Keller and Cyprien don't exactly sizzle, but there is something there and I hope we see it develop.
