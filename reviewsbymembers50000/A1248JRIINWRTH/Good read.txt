 This is the first Jacey Ford I've read and I really liked it - not loved like some books that grip your soul, but I would definitely look for her next one. Strong female Aimee Devlin and strong, sexy male Race Gardner are a combustible combination. And what's really cool is they are fallible people who fall hard, fast, but do what is right for their country no matter how painful it is to their relationship.
