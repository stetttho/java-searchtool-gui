 This is a rare CD for me.  I saw SGT open for Sarah Mclachlan some 10 years ago and I was intrigued.  I got a cassette single from that show and always told myself I would get the CD.  Nine years pass.  I found the cassette, played it, went out and bought the CD..finally.  It's great.  The trance that I was put in during their show was evoked again.  The concept of a poetic, etheral, rhythm-driven new-age-esqe world beat CD sounds bloated and self-important, but everything works on this release.  THis is a treasure of the 90s.  "Estranged Wife" is phenomenal.
