 This is the best film on art I have ever seen.  It unfolds in near real-time for the characters and the viewers.  Yes it is slow, deliberate, and calculated but it is far from predictable or boring.  People who have never experienced the multiple levels of creating art in some form will be treated to the simulated experience of the characters in this film.  It isn't exciting in the sense of action but rather like having something dawn on you.  I have returned to this film several times over the last 14 years and it never ceases to amaze me.  It will touch what creates inside of you.  Enjoy the view.
