 This is a perfect ghost story for younger people in the PG-13 age range.  It is not violent, there is no nudity, no cruelty, no blood or extreme terror-filled scenes.  My daughter loves this film because, as she puts it, it is so "sad" and "beautiful" with cool music.  The children actors are astounding and will captivate any kid who watches.  The photography is excellent, the sets, ambiance, and especially the music is top-notch.  In a DVD sea of shocking and inappropriate horror subject matter, The Others offers something you as a parent can view with your child and actually gain insights into tragedy, resolve, and hidden intentions. The ending is especially good because it has no good or bad people or anything simplistic or pedestrian.    This being said, be cautioned that suicide, murder and a brief husband/wife intimacy scene are all implied, as well as the theme that a marriage has ended.  These are big and painful subjects that you may not wish our 13-year-old to see, but be assured that nothing is really depicted on screen as such.  But it is a part of the story and you may need to be prepared to explain these things in whatever manner you see fit.    Aside from this parental-oriented endorsement I can suggest this film to any adult who is looking for a textured story with excellent acting.  Do not compare this to Sixth Sense or any other recent "surprise ending" ghost movies because it is more a character and mood piece that a whodunnit or mystery.  Most will figure the movie out before it is over so if it is a shocker or puzzle you seek this is not likely to grab you.
