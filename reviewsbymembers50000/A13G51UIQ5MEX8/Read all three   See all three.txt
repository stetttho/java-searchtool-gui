 This is the kind of graphic novel that actually inspires.  While not as beautiful to look at as a typical noir, horror, sex,  or superhero GN this series (with AEIOU and CLUMSY) is like having a buddy spill his guts to you while drawing pictures on napkins at a bar.  It's intimate and unflinching but not overdosed on self-anything.  Not grim, not sensational.  I can see that many GN enthusiasts would be bored or unimpressed with the simplicity of the art and the unmelodramatic narrative, but something tells me that Brown is not aiming to convert fans of GNs or to get revenge by virtue of dirty laundry.  This is not a dirty diary with airbrushed pictures.  This looks and feels more like a series of emotional microscope slides.
