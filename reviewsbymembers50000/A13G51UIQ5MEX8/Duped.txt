 I already owned a bootleg copy that had a 1:85 ratio to provide for old hard-to-read subtitles.  The sound is skewed to one channel and the print was average.  Compared to the horrible print that this new DVD features my bootleg looks like a masterpiece.  I join the many opinions here that this DVD is unwatchable with the blurry image, the burn spots and the scratches that appear at the begining and end of every reel (every 15-20 mins) and the wierd noises from the damaged optical sound from the print.  Find a bootleg.
