 A mood film like "Witness" from 1985.  Concerning itself with more unspoken and unshown emotions, this film grandly protrays a woman and a boy both "frozen" by either loss or longing.  The husband character arcs with expected patience, anger, and then a snap. The actions are not realistic but they are not meant to be so.  At times I wished more information to validate the lonley tones of this film and earlier I commented that there was a need for flashbacks or some other device to explain at least the boy'smotivations for his actions. That being said, the music and atmosphere are rich and thus gives the film a real heaviness that does in fact create bouyancy for the whole.  Sad, effective, but distant. A neat failure.
