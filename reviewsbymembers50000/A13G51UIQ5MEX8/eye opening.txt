 I read this book as an unedited proof back in 1992 when I found it at a used bookstore.  I found that not only did this book enlighten me on the "paradoxes" of the "lesbian nation," I discovered just what a microcosmic subject the lesbian perspective is for almost all of the world.  The conflicts, history, and resolute endeavors that flow from essay to essay was enriching beyond my expectations.  One of the most important books I've ever read and I cannot recommend it enough.
