 I agree with one review here that stated that the Haden version of this album made me hear things I hadn't appreciated in the original.  It made me realize that this is my favorite Who album after all...being in the running with Quad, Next and Tommy.  I would say that 90% of Petra's versions of these songs are on the mark with some weak spots in Mary Anne and Silus Stingy.  Her Rael is tremendous.  That alone justifies buying and listening to this.
