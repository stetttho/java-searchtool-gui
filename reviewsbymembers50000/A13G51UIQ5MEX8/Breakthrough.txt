 This is the result of the Grateful Dead playing shows for 10 solid years and perfecting their songcraft with the help of other musicians, themselves, and the otherly world of creative process.  This is a Master's Thesis of music, the greatest album the Dead ever recorded.  It has the power of a tremendous live show juxtaposed with the fragility of flower petals.  The intimacy that weaves through the songs is the big surprise and you may find that the relaxed mellow with surge into a huge amount of energy while listening.  You'll dance in the dark.  This is the Dead's smoothest, most exciting and powerful studio recording ever.    Get it for the songs.  Keep it for how it will grow with you for a long, long time.  This is the CD for the deadhead who has peace with their old, useless, and passive listening style and seeks true artistic beauty to dance in their brain.    Unusual Occurrences in the Desert indeed....
