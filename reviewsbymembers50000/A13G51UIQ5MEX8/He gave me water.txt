 Find it.  Do whatever you can.  This LP blew me away in 1988 when I first heard it at the radio station where I worked.  I can only suggest that if true musical fusion of funk, garage bands, celtic dance, rock, spirituals, and comedy among others is your thing then do whatever you can to find this CD. It is compelling and challenging and entirely approachable. Sankefinger was a genius and I can only hope to own the Vestal Virgin's other recording from Chicago.  My thirst for truly original and enjoyable sounds, music and excitement were met on one CD...this.  Quench that killer Scottish thirst you have.
