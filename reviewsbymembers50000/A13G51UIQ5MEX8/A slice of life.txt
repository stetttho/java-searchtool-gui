 This is a complete offering of Phish, listening to two unedited shows back to back.  Like most of Phish's fans, I tend to have a lot of recordings made from shows already.  It is these shows that I shall compare HAMPTON  COMES ALIVE.  I agree with some reviewers insofar that this isn't the best  set of shows I've heard.  I have lousy bootlegs of poor quality that are  more exciting than HAMPTON.  I've heard better Roggaes, Divided Skys, Harry  Hoods, Frees and Bold as Loves.  Sounds like I hate this, right? No.  Like  most shows, this is a complete package, meant to heard in its entirety.   When I do that, I really enjoy these two shows.  There is a definite mood  and feel to them and that makes them distinctive.  I love the Possum,  Mike's Song, Simple, Split Open and Melt, Driver,and Stash.  The covers are  fun as well, with Cry Baby Cry and Rock and Roll being my favorites.  This  ultimately makes this a good purchase for me, as I will listen to this show  over time again and again...very likely growing to love songs on this set  that I  currently have indifferent feelings about.  That's how it goes with  other shows I have and I expect HAMPTON will be no different.  Talk to me  in a year.
