 If one is new to Phish and is seeking a first CD for a listen pass this release over.  Phish makes intensly introspective and literate music between themselves and their audience.  This CD speaks directly to that sense and thus it may alienate a listener who seeks some form of welcoming or recognition from the music.  Buy Picture of Nectar or Billy Breathes for a first CD experience.  I have read other reviews that hate this CD for its quick, slapped together, raw, unpolished feel and sound and to be honest I agree with much of what is said...  We are talking about four experts in sonic journeys who decided, very pointedly so, to release this music in an almost Twilight Zone.  Not live, not a demo, not a studio album, but something altogether different... The audio recording of a conversation between themselves...like a police wire tap.  We are invited into this round room of theirs, a musical buffet of styles, jams, statements and almost whispers.  I would say such a context means we may not like what we hear, as the band is truly steering clear of hit singles or conformity even within their own stylistic powers.  Phish communicate with us by communicating to each other, like an intense simulation of a brainwave. It's hard to pin down unless you see a live show.  Their music is cross refrenced in phan books and websites for a reason.  They play music and sing songs but they create a language all their own.  Buy this CD if it is this you seek.  Expect no review to prepare you.
