 Eyes Wide Shut presents a married couple on the adult discovery of the true nature of sexual paradox.  Sex, as presented in most films or media, is shown to be:  a commodity that can be bought,  a taken for granted romantic bell and whistle,   a spiritual plateau,  or a pure fact of biological life.  Yet when the character of BILL hears his wife ALICE confess an extremely intimate sexual fantasy about another man, his preconceived ideas about sex (as mentioned above) are destroyd.  First, the romantic and faithful sex between husband and wife are shattered, then the biological fuction of life (in the old man's death scene) is weirded out when the grieving daughter hits on Bill, then the notion of prostitution is undermined and yields HIV, then sex as spiritual is revealed in a cult setting with dire consequences for Mandy, Bill, Alice,  and all concerned.   Sex is pleasure and it is death.  It is not any one thing and it is certainly not anything that anyone in the movie has a grip on.  This is a movie that dethrones sexual desire and acts as anything that can be understood...and yet it clearly is in everyone's life.  Kubrick's film is a revelation in an overly-sexed world that no matter how hard any of us tries, we cannot know sexuality like we claim.  There is an inner universe in Kubrick's film that comes clearly out into the open in the form of smooth tracking shots and lush lighting, colors and staging.  Why this film was marketed as a blockbuster just makes me laugh. It is the antithesis of that very notion.
