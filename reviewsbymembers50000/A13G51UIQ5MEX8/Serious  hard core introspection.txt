 This is the one TD Cd to get (if you can) when wordless and complex moods are what you seek.  Beyond the space rock of Pink Floyd or 2001 Soundtrack enthusiasts, this is an aural soundscape of something so subjective that even writing this favorable review seems trite.  I have read that many TD fans hate this era of their music and that this album is the equivalant of a gigantic comma...a pause of statement rather than a concrete creation.  I disagree.  This is my favorite.  This is the recorded journey of TD.  Only they could know what inspired and moved the sounds they chose.  We as listeners can bring our own minds to their 50 yard-line and create a true interactive experience of our own.  Just get it.
