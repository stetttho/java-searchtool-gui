 This could possibly be the greatest decision Criterion has ever made.  This film is beyond the creativity or hilarity of Ed Wood or any other low budget horror flick.   The film "Evil Dead" owes it's very life to Equinox. This is a proud addition to any horror collection and can sit alongside the Criterion version of Carnival of Souls on my shelf as soon as it is released.  It is a sure thing you will never be the same when you see the flying devil-head bat thingie attacking a teenage girl.  Now if Criterion would only release "The Incredible Two-Headed Transplant."
