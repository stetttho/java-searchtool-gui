 Reading Peter Pan with Beckers illustrations gives me a renewed appreciation of reading childrens stories.  The book itself is a collectors piece.  The story itself is wonderful of course, a true classic, and the  book itself is a perfect vehicle for the story.  The pages are silky, the  illustrations are magical.  It isn't a what you would call a "picture  book" but has the right amount of illustrations in it without  detracting one from reading.  A book to be cherished and kept as a  collectors piece.
