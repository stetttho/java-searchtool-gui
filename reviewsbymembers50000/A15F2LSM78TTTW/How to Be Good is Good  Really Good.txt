 This is a story about a family trying to come to terms with a spiritual change that takes place in the husband/father.  The protagonist, the unhappy wife, finds that her husband has gone thru a metamorphosis from a cynical,  sophisticated but hateful creature to an, in my opinion, equally hateful, milque-toast pseudo-saint...  The story had me analysing what IS good in the true sense of the word. Is being good so important?  The book is funny and sad and sophisticated, wise and paradoxical.  It is a great read.
