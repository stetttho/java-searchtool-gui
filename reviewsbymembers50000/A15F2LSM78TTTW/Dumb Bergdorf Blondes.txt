 I got this book because I like reading the Plum Sykes articles in Vogue magazine.  However, this book... well.  I started to read this book and was shocked, SHOCKED(!) at how AWFUL it was. How could she get this published! I was ready to return it... then I decided to give a go and read the rest.  I found myself rather entertained by this silly novel by the end of it.  I give it 2 stars because it kind of won me over (a bit) but Plum can do better.
