 I heard the Prairie Cats last night at the Hudson River Festival in New York City. In a word, they are AWESOME! They were so good, that I did three things I usually never do at these concerts: 1. I got up and danced.  2. I stayed for the entire performance, without worrying about the length of my commute home  and the lateness of the hour.  3. I bought their CD. If you like Swing, this CD is a must-have!
