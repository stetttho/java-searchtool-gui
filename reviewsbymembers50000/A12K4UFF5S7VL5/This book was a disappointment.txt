 I was looking for a book that would help get me motivated and psyched up to start walking, and this was definitely not it! The author seemed to be more interested in trying to convince his audience that walking was an as good or better exercise than running, than in presenting helpful information for those already interested in walking. I got very bored with reading about "walking gaits" and "running gaits" and gave up trying to finish the book.
