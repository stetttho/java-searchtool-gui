 My sister bought one of these last year for my niece's birthday party. It was a huge hit, and continues to be one even now, a year later. We just used it again for another party, and the kids loved it!  In the course of the year, it's been used on numerous occasions, without any problems. If you consider what you would spend to rent one of these, or for party entertainers for one party, this is a very good investment. Unlike one-time party rentals, this is yours to keep and have fun with. My sister's castle has been used for several kids parties, so she's really gotten her money's worth out of the castle.
