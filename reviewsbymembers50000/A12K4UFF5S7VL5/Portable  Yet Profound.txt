 The ideas in this book are presented in a series of essays. Even if you only read a few pages a day, you'll learn something valuable. I found the quotes used at the beginning of each section to be very inspiring, and have copied several of them into my journal. The book is a perfect size to be easily carried in a knapsack or purse if you want to read a section a day as a daily meditation. Overall, this book has been helpful to me in my quest to begin practicing an attitude of gratitude.
