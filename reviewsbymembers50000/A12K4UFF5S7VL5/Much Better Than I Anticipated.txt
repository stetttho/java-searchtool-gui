 I had wanted to see this movie, but wasn't sure if I would like it. I was very pleasantly surprised! Johnny Depp was hilarious as Captain Jack Sparrow, and the rest of the cast was excellent. The movie was much, much better than I had thought it would be, and the plot was believable. The movie score added to the experience. It's definitely a "must-see".
