 This book may look small, but it packs a wallop for everyone who's having trouble starting - whether it be starting "the great American novel", a painting, new business or screenplay. Suzanne Falter-Barnes also shows us how "failures" actually help us in the creative process, and be positive experiences along our path. It's not necessarily a matter of having talent, it's all about having the passion to follow our dreams.
