 While I expected this book to be uplifting and inspiring, I didn't expect all of the wonderful advice that I found in it! Unlike some other books that I read once, and then give away, I will definitely be keeping this one so that I can refer back to it regularly. There is a wealth of valuable, practical and down-to-earth information in this little book that anyone, man or woman, can follow. Everyone can benefit from the advice in this book.
