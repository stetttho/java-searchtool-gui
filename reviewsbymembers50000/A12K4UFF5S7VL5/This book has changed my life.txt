 I can't even begin to tell you how much I love this book! This is the book that pushed me full-throttle into becoming a life coach. "Finding Your Own North Star" is, in my opinion, THE book to use when trying to design a life that's in-synch with who you really are. Martha Beck really "gets it". I enjoy her writing style, because she's down-to-earth and funny, too! Don't drink any liquids while reading, though, because you'll find yourself laughing when you least expect it!
