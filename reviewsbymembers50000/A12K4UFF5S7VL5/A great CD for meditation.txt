 I was skeptical at first when I ordered this, because I've had bad luck with several meditation music CDs I've purchased. I'm happy to say that I was very pleasantly surprised with this one. I received it about a week ago. I've used it a few times already, and am very pleased with it. Its soothing tones enable me to meditate and focus on each chakra easily, without being distracted.
