 I just bought this and am now listening to my iPod through my home stereo. Unlike the previous reviewer, I had no difficulty selecting a radio station (all four stations, 88.1, 88.3, 88.5 and 88.7 appear to work fine), or getting static instead of music.  The sound is good, and the only time I get any significant static is when I move the iPod a few feet away from my stereo receiver. Considering the low price of the item, I am very pleasantly surprised.
