 Ditto to what another reviewer said about seeing Big Bill Morganfield in person! I had the opportunity to see him up close at the Blues, BBQ & Fireworks event in NYC. I had never heard or seen him before, and I was completely blown away by him! If you think the CD is great, by all means, try to catch him in person!
