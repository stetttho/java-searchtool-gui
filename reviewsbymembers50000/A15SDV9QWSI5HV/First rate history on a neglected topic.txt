 Unlike his first book Rockets of the World, Retro Rockets is not principally about scaling data for modellers.  In this book he covers in great detail the pioneers of liquid fuel rockets with emphasis on Robert  Goddard, a man whose achievements have not received anything like the  recognition they deserve.  But he also outlines the German and Russian  rocket societies that flourished between the world wars, and spends a  little time on the development of the first ballistic missile, the A4  (V2). Some might find the detailed descriptions of the versions these  early rockets went through a bit tedious, but for any rocketry buff or  student of technical history Retro Rockets should be a must read.
