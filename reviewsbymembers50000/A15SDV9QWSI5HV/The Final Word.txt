 This excellent book may well be the definitive work on the tragedy of Ruby Ridge.  I was prepared for another diatribe; either Randy Weaver the martyr or Randy Weaver the lawless, racist scum.  Instead, Jess Walter has written a very even-handed chronicle that left me terribly sad. If Walter's facts are right, (and they're certainly believable,) this was a story without unalloyed heroes or villains.  He takes us through the Weaver family's odyssey from fundamentalist Christians to - well, whackos.  He takes us through the story of how the U.S. Marshalls sent to bring in an everyday, minor fugitive found the case spinning out of their control, leaving them on a mountaintop with two people and a dog dead, and the whole world watching.  And he explains the inexplicable; how on earth a law enforcement officer could be in a blind with a .308 and orders to shoot on sight. This is one of the few really essential books I've read this year.
