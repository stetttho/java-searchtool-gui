 It was interesting to listen to the compendium of Lehrer songs, many of which I had only heard in excerpts or through rumor.  It's remarkable how well some of them have held up, for topical humor.  I was surprised, though, by how many of them were gruesome and macabre.  Some of his humor  wasn't all that funny.  Even so, I laughed out loud at "National  Brotherhood Week" and "Werher Von Braun," and a few others.   And all the recordings are from really high-quality masters.  It could have  been recorded yesterday. Not so heartwarming, though, was the sheer  repetitiveness of the set.  CD's 1 and 2 are virtual duplicates of each  other, one being studio recordings and the other live performances.  And  it's remarkable how similar they are.  Boy, he rehearsed one delivery style  and then he stuck to it. The third CD has some great songs not on the  other two, but it also has a lot of fluff from The Electric Company and  some orchestrated versions of songs on the other two disks.  Lehrer's voice  and delivery really don't lend themselves to orchestra accompaniment. My  recommendation?  Unless you're a serious Lehrer fan, find a single CD that  has most of the songs you like, and stick with that.
