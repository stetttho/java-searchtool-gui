 L. Neil Smith can't write bad fiction.  Wardove is proof that he can write fiction that isn't great. The writing is tight and the characters are believable.  But it's by far the most conventional and predictable plot I've ever read from Smith.  There are none of the startling new SF concepts, no new philosophical insights to mull over, not even much libertarian rabble-rousing. He presents us with a 900-year-old post-apocalypse lunar libertarian paradise, but fails to describe it at all; it's not even a backdrop to the action.  His aliens talk and act just like humans.  In the prologue he gives away everything about the ending but the identity of the villain, and most of the characters are so unlikeable that it could have been any of them and we wouldn't really care.  And he dots the beginning, end, and sometimes even the middle of every chapter with faux rock lyrics that add nothing but obstacles for your eyes to trip over. Whoever did the blueline editing for this edition at pulpless.com should never work in the business again. Some El Neil books are among my all-time favorites and some are not, but this is the first one I can only describe as disappointing.  He never finished the trilogy (unless the Martyn books count) and that's a shame, because the Coordinated Arm concept was intriguing.  But if this is as far as he could take it, maybe it's for the best.
