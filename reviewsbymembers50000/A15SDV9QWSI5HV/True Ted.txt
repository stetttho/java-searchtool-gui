 I've always found Ted Nugent the Character one of the most entertaining things to come out of Detroit, that very entertaining place.  I haven't really been a fan of Ted Nugent the musician since the early Amboy Dukes.  Just too raucous, too damn loud. But some shooting friends kept telling me I had to hear this Spirit of the Wild CD, so I broke down and bought a copy.  Though most of the lyrics are banal beyond belief, I must say the man can certainly play a guitar.  Some of the cuts, like "Tooth, Fang and Claw" and "Primative Man" have become favorite songs to play while driving fast on the interstate.  The first time I heard "Kiss My A**" I laughed so hard I thought I'd need clean underwear.  "Janet REEEno!"  Almost makes me wish Clinton were still in power, so the song would be topical.  It rakes the flesh of the people we love to hate. "Fred Bear" is a song I'd heard about for years but had never actually heard.  I must admit it's moving, but still disappointing.  First, it's more about Ted than Fred.  Second, the lyrics are embarrassing.  "There I was, back in the wild again/I felt right at home, where I belonged."  Sheesh. A person who likes loud metal rock would probably get a lot more enjoyment from the CD than I have.  Heh, but I do seem to play it a lot.
