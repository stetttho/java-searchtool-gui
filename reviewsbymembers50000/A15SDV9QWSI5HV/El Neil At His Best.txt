 The thing that most intrigues me about Smith's fiction is that, even though I know he's going to preach libertarianism to me, I also know he's going to slip in at least one new thought I'd never considered.  I just never know when it's coming, or from what direction. So...was the invention of agriculture really a positive turning point in human history?  I must admit the question had never occurred to me. The characterizations are stronger in this novel than in some of his earlier work.  I get the impression that he's more confident, finding his own voice rather than trying to be Heinlein.   You can find things to quibble with.  The Pallas society is a bit self-consciously old-west.  In an environment where all guns have to be imported from Earth I couldn't get past how casually Emerson acquired an extraordinary speciman.  The ending left me a bit unsatisfied. But all in all it's a very fine novel; engrossing and thought-provoking as almost all Smith books are, and highly entertaining.  There are very few contemporary authors that I follow around to see when the next book is due; Smith has become one of them.
