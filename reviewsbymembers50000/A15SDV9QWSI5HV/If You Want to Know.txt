 If you want to know what gunowners are so upset about, read this book. As fiction it has its faults. It's very long.  The main character - especially during his childhood - is not especially believable.  There's some gratuitous sex that doesn't add anything but gratuitous sex.  And there were times when I believed if I read one more variation on "all for not paying a $200 tax because a piece of steel or wood was too long or too short" I would certainly puke. Also (and this is a built-in hazard of mixing history with polemic fiction) I didn't know where the history ended and the fiction began, which meant I will always be afraid to use the things I may have learned in discussions for fear I'm repeating fiction as fact. One thing I DID find plausible was the climax of the story, which provides one possible answer to the questions, "Suppose you did decide your government had crossed the line into tyranny? What do you think you'd do about it?" The argument normally runs that armed citizens are irrelevant because they couldn't beat the army. But who says they'd be facing the army? I found the book difficult to put down even though I'm normally bored by the same old pro-gun arguments, having read them all a hundred times before. Even at 850+ pages, it's a surprisingly good yarn. And it definitely sums up the beliefs, fears, hopes and revenge fantasies of the American gun culture very nicely.
