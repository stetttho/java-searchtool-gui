 What I've always liked about Larry Watson's books was the terse writing, the feel of the west, and the complete immersion into the world of masculinity, which is a foreign land for me.  So I was a bit afraid of how  I would feel about this book, which looked to me to be leaning towards a  mingling of feminine outlook with what I had come to appreciate most about  Watson's writing, and I feared that it would dilute my awe for his  work. This book was amazing. Paul spends a lifetime with an obsession  with Laura, and like all obsessions, finds it rooted in complete mystery  over who she really is, and what it is about her that so captivates him.   Watson never let me down, he remained steadfast to the view of the world  seen through eyes of men, which remains for me as enigmatic as Laura does  for Paul. He gives me a glimpse into a world I've never lived, that of a  boy who grows into a man, and anchors it with touches of a world I know  firsthand and yet still evades complete understanding, that shadow world of  relationships between men and women.    The relationship between Paul and  Laura haunts both of them throughout their lives.  Like most people, I too  have had relationships that I will ponder over during late sleepless  nights.  I think Larry Watson did a remarkable job in capturing the  combination of anticipation and memory that keeps us awake because of our  own obsessions.
