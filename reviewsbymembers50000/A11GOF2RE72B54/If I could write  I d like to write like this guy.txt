 What I've always liked best about Richard Russo's characters is that they are spectators.  Watching and noting the things that happen to them as if they are helpless to change.  And then they find some small thing the absolute last tolerable occurrence, and begin to affect a change. One of my friends dislikes Russo's characters, because, as he put it, "they never do anything!"  But they do, it's just that they are wainting to choose just the right thing to do. I loved Empire Falls because of Miles Roby. Another good guy who is getting stepped all over (like most of the people I know) and who manages to not be such a simpleton that he doesn't notice.  I could identify with the various crosses he has to bear - Walt the jerk who is engaged to his ex-wife, the bully Jimmy and the worry about Jimmy's son who wants Miles' daughter Tick.  I love the shallowness of some of the characters, because, well, I know that there are lots of shallow people out there.  They are so desperate that it makes me like them anyway. I work in a small town and there are so many aspects that Russo has captured so well.  I've been so fond of all his books, and this is one I know I will return to (ok, maybe not so often as the 5 or 6 times I've read Straight Man...but then again, who knows?)
