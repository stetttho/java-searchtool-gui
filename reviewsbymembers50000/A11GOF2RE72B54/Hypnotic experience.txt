 Having read Michael Ondaatje's work, I am a bit predisposed to enjoy it, but my anticipation did not prepare me for the luscious experience of listening to this work on tape.  Mr. Ondaatje's voice, soft, lilting and  hypnotic, was a fabulous presentation for his lyrical writing.  I listened  to this work on tape in the car, and had to pull off the side of the road,  so that I could rewind and relisten to several parts.
