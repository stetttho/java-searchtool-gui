 Both the text and the images in this book are priceless -- the photos of the actual sketchbooks of Van Gogh evoke a feeling that right here, inside these small books, is a map of the process of an artistic genius. The end section that shows some of the sketches next to finished works is a great illustration of that exact process.    The essays and description of the reconstruction of these sketchbooks was both interesting and scholarly.  Good reference for art historians and artists alike.
