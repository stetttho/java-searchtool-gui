 I went to see a performance of "Stomp" - and I sat there with this silly grin on my face throughout the whole exciting, creative and heart thumping event.   It's the same silly grin I had on my face while  reading this novel - and for the same reasons.  I love the way this man  writes - he makes me fall in love with language and ideas all over again.   I am rolling in the language the way a dog rolls in a particularly pungent  patch in the woods - and I am loving every redolent moment. I suppose  those who feel that Mr. Robbins' work contains unbelievable plots twists  are looking for something a little too linear in this surreal world - but  as for me, the whole process of living itself is pretty darn non-linear and  full of unbelieveable plot twists.   I am particularly fond of the  diatrabes on religion and advertising.  I love the thoughts regarding Mary  and the possible reason why she never mentions Jesus .....   "Jitterbug Perfume" caused me to shift into a permanent  suspension of disbelief, and I was thrilled to get this booster shot.
