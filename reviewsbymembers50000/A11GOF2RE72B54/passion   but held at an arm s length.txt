 I decided to read this book after seeing the movie "Adaptation."  I have to confess that this wouldn't have been a book I'd pick up normally - I'm a ficition junkie, and non-fiction usually gets so ... well, dry.  But the movie got me excited about the passionate quest, and this book certainly explored that.  While there are no doubt many people who are disappointed with the way the film adapted the book - I find that it captured some of the essence of the novel. Susan Orlean certainly lives vicariously through her subject John Laroche - and his ever changing quest to collect all of something.  I loved the historical portions with the explorers and those who travel in search of orchids.  Who'd have thought orchids - what I'd always thought of as old lady's flowers - could inspire such passion?   I thought this was a fascinating tale - and to validate my feelings, I'd have to point out that my significant other (a man dedicated to Stephen King and cowboy novels) picked it up and battled me for it every night.  Can't think of a better recommendation than that.
