 Michael Ondaatje opens up his wonderfully personal vision of his life, love and relationships with this collection of poems.  I am a high school art teacher, and I often use this book for my students to draw inspiration from:  they find it accessible and friendly.  There are many fabulously simple and humorous poems, like "Application for a Driving License" and "Elimination Dance" that are a great springboard for students to come up with their own friendly imagery. In addition, Ondaatje touches on more serious and heartfelt experiences. My personal favorite is "The Time Around Scars" which takes a simple idea and brings it home in a touchingly personal way.  I find that this book is one I reach for over and over again, and it has become a classic in our small Indiana classroom.
