 This is a beautifully illustrated collection of Pablo Neruda's Odes to Common Things.  As a high school art teacher, this is one of the books I use to teach illustration, both by using the book's illustrations as a good example, and through the poetry, to have students see the variety of imagery available even in things they see every day.  In particular, Ode to a Cat and Ode to Scissors are both playful and haunting.
