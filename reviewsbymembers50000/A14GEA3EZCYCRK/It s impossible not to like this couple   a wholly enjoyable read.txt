 This is the second in the Bridgerton series, and it is even better than the first.  Anthony, Viscount Bridgerton, has decided that it's time to marry and has set his sights on Edwina Sheffield, the "incomparable" of the season.  Edwina is lovely and intelligent, but Anthony does not feel any "sparks" between them, which is exactly as he wants it.  Anthony does not want a love match because he secretly fears that that he will die young like his father and uncle, and knows that it will be harder to face death if he is in love.  Edwina's sharp-tongued older sister Kate does not like the rakish Anthony (nor does he like her) and considers him an undesirable match for her beloved sister.  Kate does her best to discourage, offend and annoy Anthony, but in doing so winds up spending a great deal of time in his company.  To the dismay of both, there are some very powerful "sparks" between them, perhaps even love.  Kate is very funny and endearing as the "headstrong" heroine - she never crosses the line into annoying - who is a little insecure and doesn't recognize her own charms.  Anthony is completely adorable as Kate's perplexed and reluctant admirer. He tries to convince himself that he does not and will not love Kate, but of course he is already in over his head. I wholly enjoyed the exchanges between this most engaging of couples, and I look forward to the next books in the series.
