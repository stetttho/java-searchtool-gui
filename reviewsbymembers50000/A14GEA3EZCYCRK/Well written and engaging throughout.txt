 This second book in the "Royal Brotherhood" series is fast paced and kept my interest throughout.  It is the story of Marcus North, Viscount Draker, known as the Dragon Viscount for his allegedly hot temper and wild bearded appearance.  Although claimed as his son and legal heir by the late viscount, Marcus' real father is the Prince of Wales (Prinny), who had a long-time affair with Marcus' mother.  Marcus' was embarassed by the affair and the fact that his paternity was so commonly suspected.  When he inherited the viscountcy nine years before, Marcus evicted his mother and Prinny from the estate, leading to his complete falling out with Prinny.  Since then, Marcus has been treated as a social outcast.  He in turn is angry with the world and shuns society, preferring instead to rusticate and read on his country estate.         Marcus' life of seclusion is abruptly altered when his younger sister Louisa, who is in London for the season, begins to be courted by Simon Tremaine, Duke of Foxmoor.  Marcus is livid and refuses to allow the courtship because Simon is a confidante of the despised Prinny.  Simon's sister Regina, who is a close friend of Louisa's and supports the match, ventures out to Marcus' estate and convinces him to let the couple court for a one month trial period.  In return, Marcus gets Regina to court him for the same month so that she can help ease his re-entry into London society while he keeps an eye on Louisa.  Regina is beautiful and much-sought-after and, at the age of twenty-four, has turned down many marriage proposals.  Marcus, who has a large facial scar of which he is self-conscious, does not expect acceptance by either polite society or by Regina.  He therefore behaves and dresses like the beast people believe him to be.  Regina sees through him, however, and finds him more attractive than she lets on.  She is afraid, however, to become too close to him or to any man, lest they discover her shameful secret - she unable to read.  How Marcus and Regina grow to trust one another and deal with their personal demons is at the heart of this story.   I very much enjoyed Marcus and Regina.  They are a fun couple and are a perfect match for one another.  Both are intelligent, passionate and refreshingly forthright, which is a potent combination.  Their exchanges always are entertaining, and there is a clear affection and admiration between them, even if Marcus resists admitting it.  For a non-reader, Regina wisely knows not judge a book - in this case Marcus - by its cover.  For an avid reader, Marcus is a little dense in this regard, but eventually redeems himself quite nicely.  Regina's handicap (dyslexia) and the misunderstandings it creates add force to the story, setting up many of the best scenes in the book.  The story is immensely likeable and I look forward to reading the next installment.
