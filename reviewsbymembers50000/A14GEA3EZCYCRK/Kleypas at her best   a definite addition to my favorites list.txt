 This book is Kleypas in top form, which doesn't get any better.  Marcus, the aloof and intriguing Earl of Westcliff, who has appeared in numerous prior books by this author, finally gets his own love story.  His object of interest is the seemingly incompatible Lillian Bowman, an opinionated, spirited, and strong-willed American heiress who is not too fond of the self-important Earl.  Marcus believes she would make a most unsuitable countess for him, and yet he cannot leave her alone.  There are definitely shades of Pride and Prejudice here.  Lillian is of course Marcus' perfect complement and the scenes between them are sensual and passionate and fun. This is one of those books where the story, the dialogue and, most importantly, the romance are such a joy to read that I know I will want to read it again.  It is better than Secrets of a Summer's Night, the first book in the "Wallflower" quartet, and is comparable to some of Kleypas' best works such as Then Came You and Worth Any Price.  I also enjoyed that the book included some of my favorite characters from earlier books, particularly Annabelle and Simon Hunt, and Marcus' sister Livia.  I cannot wait to read about St. Vincent and Evie in Devil in Winter.
