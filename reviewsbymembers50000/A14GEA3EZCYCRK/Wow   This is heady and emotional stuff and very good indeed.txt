 I stayed up until 3 in the morning with tissues in hand, unable to sleep until all was settled in Carlyle land.  I am a huge Liz Carlyle fan and books like this are the reason why.  This is the story of the Earl of Wynwood (Quin) and Italian opera singer Viviana Alessandri and their life-altering but badly ended love affair, which is revisited ten years later.   Viviana returns to England from Italy as a widow with three children and a lot of hidden baggage.  Quin, after ten years of a dissolute life, has recently become engaged to a woman whom he likes but does not love for the sake of begetting an heir.  How Quin and Viviana's story progresses and is resolved is compelling and passionate and extremely moving, with the high calibre of writing which one always gets from this author.  Her dialogue is genuine and her storytelling engrossing.  One immediately feels invested in the outcome, not only for Quin and Viviana, but for the wonderful cast of supporting characters as well.  This book is a definite keeper for me and I will be recommending it to my friends.
