 The sparks fly from the outset in this early offering from Liz Carlyle. Widowed Captain Cole Amherst is a scholar, a former curate and an ex-soldier (what a combo!) who comes to tutor the widowed Lady Jonet Mercer's two boys. He's tightly wound and she's wound up, and there's a bit of a class difference, but they have clearly met their match. Ultimately, Jonet is the wiser of the two.  She realizes she must take the bull by the horns, so to speak, and move things along with the reluctant Cole.  The resulting love scenes are very touching and funny, but a little less erotic and more hard-edged than in her later books.  There's also some danger and a murder mystery thrown in, but mostly this is the story of two deserving people offered a second chance at love.  Nicely done!
