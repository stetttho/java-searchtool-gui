 There is never a dull moment in this fast-paced tale about a rather conventional nobleman who is thrown headfirst into life - and love - by the adorable fraud posing as his wife. Alex Denford, Baron Sedgewick, is a wealthy man but has a reputation for leading a rather dull and economical life.  The only provocative thing Alex has ever done is to pretend for the past five years that he has a wife, when in fact he does not.  Alex is able to pull off the ruse by pretending that his wife, Emmaline, is sickly and must live in seclusion.  One fateful day, Alex returns from an extended trip to discover that Emmaline has suddenly materialized and is ensconced in his London townhouse.  His professed "wife" is gorgeous, effervescent and the picture of health, and she has taken his world by storm.  She has redecorated his dull and stuffy house into an inviting home, has made best friends with the neighbors, and is loved by all his servants.  Emmaline privately admits to Alex that she is a fake, but she will not tell him who hired her, and pleads with him to let her stay as his wife for another two weeks.  Although his first thought is to evict her, Alex realizes that Emmaline's sudden disappearance will raise too many questions now that she has so publicly been seen about town.  Besides, he is undeniably attracted to her and more than a little curious.  So he agrees to two more weeks, knowing full well that his life will never be the same.   This is my first book by this author and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Emmaline is a lively and fun heroine, but one that definitely retains her femininity.  Alex is very endearing as the reluctant "husband" who soon can't do without his wife.  In fact, his and Emmaline's growing enthusiasm for each other is the best part of the story, although the servants' intrigues and machinations run a close second.  This story is a delight to read.
