 Dickens would be proud of this captivating story with its twists and turns and family secrets, and a hero and heroine who must come to terms with their troubled pasts before they can be truly happy.  Lydia Grenville, raised in poverty, lost her mother and sister as a child and was then abandoned by her wastrel father. She is now a crusading journalist for a popular London publication, and doesn't think very highly of men. Vere Mallory, Duke of Ainswood has his own turbulent history.  His parents died when he was nine, and he is the last of his direct line, whose male heirs have all succumbed to untimely deaths.  Since the death eighteen months ago of the previous Duke, his boy cousin, Vere has essentially been in a state of depression and denial.  He has led a life of dissipation, shirking his responsibilities to his title and to his young female cousins who are his wards. He does not think very highly of women.  The meeting of the two opposing forces of Vere and Lydia is a wonder to behold.  At times highly humorous, at times deeply moving, the dialogue is always engaging in the way the inimitable Ms. Chase does so well.  Vere's oft-muttered epithets for Lydia are hilarious, and yet there are also times of amazing tenderness. This book has a fine cast of supporting characters, particularly the continuing character of Bertie Trent, who finally gets to prove his worth.  The Last Hellion is a very satisfying romance and is highly recommended.
