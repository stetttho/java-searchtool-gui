 Her closest friend has unexpectedly married, and 28-year-old Eloise Bridgerton suddenly feels lost and alone.  Impulsively, she decides to accept an invitation to visit from Sir Phillip Crane, such visit to be a precursor to marriage, assuming they suit.  Phillip is the widowed husband of a distant cousin of Eloise.  Eloise has been secretly corresponding with him since his wife died, but they have never met.   It started out at first as a simple letter of condolence, but it has grown over the past year into quite an intimate correspondence.  Eloise leaves a cryptic note for her family saying not to worry, but not revealing her destination, and travels to Phillip's estate.  She takes him by surprise (having not sent a written reply to his proposal) so there is no chaperone present.  However, there are Phillip's twin son and daughter whom he has neglected to mention in any of his letters!  She is a little taken aback by the children and by Phillip's somewhat awkward and quiet demeanor, but decides to stay anyway and give it a try.  Phillip, whose first wife suffered from severe depression and kept mostly to her room, wants simply to find someone who will be happy and care for his children.  He is not prepared for the beguiling Eloise with her own needs, desires and opinions.  This story is moving and witty and wise and romantic as Eloise and Phillip - two very different people - learn to adjust to and communicate with one another.  The interaction between Eloise and Phillip, and how each one interprets it, is priceless.  Eloise needs to talk out every problem; Phillip is blissfully clueless and doesn't even realize when there is a problem.  Phillip's character is utterly delightful.  His "awakening" is sweet and funny and is the true highlight of the story.  This is another well-executed and satisfying story in the Bridgerton series, and is highly recommended.
