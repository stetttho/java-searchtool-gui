 This book is not as good as Lord of Scoundrels or Mr. Impossible, but it is still a good read.  Both leads are very likeable.  Alastair Carsington is sympathetic as a troubled Waterloo veteran.  He is trying to regain his confidence by helping a friend to pursuade a small town to let a canal run through it. It will connect to the friend's mine in which Alastair has invested all of his remaining funds.  Mirabel Oldridge is the daughter of the largest and most influential property owner in the area and she has a troubled past of her own.   She is vehemently against the building of the canal and the unwanted changes it would bring.  Mirabel is refreshingly direct and Alastair is amazingly sweet as they fall in love despite their opposing positions on the canal project.  The book is a little slow in the middle, and there is too much discussion of the project.  However, the ending is quite good and so is the humor.
