 The first half of this book is a little tedious and worth about 3 stars, but it really takes off in the second half and becomes a strong 4.   Daphne Bridgerton is in her second season but has yet to find an acceptable suitor.  She believes that it is because men view her as "just one of the guys" - sister of the handsome Bridgerton brothers - and not as an object of romantic love. It is also possible that her overbearing brothers are scaring off potential beaus. Simon Basset, the new Duke of Hastings and an old friend of Daphne's brother Anthony, has just arrived back from the continent and is the focus of intense interest by potential brides and their mothers. Daphne and Simon become fast friends, but he makes it clear that he does not ever want a wife.  They decide to pretend an attachment to one another in order to get Daphne's mother off her back about marrying and to make Daphne more desirable to other men because she has attracted a Duke.  It will also get the "matchmaking mommas" to leave Simon alone.  Of course, the pretend attachment starts to become quite real and the inevitable complications develop.   Both Daphne and Simon are extremely appealing.  Simon's childhood as a profound stutterer who is wholly rejected by his father, is heartbreaking, and Daphne's efforts to help him come to terms with it are quite moving.  I think the first half of the story would have been better if we knew more about Daphne and what makes her tick, but she is redeemed nicely in the second half. I can see why this series has become so popular, because the Bridgerton family, of which Daphne is the oldest daughter, is truly loveable.
