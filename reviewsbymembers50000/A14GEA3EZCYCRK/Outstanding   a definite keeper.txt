 This book drew me in from the start, and it never let go.  Sebastian, Marquess of Dain, is the product of a painfully loveless childhood.  His drive and intelligence have brought him financial success, but he leads an essentially empty and degenerate life and is ruthless in his dealings with others.  He is full of self-loathing, and is inwardly ashamed of his dark Italian looks and large nose, which set him apart from his peers.  His life changes dramatically when he meets the clever and beautiful Jessica Trent.  She has come to Paris to rescue her simpleton brother from Dain's clutches before he can gamble away the last of her family's money.  The attraction is immediate and palpable and wonderfully written as the two worthy opponents face off in a series of highly enjoyable encounters.  The scenes between Dain and Jess are priceless.   I can see why this book is on so many people's "favorites" list (and now mine, too.)   It is funny, warm and sexy, with a serious undercurrent that adds to the romance.  Dain is a very compelling figure who, despite his arrogance, bores his way into your heart.  Jess is a treasure of a heroine, at once both pragmatic and impassioned.  Lord of Scoundrels is an immensely satisfying read and one that I know I will read again.
