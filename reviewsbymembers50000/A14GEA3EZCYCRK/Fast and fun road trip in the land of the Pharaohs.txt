 This is the first Loretta Chase book I have read and it will not be the last.  This fast-paced and humorous tale of British black sheep helping a beautiful widow to rescue her abducted brother in Egypt is enjoyable throughout.  Daphne Pembroke is the bookish young widow of a much older man who suppressed Daphne's spirit and made her feel ashamed of her strong passions and superior intellect.  Rupert Carsington, the fourth son of the Earl of Hargate, has been sent to Egypt by his father in order that he might make something of himself.  Up until now, Rupert has been a bit irresponsible and has a habit of getting himself into trouble.  Daphne is initially reluctant to engage the handsome and virile Rupert in her quest, because she mistakenly views him as dim-witted.  This is a notion that Rupert encourages for a while, because it feeds his warped sense of humor.  As their adventure progresses with an exciting and dangerous boat trip along the Nile, Daphne discovers that Rupert is much more than a pretty face.  She is steadily is drawn in by his courage, tenderness and easy charm, and the fact that he is not intimidated by her intelligence. In fact, Rupert seems to bring out the very best in Daphne.  This book is a pleasure to read.  Although bad guys and murder abound, it is done almost tongue and cheek, and never detracts from the romance.  Ms. Chase's sly humor is delightful, and Daphne and Rupert's (frequently lustful) thoughts about each other are laugh-out-loud funny.  "Mr. Impossible" is not a typical historical romance, which is just fine by me.  I liked it immensely and found it a very satisfying read.
