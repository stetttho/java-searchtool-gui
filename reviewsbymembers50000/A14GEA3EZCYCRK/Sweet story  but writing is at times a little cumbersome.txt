 I had a little trouble with this author's writing style, but I enjoyed the basic storyline and liked all of the main characters.  The story's hero is Sebastian Reyne, a self-made man who has to fend for himself after being orphaned at the age of fourteen.  Destitute, young Sebastian must work long hours at a local factory. He pays for his two young sisters to be watched by a neighbor, who then disappears with them. Ten years pass before Sebastian, now a wealthy manufacturer, finally locates his sisters and rescues them from a London orphanage. The sisters - now twelve and fourteen - have extreme difficulty adjusting to Sebastian and their new life, so he decides to look for a wife who can act as a mother to them. He sets his sights on Lady Elenore Whitelaw.  She is a self-disciplined and serious-minded spinster who overseas a home for girls and Sebastian feels that she will therefore be ideally suited to handle his sisters.  While at society dance in order to pursue Lady Elenore, he meets the lovely debutante Hope Merridew.  Sebastian is instantly smitten (as is she), but he rigidly resists Hope because he mistakenly believes that she does not have the background or disposition to make a strong mother for his troublesome sisters.  However, circumstances continuously throw together Sebastian and Hope, and he is forced to reevaluate his preconceived notions about her. 	 I felt Ms. Gracie's prose did not always flow smoothly and the love scenes were sometimes awkwardly worded.  That said, Sebastian is an admirable hero with a compelling background and I found his sisters' tale quite absorbing.  Also, the author injects some nice humor into the story through Sebastian's friend Giles Bemerton.  In fact, the secondary romance between carefree Giles and the tightly wound Lady Elinore, is the highlight of the novel.
