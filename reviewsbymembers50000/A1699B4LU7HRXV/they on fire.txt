 you would not believe how psyched i am about cash money doin so well in their careers and if u listen to dis cd you'd understand why they're so big. i didn't expect dis cd to be dat good when i bought it cuz cash money drops a new track about every 5 seconds and i always thought they wouldn't all be quality tracks if they make cd's so fast . . . but i was wrong. mannie fresh has got to have some super-human talent cuz these beats he drops are phat. EVERY SINGLE ONE of 'em. we on fire is my favorite song on dis cd mostly fer the phat chorus and lyrics, and the way each one of 'em rhymes wit so much precision. respect my mind is a pretty phat song . . . help is pretty tyte cuz bg does a tyte job wit dis. get out tha way is one of the way better songs on dis cd wit some tyte rhymes and a phat chorus. i feel is also one of the tyter song on dis cd because i think it's hellsa tyte how all of dem rotayte in rhymin and mayke 'em all come together in one tyte song. boys at war definitely has one of the tytest beats on dis cd and tytest rappn from my favorite cmr millionaire, juvenile. you dig by juvenile is pretty phat cuz of juvenile's tyte style. i need a hot grrl has the phattest, phattest beat out of all of dem and the tytest lyrics and chorus. the rest of the songs are pretty tyte but there are too many great songs on here to list. but please buy dis cd . . . it's hot.
