 before i say n/e thing bout dis cd i wanna say to all u peoplez, tripp'n out there about monica and brandy "tryin to copy each other" and "out do each other", dat this so-called "hate" or "rivalry" they supposedly have for one another is all created by you: the fans/haters. just because they both happen to be female r&b artists trying to make it with their music doesn't mean they're rivals. and please peoplez, quit wit the stuff about one tryin to copy the other cause dat's just hatin . . . why be a so negative when you should be posotive . . . poeple will like you a lot more. n/e wayz . . . every single song on this cd is great . . . i suggest litenin to each one. the ones dat stand out the most are: the boy is mine cuz it's a phat song with a kewl concept, street symphony cuz of it's phat beat and original lyrics about hustlin, the first night for the catchy beat and true lyrics, misty blue because it's slow, smooth, and sweet and monica does a great remake, angel of mine cuz of her sweet voice and perfect lyrics, gone be fine because outkast really adds a lot to the lyrics and beat, take him back for the tight chorus and kewl beat, and every other song on here too. buy this cd cuz monica is orignal and very talented.
