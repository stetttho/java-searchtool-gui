 jay-z isn't one of my most favorite artists but he is very good and dis cd is pretty good too. not all songs on here are all really dat good, but there are many on here dat are beyond phatness. the best ones on dis cd are: things dat u do (featuring mariah carey) because between jay's tight rhymes and mariah's tight chorus dis song is phat, snoopy track (featuring juvenile) mostly cuz juvenile's hellsa tight and the phat beat, s carter is a kewl song wit a crazy beat and phat lyrics which reminds me more of a rugrats song, pop 4 roc has a pretty phat beat, big pimpin obviously is a phat song for the tight rhymes and beat, nymp offers a new (and good) flavor to dis cd . . .but my 2 most favorite on dis cd are the last 2 bonus tracks: jigga my n for the phat, phat beat and tight rhymes and grrl's best friend also for the phat beat and tight chorus. dis cd is pretty good but what i also look for in a good rap/hip hop cd is a variety of phat beats in every song and not all beats on dis cd sound dat great. most but not all . . .
