 this is the kinda song that could ruin my hip hop/rap/r&b reputation. but i can't help but love this song!  this has to be a good song seeing as how no doubt is the only non-hip hop cd in my collection. this is one of  those love and heartbreak songs that you would hear on the radio. but then  again it isn't typical at all. i think that the main reason this song is so  well-liked is because songs that speak from truth and experience touch the  heart more than just a typical attempt at a love song. the rest of the  songs on this single are great too and i am seriously considering buyin the  whole cd.
