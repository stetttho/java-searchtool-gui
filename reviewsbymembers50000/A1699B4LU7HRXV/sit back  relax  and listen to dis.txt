 if you're lookin for a kewl kick-back cd with a lotta meaning and variety . . . then buy dis cd. most tracks are slow and smooth and then there are a couple dat are more fast-paced, but all-around good. anytime is what first started me out as a brian mcknight fan, and still to dis day my favorite brian mcknight song. you should be mine (featuring mase) is a pretty good song wit a kewl beat and creative lyrics. show me the way back to your heart is one of the better slow songs on dis album. everytime we say goodbye is a slow, but fast kinda song i guess wit a weird yet phat beat. hold me is is very mellow and smooth. the only one for me (one of the released singles of dis album) is one of the best slow songs on this cd mostly for the lyrics. and so on and so on . . . every other song is very good to and just a great cd to just kick back to . . . pure r&b. get dis cd . . .
