 i dunno where to start cuz dis song is great. by far, dis is my favorite  single from mya . . . it has a lotta fast beat thumpin in it which makes  for a great time at a party . . . the lyrics are orginal and great . . .  and mya looks hot in the video. dis song is just too good to be left alone.  if you like dis song then you'll like the whole cd "Fear of  Flying" which i also highly reccomend. if you're not sure of what song  dis is you've probably heard it, " . . .what you gon' do when u can't  say no and her feelings start to show boy i really need to knoe and how u  gon' act how u gon' handle dat what u gon' do when she wants u back. .  ." if u don't get da album at least get dis cuz it's a phat song . . .
