 now this cd just plain seems like there was no effort put into it. no, no, no was a great song for about the 3 weeks when it was on the top but now it's just er . . . is'nt that great n/e more. although i do hafta say that  number 3 and number 10 are both 75% good each but there is  still something  missing. so some songs make up for the lack of quality, all i'm sayin is if  you're gonna buy it, don't pay n/e thing over $3.
