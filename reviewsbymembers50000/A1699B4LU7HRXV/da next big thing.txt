 very rarely does an artist do so well on their debut album but if u listen  to dis album you'll understand why. every song is great and i didn't hafta  skip thru any tracks which is ALWAYS a plus. the best ones on dis cd though  are country grammar, EI, for my, and greed hate envy. he shows much  potential for bein da next dmx but he has his own style so it's kewl to see  sumthin new. man i brought dis to a party and by da end of da night it was  all worn out . . . n/e wayz what i'm gettin at is dat dis is hot so order  it now.
