 i dunno where to start cuz dis album is one of the best i've ever heard. what makes this album so great are the sounds, the true-to-life lyrics and  gwen's amazing voice. every single song is worth being a single on the  radio and dat's what i look for in an album. this cd made me a  newly-discovered no doubt fan and it should make you one too. my favorite  songs on dis cd are "new" for the upbeat alternative pop sound,  "too late" which i predict may be their next single (or worthy of  being their next single), and "home now" because the chorus is  slammin . . . this cd also comes with a bonus track. just wait until 5:36  has passed on track number 14 and the instrumental version of too late will  play. BUY DIS CD!
