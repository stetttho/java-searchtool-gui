 dis cd is actually a lot better than i thought it'd be. i bought it knowing dat what's so different was a great song and thinkin dat the rest of the cd would be garbage . . . but i was wrong, it's actually pretty good. it's not one of the best cd's i have, being played at least 3 times a week, but it is very good and i play it maybe 2 or 3 times a month. obvioulsy his 5 singles released from this album (what's so different, so anxious, none of ur friends business, final warning w/ aaliyah, and same ol' g) are all good songs but there are some on here dat i wonder why weren't released as singles. my favorite on dis cd is i know because it's got an extremely catchy chorus and weird yet kewl sounds and beats. no. 1 fan also should've been realeased cuz dis is also a tight song. i'm crying out too is single-werthy for it's slow and kewl lyrics. all nite all day is a kewl song to just put on repeat and lay back. toe 2 toe is one of the faster and tougher songs on the cd and my second favorite. she's out of my life is a nice ending to dis great cd. one thing though, i suggest skipping the first two boring tracks (interludes) and most of the other little intro's and interludes found scattered in dis cd. but bottom line: dis cd is kewl. buy it . . .
