 dis is a hot single dat is an essential to any r&b/pop collection. i  do is an extremely catchy motown style swingin song dat will infiltrate  your made from da first time you hear it. it does sound very old fashioned  r&b but still wit blaque's own style they make it sound up to date too.  if you like bring it all to me you will love "i do" because every  song dat blaque puts out is a quality track. also, the i do remix wit left  eye  sounds very good because left eye is very talented too and she adds to  da song wit her geat rhymes . . . da trackmasters precision mix reminds me  a lot of "roll with me" off of blaque's self-titled debut album  (which i also reccomend) BOTOM LINE: blaque is great and they out do  thereselves every single time they come out with a song . . .
