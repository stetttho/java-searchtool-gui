 you would be surprised how good this cd actually is. at first when i got dis cd a couple of years ago, i only listened to all of the single tracks and skipped through the rest. but now dat mya has her sophomore album out and my love for mya has grown even bigger, i actually sarted to listen to dis cd more . . . and it's great. obviously the 3 singles she released ( movin on, it's all about me, and my first night with you ) are great songs . . . no question about dat . . . but as i listened to the cd, i realized dat mostly all of the rest of these tracks are also werthy 'nuff to be singles. what cha say is a kewl song wit a an upbeat tempo and party-type lyrics. keep on lovin me has an extremely clever chorus and the same phat beat dat's in "all about the benjamins." if you died i wouldn't cry cuase u never loved me n/e way is a pretty good song but kinda harsh (and also very fun to have people guess the letters in the name of the song when u play hangman) we're gonna make you dance pretty much makes you wanna dance. bye bye is a sick (in a good way) song wit tight lyrics and phat rap from missy elliot. anytime you want me is definitely one of the better songs on the cd and EXTREMELY catchy. don't be afraid is just a kewl song to sit back to and just chill wit your grrl/man. to make a VERY LONG story short, dis cd is hot and you gotsta pick it up . . .
