 Where to start!  I liked the original version of "Bring it all to me" but unfortunately NSYNC singing about "thug appeal" just wasnt happening for me. However, this single with only Blaque is great.  They can sing about feeling thug appeal and actually pull it off!  Not only  that, but they sound great at the same time and you sure can't beat a great  song. Even greater news is the fact that this CD comes along with two GREAT  remixes. Now if you're a fan of Hip-hop and R&B grooves, then this is  the song for you. The remix of "Bring it all to me" featuring 50  cent offers Blaque's angelic voices, along with a jumpin rap from 50 cent.  Also, the triple threat remix offers a lot more to hard core hip hop fans  with some pretty tight rhymes. What more can i say!  Blaque is hot and  this CD is well worth the money!
