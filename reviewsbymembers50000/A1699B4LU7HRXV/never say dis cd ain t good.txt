 first, i'm a say what i said when i reviewed the monica cd ( but try to make it shorter): all the peoplez out there who are trip'n about monica and brandy being so-called "rivals" wit each other need to stop dat and realize dat they're not tryin to copy each other and dat dis whole "rivalry" is created by all the media/haters. n/e wayz . . . back to the cd. dis cd is full of phat tracks. first off the boy is mine: quite possibly the biggest hit of the summer a few years ago. good song, in moderation. angel in disguise, which should've done better than it actually did on the radio, has to be one of the kewlest tracks on her cuz of it's slow, mellow, yet fast and phat beat. almost doesn't count is my favorite song on dis album cuz of her beautiful voice and lyrics & (like angel in disguise) should've got more air time than it actually did. u don't knoe me (like u used to) is a phat song wit quite possibly one of the kelwest beats on most of my cd's. never say never isa kewl song too cuz of her voice. and those are all the ones dat seem to stick out in my mind, but the rest of the songs are all good too. dis was werth the money . . .
