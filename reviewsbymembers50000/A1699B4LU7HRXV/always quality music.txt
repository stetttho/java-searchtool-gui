 i saw dis cd on sale before i even heard the new song back at one, and i bought it n/e wayz because i knew dat brian mcknight always makes good music . . . and i was right, dis cd is very good and brian mcknight lives up to and beyond the expectations. most of these songs are nice & slow songs dat are good to sit back to but there are a couple of faster ones like: played yourself, you could be the one, and can you read my mind. my personal favorites are: last dance for the kicked-back sound, back at one because you've most likely heard how great it is, 6,8,12 for the great lyrics, you could be the one because it's a fast-paced slow song, can you read my mind for the tight beat and clever chorus, and cherish for the true lyrics. also, the gothic interlude, though weird, is really kewl and offers more variety. if you like nice & slow r&b then get dis cd . . .
