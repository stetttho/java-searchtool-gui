 most of the tyme i'm not happy wit how a soundtrack turns out. i usually skip thru every track 'cept the one song dat i actually bought it for. but dis soundtrack is pretty good . . . i can actually listen to about 75% of dis cd (as opposed to only 20% on my other soundtracks . . . ) not all artists on dis soundtrack i lyke but most i do. but then again not all artists dat i do lyke on her did quality tracks for dis cd. doesn't really matter (by janet) is a pretty kewl song mostly for the phat dance beat . . . hey papi (by jay-z) is the second best song on here because the song and video remind me a lot of big pimpin. just friends (by musiq) is the BEST SONG on dis cd because fer a new artist he sure did so well on dis song and if u sample n/e song sample dis one cuz it's great. even if (by methodman) is in a tie wit jay-z fer the second best song on here, because method man never does a song wrong. i am very dissapointed in the lack of quality in dmx's song i'm gonna crawl, because even though dmx is hellsa kewl dis song isn't dat great at all. thinkin bout me (by brian mcknight) is pretty good but it kinda sounds to me lyke all his other songs. surprisingly good artists shorty 101 do an amazingly great job on their song get wit me, and usually i do not like pop-ish songs, but it also sounds sorta r&b mostly because darkchild werked wit dem on dis song. i've never really been a big thong song fan but dis version wit foxy brown does sound a lot better than the one wit only sisqo. you'll like off the wall if you're a fan of both redman and eminem. but i only lyke redman so i usually skip dis track, but i hafta say it does have crazy beat. the rest of the songs don't really appeal to me, but if you're a fan of n/e artists i didn't mention, you'll probably lyke their songs. but dis cd is definitely what a soundtrack should be . . .
