 this is one of those cd's when u know the artist isn't humongous and u wonder why . . . i mean with such a great cd i wondered the same about this one. "never ever" is a well put together song with out your  typical "i'm heart broken" lyrics. it's chorus is extremely  catchy and i'ts lyrics are somewhat frighteningly true. "bootie  call" hmm . . . this one is somewhat naughty fun but none the less a  great song. this is also well put together and just a song to blast at a  party. "under the bridge" has to be one of my most favorite songs  ever. this remake (like the cd) appeals to more of r&b and pop fans.  it's one of those mellow songs that gets the message accross and still  sounds wonderful at the same time. another one of my most favorite songs  has to be "lady marmalade" it's one of the phattest dance songs  ever and this one to is naughty fun . . . (if only you could translate that  french they're speakin . . .) but more than that it's a great song and this  original song is much better than the timbaland remix that appears on the  dr. dolittle soundtrack. i was amazed (me being a hip hop rap and r&b  fan) that i love this cd so much. but one of the hugest reasons is because  the beats, rythms, and phat sounds appeal to me in the same manner that a  dmx song would. a very versatile cd with many great styles.
