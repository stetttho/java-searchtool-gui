 i dunno, it's kinda a tie between him and dmx but q-tip is almost my favorite rapper. this cd is great and every song is a reason to buy this cd. now, i've read the other reviews on this and i figured that it wouldn't  be rated too high . . . but you hafta understand . . .  THIS IS A CD THAT  SOME ONE WHO LOVES HIP HOP (you know beats and rhymes)WOULD LOVE. so if you  aint into hip hop you won't be into this. a big part of the popularity of  vivrant thing and breathe and stop is all in the beat. also part of me  feelin this cd so much has to do with the fact that i think it's kewl when  different artists played on diffrenet stations come together to make a  great song. now i don't like korn but this collaboration is great for a fan  of hip hop or rock. that definitely shows versatility and that is a great  feature that not too many artists have. music can be more than lyrics and  werds and q-tip's great cd shows every aspect of that theory.
