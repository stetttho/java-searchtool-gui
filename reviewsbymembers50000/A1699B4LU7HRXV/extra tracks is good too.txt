 first off this is a very good cd with a lot of catchy songs and lyrics. i highly reccomend this to any fan of r&b songs. the purpose of this review is to let u know bout the extra tracks: -DANCE WITH ME: nice fun beat wit a great chorus and possibly better then some of the songs they included in the american version of "survivor." -PERFECT MAN: you can also catch this one on the "romeo must die" soundtrack. great beat, nice and exteremely catchy chorus and infectious and spacey dance elements. this is basically has the same theme as "apple pie a la mode" but a little more funkier. -MY HEART STILL BEATS: nice ballad and chorus. if u love "emotion" off of "survivor" and, like me, wish that destiny's child would do more to expand their vocal talents, then this song is for you. these three songs are all worthy of being on the american release of "survivor" but for some reason, americans will never have much access to b-sides . . . only get this if u LOVE destiny's child and don't mind paying a little extra for a quality import.
