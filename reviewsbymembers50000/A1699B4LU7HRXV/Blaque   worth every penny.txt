 I am the biggest Blaque fan out there so when I heard this CD was only realeased in Japan, I was very dissapointed. Thankfully, I was able to find it here and buy it. And believe me, it's worth the money. This song is  great and it has an upbeat R&B feel to it. It reminds me a lot of  "Roll with Me" off of Blaque's self-titled, debut album (which i  also reccomend.) And if you like "I do" this CD comes with a  great remix of it. They've changed the beat to a funky jumpin groove, yet  at the same time i'ts slow and smooth. Even better, this version comes with  a snippet of rap from Left Eye of TLC. (and if you've seen the video you've  heard the great rhymes) This CD also comes with another great remix of  "I do." And, if you like the 808 & Bring it all to me  remixes, you'll love this. Even beter, (yes more great news) this CD comes  with an ultra colorful and holographic/shiny booklet with great pictures of  these pretty grrrlz. And if Natina's rap has you confused . . . no need to  worry. This CD als comes with lyrics (in both English and Japanese! ) This  CD is HOT!  and this CD is a great reason why I love Blaque!
