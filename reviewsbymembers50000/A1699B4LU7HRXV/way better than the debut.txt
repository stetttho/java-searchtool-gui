 although i am a little annoyed about new members comin in and out and leaving or quitting, i can't help but admit dat dis is a great cd. there a couple of songs on her that are ok, but all of the other songs' great quality make up for it. bills, bills, bills, quite possibly wasn't as big as their other 3 released singles but a personal favorite of mine. confessions is a pretty kewl song and surprisingly enough the only track where destiny's child admits to doing sumthin wrong to their man(and somehow in the end they still manage to blame it on the guy . . .) bug-a-boo, like every popular song, is a very phat song with kewl lyrics but should be listened to IN MODERATION. temptation is one of my favorite songs on here cuz of dc's beautiful voices and lyrics. now dat she's gone is also one of my favorites cuz of it's catchy chorus and mellow beat. where'd you go is a kewl song, but right up to dis point in the cd you wonder why beyonce is always singin. jumpin, jumpin is a great party/dance song but only every once in a while. say my name, even though they played it out on the radio/tv, is still un-doubtedly a great song all-around . . . IN MODERATION. she can't love you is also one of my very favorites cuz of the tight background beat and clever chorus. but my most favorite on dis cd has to be . . . stay. if you sample or listen to one song on dis cd then listen to dis one, cuz it's the best one on there . . . and dc does a great version of amazing grace and surprisingly i think i hear someone besides beyonce singing a verse in dis one. get dis cd . . .
