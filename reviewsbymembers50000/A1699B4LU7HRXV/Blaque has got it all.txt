 What can I say? Blaque has got it all and their self-titled album is pretty much the same. These grrrlz have great voices that are waiting to be heard. Through soul-inspiring songs like "Don't go looking for  love" and their infectiously catchy song "Bring it all to  me", Blaque proves that they are not just another TLC or SWV.  This CD  definitley gives Blaque their own identity: Blaque! Whether it be through  Natina's ground-breaking lyricist skills shown in "Roll with me"  or Brandi and Shamari's sweet voices portrayed in "When the last  teardrop falls", these grrrlz have got it goin on and this album  proves it. This CD has a wide range of different styles and beats: ranging  from something with a Motown swingin sound like "I do" to the  mellow, kicked back sound of "Mind of a king." This CD only made  me an even more avid Blaque fan I'd give it 10 stars if I could.
