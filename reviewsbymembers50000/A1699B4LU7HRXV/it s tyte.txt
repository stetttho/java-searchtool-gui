 i juss wanted to say that this is a very good cd with great quality songs that explore every aspect of music and was executed very well. each song has it's own, pop, hip hop, dance, soul, or r&b vibe and their voices, style, and lyrics offer a lot of things to people who are so used to the normal. i already reviewed this cd but it was from an import from a different country but i juss wanted to counter what some other person said when they reviewed this. the saints do write the songs on this cd. if u look at the credits it either says s. lewis (shaznay) or m. blatt (melanie). i think it's juss smart to let people knoe what they're buying into because the other review is very misleading. n/e wayz it's a hot cd wit cool beats, creative lyrics, and much versatility. do not hesitate to AT LEAST listen to it.
