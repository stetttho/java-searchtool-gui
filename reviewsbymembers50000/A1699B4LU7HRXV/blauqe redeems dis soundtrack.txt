 lemme tell you dis . . . almost every single song no dis cd is terrible .  . . HOWEVER blaque (once again) did da best on their new track "as  if" featured on dis album and TOTALLY made this album werth buying. if  you've seen the video you would know how great dis song sounds and how  great blaque looks. it reminds me a lot of their more pop-ish songs like  bring it all to me. and if you're a fan of NSYNC (which i am not) there is  another version of "as if" featuring joey fatone of nsync . . .  it's ok but once again the nsync guy sounds majorly wannabe. i'd say just  stick to da track wit out him. they also have a great "bring it all to  me" remix on here featuring 50 cent which is also a GREAT song . . .  and reminds me of da 808 remix. da rest of da songs are majorly annoying  especially "u.g.l.y." which sounds like a bunch of pre-peubescent  squirrels tryin to sing at the same time they're being run over by a truck.  but BLAQUE totally redeems dis album wit there great talent . . . BUY dis  cd. or at least the "as if" single . . .
