 this is the song of of all saints' cd "Saints and sinners" dat goes, "i knoe dat u wanna piece of my . . ." if u live in n/e where but the u.s., it's most likely u've heard of it. it has a good chance of coming out here in america but if the saints are really going to break up (which they seem to be leaning toward) it most likely will stay foreign to american radio. the song is great and reminds me of "bootie call" except with a faster and happier pace.  it's catchy, the video is hilarious, and it's awesome the way the words blend in perfectly with the tune.  it's far from pop cuz, like every all saints song, is laced up with bouncin beats and hip hop influences.  the architecs remix i didn't like too much. i mean, it had a kewl fast and hard dance beat, but i don't consider "taking a song and playing it twice as fast and putting it in with different sounds", a remix. they coulda added some new werds and lyrics or sumthin lyke dat. it's ok but it falls short of great. i havent' heard the k gee version but i am dyin to hear it because outta all the people who remix all saints' stuff, he remixes it the best. he gives the group even more hip hop flavor. u don't hafta buy it, just give it a listen.
