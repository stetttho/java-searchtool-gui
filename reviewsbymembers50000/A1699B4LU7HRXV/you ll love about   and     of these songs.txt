 once again destiny's child has done it again with their extremely catchy hit "say my name." and if you've heard it (which you probably have because it's inpossible to turn on the radio with out hearing it) you  know how great it is. it's a very good song but like every over played song  it can get pretty old - but none the less it's a great song to listen to  (in moderation.)if you do like this song, i would suggest buying the whole  cd instead of the single. the timbaland remix is very good and the main  reason i bought this cd. it's a good song but it just seems like there  could've been more effort put into it. the last minute of the song i like  very much. and this track was recorded by the 2 new members that replaced  letoya and latavia. the original group is on the cd cover though. and the  new girls' vocals do not compare at all to the 2 original girls. but in a  good way, beyonce does most of the singing. tracks 3-5 are not very good  remixes at all. they're typical remixes. when i look for remixes i wanna  think of sumthin that stands out in my mind and doesnt compare to other  remixes. like the 808 remix. but believe me, these songs are no 808 remixes  . . .
