 this cd has to be one of my most favorites ever. mya's voice has really  taken on a more mature voice since her last album (which i also reccomend)  ans sounds like an angel . . . or if you're lookin for a more rough bad  grrl tone, there are many different songs to fullfill that. this cd comes  with much variety: love, cheating, ex grrls, attraction, temptation,  hypocritical friends, power of music, phobias, being left for some one  else, and an all-in-good-fun dawg hating song . . . every single song on  dis cd is werthy of bein a single. if variety is da spice of life then mya  has it all.
