 when i bought dis cd, i bought it mainly for n's dies for me (featuring dmx) and thinkin dat the rest of the cd would be nothing great . . . but it's one of the best rap cd's i have. dis cd also has some of the funniest skits i have ever heard and those are also an important part to an album. every song on dis cd has a variety of tight beats and sounds and each one is different in it's own way. spit these bars is a tight song wit creative lyrics and the phattest beat . . . groundhog's day has a tight beat and a phat chorus from dmx. now the best song on dis cd has to be n's die for me (featurin dmx) mostly cuz of the catchy chorus and beat. snipe out start's out wit phat beats and a phat chorus and is one of the more quieter and calmer songs on dis cd. get it right (featurin dmx) has one of the phattest beats on dis cd and u knoe dat dmx never does a song wrong . . . ladies 2000 is a tight song wit a different and slower beat (sounds like background music to a mario game) and an extremely clever and tight beat. drag ish has a crazy beat dat reminds me (in some weird way) of the ghostbuster's song. pop it also has one of the best beats on dis cd, and has a phat chorus. bottom line about dis cd: every single song on dis cd has a phat variety of beats, tight rhymes on each track, funny skits, and some of the best and catchiest choruses i've ever heard on a rap cd. get dis cd . . .
