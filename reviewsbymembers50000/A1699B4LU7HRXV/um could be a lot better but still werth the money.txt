 i'm a just say it straight up - mostly all of these songs are not very good songs at all . . . they are very typical. somewhat good but very typical. "got to get it" and "thong song" are 2 of the  better songs on the cd. but still, like any other hit song, after the first  month it's annoying to hear a good song go from good to played out. but  these are not the reasons i bought this cd. the "u are everything  remix" is one of the hottest songs and i could listen to it forever.  this one great song was werth buying the cd and earned 5 stars for the rest  of the cd too. it's that good . . .
