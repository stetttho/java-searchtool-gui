 this is the third effort from r&b superstars, destiny's child. there are many stand-out tracks on this cd, and it's apparent why they are so huge right now. if u order this cd from a foreign country, u will get four extra tracks: perfect man, dance with me, survivor remix, and my heart still beats. but it might be costly. the stand out tracks are: -INDEPENDENT WOMEN PART 1: this song is what kept the ladies on the top after the release of "say my name." good beat, catchy chorus, clear lyrics. -SURVIVOR: one of the hottest r&b songs of this year 2k1. extremley catchy chorus and clever lyrics to go along with a great video. -BOOTYLICIOUS: this song sums up destiny's child whole vibe. has the same guitar riff from stevie nick's "edge of seventeen." a tyte chorus that goes ...." and a verse containing "....." smooth and sexy r&b fun. -APPLE PIE A LA MODE: starts out with a surprisingly cool hip hop beat that's sounds like sumthin from methodman. in case yur wondering, this song is about.... great chorus too. -SEXY DADDY: the song could be summed up in this excerpt "...." -INDEPENDENT WOMEN PART 2: ten times bettter than part one! great beat and great hip hop elements added to this. the chorus is ten times catchier and better than the original. the song changes moods alot too, gives it some good variety. -HAPPY FACE: really motivational song ... reminds me of tlc's "unpretty" -EMOTION: a beautiful ballad and cover of the bee gee's disco hit. indescribably beautiful chorus and verses. this track really shines and focuses on destiny's child's vocal abilities. in my opinion, the best track on this cd. -THE STORY OF BEAUTY: this song has a great message..... u can listen to how everyone says that destiny's child isn't talented, or u can pick this up and decide for yurself. i am not the type to just go along and let the majority form MY opinion, so i picked up this album for myself.
