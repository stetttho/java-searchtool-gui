 We have a just-turned-2-year-old daughter from China. This is absolutely her favorite book.  She squeals with delight when Choco finally finds a mommy.  She points to Choco's mother and shouts "Mama!" and then points to me and shouts "Liann's Mama!".   She picked up on the similarities very quickly. She just adores this book.
