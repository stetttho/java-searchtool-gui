 This is a VERY cute game, but EXTREMELY AGGRAVATING. Unless you're six-year-old is a rocket scientist, this is going to frustrate the heck out of him. The game is very linear - you are forced to walk along a path. I can over-look this because of the cute graphics. However, some of the levels are very long and it's very tough to get through them without getting killed dozens of times. Argh!!!
