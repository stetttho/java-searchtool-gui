 We had a 5-point Century Smartmove for my older son, which I had to continually re-tighten in my Dodge Spirit. When I tried to use this again for my 7 month old (19 pounds) in our 2000 Toyota Sienna van, it was useless - could not get a tight fit and the seat would not rotate up to the "crash" position.  We decided to try the Alpha Omega and it has been GREAT in the van (we are presently using it in the rear-facing position, second row bucket seats). Very easy to install and we have a rock-solid fit - doesn't move a hair! You can use one of the foam swimmy noodles by the seat crack if you want to tilt the chair back a little. About the "problem" with the straps being twisty - I have had several car seats of different brands now and ALL of the straps have been twisty. These are no more twisty than any of the others and they are nice and soft so they don't irritate the baby's skin. I don't know that I would recommend this for a small newborn - it's probably fine, but I still feel more comfortable with the infant car seats for them (besides, it's always a shame to wake up a newborn in order to remove them from the car).
