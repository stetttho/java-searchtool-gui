 I am really disappointed with this game (and I loved the other Ratchet & Clank games). This game just moves from one arena battle to the next (in the form of very small planets), so you don't get the adventures you do with the previous games.  There is a cooperative mode where two players can play, but you need a big tv because it's like watching a couple of microbes run around.
