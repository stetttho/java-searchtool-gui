 I was looking forward to replacing my old toaster, which takes too long to produce toast.  I was very disappointed in this toaster. The first thing I tried to toast - a relatively small slice of oval marble rye - was too long to fit in the toaster. Unless you only toast round or square things, like bagels and white bread, you are going to have to cut off the end of the bread.  I'm going to go back to a toaster that has two extra long slots.
