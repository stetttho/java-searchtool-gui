 This new installment in the Doc Ford series is a good one, and it is well worth reading.  Some characteristics of a few of the leading characters are a bit over the top, and that can be a bit much, but in general, the mystery is well developed and moves along nicely. Here, Doc returns to his home-on-stilts to find an old girl friend waiting on him, and she uses his shoulder to cry on, telling about the disappearance of her husband.  And, lo-and-behold, right that minute, she tells him she is being followed by someone who is right then hiding in the mangrove, watching them.  Doc pulls a trick to get out of sight and sneak up on the watcher, and they have a tough run-in that results in a strange friendship, as they both want to help the lady in distress. While trying to locate the missing husband, they run into a strange, power-hungry religious guru, who seems to be putting together a genuine cult, and they begin to suspect the man's disappearance has some connection with his interest in the new religion. Of course, this leads to another strange, unexpected meeting, this time with a small group of Seminole indians who turn out to have a bizarre connection with Doc. There is a lot of action here, with many characters--and we do mean "characters" in this one--and there are plenty of death and natural phenonomon to interest most readers. As a slight criticism, many readers will find almost too much history of Florida and their native Indian tribes here, and while a part of the story, these elements almost take off on their own, diverting our interest from the mystery. But the author knows his subject, and he seemingly can't quite get his mind fully on the mystery he is writing because of his on-going strong interest in the history of his home region. But this is plenty of action for anyone, with romance along for the ride, and this is a genuine interesting addition to the Doc Ford series.
