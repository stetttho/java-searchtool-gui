 The author is at least back on track with his writing,  after a real failure or two, but "Violets are Blue"  is below the standard for Patterson.  Those who have read his previous Cross novels will come away feeling he has knocked this one out a little too quickly, and that maybe he was just following his own formula,  rather than developing new ground. This story is believeable only if you buy into the author's thesis that his hero Alex Cross is the best, brightest and hardest-working detective in the country, and that, furthermore, the criminals he searches for are, likewise, the absolute worst, most intelligent, but demented, criminals in the country. It is a lot to expect readers to accept, but, of course, many do. But, despite being derivative of his own work, this is a decent-paced story that is entertaining and worth a read.
