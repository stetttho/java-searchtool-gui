 Author Burke can paint a picture with words that has few equals. A reader paying attention will easily visualize the beautiful streams and the high peaks of Montana, as well as the plentiful wildlife, and the dark blue endless skies.  Burke uses words like every politician wishes he could, creating feelings and emotions at will, and that is quite a talent. Some of Burke's hero's actions seem more complex than is  necessary, but that doesn't detract from a very readable, moving story. The author's use of a strongly anti-Custer dream sequence was too distracting to be useful, and the feeling persists that Burke used his popular novel to verbalize some personal feelings that have no place in this particular story.  He departs in this sequence from known history, so the distraction also becomes disturbing. But the multitude of characters is interesting, even when some of their actions are a bit muddled together.  Burke creates a mood that is very engaging, and the story moves along in a  very entertaining manner. In addition to a good story, reading this book will also educate the reader about many aspects of Montana, and that is a genuine plus.  Highly recommended.
