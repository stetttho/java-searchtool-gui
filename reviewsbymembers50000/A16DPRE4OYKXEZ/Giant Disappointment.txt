 This is the sort of book that would never have been published if the author wasn't already established.  The premise, about the possibility of a modern virgin birth, is interesting enough to attract attention, but the conclusion veers off into the realm of science fiction, or worse, so this work should not even be considered a "novel" or "mystery" in the normal sense of those words.  The only reason I kept reading this book was my prior experience with this author's writings, and my hope he would start displaying his usual talent in story-telling, but the more I read, the more disappointed I was.  The whole reading experience with this work was a complete waste of time, and I  will have to think twice before I read any more his his coming works.  Don't disappoint yourself with this book.  Read his older works if interested in mysteries, but definitely skip this failure.
