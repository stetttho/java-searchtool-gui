 This nice disc contains so many of the Beatles classic hits, it is a good addition for any fan of their music or the era. But a very big negative is that the label has not provided any, not a word, of liner notes, and it is unbelieveable they couldn't have spent a tiny amount of time and money giving us some insight or comment on this music, especially considering it has been released as a full-priced CD.
