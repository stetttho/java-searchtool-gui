 The surprising thing about this author is that he isn't recognized more widely. His writing is absolutely first-class, and his use of the English language surpasses almost any other writing most us encounter.  In this narrow field of the "psychological thriller," his command of the language, and his fresh use of the metaphor and simile, is unparalleled. A serious reader will have to re-read some of his passages just for the pleasure of how the mental picture developes as the words are flowing. In this outing, his "heros," Ben and Diane, remain at personal odds, and they have a difficult time working together on their rural Derbyshire Constabulary, but a series of crimes brings them together again to work their particular magic on violent felons. A couple of dead bodies are found, apparently unrelated, but investigation leads back to a WWII crash of a British bomber in the rural mountains, and an amazing series of crimes begins to unfold as evidence points to an ever-widening story of crime, deception at multiple levels, and family relationships.  The details presented and analyzed will hold the reader's attention throughout the book. This author also has an unusual insight into how crime victims react to the assaults on them, and some readers will almost shrink from absorbing the details of that process. This story is one that should not be missed by anyone reading in the "crime" or "thriller" field, and we also learn a lot about life in the rural England of today. Rush to grab this one.
