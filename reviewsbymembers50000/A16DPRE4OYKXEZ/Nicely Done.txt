 Author Silva has put together another interesting and complex story, and, again, he relies on the device of an enormous conspiracy among unlikely allies to provide some tension and basis for moving the action along. This conspiracy is not quite believeable, so that contrived device prevents this from being a truly great book The title refers to the Marching Season in N. Ireland, and much of the setting for this story is in that part of Ireland, and the author details much of the history of this unsavory conflict, going back in history to 1609 when William of Orange defeated the Catholics in a deadly battle, and he gives us considerable detail of the action since 1969, when the present "troubles" started. This historical perspective is necessary for the understanding of this story, and the author does a nice job of presenting the complex material and gives us some basis for understanding the continuation of the conflict. He helps us understand the long-running conflicts around the world by mentioning the "trouble spots," and the places mentioned several years ago turn out to be the exact same places that cause trouble for us today. The writer has done considerable research, as well, on the places where the action takes place, and many readers will  be able to feel the locale as he reads.  But despite this considerable research, the author doesn't seem to have talked to any small-arms experts, as his descriptions of the various handguns carried by agents of various groups doesn't ring true. And he misses some of the terminology of such weapons and their uses. But the story moves along, and the characters are rather believeable.
