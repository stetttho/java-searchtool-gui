 This is, indeed, a nice read, as we say, and many people will find it a very pleasant book to browse through.  This is a compendium of pure Andy Rooney, and if a person enjoys hearing his 60 Minutes commentaries, they will enjoy this present book. His stories are short and to the point, and he makes no pretense of them being anything other than his personal opinion on dozens of topics, from WWII to the present, and he is usually funny and accurate. But there is nothing new here, and the book moves along almost too smoothly.  There is very little to catch the imagination. This book is easily put down, and it can be read anytime, anywhere with some satisfaction. It would be a wonderful gift for Rooney fans.
