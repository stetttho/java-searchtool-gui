 This mystery falls short because it just doesn't quite have the ability to engage the reader and make us feel part of the investigation.  The characters seem a little shallow, and they aren't quite fleshed out enough to seem real.  The reader will not quite be able to identify with any of them. The publisher makes much of the fact that this author is a native of NYC, but that is apparent without being reminded. The writing uses a lot of "inside" references that most readers will not fully understand, especially when presenting information relating to streets and businesses. The story's frequent use of incomplete information, that only a NYC native would get, will makes most readers feel like an outsider. The basic story here is that a body is found in the basement of a local store on Coney Island, and the hero, a police captain, happens to be nearby, and he is able to insert himself into the investigation and take it over.  The man killed inside the little store turns out to be a rich real estate developer, and no one can figure why he would be in the basement of a small, uninteresting store in the first place, let alone why anyone would want to kill him. It turns out the guy is cheating on his wife with a young "starlet," so the motives begin to unfold.  His real estate speculations have angered many local residents, and the suspects multiply.  Plus, the captain begins to wonder if there is any connection between the present crime and the FBI shooting of a terrorist suspect nearby a couple weeks earlier. The plot and story are interesting, and this is readable, but many readers will find it difficult to really get into these characters and their story.
