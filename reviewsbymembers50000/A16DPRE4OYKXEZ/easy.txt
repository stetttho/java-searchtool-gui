 Yes, this is an easy-reading book from Muller, so it will appeal to many readers, but her writing about P.I. Sharon McCone has become almost a formula-like exercise. One review has referred to McCone being a "socially conscious" character, but writer Muller pushes that theme so far, it is almost laughable that her heroine makes such a point of including among her friends every conceiveable representative of race, color, sexual orientation, social set and criminal background.  The writer now is more interested in promoting her "socially conscious" views than in writing an engaging mystery. In this outing, McCone gets hired to investigate a suicide, because the parents are pushing some far-out theory about civil liability by a corporation who pushes employees too hard, and she dives into that inquiry full bore.  Murder and mayhem ensue, and McCone manages to help solve a mystery, all while promoting even more personal interrelationships with such a varied cast of "diverse" people, it's difficult for some readers to keep the mystery in mind. Writer Muller spends so much effort pushing this diverse cast of people at us, making each one from a different background, she doesn't give full credit to the concept of a mystery. For good mystery reading, Muller's earlier stuff is much better and more readable and entertaining.
