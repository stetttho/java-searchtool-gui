 Wambaugh is justly considered one of our best fiction writers, and he is a master at the police procedural.  Unhappily, this entry is merely o.k., and the tenseness and plotting are not up to his usual quite high standard. The story is about a fire fighter who turns out to have been setting fires himself, and it concerns the clues that various law-enforcement men and a task force slowly uncover before finally beginning to focus on the Glendale, CA arson investigator. The most interesting part of the story is Wambaugh's explanation of the different mind-set of the two types of people involved: cops and firefighters, and how those differences affect their view of the crime and possible suspects.  Cops and firefighters view the world quite differently, as does the world view them in dissimilar lights. And Wambaugh understands these differences. In addition, he presents a couple of firefighters who have uneasy feelings about the crimes and how the cops are responding to them, and he explores how these two men have to work so hard to try to convince the cops they might be missing something. This is an interesting story, but the tension and drama just are not there.  The crimes took place over a period of many years, and most of them were low-key, and we have to factor in the fact that the defendant/criminal kept insisting, even after he plead guilty to some of them, that he was not really guilty. In addition, the prosecutors never required the guy to explain his motivations or reasoning, and the system never developed a coherent theory of why the defendant behaved as he did, even though he was considered one of the most active serial-arsonists in American history. So the lack of great drama and tension in the story may not be the result of Wambaugh at all; maybe the great, exciting story we expected was just never there at all.
