 The author has another winning book, but don't expect much stimulation from it; it is an easy read, but that is not a bad thing.  The characters and story are interesting, but there isn't much challenge to it, so you can just flow along until the end, and you will have a nice, entertaining time. Unhappily, the author is guilty of having some of his characters be more "politically correct" than would have been the case in '50s Iowa; it seems he is inserting his own sensibilities more often than is reasonable.  At that time, people were both good and bad, as in most times, but they weren't as conscious of some of the distinctions then as now. In those days, newspapers and politicians weren't always beating everyone over the head about how they should think, and yelling at us to be so "inclusive."  Even the most open-minded people then developed their own ideas and morals, with help from  family and close friends, but the media didn't press us with many ideas and names. So the author's characters are nicely done, but their "politically correct" pronouncements are jarring and seem out of place for time and place of the story. But if a nice, easy read is what you need, and all of us do at times, then this should be satisifying.
