 The author has another great entry in his "Doc Ford" series, and this one is hard to put down. He explores a complex set of factors in putting forth this mystery, including his favorite, the environment, as well as the more familiar man-woman emotional relationships, and the continuing US difficulty with illegal drugs.  The interesting story takes us from a warm home on the coast of Florida, to a wreck 50 miles away, and then on to the brutal, harsh country of Columbia. The hero, Ford, meets the usual array of quirky and interesting characters, and we know he is going to have a tough time meeting his objectives. The story, which the author says is based, loosely, on a true story about some missing divers, concerns Ford's search for a good friend who is first thought to be dead in a diving accident, but who Ford later, using some super-secret info from friendly government operatives, concludes has been captured by "white-slavers" and taken into captivity.  Ford will spare no effort, of course, and he encounters dangers almost too numerous to list in his search. And he has help from a couple interesting friends, and they plunge headlong into an adventure most of us will like to share only in book form. The S. Florida boating and fishing scene is not presented better by anyone, and a thoughtful reader will almost be swaying to the breeze rocking a boat as this adventure is absorbed.
