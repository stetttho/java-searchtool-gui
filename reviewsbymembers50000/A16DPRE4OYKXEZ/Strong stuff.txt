 Ann Coulter is one of the people not afraid to tell the truth, and she does it in such a head-on style, any receptive reader will enjoy her political truths, as well as her humor.  This is one of the few stong political books that will also make you laugh out loud. An absolute must read for anyone concerned about the possibility of "truth in politics;" such will never happen of course, but Coulter throws the truth at us like a fastball pitcher on his best day. And when you are laughing out loud at the same time, you have to be having some real fun. The only thing better will be her new book.
