 Buckley does his usual nice job of putting everything together and giving us a cast of characters that are lively and entertaining. At first glance, this seems like it will be a mystery or novel with the Nuremberg trials after WWII the backdrop.  But the author gives us so much background for the war crimes trials, and so much personal detail about some of the defendants and their feelings, it developes into an overview of the war crimes trials, with the story in the background. But the author does such a nice job of mixing the real-life characters with those of the fictional story, it turns into a very entertaining and engaging book.  This would be a first-class place to start for anyone interesting in delving into what happened at the end of WWII, and how the Four Powers turned to this tribunal to handle significant questions about how to treat surviving Nazi leaders. Plus, of course, we can follow a nice story about a German-American family and how their young son, in the US Army, fits into all the international politics of the time. A very engrossing book and one most of us will find it difficult to put down.
