 Yes, when you know this story is centered around the return of Clara Rinker, you have to read it.  And the rewards are great, because Rinker is a multi-dimentional, complex character, and the most interesting villain in a long time. She has appeared before in the "Prey" series and managed to stay ahead of law enforcement at all times, and she has settled in Mexico now, and she has a wonderful love interest, and they are planning on marriage and a family.  Then her lover is gunned down in the town square, literally on top of Clara, and no one locally can figure out who would want the guy dead.  But, then, no one there has any idea of the true identify of Clara Rinker, and she is the only one who knows that is was she, not the guy, who was the target.  She is about out of her mind with fury and grief, and she quickly decides to go after whoever might have been responsible for her loss. She is so dedicated to getting even, she doesn't even worry about which of several possible enemies might have been responsible; she just decides to kill all of them! So she returns to the American mid-west, and events then propel the series hero, Lucas Davenport, a cop in Minneapolis, to start looking for her again. That their paths will cross is certain, and the outcome is not quite forseeable.  Each is the best of what they do, and they are both determined to finish the job they started. And that means more clashes and confrontations. This is a first-class story, with a lot of interest, a fascinating plot, multi-dimentional characters, and this is a difficult book to put down. A lot of pleasure in this one.
