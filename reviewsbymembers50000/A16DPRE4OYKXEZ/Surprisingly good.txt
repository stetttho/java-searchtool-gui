 David Brenner is a well-known comedian of course, but his book goes beyond quick humor.  He also displays a formitable intelligence and the ability to honestly analyze our everyday situations, including our problems with national security, diversity, race relations, language, etc., all while having fun, and he is able to convey in his book both that intelligence and humor. Given his reputation as a quick-witted humorist on TV, and in clubs, his down-to-Earth ability to grasp our most basic concerns is both surprising and enlightening. Brenner does a first-class job of entertaining the reader with this book, while also addressing mundane concerns.  He has a very funny book that nearly everyone will enjoy.
