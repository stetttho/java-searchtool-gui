 You no doubt have heard the theory that if enough monkeys spent time pounding on typewriter keys, they would eventually produce all the written works of Western Civilization.  Maybe, but this book seems like one of the products of such a stunt, and one of the rejects at that. If this author could make a point, or explain something, in 10 words, he always, instead, spends at least 100 words to produce the same result. And, worse yet, there are several instances in this book where several pages can go by without the slightest advance in plot, or development of character.  Seriously, this book consists mainly of a string of words put together that seem to go on and on.  Without any literary result at all. This is the book that should be read only by someone confined, who can't get out to find something decent to read, and is unlucky enough to have no one to come to his reading rescue. Or, better yet, it should be given to people serving time for serious crimes as part of their punishment. This book is a supreme waste of time.  Please avoid it.
