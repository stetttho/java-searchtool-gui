 No, "Weird" is not a term usually associated with a book review, but it's difficult to think of a better one-word description here. This book is so convoluted, and much of it rather illogical, that it is hard to believe the same author has written the complex, detailed and fascinating book, "The Company."  This one must have been some sort of practice run. As we read through it, there are interesting parts, but we keep thinking as we go along that the author will surely bring it all together in a satisfying way.  But he never does.  There is an ending of sorts, but the story never quite comes together.  And many of us will not be wishing there was more, we will, instead, be wishing we had spent our time more profitably. The story, on the surface, is about an ultra-secret project by a handful of CIA operatives working outside even that organization, with the direction and approval of the Attorney General, and the aim of this project is to sow discord in the heart of one of our Muslim enemy countries, while also bringing into disrepute everything that country stands for.  A laudable goal, and a very nice starting point for this type novel. But the author insists on intermixing with that story another, and parallel, story about Nathan Hale during our Revolution against the British Empire.  The Hale story is quite far-fetched, so it detracts rather than adds to the central theme. With the shifts in both era and story, this is not exciting, but rather distracting.  Not a very well-put-together story and ultimately dissatisfying.
