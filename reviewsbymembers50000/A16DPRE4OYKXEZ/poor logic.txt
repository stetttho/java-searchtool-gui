 Once we discover the author has very few facts to back up her assertions and theories, this book has little of interest. Plainly, there is just too much of the author's personal conjecture, and too many broad jumps in logic, for her to make any case at all for knowing the identity of Jack the Ripper. The book reads like a poor attempt to support a conclusion made before research and writing began, and that serious failing really shines through in her writing. For a serious student of those crimes, and that period in history, this is a waste of time.
