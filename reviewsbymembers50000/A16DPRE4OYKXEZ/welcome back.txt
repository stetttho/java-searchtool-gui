 When I first saw the new Robak book by Joe Hensley, in my haste, I thought the title was going to be, "Robak is Back," and I was certainly happy to see it, and I thought that title would be most appropriate. No one can better describe small-town politics, or the atmosphere around a county-seat courthouse than Hensley.  He has lived and worked that life himself, and he has a rare gift for conveying all the feelings and emotions of one immersed in that particular venue.  In his earlier works, which every mystery reader should read, he displays his knowledge more fully, and he develops the background in greater detail, than in this latest Robak adventure. But, "Robak is Back," in this new mystery, and it is a pleasure to read of his latest "case," though he now sits on the Circuit Court bench and shouldn't be doing much investigating.  But he has to be forgiven because he is investigating his own wife's sudden and near-fatal illness, and he is determined to do all possible to cure her and restore her health, and that determination requires solving the mystery.  Along the way, he manages to disturb several characters, who show too much hatred toward Robak to be normal, and he thus has to look into their interests as well.  Despite his official position, he is able to press his investigations, and with the help of some good friends, he solves several mysteries while pursuing his wife's enemy. Hensley's writing is comfortable and entertaining, and his creation of atmosphere is first-class. I hope Robak keeps coming back.
