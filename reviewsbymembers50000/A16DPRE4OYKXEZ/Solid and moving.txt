 Atkins' story has a nice combination of solid writing, combined with an engaging and moving story line. Our hero, Nick, loves blues music better than anything, maybe even better than his remembered girl friend, Kate, and when he is given the chance to go to Chicago and root around in the past, with the expectation of a revealing interview with a former blues singer now in prison, he can't wait to get started.  His trip north not only allows him to have that interview with a former blues great, whose career was cut terribly short by a conviction of murdering her lover, but it also allows him to re-united with that warm ex-, Kate. When he attempts to learn the truth about the death of the long- gone musician, for which Ruby was convicted, he encounters one of the most nasty of fictional killers, and he also runs into obstacles put up, mysteriously, by former friends and fellow-musicians of the dead blues man. The obstacles and problems only encourage Nick to further explore the decades-old murder, as well as the story told him by the inmate convicted of killing him. It's a moving and warm story, both intricate and straightforward, and Atkins does a very nice job of combining the elements of a good read.
