 Author Aldrich obviously is passionate about his beliefs, and they are showcased here as he paints a rather broad picture of leftist hatred of our American history and culture, and he urges us to help steer America on the correct course as established by the Founding Fathers. His views seem correct, but this not a simple hate-Democrats book as might be thought, as he states and shows he is not unhappy with mainstream Democrats, but at the fringe element of that Party that has virtually taken over. And we have to know he is not making any phony claims.  Even our Indiana Democrat Senator, Evan Bayh, has publicly questioned the direction of the national Democrat party, and he has made some effort to organize party members to help insure that the Party doesn't go off in some very minority, unpopular direction. And Aldrich doesn't hesitate to critize the current Republican administration in some regards, where he feels they are veering too far from our Republic's guiding principles. So this is not a purely political diatribe at all, but is the author's vision of where America should be heading, as he outlines some of the failings of many who would try to lead us in the wrong direction. He has a lot of truth to present, based on history and an understanding of world politics, and he presents his views with clarity and strength, so this book should be read by all interested voters and citizens.
