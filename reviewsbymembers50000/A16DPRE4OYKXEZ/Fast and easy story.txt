 Lawyer Ben Kincaid takes on another case he seemingly has no chance of winning, but he "back doors" this one because he initially refuses to have anything to do with the case, and he refuses to give a reason to anyone, but after his partner Christina takes the case, and is faltering, he has to take over. The case consists of two parts, seemingly unrelated, the first the big murder case involving a "gay bashing" killing by a couple of ignorant, hapless frat boys, and the other a sophisticated kidnapping where the criminals got totally away. But then some low-level people are killed, in gruesome fashion, and Ben's buddy, a detective on the Tulsa PD, starts seeing some common threads in the murders, and the chase is on. How Bernhardt handles the two crimes, and the various factors, is well-done, and he does a very nice job of tying up loose ends. Some readers will think those loose ends are too quickly tied up, and the final solution sort of falls together too easily, so there will be some dissatisfaction here, but, overall, this is a nice story well done.
