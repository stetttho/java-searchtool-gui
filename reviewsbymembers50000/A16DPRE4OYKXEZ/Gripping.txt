 This Elvis Cole/Joe Pike story is more gripping than most others, and one recommended. The story has an interesting beginning when a teen-age girl, taking care of her two younger siblings, comes into Cole's office and tries to hire him to find her missing father.  This improbable request is initially denied, but Cole's soft heart leads him into a mystery that grows by the day. The father turns out to be truly missing, and the trail leads to a Seattle counterfeiting operation for the Russian mob, and before Cole knows what is going on, he is arrested by the feds and knocked around by a team of US Marshals. And that is just the beginning. The action leads from Seattle back to the large L.A. area, and the search generates more threats and banging-around, and Cole, and then his partner, Pike, end up taking shots from Orientals as well as Russians, while dodging both the Secret Service and the US Marshals, and the complex conflicts taxes even these best of private detectives. And the kids of the missing man keep getting in the way as well, and there is considerable interesting reading here, and this book is recommended.
