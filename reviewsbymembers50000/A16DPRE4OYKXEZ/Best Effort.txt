 This is author Erickson's best effort, and it is a very rewarding book to read. Her earlier efforts were good, but in this story, she really expands her characters, and she establishs depths that are first-rate. The story is that the wife of a very nasty, abusive, egocentric pro athlete is killed at home, just as her family and husband, with lawyers, are finalizing their divorce settlement.  Everyone, from her family, to the public, onto the police, believe the athlete-husband was responsible for her horrible death, but he seems to have an iron-clad alibi, and the police even reach dead-ends (in more ways than one) when trying to work out how the guy would have arranged the murder by other persons. The story is compelling, with much tension and mystery, as it moves forward, and the police, especially Mars and his partner, are straining to solve the killing within a tight time frame. Mars and his partner are moving from the city PD to another agency within days, and the new police chief is fumbling around, interfering with their investigation because of his own personal agenda, and his old friend, the Mayor, is willing to stand by and let the investigtion falter so she can make her own political game work.  The reader can feel the frustration of these capable police investigators as they keep following leads that aren't solving the crime, as they try to re-think how it could have happened, all the while the clock is running out against them. The author does an exceptional job of building the supsense, while pitting that against the shrinking time factor, and most readers will really enjoy the unfolding of the mystery; the solution will surprise many, and it will unfold in such a way that most readers will genuinely have a difficult time putting the book down after starting the final revelations. This author's ability takes a giant step forward with this effort.  We can only hope for similar, future efforts.
