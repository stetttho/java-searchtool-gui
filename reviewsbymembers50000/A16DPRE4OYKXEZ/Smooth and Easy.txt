 Grisham writes some of the smoothest books around, and that is not a negative comment.  His works are so easy-going and readable, and once started, they are difficult to put down. This one is also good, but it doesn't seem to have the focus of the better-known Grisham novels.  It is almost like a story told by an old-timer, where you find it interesting, but you know if he lost his threat of thought, you wouldn't miss much. This is the story of a young guy who drifted through college, and never graduated because his grandmother cut off his money, and who ended up working as a reporter on a small Mississippi weekly.  But he has barely gotten his feet wet when the old-time owner/editor comes to an end to his career, and the young guy get the idea he would like to make something of this small failing paper, and maybe have some fun himself; so he talks his grandmother into putting up the money to buy the paper,and he goes to work.  Not only does he work, but he begins to try to ease himself into the small-town society. He is working hard, and the paper shows promise, when the most horrible crime in anyone's memory occurs, and he finds himself in the middle of a very exciting and dangerous time. A young attractive widow is suddenly attacked, raped and murdered, apparently in front of her two small children, and the town explodes in hatred toward the obvious culprit. A very nasty trial takes place, and Grisham describes the jury proceedings, and it's impact on the small town, as no other can.  The killer is found guilty, but he is spared the death penalty in a controversal decision by the jury, but after he is sent off to Parchman prison, the real mystery begins. The pace is good, and the characters are, for the most part,  readable and interesting.
