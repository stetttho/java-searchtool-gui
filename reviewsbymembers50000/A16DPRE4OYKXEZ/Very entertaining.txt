 Unhappily, this book start out a little slow, and the reader will have to plow through some dialog filled with cliches for awhile, but if you persist, the story developes into an entertaining one. The author must have had a girl friend like the "heroine" here, because he invests her with so many odd, and even negative, qualities, while making her seem worthwhile, and at times a nice companion, it has to be difficult to have a characte with so many divergent qualities.  Most fictional characters are easily catagorized, whether good or bad, but this one keeps our interest because at times she is very unappealing and unlikeable, but then before we can write her off, she suddenly grabs our interest by some quick, inventive thinking that we have to admire. The woman is running away from trouble, and she isn't doing a very good job of it, when she is befriended by an elderly couple, and it turns out the man has stolen some newly developed scientific formula, which could, of course, change the course of world history, and many readers will begin to wonder if they will be able to keep awake during this trite story. But then the fun begins. Various thieves, murderers and government agents start to converge on her, to get the formula, and she is teamed up with different people depending on who is killing off whom, as she is paired, usually against her will, with various survivors. And all the time, she is trying to stay alive by her wits, when she doesn't really understand the nature of the formlula everyone wants, and at the same time, she constantly is thinking of all the money the thing is worth, and she starts to try to figure out how to cut herself into the payoff.  So she is trying to cut herself into the deal, while at the same time she knows she is about to be killed by any of the othe particpants. The author does a nice job of maintaining our interest, and most readers will want to read to the end, and that is a true mark of a real mystery.
