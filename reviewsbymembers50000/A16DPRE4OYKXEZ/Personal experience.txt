 This a mildly interesting look at the concept of serial killers, but the author tells us up front that it is not any kind of scientific look at the subject, but it is based on her personal experience. She is certainly correct about that. The author has some experience with a serial killer, and she relates she became interested in the subject because she suspected the police weren't giving that case the proper amount of attention.  So she has studied cases of serial killers to become more acquainted with them and their profiles, and she does present the reader with many instances of such killers, but her presentation is not categorized at all, nor is there any order to them.  So we are left with reading a series of individual cases, with little connection amount them. She does assert that the "scientific" approach to profiling isn't nearly as good as the FBI expects us to believe, and she presents material showing that there is more in the way of "common sense" details in their profiling, and that regular citizens can do about as well in that regard. Plus, her study of individual cases tells her there are more such cases than we tend to believe. This is a fairly interesting series of stories, but it is mainly the author's personal experience and her personal approach to such complex problems, and, as a result, the book tends to make interested readers pursue the subject in a more serious fashion. You won't find many answers here, only questions readers will have to research elsewhere.
