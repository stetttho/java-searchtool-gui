 This book is about as close to a Soap Opera as you can get without video.   The story is about twin brothers separated at birth and raised by different families, and it follows their lives through a series of coincidences that defies imagination.  Even the author reminds us that sometimes a rare coincidence does happen, but he fails to convince us such a series of coincidences as here described could actually happen. The story will appeal to a few, but there is no suspense, no tension, no surprises, and one page reads like another.  It is just an on-going rather boring story, and people who actually lived the lives fictionalized here couldn't possibly lead such dull, predictable lives. There just isn't much here to engage any serious reader, and most readers will want to avoid wasting their time with this one.
