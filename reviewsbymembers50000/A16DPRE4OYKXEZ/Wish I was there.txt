 All I can say is that if you travel, or, better yet, dream of traveling, as you are reading Bryson's book of his travels in Australia, you will surely wish you were there right now. Bryson's usual breezy style, plus his optimistic outlook on what he is seeing and what is yet to come, make this book a pleasure to read.  His writing radiates so much fun, it is a difficult book to put down; the reader can't wait to go on and share in the fun around the next corner (and on the next few pages). Escape into pleasant dreams by reading this book.
