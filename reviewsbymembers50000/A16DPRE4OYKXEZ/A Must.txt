 This CD is limited to their Decca recording days in 1938, but the Carter Family never sounded better.  Their earliest recordings are very significant, but the primitive recording techniques can be noticed in the music recorded in the 1927-28 era. In this CD, however, the fabulous sound is amazing, considering the date of origin, and the group harmonizes perfectly, and their singing is much more polished than in their beginning days.  The sound in this CD is so good you can hear Sara's voice as never before, and the details of Maybelle's picking are also evident.  The sound is so good, we can hope the sound engineers were given a proper "pat on the back" for their inspired efforts in getting this music onto the CD format. It's hard to believe the originals were this good. Yes, a couple more songs would have made it getter, but the selectons are good, considering being limited to the Decca recordings, and we have to appreciate this unique offering. The Carter Family singing is so good here, in some songs many listeners will have difficulty keeping dry eyes when they concentrate on the music. This belongs in every country music collection.
