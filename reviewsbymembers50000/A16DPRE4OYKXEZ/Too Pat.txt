 Patterson has written another Cross story that is entertaining enough to keep most readers interested, and it moves along o.k., but it's just too pat to really be engaging.  There just isn't the supsense to make us stay with the book and disregard other interests.  This seems like the kind of book that can be put down at anytime, and taken up later, with the feeling that we haven't missed out on anything. The story is another that involves past guilt from the Vietnam War, and terrible things that happened there, and this author tries to raise some excitement along the lines of that old guilt coming home to roost, and doing so with the murders of innocent people here, with resultant convictions of Vietnam vets.  Which vets are innocent of any crime here, but who are ostensibly being punished for past sins during that war. It's an old concept, and this author doesn't add anything new to it. The story moves along to a predictable end, and none of the characters, good or bad, seem to grab us with either their personalities or past histories. This is something to read when nothing good can be found.
