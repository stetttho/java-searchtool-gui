 It isn't even fair to list this book by PD James as a "mystery," because that implies it lacks the depth to be considered a true novel.  But the author puts so much detail and emotion into this story, and she developes it so completely, it can't be anything else. PD James is such a careful, detailed craftsman, she spends more than the first 100 pages just introducing the characters.  And it is worth it. The action takes place in and near a private, rather specialized museum on the outskirts of London, at the edge of one of the great parks, and as the police investigate, the mystery grows. The Commander is called into a meeting which includes some officials higher up than he expects, including representatives from Special Branch, MI5, MI6, the Ministry, and he is told his special squad will be handling the matter.  And before the original murder is solved, another takes place, and the police have to expand their investigation. As happens, there are some side issues, with collateral actions taking place involving some in the higher social classes, as well as at least one Diplomat, so the police are urged to solve the crimes without ruffling too many feathers while doing so. This author can bring together more divergent elements, while making it so smooth as to appear effortless, that it's easy to forget just what talent she brings to this type writing. This is a fairly long book, for a mystery, but it is gripping at all times, and it will continually engage most readers.  It will definitely be difficult to put down.  Don't start this book until you know you can devote some significant time to it.
