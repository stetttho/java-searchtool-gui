 The author does a first-class job of covering not only the causes of most of our physical ailments, but also of how to give yourself relief from them. His theory is that so many of our physical problems come from what we eat and drink, that we should be able to avoid those problems by eating right.  Not a new theory, but he outlines all the problems affected by our poor diet, and he documents scientific and medical studies showing the cause-and-effect, and then, to cap it all off, he explains how we can specifically change our diets to start improving our physical health. He gives details for anyone truly interested in those questions, and he has a direct and rather plain-speaking way of showing us what items we need to eliminate from our diets, and then he happily presents the better, more healthful substitutes. The author covers everything in the field, and he not only outlines the problems, he shows us the way to a more healthful life, and he does that in a way we can understand and follow. For anyone suffering from any health problem, or who is worried about their future health, this is a must. Don't miss it.
