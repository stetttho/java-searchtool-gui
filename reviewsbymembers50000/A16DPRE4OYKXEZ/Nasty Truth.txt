 Everyone should have to read the nasty truth about these politicians before they are allowed to vote. This author worked as a military aide to Pres. Clinton for a couple yrs, and he had to be close by on numerous occasions, plus, he had to endure the presence of Hillary Clinton.  Talk about a "combat zone!" There are no secrets at all in this book, but some candid and truthful glimpses of the Clintons should be known to everyone. From Mr. Clinton's ignorance of the role of the military, and his lack of proper response to military needs, as well as the well-documented absence of action to protect our country from terrorism, on to Mrs. Clinton's obvious self-centered, selfish, "me-me" attitude, these people are clearly revealed as being unfit for high office.  Add in some examples of Mrs. Clinton's ill-tempered reponses to almost anything, and you should get a decent picture of what kind of people they really are. No one voting for either of those people could possibly know and understand the truth about them. Unfortunately, it is the ignorant who keep voting for them, and they won't bother with the truth. But this author presents in a dispassionate way some clear examples of the behavior and motivations of the Clintons, and it's too bad everyone doesn't acquaint themselves with the truth. This is a condensed look at those examples, and it can be easily and quickly read, and that is all the more reason why it should not be missed.
