 Yes, this latest by Ruth Rendell is breaking new ground for her, and we can understand her interest in exploring new territory, but this story doesn't have the tight plotting and exciting mysteries of her famous Inspector Wexford series. This one is more of a "psychological thriller" than mystery, and it suffers by the exclusion of a mystery component. An interesting story, but we have to hope the author returns to her justly-famous mysteries and gives us another winner.
