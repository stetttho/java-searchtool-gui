 This has to be one of the best Ed McBain books ever.  The story is complex, and the characters keep on parading through the story, with enough eccentricities to keep the readers on their toes. The lead detective is Fat Ollie, and the worst of the foul criminals is Wiggy the Lid, and their are intermediate characters equally odd, and the characters peopling this story remind us of some of the Damon Runyon stories. The story is, basically, about a drug deal gone wrong, and drug wholesalers and retailers fight it out among themselves, as well as various federal and local cops, as well as a mysterious organization that might be criminal, or it might be law enforcement.  Who knows?  The local cops sure don't, and they struggle to identify the good and bad guys as the killings continue. It's quite a mish-mash of characters, but that is what makes this story so interesting and readable. The story leaps forward throughout the book, and this is one you genuinely hate to put down in the middle. Plot twists mixed with humor make this a real winner.
