 Unhappily, the writer here, who is very good with technical details and predictions of future weaponry, takes it a bit too far. In this story of the new US warrior class, mainly consisting of former US military now operating for a private company, the heroes take on a ruthless, vicious dictator of a new Libya, and they engage in some serious warfare in that part of the world. While making war against the new Libya, they encounter various heroes and villains in Egypt as well, and that adds a depth of story that is usually engaging and informative. But the writer stretches our imagination a little too much in this one.  Among his new characters is a 9-yr-old girl who helps, happily, design fearsome new weapons, and whose genius with computer technology, as well as the highest forms of physics, goes beyond genius, and that character seems more science-fiction than anything else.  So it is difficult to relate to that character and her contributions to the story. In addition, one of the leading characters is an American woman who becomes the President of Egypt, then the leader of a neo- Muslim fanatical organization intent on pushing Westerners out of the Arab world.  She is also former US military and a non-Muslim, who converts for the purpose of leading this pan-Arab colition, so the stretch here is also a little too much to accept as part of the story. There is just too much of a "science-fiction" feel to this story to really be a good novel. And, as usual, coupled with that tugging on our imagination, the writer inundates us with military jargon, so it is a bit difficult to follow. Tough going for most readers.
