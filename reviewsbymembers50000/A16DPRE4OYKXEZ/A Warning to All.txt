 Author David Limbaugh shows dozens of examples of how so many people and groups are attacking the very foundation of our great American republic by attacking Christian values. He lists the examples, and then he explains further the background of those attacking all traditional values and the motivation for such attacks. The most significant point he makes is that even those who aren't traditional Christians need for the traditional Christian values to be upheld, and even celebrated, because it is those values which have always formed the basis for all the freedoms enjoyed by all in our country.  He also points out that virtually all of our founding fathers held strong Christian beliefs, even most of those now cited as not being Christians. Not all Founders were Christians, but nearly all were, and the writer does a nice job of exploring their various backgrounds and citing many of their writings. All our traditions of freedoms, both personal and economic, are based on those long-standing Christian values, and Limbaugh tries to show how the very Republic will crumble if the anti-Christians have their way. The only trouble with such a book packed with examples and historical and legal precedents is that is the old story of "preaching to the choir."  The ignorant and self-seeking who most need to learn why they have such freedoms will never read or understand why.  It is only those who understand the fight and what they have to lose who will pick up and read such a detailed defense of our 200-year-old values.
