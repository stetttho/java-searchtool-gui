 Although this Clancy novel is not as tense and exciting as his usual top-notch work, it is still very good. The book details much of the facts and action that preceded one of the most inhumane acts of Communism, the attempt to kill the Pope.  The shooter was a Turk, sponsored by the Bulgarian Secret Police, at the behest of the Soviet Union's KGB, and the plan had been initiated by one of the top KGB killers, Andropov, who became, of course, the Communist Party's First Secretary. Anyone interested in the Cold War needs to acquaint themselves with this extreme action by the Soviets, and the Clancy book gives a lot of detail, enhanced by the author's knowledge and understanding of the true character of that Cold War. The future of all of us was at stake during those years, and Clancy is one who fully understands and can explain that. Yes, there is less "action" in this book, which takes place in the early years of hero Jack Ryan's place on the international stage, but the workings of the CIA and the British SIS are further explored to great satisfaction, and the reactions of our great conservative leaders, Reagan and Thacher, form a good background to Western civilization's response to the truly evil actions by the USSR. Clancy does a good job of explaining and exploring the movements of people in the Cold War, and his writing remains fascinating and engaging.  He understands that not every battle results in a lot of lost blood, and we, as readers, may need to be reminded of that.  An engrossing exposition, well written.
