 A very decent book and an interesting read, but Buckley's fictional account of some of Jim Angleton's anti-communist work lacks enough detail to really prove engaging. As a mystery, the story seems a little weak, but passable. A more glaring omission is Buckley's usual detailed knowledge and background, and we are allowed only the slightest insight into Angleton's thinking and motivation.  It's especially glaring here because the author has significant knowledge of the events and eras covered, but he has chosen not to share it with the reader. Angleton was the CIA's Chief of Counterintelligence for 20 years, and he was one of the leading anti-communist fighters of all time, and he devoted his life to that cause, and we have to wish Buckley would have shared significantly more of his insights and knowledge.  Even in a fictionalized account, the author could have easily added far more interesting details and stories. This work is barely an introduction to either the life and times of the famous Angleton or to the enormous anti-communist effort so many Westerners made for decades.   This is a book to read in between more serious pursuits.
