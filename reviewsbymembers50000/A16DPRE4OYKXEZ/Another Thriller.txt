 Author Crais remains in top form with this story, in which a burned-out LA SWAT negotiator has semi-retired to a small, quiet suburb, where he expects to remain as police chief in a similarly small, quiet job. His expectations are shattered when some small-time losers rob a convenience store, where an unexpected struggle over a gun results in a dead clerk, with the panicked hold-up guys running for cover and ending up in a nice, high-end house with a man and 2 kids.  Before the robbers can get away, as they seriously want, they are cornered in the house, where they then take that family hostage. The hostage situation seems routine, if dangerous, for the local chief, but the scenerio plays out much differently than expected. It turns out the man of the house is an accountant for a large west-coast organized crime family, and those people make immediately plans for handling the situation, over and above anything the cops can do.  And they bring massive resources to play in their attempt to get what they want. Plus, their solution involves taking some hostages of their own, so they can control the problem and its solution. The action moves along quickly and effortlessly, and all the characters ring true, even if a bit more willing to work for organized crime than we like to think possible.  Some unexpected characters end up working agains the police chief, and he has multiple enemies to fight in trying to reach a reasonable conclusion to both the crimes and his own personal demons. A very serious story that is gripping and entertaining.
