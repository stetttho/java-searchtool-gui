 This Ed McBain 87th Precinct book is proof that these stories just get better and better. The characters are complex and very, very human, and all the more believeable for it. An old man is found dead in mysterious circumstances, but there is no motive for his death, and the case stagnates until a very nice motive suddenly appears.  The man was sitting on literary rights to a play about to be staged, and he was refusing to sell the rights.  And a lot of people wanted that play to go and be staged; there was a lot of money at stake. Then one of Steve's favorite informers is shot to death in a pizza place, when the informer is talking to Steve and about to help him on a case.  The audacity of that killing upsets the police, and the hunt begins in earnest. Plus, Fat Ollie gets involved and is determined to help the  detectives of the 87th, whether they want it or not. There is a lot of action here, and the pace is fast and strong. A solid and good police-procedural entry.
