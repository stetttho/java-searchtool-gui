 The author has put together a nice story, wherein he explores the lives of some complex characters, all related to the elderly federal judge who has recently died in his hometown of Louisville. His children are rather diverse in character, and they are still exploring their feelings and goals even in middle age, and they continue to explore life in a very real way, even to the point of disrupting their own families. There is a certain vagueness about some of the "action", where we aren't quite sure of the exact relationships among the various players, but the story is interesting and moves along at a nice pace.  It has the added attraction of moving in some unexpected directions. Slightly off-beat, but all the more interesting.
