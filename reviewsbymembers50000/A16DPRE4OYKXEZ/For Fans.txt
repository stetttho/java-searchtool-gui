 This book is a full one, with numerous quotes from many participants themselves who were cast members of the famous TV show, but the information provided is a bit limited. The format consists of hundreds of brief quotes, clustered around a linear time-line, so there isn't much of a feel of literature about the book at all. The disjointed format lessens the interest in reading it, but the quotes provide a first-hand look at one of our popular institutions. If "unnamed sources" had told some of these stories, no one would believe them.  There are such sorid tales of massive drug abuse and routine, non-romantic sex, taking place during the writing and rehearsals, that they would sound like wild exaggerations.  Outsiders wouldn't believe a TV show could be put on the air with such inattention and such casual attitude toward public performance, but the participants detail a long list of abuses and excesses. There are more confessions in this book than in a Catholic church, and if salacious detail interest a reader, then this book is a place to start. The format prevents it from being as readable as it should be, but some interesting facts are here.  But this book, as a serious subject, is only for the true fan of the TV show. The displays of self-indulgence behavior and selfish attitudes detailed here will repel many potential readers, so approach this book with caution.  It won't hold the interests of many readers very long. It is almost like a pasted-up version of a supermarket tabloid, and the only redeeming feature is that the details are provided by those who were there doing all those stupid, selfish things to themselves and fellow staffers. As I said, for the serious fan of the show only.
