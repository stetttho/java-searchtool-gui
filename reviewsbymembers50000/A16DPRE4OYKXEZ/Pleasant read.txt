 This book is a pleasant read, and fun at times, but it just never measures up to the usual Bernhardt standard of excitement and fast-paced action. The characters don't ring quite as true as in his prior works, so it is difficult to get involved with them and this mystery. I look forward to his next entries in the mystery category.
