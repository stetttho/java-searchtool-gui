 The best part of this book is the question that forms the premise of the story: What would you do to take care of yourself if you lost your job, and your other options were quickly running out?" And this question can't really be answered by anyone who hasn't been in that position, so readers should be too quick to judge the story or the "hero's" response. Here, the man who has lost his job also lost some of his friends at the same time, and his girl friend moved out almost immediately, and he can see the entire town shriveling up and dying because the one big plant is gone forever, and all the supporting retail establishments are also drying up.  He has reached the point where he has no hope, and he is beginning to let his life slide along with no ambition, no expectation, no social life, no fun, and he has lost all his possessions. It's so bad that when an acquaintance says, accusingly, that his girl friend ran off with a used car dealer, the only response the guy can make is, "He was a new car dealer." If you have ever been there, or even close to it, this is a very interesting book. But, unhappily, the premise question is never quite answered satisfactorily because all at once, the subject of the story, who has descended to depths never thought possible, decided to quit the criminal game he started and retire to a regular business he bought with his criminal income, and he then gets a very nice, understanding girl friend, and "they all lived happily ever after." The ending is too abrupt and too pat. Just think how this imposing question of how far we would go had been addressed and answered by Elmore Leonard.  Wow. But the writer had a very good idea, and a subsequent writing will likely be improved.
