 First off, this is an interesting book and well worth reading, but for the conspiracy buff, this would have to be a "5 star" rating.  The author sketches, over the length of this story, such a conspiracy that could only exist in the minds of the most imaginative of us.  He presents a secret organization composed of capitalists, communists, drug lords, terrorists, intelligence organizations from both East and West, Arabs, Israelis and such historically opposed groups as to defy belief, and he wants us to believe all of these opposing forces and beliefs get together as one, all for the purpose of pursuing actions that will benefit all of them. A bit of belief has to be suspended in order for the reader to accept this premise. But the writing is so well done, and the characters so interesting, it is possible to do so. The story starts out with the downing of a crowded US airliner over the Atlantic shortly after takeoff, and it takes off from there with killings so wide-spread and among such a diverse group of people, they are hard to follow.  Except for the participants of course. The hero is a CIA man, and he recognizes quickly the mark of an assassin he has encountered before, and he begins a dogged search for that person, and along the way has to deal with many more deaths, which, even to him, sometimes seem unconnected. But this is an interesting story, and it will certainly be stimulating to many. As said above, conspiracy buffs will salivate over this one. But the rest of us can still enjoy a good, entertaining story.
