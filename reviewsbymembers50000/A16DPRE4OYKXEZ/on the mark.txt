 This book will be satisfying to most any reader of mysteries. The characters are well-drawn and interesting, the story keeps reader interest and moves along at a nice pace.  The ending approaches more slowly than in most comparable books, but it is a surprise nonetheless. The author has her own special ability to describe the characters, and they do appear interesting, and you want to learn more about them, but some readers will find her division between the good and the bad people a bit abrupt.  The "good" people, from the main detective to the supporting witnesses, are so good, we will wonder why we don't know anyone quite like them, whereas her "bad" people are as psychotic and evil as  those in any mystery. For example, her lead, the detective, is so good to his ex-wife, and so considerate of her welfare, it's difficult not to actually stop reading to try to think of someone in our life who is that good and caring and non-judgemental.  Of course, he cares so much about his son, he always puts him first in his life, even to the point of taking him to murder scenes and letting the 8- yr-old read detailed, gory accounts of killing sprees, and of allowing him free acquaintance with cops' street language. And that family is so happy with everything, we can't help but wonder why the divorce, etc. But maybe we can accept that some people are still incurable romantics, as this author has to be, and go on with her writing. Accept this blip in the story, and you will enjoy the book. The author does a nice job, and we will hope she has more ideas that will encourage her a follow-up.  Read this nice mystery, and you will be waiting on the next one by this author.
