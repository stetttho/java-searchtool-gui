 This is a nice change of pace for readers of mysteries, because it is about a Michigan game warden, and he works in that "far off" world of the Upper Peninsula.  This is a nice introduction to the rather different life of a game warden, who sometimes has to work like a regular cop, but who also has to give priority to the well-being of the wild animals he is to protect. And how many game wardens, let along cops, get to work on tracking down poachers whose ranks include professional killers of protected animals, foreigners, IRA terrorists, and whose enemies include tight-lipped FBI agents and Native Americans? This guy has a maze of enemies whose relationships equal those of a soap opera, and he has to sort through them like the best of our detectives. The story revolves around a mysterious explosion at an unusual federal animal research lab on the shores of Lake Superior, where 2 people are shot at close range, but where, at the same time, 5 timber wolves escape.  And when our game warden arrives, he finds the place guarded by FBI agents, with help from the Fish & Wildlife Svc and other strange people.  Plus, as he pokes around, he bumps into an Ojibway game warden, who shouldn't even be there, but our guy, Grady Service, hears about a very unusual "blue wolf" which is among those escaping animals. This is a nice, intricate mystery involving a large number of people of all kinds, and it all takes place in the beautiful, and sometimes lonely, U.P. of Michigan about the time deer hunting season is to begin.  It makes for a complex set of characters, and this hero's march through the wilderness, both natural and political, makes good reading.
