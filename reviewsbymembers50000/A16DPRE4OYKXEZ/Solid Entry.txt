 In this Elvis Cole--Joe Pike story, Crais hits the mark again, and his two heros work as one in solving some problems/mysteries involving an elite squad of the LAPD, and their mysterious activities after the bright but naive girl friend of one of the cops consults Elvis. Just as soon as his new client leaves, a couple of LAPD cops come into his office and threaten him and pester him to leave the case alone, but Elvis isn't the kind of guy to easily scare off.  Although he isn't as quiet as his partner, Pike, he is almost as fearless, and together they form a team that is almost unbeatable. The action moves along quickly and smoothly, and the reader who pays attention feels he is in L.A., moving with the action.
