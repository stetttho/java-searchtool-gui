 This can be a pleasant read for real fans of the "Cat Who..." series, but there isn't any mystery about it.  The writer never developes any tension in the story, and the villains just appear and drop out without any real development, and this book is just an easy story to read about the same ol' characters as in the past, and nothing much really happens. It is like reading one of the more simple cartoons; not much to it, but it's familiar, so you can give it a glance, then move on to something more substantial. For the true fans only.
