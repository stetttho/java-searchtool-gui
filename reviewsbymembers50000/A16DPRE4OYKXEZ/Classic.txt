 Yes, this collection of the Raymond Chandler pulp stories is one of the most classic and historic possible in this whole division of literature.  And we can call it "literature" because of Chandler. Although Hammett made an early contribution, he so quickly burned out, devoured by alcoholism and his unfathomable romance with Communism, that his effective writings ended rather quickly. But Chandler worked his magic over many years, and although his output was slim in volume, he continued to glow over a long period of time. And his start was here in these pulp contributions.  His very first writings seem a little stilted now, but they are still Chandler, and we can see the beginnings of his great prose. Shortly into his short-story writing, his style becomes pure Chandler, and it is recognizable by any mystery reader. Chandler always easily admitted that his great novels were put together from some of these early stories, and, as such, they shouldn't be missed by any mystery reader. His use of metaphore is not to be missed, and the reader will encounter those throughout his work; the use of language in these stories is like the use of musical notes by a master classical violinist--until you encounter them, you wouldn't have believed such combinations possible.  Most readers will find pleasure in going back and re-reading favorite phrases; they will have to be savored. This collection is complete, and it's one that will give pleasure for a long time.  Grab it now.
