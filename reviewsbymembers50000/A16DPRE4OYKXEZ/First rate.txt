 Author Bernhardt usually writes an interesting story, but this effort is among his best, and he has risen to a higher level of suspense and drama. The story essentially involves the hero's attempts to block an execution he feels isn't supported by the evidence, and his hopes soar when the main prosecution witness visits him to recant her testimony, and he prepared the paperwork to get the case before a federal judge. But as quickly as his hopes soared, they are dashed as the recanting witness turns up dead.  Before she can repeat her story to anyone else. Ben's whole office gets involved, and his partner Christina plays a more important role than usual, and they begin delving into the whole background of the case.  The murder that is at the base of the planned execution was especially horrible, and everyone involved, as well as much of the public, remembers it all too well, and those memories cause Ben and his staff much trouble as they try to save a man's life. The defendant's job as a food chemist allows us to see a new side to our food and restaurant industry, and Bernhardt has done a nice job of presenting such useful information in the context of his legal thriller. Very, very interesting story, and this is a book any reader of thrillers will want to grab and read.
