 This book is a fabulous chance to revel in the beautiful use of language, and this author is a master. The book isn't, of course, strictly speaking, about orchids and orchid hunters, but it is an exploration of the quirkiness of an individual orchid thief and his relationship with other orchid lovers, as well as the authorities charged with protecting our wild environment in Florida.  Plus, the author explores her own feelings and impressions about the off-beat characters she encounters in her off-the-wall (for her) adventure, and she reveals her thoughts as she travels through this adventure.  She obviously has mixed feelings about some aspects of her travels, but she clearly is having a lot of fun and excitement, and she does a very nice job of projecting her impressions with her skilled writing. The author's use of language has to be experienced, and most readers will find her work engaging.
