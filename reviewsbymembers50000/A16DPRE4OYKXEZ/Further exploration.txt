 This Ben Kincaid mystery further explores both the surface interactions between Ben and his partner Christina as well as the concept of a "hate" crime. Here, a gay man is tortured and murdered, apparently by two stupid, drunken college frat boys, and when Ben, the champion of the unpopular defendant, is asked to defend one of them, he surprisingly refuses.  Everyone who knows him is mystified. But then his partner Christina, over his objections, takes on the defense, and the case plods along with the defendant looking worse all the time. A parallel case, which doesn't seem to have any connection with the gay murder, is also tackled, and Ben's pal, the Tulsa PD detective who loves driving his vintage high-powered Pontiac, is working that one.  The Tulsa case involved a kidnapping with ransom, where the victim was left unharmed, but the kidnappers suddenly, and surprisingly since they were surrounded by both local police and the FBI, disappear.  Mike, the detective, pursues the case as long as possible, until his superiors assign him to more current cases.  But Mike doesn't forget, and he keeps trying to remember details of some aspect of the case that is in the background of his mind and won't go away. As Christina's case is nearing its end, with virtually no hope, Ben is visited by the defendant's mother, and that whole visit is quite mysterious, and Ben's office-mates wonder what is going on.  Christina is determined to learn how and why that other woman seems to know Ben, when Ben denies such knowledge. This Kincaid entry is rather more complex than most of these, and the cases come to a nice conclusion; the only drawback to many readers will be that the ending is a bit too pat and too sudden.  It has a feel that the author sort of took the easy way out at the end by offering up a solution that isn't entirely logical. But it is interesting and very readable.
