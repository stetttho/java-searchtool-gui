 A "mixed review" is about the best possible for this book, because there is such disparity between the good and negative elements.  The photos are fabulous, which much detail and well-informed captions, and that part is clearly the best part of this book.  Most photos were taken of gun collections in famous museums, mainly the Gene Autry museum in L.A., and the Buffalo Bill Museum in Cody, WY, so the guns themselves are rare and usually documented in a way that clearly sets them apart from what most of us will ever see.  Anyone who has ever tried to photograph a gun will have their breathe taken away by the clarity and beauty of these photos, and they have to be seen to be believed.  Any student of the Old West, or of firearms, will want to study these photos and relish the details. Unhappily, the text doesn't seem to have as much detail or accuracy.  Many old legends are repeated, seemingly without verification, and some of them are rather discredited now. So the stories have to be read with an open mind, knowing that further reading would be required before forming an opinion of some of the historic figures of the Old West. So there is an odd mix in going through this book, but the photos alone make this an interesting and worthwhile project.
