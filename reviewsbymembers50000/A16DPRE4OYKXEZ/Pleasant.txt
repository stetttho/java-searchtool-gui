 A pleasant read, and a relatively nice mystery, but, as the book jacket proclaims, this is a book that "mixes mysticism and murder."  And the mix doesn't work as well as it should. The "mysticism" part is a bit of an intrusion to most readers, but, happily, that part is rather minor, so the mystery moves along and is quite readable. The hero is a Southern Ute rancher, who doubles as a tribal investigator on call to the tribal council, and he is likeable enough, but this character doesn't quite resonate as a mystery hero should. In this one, a young woman student at a nearby college goes missing and has totally disappeared.  Or has she?  Because she seems to be appealing to the rancher's elderly aunt, a tribal shaman, to ask Charlie, her nephew, to meet her and offer some help.  There is a murder of a tribesman, plus the maiming of a US Senator, that draws Charlie into a mix of local crime and international intrique, and that combination really heats up the story. There are explosions and more murders, plus a run-in with local drug-running motorcycle gang members, and the action gets diverse, and it moves the reader along. The author introduces a romance angle, but it has a very hollow feel to it, as though it was added after completion of the book, and this angle doesn't ring true at all. Readable, but not very exciting, this book is a little too easy to put down.
