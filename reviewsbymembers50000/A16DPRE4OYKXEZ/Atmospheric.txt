 ~~~Author Connnelly does create the best atmospheric police thriller available anywhere today, and his City of Bones is up to his always high standard. No character better personifies the complexity of a rare type of cop, the cop who does not become too hardened to feel emotionally for the victims, than Harry Bosch.  When some old bones turn out to be those of a murdered child, Bosch knows he will have to find the killer, regardless of the toll on his own emotions, and in spite of the~~~~ bureaucratic limitations of a big-city police department, with their budget constraints and their ego-driven bosses. Bosch, as usual, becomes consumed by his search, but he still finds time to become romantically involved with a rookie cop, with her unusual attractions, over the objections of his superiors and contrary to department regs. As usual, in both his personal as well as his professional life, Bosch plunges ahead to satifify his goals and disregards the conventional wisdom of~~~~ the department and his bosses. We have to admire detective Bosch for his willingness to pursue his goals, no matter the costs, but we are also aware of the real costs of such relentless pursuits.  As Harry both plods and races, at turns, toward the climax, we know the conclusion will be bittersweet. The dedicated crime reader will almost sweat with Harry as we read his frustrations and remember the limits imposed on him by his department.  We will be thinking of the calender just as ~~Harry does as he reaches dead ends or inconclusive facts; we can cuss under our breath as Harry does as witnesses fail to substantiate our theories. Nobody tries harder to solve a mystery than Harry Bosch, and we are right there with him in Connelly's stories.  One of the best.~~~
