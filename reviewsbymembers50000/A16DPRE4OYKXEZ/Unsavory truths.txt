 Although the this book seems a little old, when political events unfold on a daily basis, it is a very truthful and candid look at the early years of the Clinton White House years and the sloppy, self-centered occupants.  It would be funny to read about Bill Clinton trying to run and hide from an angry, vulgar, cursing Hillary if it wasn't so sad. Many insights into the type of people who worked in that White House and their casual attitude toward their work and the American public, and their callous disregard for basic security for both the President and the US. And it's too bad everyone who might consider voting for Hillary isn't required to at least read what is noted here about her behavior and character.  Her self-absorbed, continual efforts to benefit herself, to the detriment of absolutely everyone else have to be eye-opening. But most of her fans aren't interested in the truth, but real students of politics will want to learn the truth.  Which is presented here by a first-hand observer.
