 "Disappointing" may be too negative a description of this book, because Pearson is a great writer, and this description only applies when compared to other Pearson writings. The book moves along at a nice pace, and the main characters are interesting, but the story covers a lot of familiar ground here; we are supposed to get involved in the story of some women disappearing, probably at the hands of some pervert roaming the streets of Seattle, and the premise just isn't engaging any more.  Plus, in this entry, we have a lot more "romance" than we usually find in a good mystery or suspense, and there is so much of that element present, the mystery aspect is too toned down. Pearson tried some new direction here, and it is certainly not bad, but we hope he will re-engage us with a return to top- flight mysteries, similar to his work in the past.
