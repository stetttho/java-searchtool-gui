 First, we have to understand that this is author Block's homage to his favorite place in the world, New York City, and the story here concerns the lives of a multitude of people following the 9/11 terror attack. The title comes from Block's premise that even New York can be a "small town" in some respects, and even though that stretches our imagination, he manages to do a very good job of weaving all these individual stories into a coherent novel. The point of the novel, the one thing that really keeps us moving forward through the story, wanting more, is that someone is killing people apparently at random, at an ever-increasing pace, and the people whose lives are directly affected by the killings are connected in a "small-town" way.  Those affected most are eating at the same restaurants, visting the same art galleries, waving at old friends, talking to the same people, and even-amazingly-having sexual relations with the same people. There are some odd points of view at work here, but Block is a master at putting them all together so they work, and he is an experienced story-teller whose skills are revealed here. This is a very good, moving and fast-paced story whose multiple  characters are all interesting. Even if New York isn't your favorite city, this novel almost makes you wish you could be having dinner there with some friends, including some of the characters in this story. You need to read this one.
