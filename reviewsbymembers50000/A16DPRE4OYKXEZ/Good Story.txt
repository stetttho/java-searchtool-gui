 Yes, this is a very good story, and, as many say, vintage Scottoline.  But we have to consider the negataive of this story, and that there is little genuine "mystery" to it, and the author makes up for that by enlarging her usual theme of female bonding in her all-female law firm in Philadelphia.  The "girl power" aspect of the story dominates and rather detracts from the mystery aspect, which is too bad, because the elements of mystery are quite good, and Scottoline handles them all with mastery.  It's just that the mystery elements are too blunted, and too shortened, by the aspects of female bonding, and all the fun the girls have gossiping and shopping, etc. The mystery involves new attorney Anne Murphy, a tall, eye-catching redhead who insists on doing things "her way," and she is largely successful until her life is blown up by the death of her cat-sitter in circumstances that remind her of her former stalker.  She goes into hiding, while still trying to prepare fo the up-coming jury trial that will make her career, but as things continue to go horribly wrong for her, she finally decides she must bring into the mix her fellow attorneys for help, and that is when she discovers how much fun and happiness there is in working with the other women in the office. Part of the ending can be seen coming far ahead of time, but there is a nice twist at the end that really adds to the story. We can hope Scottoline's mysteries of the future involve a little more of the crime and its solution and a little less of the "gal pal" aspect of her attorneys.
