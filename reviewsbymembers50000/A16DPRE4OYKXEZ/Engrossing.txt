 This book by Daniel Silva is among the most engrossing you are apt to read for awhile.  His hero, the art-restorer Gabriel Allon, who still does the occasional very secret job for the Israeli Secret Service, learns that one of his best friends was murdered while working on a top-secret book. The search for the truth quickly becomes quite complex, as this talented spy searches for answers, and he is directed to an obscure convent along one of Italy's northern lakes, where the answers to his questions are really suspicious non-answers. His quest send him to locales through Germany and Italy, as well as into France and other places, and the tension mounts as Gabriel has to shoot his way out of a couple tight spots, and he begins to wonder just who his enemies are. Some of the highest leaders of the Roman Catholic church have parts to play here, as the search begins to focus on WWII and the part the church played in the Nazi's attempts to eliminate the Jewish population of Europe. Whether the premise, of Catholic indifference to the plight of the Jews in WWII Europe, is accepted or not, the story is very fascinating, and this author does a magnificant job detailing possible scenarios, and his characters are believeable to the point of the reader worrying and caring about some of them, and hoping for the worst for some others. Silva creates both characters and places that are easily visualized, and we do feel we are working along with these people as they are shot at, race around back streets of German and Italian cities, and meet with mysterious figures. The atmosphere the author creates cannot be beat, and this book will end too fast for most readers. Grab this one as soon as you can.
