 Yes, this is a "fast and easy" read, but that is not a negative comment.  Author Kaminsky has the ability to create and project characters of vastly different sensibilities and backgrounds, and he always writes stories that move quickly and with ease. Det. Abe Lieberman is an old-time Chicago cop who has almost seen too much crime and too many characters, but he is determined to stay on the job and do his best to see that justice is done.  Even when doing justice means doing business with some felons while pursuing others. Here, a robbery gone terribly wrong, when a low-level criminal of marginal ability trips and shoots a cooperating merchant, leads Lieberman and his Irish partner into a series of false confessions, low-lifes at each others throats, and sad commentaries on marriage and relationshiips. We also get to learn a little more about Jewish traditions than many readers will enjoy, but these heros are likeable people who do good, and they keep working on their professional duties while handling personal difficulties. Although this is a fast and easy read, it is also enjoyable and fun.
