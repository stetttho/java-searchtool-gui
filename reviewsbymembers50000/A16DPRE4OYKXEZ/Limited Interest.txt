 This is basically a good CD of country music, and many fans of the artist will enjoy the songs. However, it turns out that several of the best songs are virtually ruined, for many listeners, because they were  recorded "live," and the whistles, yells and screams so detract from the music, we have to wonder if they were left in on purpose, for some reason music-lovers will fail to understand, or if they result from the inattention of some sound engineers. The extra noise--and that is all it is--overpower the music in several songs, and that really detracts from enjoyment of this CD. Amazingly, the CD isn't labeled "live" anywhere on the CD. As a matter of fact, some of the songs are played on radio stations without the distracting and loud background noise, so someone understands how bad the CD we buy is. Largely, a disappointment.
