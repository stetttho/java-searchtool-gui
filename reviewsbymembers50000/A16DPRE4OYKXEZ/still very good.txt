 Although there is a lot of criticism for this Grisham book as not being up to his normal standard, it is, nonetheless, a very good book.  The puzzle is one we should be able to identify with because it poses the question of what to do with three million dollars in cash that turns up with, apparently, no strings attached. The hero of the story agonizes over his responsibilites considerably more than most of us would, but the author makes a good case for all the worry and guilt his hero feels as he struggles with the question of what to do with the money.  The more he worries, the more trouble he encounters, until he is being pursued completely by both his paranoia and genuine bad guys. The premise of the story is very engrossing, and the characters are life-like, and the action moves along at a good pace.  This is a very interesting read. However, it isn't up to the best Grisham work because of the ending; it was puzzling, but not satisifying at all, and, amazingly, most readers could work out a better ending. You should read the book for all the fun a good story gives, but then after the ending, try to work out an ending that is more fulfilling. Then you will have a good book.
