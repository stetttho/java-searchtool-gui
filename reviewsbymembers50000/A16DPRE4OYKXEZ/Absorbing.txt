 Another absorbing tale of the well-known Navajo policemen, who combine detailed understanding of their local people and environment, coupled with good police instincts. This time, the story is spiced with tales of long-lost gold mines, a wife who suddenly disappeared without a trace, a couple murders that don't seem connected, but which keep intersecting, along with a possible developing romantic interest. This series is especially interesting because the author is so knowledgeable about Navajo traditions and history, and he shares his fascination with us.  (The book's endpaper map is rather inadequate, and readers interested in the geography of the region, or in following the physical moves of the characters, will be well-served by having their own map to follow the action.  You can't do better than the AAA auto map of the Indian Country, which retired Lt. Leaphorn prefers.) A fast-paced story with engaging characters, and it is highly recommended.
