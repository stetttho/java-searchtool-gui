 Author Matthews has an "All-American" view of our collective history, and he does a nice job of highlighting some of the things that have specifically shaped him into a particular "all-American" character himself. He touches briefly on some of our cultural heroes, and since they are all worthy of review, his thoughts on them are worth reading.  It seems a bit odd that he puts such emphasis on movies and their heroes, but those movies have no doubt influenced his view of America, just as other factors have shaped our own view. The author hits only the high points of a rather odd mixture of historic figures, but they are all worth reviewing, and he gives the reader some positive thoughts to consider, and it is a nice review of a few American leaders who have influenced our collective thinking about exactly what a "real" American is. Given the author's experience and education, this book has a rather "light" feel to it, and it is rather easy to get through it quickly, but his points are nonetheless valid.  Many factors make up a true American, and they come from a great variety of sources during the last 300 years, and we still credit a lot of our qualities to our forebearers, both real and fictional. An interesting read.
