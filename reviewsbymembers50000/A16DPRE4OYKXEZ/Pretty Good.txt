 Yes, "Pretty Good" isn't much of a recommendation, but this is an enjoyable, easy read, and I do recommend it to friends.  But, truthfully, this tale of Mr. Q. and his loveable Siamese isn't quite up to par, and we see and hear too little of those famous cats. There is nothing taxing or engrossing about this story, but, that said, it is still enjoyable.
