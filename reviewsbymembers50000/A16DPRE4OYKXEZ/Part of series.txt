 This is much to recommend this book, and the true fans will love it. But, that said, the book is disturbing for a couple reasons. It is part of a series, and although it is only the 2nd of that series, it relies for a considerable part of its appeal on a full knowledge by the reader of the first book.  A truly good series will be so well done that each book stands on its own; it will make occasional reference to the past history of the characters, partly to entertain those who have read the entire series, and partly to encourage new readers to go back and capture, but it won't require that prior knowledge.  This book has several references to the first book that must be fully understood in order to appreciate the action of the second book.  That will be a serious flaw to many readers. Secondly, the author interlaces his story with so many references to the local scene of Tokyo, including the culture, architecture, history, local night spots, etc., that it will almost be more interesting to a sociologist than to a general reader of novels or mysteries.  He likes to drop in Japanese phrases throughout his book, some with a translation, but others without, and that seems to be a bit of an affectation, since it doesn't add to the story for most readers. So for many readers, this book will not "take off" as it should, with the distractions of detailed information on the Japanese and the continual references to a prior book. There are many good action details that are quite good, and those will be rewarding to many readers, and the book is full of detail. Worth reading, but it might be a disappointment to those who have missed the first installment.
