 Grisham is one of the best, and this book is another fast- moving, page-turning, interesting one. The story is about a young, frustrated, underpaid lawyer in the D.C. public defender's office, barely dreaming of a better life and career, who suddenly has a fabulous case dropped in his lap by a mysterious stranger. Yes, that is quite a stretch in our imagination, but strange things do happen,and this author can make it very  believeable and fascinating. The kid's new case, involving medical malpractice where he manages, with advice, to enlist hundreds of sufferers,  thrusts him into the limelight and the forefront of his profession, and he is quickly being touted as the new "King of Torts," the master of the mass-tort field. The first 2/3 of the book goes like wildfire, with ever- increasing tension and action. Unhappily, about that time, the author telegraphs his ending, and then the tension melts away, and the book is not quite so demanding or interesting. The ending is a foregone conclusion, so that ending is a bit of a let-down, and we can't quite maintain our high level of interest through the length of the book. But it is a very good read nonetheless, and readers of a good story won't want to miss it.
