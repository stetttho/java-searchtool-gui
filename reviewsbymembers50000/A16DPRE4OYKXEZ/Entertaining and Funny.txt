 This book does call for considerable suspension of belief, but fiction tends to call on us for that suspension; in this story, the reader has to be ready to suspend a large amount of belief and logic, but that said, this is a very entertaining and funny book. One point of the story is that we tend to expect the life of a small-college professor, especially just a visiting prof., to be rather one-dimensional and even dull.  But this particular prof. suddenly finds himself immersed in those famous trilogy of high-living qualities, guns, drugs and sex. He bounces from one problem to another, and along the way, his friends and students get more and more involved, to the point where they end up getting shot, beat up, robbed and generallly knocked around, and the prof. himself seems only interested in getting a little "action" with some women and in gaining some employment. It is difficult to describe crimes and violence and make it seem funny, knowing as we do the horrible reality of it from our reading and daily lives, but this author manages to do just that.  When you read some of these violent encounters, and meet the vicious characters involved, it is hard to laugh, but laugh we will. With the multiple plots and characters moving along, the pace is very good and fast, and the results are sometimes surprising. Life in a small college town may not be like this, but this writer does make it all sound intriguing. There are gangsters, drug dealers, college girls on the make, professors who seem to have little interest in teaching, mysterious mobsters who are hiding out while writing poetry, and more characters than we can almost keep track of, and they are all interesting, and we can't help but want to keep reading about them. The author does a very nice job of maintaining a very high level of interest, and most readers will keep wanting more.
