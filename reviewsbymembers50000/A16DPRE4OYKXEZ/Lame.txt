 Unhappily, this is a rather lame attempt to cash in on the popularity of her "Cat Who..." series.  The series itself, while entertaining to many, is rather tame and plain, so this slimmed-down version of some "local" folk lore from the same locale is just too weak to be sustainable. These tales are very short, and while that itself is not a criticism, the reader will search in vain for anything of value here. At bottom, there is simply no substance here at all in any of the little stories, and the only reason most readers will even bother going on to the next one is the hope that it will be better than the one just left.  But any hope is quickly dashed as the stories continue on in a very low-level attempt to seem folksy.  There is just no substance, no real style, no interesting characters, no truths, and no fun. Please don't waste your time with this.
