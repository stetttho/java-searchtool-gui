 McGarrity's hero has to take on a much expanded view of the world, and the law enforcment community, in this outing. When the wife of a high US government official is murdered in Sante Fe, the crime scene is quickly filled with various agents of the US, who all push aside the local police, citing some vague need for "national security."  It all sounds a little too much like a glossly cover-up, so the hero and his top police aides dig in and try to uncover the truth, all the while having to work under the radar of the FBI.  And as the investigation goes on, some of the federal investigators seem a bit too cold-blooded, keeping too many secrets, to even be FBI types. The local cops begin to suspect a conspiracy, and they uncover the disturbing fact that even they are under surveillance by the feds. It's a real law enforcement mess, and the author must know about jurisdictional arguments and fights, with multiple agencies, and even over-lapping court jurisdictions, because he does such a nice job of presenting the frustration felt by many local authorities. The range of the problems explored is a bit large, and it does take the reader away from the beautiful New Mexico settings favored by author McGarrity, but it is still a very nice mystery.  The pace is good, and the reader will keep wanting to move forward.
