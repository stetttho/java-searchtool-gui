 Yes, this is another nice entry in the famous "Nameless" detective series, and that is the mild recommendation intended. The reader gets the impression from this story that the author is tired of writing about his great creation, so the action seems slower than in the past, and the "nameless" detective is deliberately plagued by self-doubt and worry that slow down both him and this story. We have to wonder whether the prolific author intends to quit this series, and he is deliberately leading up to that point, or whether he is genuinely tired of the series, and this book merely reflects that lessening interest. This story just doesn't quite measure up to the earlier incarnations of "nameless," and we have to feel bad about that. Nameless has been a friend to the detective-story-reader for  quite a few years now, and he has led us through many an adventure and kept us entertained. If a reader is just sampling this series, some of the earlier stories are highly recommended. Here, we have a mildly entertaining story with a familiar character, and we hope a revived "Nameless" will re-appear in a more envigorated state shortly.   A nice story here that won't take much time or attention.
