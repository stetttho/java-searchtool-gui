 This has to be one of the worst books I've read in 40 years. It is incorrectly classified, and that should never be allowed. It is listed as a "novel," but it is not; the end flaps seem to suggest it is a "mystery," but that is so untrue, it's annoying. The story moves along at a medium pace, which is alright in itself, but as the end is approached, the whole tone switches to some metaphysical or sci-fi context, and the ending is just gibberish. It's a genuine waste of time to try this one.  Details of the first 90% of this book are meaningless, because the ending is so off-base, and such a switch in tone, anyone interested in that first part of the book will be disappointed in the ending.  A TV re-run is time better spent.
