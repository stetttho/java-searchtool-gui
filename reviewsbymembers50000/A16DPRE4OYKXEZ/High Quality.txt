 Ed McBain is a master at this kind of writing, and he sure doesn't fail us here. The story revolves around a couple of crimes, but the focal point is the lead detective's book manuscript that has been stolen during the course of a murder investigation.  All the while "Fat Ollie" is working on the murder, he is also dreaming of a better life as a famous mystery writer, and all he has to do is recover his stolen manuscript.  So he is pursuing all those goals at the same time, and, then, for some unknown reason, he seems to attract the attention of a new female cop. Fat Ollie has a lot going on, and he seems to bounce from one aspect of the case to another seamlessly, so the reader is swept up in his pursuits. All the details of a nice story are here, the characters ring true, and McBain makes all of it flow along nicely, and the reader will want to keep going to learn how it will all come out. All nicely done, and this is a good, recommended read.
