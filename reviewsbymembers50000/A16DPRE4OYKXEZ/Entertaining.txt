 A very nice, typical 87th Precinct book, and it is quite entertaining.  The basic story is about a play within a play, where an actress is attacked with a knife, in both the play and the mystery story here. But it isn't that complicated, and the author does a nice job of keeping the two mysteries straight.  The characters are very interesting, and there is enough conflict among the various people to sustain reader interest. The mystery deepens as the first obvious suspects are suddenly crossed off the list, and the police have to begin exploring other possibilities, and the author does a very nice job of moving the action forward. The only hitch in the story is the author's clumsy exploration of a black-white romance, which doesn't ring true at all and  seems extremely dated. But a very nice entry in this series.
