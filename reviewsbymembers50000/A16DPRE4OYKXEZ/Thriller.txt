 Although there are thousands of books called "Thrillers," very few really are.  But this one is one of those rare ones where the label is deserved.  The author weaves a complex story with many characters and multiple story lines, and this is a story that is genuinely difficult to put down in the middle. Hero Elvis Cole is about to settle down with his love interest and her young son, and he has probably never been happier, when suddenly the boy disappears.  Cole tries not to panic, but can't quite succeed, and he calls his partner and buddy, Joe Pike, to help.  Pike is a major character alone, and his contribution to this story is almost a novel in itself. And the bad guys.....They are depraved almost beyond reality, but we realize, with fear, that some people do exist who think and act like these, and we share Cole's feeling that time is running out on the young boy we are searching for. Plus, the bad guys, who are bad enough, seem to be getting some inside information that makes the job Cole and Pike have to do become almost impossible.  The cops are suspicious of all the details the criminals have access to, and they are too quick to blame Cole and Pike, and, as usual, they try to keep these two PIs out of the action and investigation. But only Cole has the information and the ability to analyze what is going on and to be able to reach for the boy, while combatting experienced killers. His girl friend's ex- is quickly on the scene, causing all sorts of trouble with his wild accusations, coupled with money and influence, and he misdirects the investigation because of his own feelings, and the story gets more complex as it goes on. But this is a story that is quite engaging, and it is difficult to lay aside in the middle. Very interesting as a thriller and as a novel delving into the psychology of people and their incredibly complex internal motivations. Quite recommended.
