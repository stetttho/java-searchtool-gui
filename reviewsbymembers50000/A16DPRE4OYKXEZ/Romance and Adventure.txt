 Truly a novel of romance and adventure, but, unhappily for some, "romance" is the dominant theme. The novel takes place in the years before WWII, and it then travels into WWII and some awful events.  But through it all, the author makes most of his characters very nice people, regardless of which side they are on in the war, and in his world, nearly everyone tried hard, and they are honest, with redeeming values. He obviously ignores the reality of the world we live in, and even the world of the Depression and of WWII. The action takes place in and around one of the small outer banks islands off the coast of N.Carolina, and the characters are mainly those islanders whose lives revolve around the ocean, fishing, boating, salvaging wreckage, etc. The hero, Josh, is "the keeper's son", but it turns out he isn't the only such son, and a possible 2nd son appears out of further away than "nowhere," and our imagination has to be stretched rather far to follow the logic and storyline of this novel. For example, even the Germans operating the U boats off our Atlantic coast, and sinking many boats with much loss of life, are shown to be patriotic in their own way, and we are supposed to have the American view that they aren't really such bad fellows after all. A good deal of suspension fo belief is required here, even more than typical novels, and it is a bit much for many. But the author handles his premise nicely, and he weaves a coherent, flowing story.
