 A very nice story about an honest and caring Wyoming Game  Warden, who is thrust into some nasty local politics, that eventually extends to the state level, and who is realistic enough to question whether he is in the right job. He wonders whether a game warden who cares about both wildlife, and the people in his community, can tread the fine line between enforcing the law, even some unpopular ones, and having friends among the local residents. The author paints a nice portrait of life in parts of Wyoming in today's complex legal and environmental tangle that affects so many of us. The actual mystery is also engaging, and the hero is very human in working out its solution. Perhaps most interesting of all, however, is the author's resolution of the age-old question about how a law officer  treats a criminal who has hurt him and his family.  This is not a "politically correct" solution, but, instead, a more human, realistic, and, eventually, more satisifying, answer. This book is a good, entertaining one, but the ending will make you wish you had read a bit faster.  The last few pages of this author's work will make most readers really sit up and wonder about the ending.  That ending raises some good  questions that will engage the reader, and this book won't be forgotten very soon. An extremely good first novel, and we hope the writer has some more ideas to write about that will continue our attention to his special outlook.
