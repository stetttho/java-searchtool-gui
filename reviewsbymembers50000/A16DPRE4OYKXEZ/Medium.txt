 Perhaps we expect too much from author Tom Clancy, because his past writings have been so strong and so full of excitement, and they have taken us so deeply into the thought processes of our global enemies. But this time, all we get is a rather "medium" story. The premise is a good one, that our Muslim enemies have worked out a deal with a Columbian drug cartel, so they will cooperate in some ways to bring death and destruction to their mutual enemy, the U.S. To counter such possibility, a super-secret, deniable group of Americans operate to learn all opponents' secrets via the internet, since they mainly keep in communication via that means, and they are recruiting young, tough Americans to execute their plans to protect the U.S. As said, a plausible and interesting concept, but the actual story never picks up any excitement, and the characters  never get developed sufficiently to engage our interest. Unhappily, the whole story has the feel of an elistist college club, where all members are related or know each other, and where their parents know each other, and they all have the exact same background, and where members are invited into this super-secret group on the basis of their family background. There just isn't the feel of Americans banding together to keep our country free of terrorist, and even as we read the story, most of us will feel we are being left out.  So we can only read this story with considerable detachment. Not a typical Clancy book at all.
