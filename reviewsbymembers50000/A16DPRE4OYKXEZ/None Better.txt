 Ruth Rendell is one of the best at her craft, and she is in great form with this one. Inspector Wexford has gotten a little older, and a bit more philosophical, but he is still a good, persistent cop, and he is determined to get to the bottom of this mystery. 2 teen-age children, and their "sitter," a young woman who used to be a school teacher and who now runs her own internet-tutoring business, disappear while the parents are on a trip to Paris.  The investigation is hampered by the wildly dysfunctional parents, and Wexford and his staff have to battle the parents to get all the information they need. But the investigation goes nowhere, and it is further delayed by Wexford's superior who orders him to wait until the current flood waters recede, thinking all 3 will be found dead in the  floodwaters. But after the waters finally recede, and some valuable time has  been lost, Wexford is able to pursue the case properly, but the lost time causes a lot of difficulty, and the people finally contacted are an odd mix, and they largely seem uninterested in being forthright and helping. In addition to the family and friends, the police here have to contend with some selfish, superior-acting people whose only concern is not getting "involved" with the police, even to the extent of giving them vital information, as well as a rather odd group of people who have formed their own church, and whose religious practices confound Wexford and staff. Plus, of course, Wexford has some personal distractions, and he has to address those at the same time. But the real Plus of this story is author Rendell's particular magic in presenting her characters and moving the story along. This writer is as good as they come in this genre, and it is such a pleasure to read her story, nearly everyone will enjoy it.  The true fan won't be able to put it down.  An absolute "must" for the mystery reader.
