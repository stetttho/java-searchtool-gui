 Some reviewers state there is no heros in this book - it's about the least objectionable person.  They are right.  It's thinly disguested Maxwell and Murdoch.  It's no wonder they sued to stop publicication of the work.  Each character has their share of sleeze.  Both were willing to do whatever it took to come out on top.  But neither had the good sense to recognize when they should let it go... and let the other ruin each other.  Indeed, ask yourself before the end - which man deserves to triumph.  The best of them, the worst of them, neither, or just one of them.  The answer might not be what you think.
