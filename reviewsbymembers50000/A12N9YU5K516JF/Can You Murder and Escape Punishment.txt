 Donald Lam was down-and-out.  He'd been a lawyer, but disbarred for his claim htat a client could commit a murder and escape prosecution.  So when he applied for a job with Berhta Cool's detective agency, he didn't expect much.  He argued that he was smart, and found ways to make those that teased him were made to regret it.
