 Hold the Dream is the sequel to "A Woman of Substance".  While it does document the next generation, the flaws are sort of obvious, and hold no real threat to the empire Emma Harte built.  Frankly, the threats Paula faces after taking control of the busines empire Emma built are pretty minor-leauge.  The betrayal of two cousins, the worthlessness of her Fairly husband, and a few problems along the way are nothing compared to Emma's struggles.    Indeed, I was left wondering if Paula's eventual decision to marry her lover Shane would work at all.  Would either be content with their own empire - or would each try to dominate the other.    I hope the novel was a bridge work to "to be the best",but I can't help but wonder at the wisdom of following AWOS any further.  I don't think it was worth it.
