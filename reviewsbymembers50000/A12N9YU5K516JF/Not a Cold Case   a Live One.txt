 The first job was simple.  Find the name of a man.  He was to get the name of a man who provided the plot of a book.  With just a few things to go on Donald Lam does exactly that - much to his frustration.  He provides that information to his client - the name of the man, the acts surprised when his client really wanted more.  Lam points out that if he was REALLY interested in the murder of the man, he made three big mistakes.  The first was not telling him, so Lam could cover his back trail.  The second was not telling him the man the police were interested in fit his description.  The third was not leaving a phone number so Donald could warn him that the police might just be interested in a private eye who was looking up a famous murder case.  Still, he was all business after that - pay him for the job.  However, his partner accepts a second job - find out if it is safe for the client to come back since the death of the only man who could identify him in the murder case.  It wasn't, but the man is arrested.  Still, even Lam's job as a jury consultant to a law school friend of his wasn't the key to the case - it was Donald's own legal knowledge and ability to bait a trap.  Maybe the real killer would never be prosecuted for it, but Donald's job was saving his client...
