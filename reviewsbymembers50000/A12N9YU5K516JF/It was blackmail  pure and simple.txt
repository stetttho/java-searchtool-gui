 Perry Mason was retained to protect the interests of the Bain family, who were being blackmailed with an audio confession of a crime they didn't commit.  Mason manages to erase the recording right out from under their nose, but then finds himself defending Hattie Bain on a murder charge. Mason's courtroom dramatics hit a high note when he produces a theory which changes the time of death, and puts an witness with an seemingly unshakeable alibi on the hot seat. Then the theory is collaborated with evidence overlooked by the police, and all hell is raised with the prosecutions theory of the case.
