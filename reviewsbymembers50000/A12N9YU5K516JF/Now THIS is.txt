 The second of the declassified series, this books is far superior to the first, and keeps the tension going as fast as Jack's heartrate.  Jack starts with a raid on a domestic militia group, but that same group has been tracking a terrorist sleeper cell.  Hour by hour the plot unfolds, with Jack trying to stop the events planned for the day.    The book only has one small problem, and that is with continuity.  The EMP weapon has been used on the TV show, and with a reduced range compared to the one in the book.  Still, the book is enjoyable, if somewhat pulp fiction, and fits into the world and theme of 24.
