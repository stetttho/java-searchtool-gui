 When Janice Wainwright shows up in Perry Mason's office with a suitcase full of money and a story of her employer being blackmailed, Perry, Della, and Janice start recording the numbers of as many bills as possible.  However, when her employer ends up murdered, the evidence points to Janice as a blackmailer and a killer.  Even more surprising, Perry Mason puts on no defense evidence, effectively betting Janice's life on one small detail, a detail which sets off a firestorm of legal fireworks and has Hamilton Burger spitting nails. This is a novel that defines Perry Mason; one where he goes up against a mountain of evidence, but finds a different analysis of it, combined with legal tactics which run circles around the district attorney.  Highly recommended.
