 The book consists of several short stories reflecting the range of Erle Stanley Gardner's interests.  The feature story is a Perry Mason novella, where he finds himself defending a woman accused of murdering the man the police claim was her lover.  She claims she doesn't know him, but she has his key on her keyring, nightgowns, lingerie, and even her toothbrush and toothpaste in his apartment.   Other stories revolve around the workings of a private detective working for a Chinese tong, a tale of a beaten man who comes to the desert, a clever jewel thief, and a private detective sharpshooting a case. The collection is a good read, reflecting the storytelling skills of Gardner in many different ways.
