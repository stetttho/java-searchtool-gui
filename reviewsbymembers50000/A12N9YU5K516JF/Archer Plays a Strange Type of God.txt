 Twins are seperated at birth.  One ends up in a family of wealth and priviledge - the other to a middle class family.  However, both are twins in many ways - they are both smart, like the same kind of girl, and are adept at their chosen paths of finance and criminal law.  Each also faces a common enemy - a character of low worth who is only out for himself.  Both sons of fortune find themselves married to a woman who loves them back - one an immigrant who had a secret; the other a scion of history.  Though they run against each other in a governor race, each respects each other enough to put politics aside in the favor of what is right.  Archer makes major mistakes in this well intended novel - one man would not defend his enemy in court in a heated political campaign.  Another is that marriage to a foreign born translates into citizenship is another - one man loves his Korean  born wife to death.  Plus AB blood type means somebody can take blood from anybody.  The sons find out their common blood via this, but it is a medical mistake.  However, I do agree with Archer's main point - that blood doens't matter much.  Both twins agree to keep their heritage secret.   Adopted or by blood, they had parents who loved them and cared for them - and raised them with all their love.  The only effect of their revealing the secret would be to destroy their families and loved ones.  Both are honorable men who put ambition apart from family in the end.
