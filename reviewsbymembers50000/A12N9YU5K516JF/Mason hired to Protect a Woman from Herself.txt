 Horace Wallen retained Perry Mason to protect his wife from somebody who was trying to blackmail her.  He provided a single clue, a fingerprint.  Mason investigates, only to find that Lorna Wallen, the wife of Horace, made the fingerprint in question. Mason reveals what he knows about the ways to deal with a blackmailer; pay off (never works; the blackmailer always wants more), go to the police (wise in some cases), or kill the SOB.  So he gets a police sketch of the blackmailer in question, then pays off to allow him to ditch the shadows of both the feds, and the government.   After the blackmailer ditches his witnesses / alibis, Mason simply has his sketch shown to witnesses of major crimes, and scores a match.  When shaken down for a "final payment", Mason just tells him that a police sketch identified him as an attempted killer.  The end result- the blackmailer is killed, but Mason's client is picked as the killer.   To win the case, Mason has to find the evidence require to both clear his client... and that of a witness tampering charge.  He does both, in his usual manner.
