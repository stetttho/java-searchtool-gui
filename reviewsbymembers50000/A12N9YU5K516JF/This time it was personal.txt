 D.A. Hamilton Burger is out for blood this time.  While investigating the return of a man missing for ten years, Mason sends Della Street out to interview the man before the police get there.  What happens?  When the man can't be found by the police, Della is charged with spiriting away a material witness.  Burger plans to convict her, then try Mason as an accessory, convict him, then institute disbarrment proceedings against him.  This will end Mason's career of legal dramatics and "outwitting the police". Mason doesn't care anything about a murdered man, a wounded man, or the missing man who is the prime suspect - all he cares about is aquitting Della Street.  And since Burger made it personal, Mason refuses to give the true solution to him during or after the trial. After all, if he did so, he'd be "outwitting the police" once again...
