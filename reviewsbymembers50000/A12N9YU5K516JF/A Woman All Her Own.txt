 Florentyna was an exceptional girl.  Born of immigrant Polish parents, one of whom become a powerful and wealthy businessman, she was tutored well, learned well, and trained well.  Until she threw it all away to marry the son of her father's most bitter enemy.  Richard Kane had also defied his father to marry his love, and the two were cast off without a cent into the world.  However, not only do they live on love, but they forge their own business empire in the process.  If Kane and Abel were rivals, but successes; only to see their greatest dream dashed at the hands of the other, Richard and Florentyna show what their father's might have achieved by working together.  Indeed, together they build the empire of both their father's dreams.  Both of their fathers recanted their hatred at the end, and they build together.  But eventually success at business bores Florentyna, and she goes into politics.    Florentyna is a success in many ways in politics.  Congress, then the Senate... and the White House?    Indeed, I don't know if the novel makes or breaks itself with the dirty tricks played at the end.  Florentyna made her biggest mistake when she didn't outright reject one offer.  Character wise, I think that is the biggest weakness of the novel.  Florentyna wasn't that stupid or naive.  Would it have hurt to have had her cave in if the man had outright lied (and still trapped her), and her serve her term as vice-president with no illusions about him?  PLus, I have to wonder if she, faced with the end of her career, wouldn't have conceeded defeat - and then dragged down certain people as well?
