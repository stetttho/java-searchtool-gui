 Robert Langston is a Harvard Professor of Art History.  It sounds pretty mundane, but this background will lead him into some extraordinary situations, beginning with his debut novel, Angels and Demons.  He is called in to aid the investigation of a high ranking CERN scientist - purportedly murdered by the Illuminati - a centuries old brotherhood with a grudge against the church.  Indeed, it is their time to strike, against the four cardinals most likely to be the next Pope, and against the Vatican, in the form of an antimatter bomb stolen from CERN.  Langston's knowledge leads him into a centuries old puzzle which is the key to stopping the plot.  He chases clue after clue and comes up with the right results... but still the identity of Janus, the hidden enemy who set the whole plot in motion is concealed until the end.  Dan Brown knows how to write thrillers.  Ordinary people in extraordinary situations is a good way to put it, but Langston has combined his knowledge of Art History with facts and fiction to produce his best book to date (better than the Da Vinci Code).
