 Of the three 24:  Declassified novels, this one is by far the best.  Jack gets involved, then uninvolved, then involed once again.  Tony has his own undercover assignment, and Nina, Jamey, and Milo all play key roles.  Even Edgar Stiles, introduced in season 4 has a cameo appearance.    There are many threads, but they all come together.  A dead Hollywood producer.  An assualt on a drug lab supposedly producing a new meth called Karma.  A modelling agency.  A Hollywood awards ceremoney Teri Bauer gets an invitation to attend.  A techno-terrorist, a papparazii photographer who discovers something strange about a pregnant actress, and a cult loyal only to a man named Hasan.    This is 24... always action packed, and a lot of fun, even if there are plot flaws or big coicindences.
