 Donald Lam was hired to verify a story of a client.  However, while he found evidence that confirmed the story, he found a real investigation didn't hold water.  What did that get him?  Disgrace, in bad with the police, a dissolution of his partnership, and a struggle to do his client some REAL service.    Indeed, while Lam's ethics are often thin in his adventures, he always was dedicated to his client.  The question is whether he could not only provide his client with the REAL service he needed (innocence on a murder charge), but also make a profit and be able to stroll into his office without being a murder victim himself - at the hands of Bertha Cool, his partner!
