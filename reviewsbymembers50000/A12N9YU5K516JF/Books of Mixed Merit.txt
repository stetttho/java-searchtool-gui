 The book I've read consists of several novellas, including the title novel.  Perry Mason finds himself with a client who has both intimate articles of clothing and other personal items inside the murdered man's secret apartment.  She also had been drugged, as had her roommate; a drug that would have been fatal if her aunt hadn't gotten a doctor in time.   Mason finds himself with a client facing a murder charge, and an attempted murder charge; the death of her supposed boy-friend, and the attempt on that of her roommate.  But he does have one clue... the lipstick kiss placed on the decendant's forehead.
