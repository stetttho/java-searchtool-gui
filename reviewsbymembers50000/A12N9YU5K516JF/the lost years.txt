 Michael Corleone is a complex man.  He never wanted his father's life, and his father never wanted it for him, but he became it.  The novel bridges the gap between the first book and the second movie, and a bit more.  Michael really wanted to go legitimate, and give up all the underworld power.  He tried, but his first attempt failed.    Plus the book gave us the insights as to why Fredo betrayed the family.  His plan was both nutty and logical.  Plus it gave reason as to why he was so weak (and a bixexual), but also managed to get an ex-Oscar winner as a beard , if nothing else.  In all, it did leave a LOT of room for a sequel.  For example, while the stage was set of Michael's children to progress (in Godfather 3), nothing was said for the death of Tom Hagen, or his children (important to Godfather 3), or the fate of Geraci.  Indeed, the weakest point of the novel was the exclusion of Frankie (Godfather 2 movie; as a capo, he deserved some time).  Peter Clemenza was disposed of well -  very much in line with his roles throughout all books and films.)  Finally, the novel harped too much on thinly  disguised people.  Yeah, the orginal had some thinly disguised people, but JFK?  His father?  Fran (Of Kukla, Fran, and Ollie)?   Sammy Davis Jr (a black jew?).
