 The book Debt of Honor questions whether the Japanese accepted surrender at the end of WWII, of if it was just a retreat.  Honor and Saving Face means much to the Japanese culture, and, if like in many Clancy novels, if they were pushed "one step closer", could they gain an upper hand and threaten war once again? To fully appreciate the situation in Debt of Honor, the full political and military ramificaitons of Clancy's works must have come true - ICBM nuke disarmament, and a general reduction of war forces of both sides of the eastern block and NATO.   So if Japan becomes a nuclear power, and takes over Guam, could the US respond - especially if their financial situation is thrown into chaos via computer "virus" - or deliberate trap?   I don't agree with several of Clancy's postulates, such as ICBM disarmement (in face of the China threat), or a President putting a member of the opposite political party in the VP slot (as happened to Jack Ryan in the book).  While perhaps necessary for future novels (such as Execute Orders), Jack Ryan's accendency to the Presidency is needed, politicians and congress members would reject a VP like Jack, since he would be a heartbeat away from the top job.  However, the book is a satifying work of fiction well worth the read.
