 I read this book looking forward to an insightful view of an industry - the in the tradition of Airport, Hotel, Moneychangers, and many more.  What I read was Hailey's weakest book.  While his statement and theme of an independent press is good, the story cracks in many places.  If Hailey can't do better than this, he should fish in Bermuda and retire from writing.
