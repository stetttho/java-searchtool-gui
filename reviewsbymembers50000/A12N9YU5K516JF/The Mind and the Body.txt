 What do you get when you mix a helpless master criminologist and crime scene professional who only wants out of life, with a "portable" - a beautiful woman officer who does her best to protect a crime scene - making a politically unpopular move to stop a train in the process?  The answer is Amelia and Lincoln - an unlikely mix of brains and talent - and different kinds of smarts.  With a serial kidnapper and killer on the loose, Lincoln suddenly has a reason to live, and Amelia is shoved into the position of his eyes and ears - walking the crime scenes herselft.   The killer is leaving clues to his NEXT crime at each scene... a challenge for both.  But Lincoln's motives isn't what it seems... nor is many of the other characters...
