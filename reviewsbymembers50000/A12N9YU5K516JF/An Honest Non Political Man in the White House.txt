 Jack Ryan is doing his best.  He took the opportunity to become Vice-President as his way out of government service - he'd serve, then retire to teaching.  But then things went wrong, and the President, most of Congress, the Supreme Court, and the cabinet were killed in a terrorist action.  Jack Ryan finds himself the head of the country - a job he never wanted. Faced with being the most important President since George Washingon, he faces a press who thinks he is playing by political rules, an enemy in the middle East who is out to cripple the country, and an ex-Vice President who claims he never really resigned.   The middle-east thinks he's weak because he won't crush political enemies.  The press pounces on him because he is being honest in a political world of dishonesty.  His enemies think it's the right time to cripple the country - with an attack on the country, and an attack on his daughter.   The question Clancy asks is clear - could another man, faced with a devestation of the American political system, rise to the occassion and reject tyrnany and kingdom over democratic law.  Plus, could he, if faced with terrible domestic and foreign policy issues, make the right choices to combat threats, both foreign and domestic.   Executive Orders put Jack Ryan, an honest man who served his country the best he could, in the position of being President.  He wanted strict constituational law, but was willing to take a step beyond it (in preventing free travel in the wake of germ warfare crisis) - and very willing to be impeached and removed from office as a cost of his decision.   Jack Ryan is the hero of the everyday man - somebody who understands the world and the threats, and is willing to admit his weakness in domestic affairs.  When facing rebuilding the government, he wants people who really know what the real world is like.  In the end, he neither wants or craves power - he just wants to do what he thinks is the right thing.
