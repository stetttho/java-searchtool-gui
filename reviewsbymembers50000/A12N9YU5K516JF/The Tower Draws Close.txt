 but the Gunslingers have split into three.  Susannah and Mia have fled to New York in 1999, taking Black 13 with them to seal the door behind them.  Yet the door can still be opened by the Manni.  However, while they can open the door, Ka intrevenes and yanks the Gunslingers to the opposite of their intended destinations.   Roland and Eddie find themselves sent to Maine in 1977 - and smack in the middle of an ambush.  Can they survive and track down Calvin Tower - and convince him to sell the vacant lot to protect the Rose?  And what other important person awaits them and Ka? In 1999, Susannah and Mia put each other in mutual deathgrips over the fate of the demon-baby.  Mia can't function in New York, and Susannah needs information about the unwelcome visitors to her body.  The answers lead to the revelation of the true father of the baby - and the horrid birthing chamber needed to protect all three lives. Meanwhile, Jake, Callahan, and Oy find themselves on the more dangereous mission of tracking down Susannah and Mia in New York, 1999.  Jake's touch can help - but can he find the clues left by Susannah during the few times she was free of Mia?  Callahan is no gunslinger, and Jake is only a kid, but both prepare to face their destiny against the vampires and the low men. Most shocking of all is the fate of somebody very important to the Tower - one hinted at in book 5, and brought fully to life - and a reported death.   In the end, will anybody be left to guide the remaining gunslingers to the dark tower - and know that the underlying sickness is known - can they do anything to save it?
