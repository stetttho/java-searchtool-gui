 Nothing new (after 7 books) is in Bernard's Crossing, Massuchutes.  A faction wants the Rabbi out, a faction wants him to stay, and the Rabbi David Small wants to be loyal to his faith.    This time the president of the temple is rich and powerful, and his daughter wants to marry a Christian.  It's political - the young man is going for an office in a republican district once he gets inside information that the incumant can't run due to poor health.  The rebel daughter of the Jewish temple present runs his campaign, and plots to be both the power behind the throne and married by a rabbi.  Despite a huge raise in salary given by the president of the temple, Rabbi David Small refuses to marry his daughter- or allow another Rabbi to do so in his territory.  Because the Rabbi David Small won't sell his beliefs for money - or his decective skills either.
