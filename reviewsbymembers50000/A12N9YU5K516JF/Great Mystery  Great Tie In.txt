 Grave Matters is a great mystery novel, and ties in well with the TV series.  As usual, there are two cases.  One is when a medical examiners calls the CSIs in because deaths are happening a little too frequently in an assisted care facility.  The other is when a court order forces the rest of the team to investige the death of a political big-wig's murder - by the daughter, who names her step-father.    The care facility death shows death by injection of air - murder, which is investigated.  But that doesn't compare to what the other CSI team finds in the casket of the deceased woman - somebody else entirely, which means somebody else is a killer who picked the perfect hiding spot for a body...
