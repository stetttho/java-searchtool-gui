 Mason's client has a problem.  He comes home to find barbed wire strung through his house, a sexy woman in a bikini on the one side, complete with a court order allowing her to be there - and himself out of half of his own house.  It seems the man who built the house put it partly on his own, and partly on his wife's separate property with the assurance he'd get clear title.   Things get worse when the man ends up dead with a knife in his back - in his client's side of the house.  Caught in a tangle, his client refuses to give his story to everybody - including Mason.  It's up to Perry to clear his client's name by creating reasonable doubt - and capitalizing on a mistake by the prosecuting attorney.
