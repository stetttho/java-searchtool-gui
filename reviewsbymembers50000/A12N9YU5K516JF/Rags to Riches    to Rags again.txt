 Grisham explores many aspects of the legal system in the United States.  In this case, it is the system of mass torts, with the protaganist telling an unlikely story of how he stumbled upon a fairly small tort case, which led to an even bigger one, and his subsequent fall into massive ligitation cases... and the pitfalls.  Almost all aspects of mass torts and the fallout are explored.  Certainly Clay (the proteganist) is seduced into a system of greed and money. The victims are also shown - the victims of mass ligigation and the ultimate problems with that as well.  Even doctors and drug companies have their say, with prescriptions of drugs which have great benefit, but often have side-effects as well.  Ultimately, I have to side with the drug companies, who, despite the drawbacks of drug, are ultimately trying to do great benefit to society in their attempts to fight disease or extend life.  For a good alternative, read Strong Medicine by Arthur Hailey.  Nobody benefits with good drugs with lethal side effects.  Nobody benefits with no new drug developments that don't have some side effects.    In the end, the best result is lost in the legal battle.  All drugs have side effects.  However, the cost of single cases verses class actions also have a side effect.  I don't know the right way to go forward - and nobody else does either.  Both sides have powerful lobbiest groups.
