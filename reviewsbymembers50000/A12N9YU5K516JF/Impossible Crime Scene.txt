 Strangely, I looked at the story from the scientific version.  The victim was beautiful, blond, great body, had strangulation marks (not the cause of death), was politically connected (wife of a power broker for the President), and the scene was impossibly clean.  No hair, no fiber, sheets on the bed were clean, carpet was clean, fingernails were clean, sex organs were clean.  Even one of the two bullets that killed her were missing (dug out of a wall; the other was in her brain).  Plus, the place was looted.  Vault found was emptied of money and jewels.  The victim's jewelry was gone as well.  But the evidence showed the thief got in with a combo to the alarm system, and exited via a rope for the bedroom.    The detective involved was frustrated...  a totally clean crime scene - no evidence, no witness, no motive.    Shift back to the early chapters and a true rendition of what happened.  The President and the young wife of a power broker were going to have sex - at a country estate of hers.  As the thief watched from their vault, the President tried kinky sex which was met with violence, which was matched... and ulimately it was her or his life... at which point the secret service entered, and shot the woman.  The President's chief of staff ordered the secret service to destroy all evidence.    Shift back to a lawyer... engaged to be married to a power broker's daughter.  A friend of the man who saw it all - despite the hatred of his daughter.  Trusted with evidence the President orders destoryed - over dead bodies...
