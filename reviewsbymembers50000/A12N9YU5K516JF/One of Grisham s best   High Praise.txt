 Rudy Baylor has nothing.  He delivered pizzas and waited tables to get through college and law school.  He passed the bar, and got his licence - and one interesting case in a throwaway class in his last year at law school.  Circumstances force him into ambulance chasing with a man who never passed the bar.  But Rudy's one case is legal dynamite.  His clients were the victims of a bad-faith case that is textbook.  He has the dirt, and has the witnesses that has the dirt.  He has a favorable judge.  He is even smart enough to know how to turn the defendent's high priced lawyers into unwitting shills for his case.  Maybe being a rookie with nothing to lose worked in his favor.  He had no money, no professional reputation, or anything else to lose.  The trial scenes are amazing.  The green kid, the rookie, absolutely humilates the defendants, as well as the best legal defense money can buy.  Trust me, they wre rueing the day that he was ever born.    Yeah, Grisham rigged the facts, the evidence, and everything to favor the rookie... in short a case any trial lawyer would love, combined with the favorable judge.  It's still fun.  I have to say though, if Grisham could rig the trial in Baylor's favor, he could rig the outcome.  Maybe the point is that his client got the justice she deserved, I have to feel her lawyer should have walked away from it all with the money.  Still, he got the girl - and maybe that was enough.  Along with the knowledge he quit being on top.
