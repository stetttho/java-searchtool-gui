 Penniless immigrant; or scion of an established family, the American dream is for the taking.  Immigrant Abel had faced horrors in his past, but rose to fortune though hard work and seizing of opportunities.  William Kane was born to money, but he took his small stakes, coupled with his intelligence, upbringing, and education, made it into a million before he graduated from college.  Abel had to make his money well after that.  Part rags to riches, part Romeo and Juliet, all interesting, Kane and Abel document the birth, life, and death of two very different men who are both successes, but also end up destroying each other's greatest dream in a senseless feud born of ignorance.    The saga spans over 60 years, and constrasts Kane's easy life and born duty, with Abel's hard life, and struggle to forge his own destiny.  However, the two men are very much more alike than different.  Both are driven to win in their own way.  In their own way, each lives out his destiny.  They also each also destroy the other's ultimate dream in a battle of power and hatred.  The irony is that battle never needed to be fought if they both had a little more information.  This also contrasts with another theme of the novel - what could they have achieved by working together as friends instead of enemies?  Ulimately, it is not for them to decide, but for their children.  Richard is his father's son; Flornentya her father's daughter.  Does their love form a bond between their families - or an even greater rift with neither parent willing to admit they might have been wrong?
