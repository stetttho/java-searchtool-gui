 Harry's back, but he's not having fun.  He's not even at Hogwarts before he's attacked, threatened with expulsion, has his reputation smeared by the Ministry of Magic and the Daily Prophet, and sent off to a secret society that provides no answers to his questions.  Hogwarts treats him no better; Hagrid isn't there, Dumbledore barely acknowledges him, and the new defense against the dark arts teacher refuses to provide practical lessons - then proceeds to terrorize the school with her harsh and restrictive rules.  Even his budding relationship with Cho Chang runs hot and cold.   All this plus Snape's and Malfoy's usual treatment of him pushes him to the breaking point in the fifth book in the series, and Harry spends most of his time frustrated and angry at the forces that are ruining his life.  With his usual outlet of Quidditch denied him, his only refuge is leadership of his own secret - and rule-breaking - society of students dedicated to learning to fight the dark arts. Despite the costs, Harry is willing to put it on the line to fight for what he believes in - even if it means a direct confrontation between himself and his friends against Lord Voldermort and his Death Eaters.  In the end, victory is his, but this time the price might be higher than Harry is willing to pay... Major secrets regarding the past history between Voldemort and Harry are revealed, as well as a few about the Dursleys.  Harry learns many harsh truths in this episode, including the fact that many people he looked up to weren't as perfect as he thought, and others he despises may have some right on their side.  In all, worth the wait it took to come out.
