 When the fate of humans is at stake, Card pulls no punches in a realistic effort to duplicate what desperate measures call for - an early identification of a master strategist who refuses to accept defeat.  Through Ender's story, and the men monitoring him, we learn all the lessons of strategy and command; and how to grab every available resource.  At first, he realizes gravity has no meaning in a null-gravity situation.  Upon promotion and denied an opportunity to learn, he trains with a sub-class, defying convention.  When he first disobeys stupid commands, he turns defeat into stalemate.  When a sub-leader recognizes his value, but the commander doesn't, he turns a suicide mission into a strategic advantage for his army.  When he is finally given command, he throws out the rulebook in favor of what works.   Ultimately, his genius is not just by understanding strategies and tactics that work but also how to utlitze other people in his favor.  He trains his subcommanders how to lead and recognize strategic and tactical opportunites, but also gains their respect as a commander.  When the wargames are rigged more and more against his favor, he simply responds by adopting new, innovative, and effective methods against his enemeies.   I found the end-game predictable, but beyond the military victory, I found a kind of solice.  Ender never really wanted to beat an enemy; he wanted them to stop fighting and live in peace.  Perhaps that is the true genius of Ender's Game - he never wanted war, but when forced into it, he played to win the war forever.   I haven't read the sequels, but I hope in them Ender focuses his mind toward creating peace instead of war.  There is just as much strategy in winning a cold war and living in peace as there is to a hot war and fighting with many dead on each side.
