 The automotive industry in the early 1970s - a time of race relations as well as car-builidng is ripe for Hailey's book.  Sure, several parts of it are hacked on (particularly, the automotive dealer part of the book), but the insights are good.    Hailey does his research and always comes up with the idea that there are no easy answers.  Hopefully, the reader understand that in the end, and realizes the world is full of compromises, not easy answers.
