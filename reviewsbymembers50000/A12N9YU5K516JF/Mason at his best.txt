 Nadine Farr was a troubled young woman.  Under the treatment of Dr. Denair, she revealed under drugs that she had killed her uncle with cyanide, then tossed the bottle into a lake, weighed down with shotgun shot.  Unfortunately for her and her doctor, there was a tape recording of the drug-induced interview... and the nurse's boy-friend was a police detective. Dr. Denair laid out his problem to Perry Mason, who put together a plan to carefully investigate the matter.  In the end, he recovered the bottle from the lake... and it only contained a harmless sugar substitute. However, the nurse blabbed to her boy-friend, and the police became interested.  Then the D.A. found a SECOND bottle in the lake, filled with cyanide.  Mason found himself stuck with a client who had confessed under drugs to a crime... and found himself accused of tossing one of the bottles into the lake.   It all comes down to a legal showdown as to whether the drug-induced confession, combined with the recovered bottle, can be admitted as evidence.  Surprisingly, Mason reverses position and agrees to allow it all in evidence, despite the strong legal arguments which could prohibit it.  It's the trap he puts Hamilton Burger in, and clears both himself and his client in the clear.
