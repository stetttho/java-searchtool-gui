 Sgt. Sellers has a bone to pick with Donald Lam even before the case begins.  It seems an armored car robbery netted a robber $100,000, but Sellers only recovered $50,000 of it.  The crook claims Sellers took the rest of it.  His clues led him to a woman who had the address of Cool and Lam in her purse.  Donald had never heard of her before, and tells Sellers that - but while in conference the woman in question shows up. Meeting her in secret, he learns she wants him to track down $60,000 she claims her ex-boy-friend was going to settle with her on.  It's a case Donald doesn't like, but agrees to take. Donald finds $50,000 without much trouble, and even figures out a way to ship it back to his office without detection, but then finds himself in the middle of a murder case - and worse still, the $50,000 disappeared somewhere along the way.  It takes all of his skill to figure out the clues while still being detained by the police - and held under "protective custody" in a hotel room.
