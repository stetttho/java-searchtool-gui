 Kidd isn't exactly a hero.  He's a thief and an outlaw... but he doesn't consider himself as such.  Still, his computer hacking and thief skills puts him in the position of the most powerful person in the United States... the person with the data so powerful he could blackmail or control the person in power...  It is exactly what he does.  He recovers the computer with the informaation overload so deadly to so many people.  He shows it's power when his longtime friend and lover Luann is caught.  He uses it when everything goes wrong as well.    Kidd isn't a hero, but he isn't an anti-hero either. He is out for himself in a world of corruption and greed, with himself as either the victim or the guy who profits from the greed of others.
