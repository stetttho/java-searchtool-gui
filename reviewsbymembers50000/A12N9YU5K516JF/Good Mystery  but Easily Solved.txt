 I like the Rabbi Small mysteries, because they are classic who-dun-it stories, and often give an insight into Jewish law and temple politics.  If there is a problem with them, it is that Kemelman tends to beat people over the head with clues, and sometimes the police work is less than stellar.  This mystery is one of those cases.  The real problem is that a serious examination of the crime scene shows the police theory was all wet.  The facts were that the victim was shot dead-on, and a clock (providing the "time of death") was also shot.  The altered timepiece is a classic of detective fiction, but since it has been so widely used, the clue was obvious.  Also weak was the evidence which got the killer.  Surely somebody who wiped the clock clean of fingerprints would also have wiped the key used to alter the clock in the first place.  However, the motive is where everything falls down.  The new (unsigned) will the victim's lawyer drew up acknowledged he had a blood son.  Once that fact was out, there was no way the killer could inherit the victim's money.  The Rabbi's conclusions were good, but a good CSI would have had half the case solved.
