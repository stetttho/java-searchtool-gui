 Overall the book concept is good, and it tries to be faithful to the format of the TV show in that each chapter is an hour long, events occur in real time, and there is a hook to the ending of each chapter.  Even the plot is good; using a surface to air missle to destroy a CDC plane and thus dump the virus over New York City.   What bothered me is that many of the events of the books would seem to take a lot less time than portrayed in the book.  Thus some events and situation seem long, compared to the time frame.    Still, it's a good read of another adventure of Jack Bauer.
