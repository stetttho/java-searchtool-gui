 Frances was accustomed to doing things her way.  However, under the terms of her father's spendthrift trust, she was powerless to marry until age 25 unless she risked being cut out completely.  She retained Perry Mason to break the will, despite it's iron-clad terms which gave her uncle absolute power over the fortune in the trust. The will did leave a loophole - if her uncle died before the terms expired, Frances would get the money absolutely.  So it was completely in her favor when Frances's uncle was murdered - until she found herself as the prime suspect.   This was Mason's first recorded trial, though not the first book (The Case of the Velvet Claws was the first, and had no trial scene).  He handles it expertly, but it all comes down to a typical Perry Mason trick to confuse a witness.  It works, but not as well as some of his later works.
