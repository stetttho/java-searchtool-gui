 The buried clock was 25 minutes slow... or was it 35 minutes fast?  Mason's explanation of the time difference was that it was keeping sidereal, or star time, which gains 4 minutes a day.  He played it up big in the newspapers  to create a juristication battle between two counties, but the clock disappeared, the juristication was settled, and Mason's client went on trial for the murder of her embezzling husband. The circumstantial evidence was tight, and Mason's only hope was to try and introduce the clock, once again found buried and set on sidereal time.  However, there was no legal doctrine he could find to introduce it into evidence... until Mason realized he'd walked into his own baited trap.
