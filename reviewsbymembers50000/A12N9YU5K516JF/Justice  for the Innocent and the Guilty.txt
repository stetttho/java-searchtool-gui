 The book documents certain cases of Gardner's "Court of Last Resort".  This court is the highest of the land, which Gardner felt was not the Supreme Court of the United States, but the court of the people of America.  The book documents several cases of men who found themselves tried and convicted of crimes.  In many cases, they were innocent.  In other cases, they were guilty.  Gardner's task force served the cause of justice. What is most astounding about this book is the insights as to how things go around and come around.  In this case, Gardner argues against life/no parole sentences for "habitual criminals".  50 years later we see the same kind of laws passed, life/no parole for "3 strikes" offenders.  Right or wrong, it's just another issue that resurfaced in a different form.
