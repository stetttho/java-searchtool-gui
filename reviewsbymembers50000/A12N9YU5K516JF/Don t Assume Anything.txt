 Twisted puts the mind of Jeffrey Deaver against the reader.  He's got some stories to tell, ones that will shock people - once they read it to the end.    One of the best stories is Triangle, where there is a classic three person love story when a male plots to get rid of the other man who loves the same woman he does.  Another great bit is "Lesser Included Offenses", which documents a prosecuter's battle with a man who can't afford a prison term - but can afford to bribe and threaten witnesses.  Finally, in a Rhymes / Sachs story, he tells the tale of a Christmas present - given by the team to a woman who fears her mother was abducted.  Turns out, her mom was just fine all along.  But while the evidence might have pointed to an innocent explanation, after it was all over the mother learned the truth - she was going to be the victim of a violent crime by her so-called boyfriend.
