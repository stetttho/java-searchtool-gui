 Mason's client was angry.  A rival art dealer had proclaimed a work he had sold was a forgery.  He wanted to sue for slander.  Mason told him he didn't want to do that.  If he did that, the papers would carry the story about the art dealer was accused of fraud.  Instead, Mason suggested that the dealer's client sue for devaluing the painting in question. Everything appears to be going well, with the witness giving her deposition, and art experts authenticating the painting.  But then the witness takes a run-out powder, the art critic ends up dead, and Mason is faced with defending a client against a mountain of evidence.
