 Can somebody put a price on the Declaration of Independence?  Saddam Hussain has - 100 million dollars.  A criminal syndicate accepts the job and sets into motion an ingenious plan to replace the document with a masterful forgery.  The plan works perfectly - and Hussain proceeds to deface the document in private and destroy it in public - on July 4th, with the world watching.  However, the theft is discovered, and it's up to an American agent, with the help of a placed Mossad spy to do the impossible - steal it back right out of Saddams inner sanctum.    It's an enjoyable tale of two incredible thefts, though I have to confess I saw the big twist at the end coming from a long ways away, with robbed some of the enjoyment.  Still, it's a good read.
