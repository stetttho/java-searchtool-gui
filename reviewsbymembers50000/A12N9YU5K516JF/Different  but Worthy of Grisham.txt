 John Grisham has published legal thrillers for years.  This time, he's returned to the roots of his first book (A Time To Kill) with a minor character, and a different perspective, both from the hero, and the time (1970 - 1979).   The hero in question is a journalist... though perhaps a failed one.  He couldn't hack it in college, and went to the small town of Clanton, Mississippi.  His boss was probably mentally reduced in any case - it was all about the obits.  When they are dead, glorify them.  When the paper goes into bankruptcy, our hero gets a loan from his grandmother to buy it... and thus his story.  It's a tale of a small town, with legal justice, blacks who made good, a powerful local boy who went bad, a trial, different churches, and good ole boy justice.  After all, somebody is killing off the powerful and weathly son of a clan who got released... after a conviction for murder and rape.    In then end I do relate to the first person of the story.  He reported, he published, he fit in, he served the community.  In the end, he sold out, but only for a high price... and I think he deserved the money and the luxuries it bought him.  He gave a lot  to build up the paper - over 9 years.
