 Arthur Hailey was a great man.  He provided insights into so many industries.  Perhaps he got the best commercial works out of Airport and Hotel, but his commentary on other works was his greatest legacy.  Don't get me wrong - Hotel and Airport were great works.  The looked into the problems of those industries.  He books contained great merit; the adaptations to screen showed a big disater movie (Airport... and then Airplane).  Strong Medicine was his look into the ethical drug world, with all it's triumphs and problems.  Medical breaktrhoughs in drugs are not without their costs.  Can some drugs lead to harmful side-effects?  Yes.  Can some drugs be helpful to men and science?  Yes.  Can the FDA both cause good drugs to be delayed, and catch harmful drugs before they hit?  Yes.  Arthur Hailey is a master of industry reseach.  He understood no industry was without it's drawbacks and costs, and well as it's advancement to mankind.  Strong Medicine shows both sides at their very best.  Drug companies want the best ethical drugs they can make - but they are also not immune from making mistakes about their strong medicne.
