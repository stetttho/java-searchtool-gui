 I've read most of Jeffrey Archer's works.  I first got hooked on his short stories, with their twists.  Since then, I've read everything I could get my hands on.  All have twists, but some were no surprise to me, while other's really caught me off guard.  This one caught me off guard.  It was a fascinating story of how several different men came together to try and recover their losses from a con man.  The con man in question, a Harvey Metcalf, knew what he was doing.  He set up a company with the sole intent of defrauding the public, but in a clever enough way to never get caught at it.  However, four men, a Oxford Professor, an Art Gallery Owner, a Harley Street Doctor, and an English Lord with a taste for the ladies, the biggest victims, meet with the goal of getting their losses back.  Three of them come up with scams of their own in a few weeks; all designed to con the con artist.  The fourth, the English Lord, can't come up with one, though his talent as an actor plays a great part in the other scams.  However, his girlfriend / fiance'  / wife DOES come up with one... and THAT scam is the biggest twist of the novel.  "Not a Penny More, Not a Penny Less" is an apt title - the defrauded men want nothing more back than their money - plus all expenses they incur recovering them.  Do they get it?  Can they end up with their account in balance?  The short answer is no - they were still owed $1.24 at one point... but that changed overnight....
