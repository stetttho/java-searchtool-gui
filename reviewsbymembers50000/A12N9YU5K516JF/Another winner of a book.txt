 Mark Fuhrman's book on the Spokane prostitute murders provides a solid insight on the way - and the way NOT - to conduct a homicide investigation.   The book chronicals the history of the prostitute slayings, police actions, and Fuhrman's insights into the case.  Fuhrman points out where police errored in their decisions, and provides his own tips on how to better run an investigation into catching a serial killer.  He makes good cases for both more public information, and continues the theme of his previous books into how proper investigation techniques can be used to solve any crime.   The Spokane police eventually caught the killer through a lot of hard work.  Furhman Monday morning quarterbacks the investigation, showing how the killer could have been caught two years earlier.  While this might seem presumptious coming from most, I've already given Fuhrman credit where credit is due for his work documented in "Murder in Greenwich".   The book is a good read, and I look forward to his next.  In the future, I'd kind of like to see a book from him with a collection of difficult crimes that efficient and proper police investigation managed to crack.
