 Take the book for what it is - an attempt to capitalize on the huge success of the TV show.  The plot centers around Faith, a crash survivor who had been a PHD candidate in biology (particularly snakes).  Chapters alternate between her backstory, which contain the same elements as the main characters, and her first few days on the island.  She has minor interactions with the main cast, as the survivors struggle through the first few days.  People who wish to read the book should understand a few things.  First, the story and backstory of the main characters are pretty much reserved for the TV show.  No new information about them will be revealed.  Second, Faith has the same kind of flaws as the main cast, which ties into the main story.  Third, the plot of Faith's backstory is predictable.  What the book does provide is a look at the show's first few days from a different perspective.  Faith does useful things, such as recover luggage, and has her own encounters with the wildlife on the island.  This was the most interesting part of the book.
