 It's 1966, and Adam Scott received 500 pounds and an envelope in his father's will.  The envelope contained the key to his family's lost honor, and leads to an item in the vault of a Swiss bank - a Russian icon thought lost, that also contains a secret.  The secret is so powerful, the KGB will do anything to get it's hands on it.  A top agent is assigned unlimited resources.  When Adam retrieves the icon moments ahead of him, he suddenly finds his girlfriend dead, and himself on the run from the KGB, the CIA, British Intelligence, and the Swiss police.  Armed with only a small amount of money and his own wits, can he survive the hunt - and restore his family's lost honor?  There is no doubt his novel heavily influenced Dan Brown (Da Vinci Code), as the elements of a hunted man, an enemy with only a code name, and a hero who seizes opportunities all come into play.
