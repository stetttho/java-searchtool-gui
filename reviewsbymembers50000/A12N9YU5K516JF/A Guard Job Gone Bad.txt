 It's was Bertha Cool's job.  She was to insure nobody gate crashed a party.  It was added security for an apartment that had already been robbed once.  Between Bertha Cool and an x-ray scan installed in the elevator, nobody was going to steal anything from the client's collection of artifacts. However, despite the precautions, two items did end up missing - a 6 foot blowgun, and a valuable jade figurine.  It was up to Donald Lam to figure out just how these items were stolen - and how to retrieve them. Figuing out how a 6-foot blowgun and a jade figurine were stolen despite Bertha and the x-ray machine, and then retrieving them was an easy task for Donald Lam.
