 This is Clancy at his best.  There are costs to everything.  On the far right, there is the side-effects and pitfalls of a military war on drugs (Clear and Present Danger).  On the far left, there is radical environmentalists (who consider humans a parasite on planet Earth who should be destroyed).   What Clancy really writes about is the costs involved in any kind of political change, and the dangers of extremists.  Clancy always takes very real political situations one step further.  Is it right for radical Muslims to promote nuclear war (The Sum or All Fears).  Is it right for radical enviormentalists to commit genocide (Rainbow Six). Plus, what would happen if an honest, non-political man found himself in the position of George Washington - faced with rebuilding the government from the ground up - but with a press who was so used to lies and political posturing they didn't know how to deal with an honest man who was doing his best (Executive Orders).   What I would believe is somebody who admits there are no easy answers.  The far left would undermine national security; the far right would eliminate privacy rights.  Clancy solutions are often poetic justice (the wacko enviromentalists being forced to live in the jungle without ANY technology from a knife to clothing - all that was part of technology, not nature, plus a drug lord, which the US decided they had no legal right to keep, being delivered to his opposition in Columbia).
