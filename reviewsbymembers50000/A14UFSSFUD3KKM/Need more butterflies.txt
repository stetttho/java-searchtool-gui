 My 2 1/2 yr old loves this game. She even picks them up and puts them back in the elephant to start a new game. It does blow the butterflies out fast. It would be nice to have more butterlies especially if more than 1 child is playing. We had 3 kids playing all at around 2-3 yrs old. They had trouble actually catching them in the net. So we played it where they picked them up off the floor becasue they were getting frusterated that they weren't catching any.I might try to make some more butterflies out of tissue/crete paper. That's all it is anyway.
