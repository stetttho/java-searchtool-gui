 WE BOUGHT THIS AFTER OUR VICKS COOL MIST HUMIDIFIER CAUGHT ON FIRE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AFTER 2 WEEKS OF USE. iT WORKS GOOD. iT WORKS SO GOOD THAT WE USUALLY HAVE TO TURN IT OFF BEFORE MORNING BECAUSE IT GETS TO HOT IN MY BABIES ROOM. IT IS VERY QUIET AND CAN HARDLY HEAR IT, BUT THE MIST COMING OUT STINKS LIKE A PIG FARM! IT HAS SMELLED THIS WAY SINCE THE FIRST NIGHT WE USED IT. WE HAVE BEEN WAITING TO SEE IF IT WOULD GO AWAY AFTER  SOME USE-MAYBE A NEW PLASTIC SMELL. IT HAS BEEN 2 WEEKS AND IT STILL SMELLS. WE WILL RETURN IT TODAY. I HAVEN'T HAD MUCH LUCK WITH VICKS PRODUCTS. I WILL PROBABLY TRY A DIFFERENT BRAND.
