 My daughter has enjoyed the kick and play bouncer since the day we brought her home. She is now 5 months old and still plays in it every day. The vibrate is a nice feature for most babies, however mine did not care for it. But she LOVES the lights and toys and kicking to get them activated. I purchased one today for a friend. Excellent buy!!!
