 My 2yr old daughter received the playskool shopping cart with the scanner and we had to change the batteries 3 times in 3 days. I exchanged the scanner for a new one and it still does the same thing...Drains the batteries and the beeps don't stop long enough to scan another item. I decided to purchase this one becasue I knew my daughter would enjoy the front fold down seat for her baby dolls.(Just like a real one)She pushes it all around the house. The back of the cart is deep enough to hold all her groceries. I highly recommend this cart.
