 This seat doesn't cover the whole grocery cart and doesn't seem to be very comfortable. It is also not easy to place in the cart while holding your baby. I recently bought a similar seat by infantino called Shop & Play. There is a removeable pillow for the back of the cart which my daughter loves-I'm sure those carts can get uncomfortable after awhile. It covers the whole back and handle of the cart with leg holes that have flaps for babies legs to rest on. There are three toys which are over the handle to entertain baby and easy to roll up while holding baby. I bought it at Wal-Mart for just a little more than this seat, but well worth it for the extras.
