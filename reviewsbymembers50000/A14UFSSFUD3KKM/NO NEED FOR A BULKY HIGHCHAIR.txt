 This is the best purchase. We were using a highchair which is always in the way and the cover was not machine washable-why would you make a cover that WILL get filthy not machine washable?? We bought this seat after seeing that it got such good ratings. We agree with everybody else. I like that the cushion and the straps are EASY TO REMOVE and are MACHINE WASHABLE. My daughter is 10 months old and we just push this up to the table. We use the tray when she is eating, but in our kitchen chair we have room between her booster seat and the back of the kitchen chair to store the tray when not in use. Another plus is that the seat and tray are dishwasher safe. The seat of the chair is so easy to pop off and wipe clean. This chair has less "crannies" for food to get stuck. We tried a different booster seat before this one and returned it because it was to complicating to put together and pain to clean. This one is so easy to wipe down! It's also easy to remove and strap onto chairs- we take ours to family gatherings. I wish I knew about this before I spent so much money on a highchair. We still would have saved money and could have bought one of these for home and grandma's house. I Highly recommend.
