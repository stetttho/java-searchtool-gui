 The first time I wore it I felt uncomfortable and not sure how to place the shoulder strap and felt like the baby would fall out.My baby was only days old at that time. I tried it again as my baby got to about 4 weeks of age and it felt like it fit her better. She LOVES it and falls asleep to the motion. I wear it when I go shopping and she snoozes the whole time.She does seem to get hot easy, but I keep the top part unsnapped. I didn't try breast feeding in it, but I can't imagine it being very helpful. I can't imagine many newborn carriers being any better than this one-they all seem to position the baby the same way. This item is worth having, but in general ALL newborn slings can use better comfort for the person wearing it.
