 I did a lot of research on car seats before purchasing one. Overall, the Triumph 5 had the best ratings and I agree! My daughter is now 10 months old and is very tall for her age. We still have her in rear facing comfortably. We like that you adjust the straps on the side. Many car seats have it on the front which makes it difficult to adjust rear facing. It also has the same protective foam as the britax only this seat has a better price tag. My daughter loved it since day one. She can sleep in it much better than the infant seat we had for her. The "memory" system really works! I never have to adjust the shoulder straps. They are always the same unless they need to be readjusted to account for a heavier coat. I highly recommend this car seat. I had read a review from a lady involved in  a bad accident and her child had minor scratches. This car seat saved the child! Everybody else was hospitalized. We briefly debated on buying a cheaper seat for my husbands truck, but we like this seat so much we are going to purchase another one. When you go shopping for one don't hesitate to take the model car seats down and try them out with your child. I went with a few in mind based on ratings from other parents and narrowed it down after trying them for myself. Happy Shopping!
