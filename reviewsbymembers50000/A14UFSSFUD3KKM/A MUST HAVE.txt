 I got this as a shower gift and I don't know what I'd do without it. It helps with sponge bathing newborns and it keeps the baby warm when water is poored over it. I lay it on the bathroom counter and fill tHE sink with water. The only minor problem is the water goes through, but I put a big towel underneath it so it cathes the water. I like the hook on the top so it's easy to hang up to air dry over the shower head. I haven't had any problems with mildew and it is machine washable. Excellent product!!
