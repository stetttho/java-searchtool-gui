 I have a lot of friends that Love the mommy bear and their babies fell asleep fast with it. Since the day I brought my daughter home she cried everytime I turned it on. This may be a good purchase for some, you will not know unless you purchase one. I'm glad I bought mine at a second hand baby store. There were about 5 of them there that looked brand new. I have hers fastened to her crib with the velcro fastener. I took the batteries out so nobody watching her would turn it on. I think it's worth getting to find out how your baby responds, but try a local second hand baby store first.
