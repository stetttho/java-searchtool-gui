 ...My daughter LOVES this toy. She is 11 months old and is just starting to walk with it. The handle has a bar that plays when pushed. I think this motivated her to keep walking!! She has figured out how to roll the bar to get different animal noises. There is also a doorbell and knocking sound which a cat and dog are behind the doors. Out of all her toys she plays with this one daily.
