 I tried using this with my daughter and she frowns and spits it out before I can get her temp. She is very picky; I think most babies are picky about what types of pacifiers they take...mine only takes NUK. She gets this thing in her mouth and it's not shaped like her regular binky so she won't keep it in her mouth. The bulb seems to be too long. She gagged on it. I only tried it once and decided to you a digital thermometer which is a better way to go.
