 I bought this when my daughter was 2 wks old and had nasal congestion.  It works very well and her sheets fit over it nicely.  We spent a weekend visiting my parents and she was not elevated for one night and she had problems breathing.  I also use the sleep positioner over the top of it. I haven't had any problems with the hard board underneath slipping out.  It doesn't feel any harder than the firm crib matress.I strongly recommend this for all newborns.
