 I bought this bag a couple months ago and I like it. I like the fact that it has two seperate compartments. One area for diapers, wipes and changing pad and the front compartment for foods. This way the foods and medicines aren't contaminated with a dirty changing pad.This bag has a changing pad that comes with it, but I purchased a seperate one that folds up smaller. I have also had problems in the past with my liquid tylenol leaking out of the bottle. This bag has small mesh pockets that hold these things upright and fits baby foods perfectly. I don't use the binky holder bc my daughter is a thumb sucker, but it is a great feature also. The color is versatile for girl or boy without looking babyish. My husband doesn't mind carrying this. There is also a small pocket in the front for my "to do" lists and a place for her shot records. I spent a good amt. of time in the store trying different bags on my shoulder-The straps are either not long enough or the width is to wide to fit my shoulder. This was important to me since I'd be lugging it around all day. This bag is good for everyday use, but I use a bigger bag for weekend outings. I like this bag, but it's best for you to check them out on your own. Everybody's needs are different. I originally purchased a different bag and after getting home realized it was to small to fit her daily necessities. I went back and exchanged it for this one and am very pleased-I have room for all her necessities, a couple books and some toys. Good luck bag shopping!
