 I had rated this item previously and have changed my mind since. It's not bad when you have a newborn baby, but as my daughter got older (16 months) the cardboard is uncomfortable for her back. I know it still serves its purpose if you put it UNDER the mattress...I just use a regular pillow or phone book under the mattress and it actaully elevates better than the wedge. I have had it in the closet still in the box since she was an infant.Don't waste money on this when you can use items you already have in the house.
