 I got this as a gift and love it. You have to experiment with the water tempature first.- I used regular milk so I wouldn't waste formula. I like the compact size. I move it to the bathroom by the nursery. I put in the bottle (avent) and it's heating while I change her diaper and finished just in time. I used a black marker to mark the fill line so it can be seen easily at those 2AM feedings. The biggest downfall is that you have to wait 10 minutes to reheat again. For the price it is well worth it.
