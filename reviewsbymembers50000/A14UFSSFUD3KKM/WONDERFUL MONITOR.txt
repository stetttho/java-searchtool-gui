 We have been using this monitor for about 5 months and have had no problems. It is so clear you can actually hear the baby breathing. We use the vibrate at night, so we don't hear our daughter's every move and she wakes up a cou[ple times in the night and "talks" to herself. The vibrate goes off only when she calls out to us. I highly recommend this product-NO static sounds.
