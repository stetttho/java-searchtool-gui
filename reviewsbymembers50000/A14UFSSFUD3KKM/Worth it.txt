 My 2 yr old daughter loves this easel. We really researched them all on the market to get one that would last. This one is sturdy. I like that there are clips to hold paper on both sides so 2 kids can color at the same time. Another positive is the double dishes on each side instead of a small ledge to "hold" the chalk. I bought an extra eraser (one for each side)It doesn't wipe it completely clean, but I don't think most do. So I give her a damp cloth to keep in her dish also. Make sure you use the Crayola white board markers for the dry erase board.
