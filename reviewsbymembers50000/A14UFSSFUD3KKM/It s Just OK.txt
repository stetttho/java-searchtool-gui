 I think my daughter enjoyed the fact that it was Dora. It wouldn't matter what it was. Boots floats upside down. I thought he would actually squirt water, but he is no different than any other squirt bath toy. The life jacket changes colors in the water. It is nice that Dora's hair is plastic. My 2 1/2 yr old plays with Dora occasionally, but prefers more of the wind up toys in the tub.
