 I've had my DW746 saw for a month and used it pretty heavily.  I bought one extension wing when I got the saw and installed it on the left side fo the blade (the extension wing can fit on either side).  I used the stamped steel wing on the right side.  The extension wing set fairly easily.  It took me about 30 minutes to level everything to less than 0.005 inches.  I did have to use a shim for one of the three bolt holes, but it was not hard to do.  The instructions recommend two people do the installation becaue the wing is heavy, but I was able to do it myself without too much trouble.  The extension wing is very solid and I've noticed no movement relative to the main table in a month of heavy use.  I have only two gripes.  First, I wish I'd bought two wings, instead of one.  Second, I do not know what to do with the stamped steel wing it replaced.  The stamped steel wing is a big piece of metal and probably weighs ten pounds.  I hate to see it wasted.
