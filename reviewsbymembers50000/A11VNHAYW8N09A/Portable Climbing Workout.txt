 I have both the Medium and Heavy and use them regularly to improve grip strength for climbing.  I find it very easy to use these while driving or listening to conference calls.  If you want just raw grip strength, these may not be the best tools to use.  However, they are great for climbing because they allow you to easily concentrate on just a few fingers at a time.  My normal routine is a rotation focusing on individual fingers and then groups of fingers holding the unit fully compressed for specific time periods.  I use this in conjunction with the Metolius Balls with the rubber bands to work the opposite muscles.  My climbing has improved several grades since I started using these.
