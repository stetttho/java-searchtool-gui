 I bought this book for my 2 year-old son because he's a nut about trains and for myself because I also love trains.  The book is good, but certainly not great.  The illustrations are clear, but the pop-up design and flap placement are poor.  You see half the trains when looking from front to back and the second half of the trains looking back to front.  In other words, you have to flip the book upside down to see the other half of the trains.  The flaps are flimsy and tear easily.  Compared to other flap books, this one is not very robust.  The flaps are also not very interesting.  My son grew tired of the book very quickly as the text describing the trains is not very engaging for his age group.  The text seems better suited to 3rd graders, but the pop-up flap nature seems geared for younger readers.  Overall the book does not really reach either audience.
