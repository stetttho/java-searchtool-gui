 This book is a comprehensive overview of nearly all aspects of climbing and mountaineering, kind of like an undergraduate survey class, and I recommend it as a core part of any climber's reference library.  I owned the third edition and recently purchased and read through (cover to cover) the seventh edition.  Because the book covers all of climbing from simple one day rock climbs to technical multi-day expeditions in a variety of climates and conditions it cannot go into as much detail as books dedicated to specific aspects or types of climbing.  For example, if you are an ice climber you would do well to follow this book up with a book dedicated solely to ice climbing.  What this book does provide in an unparalleled format, is a thorough grounding in all basic climbing techniques, basic rescue procedures, elementary first-aid for mountaineering, geology and meteorology basics, and a variety of either useful things that will make anyone a more complete climber.
