 This is one of the best single purpose guides I've ever encountered.  If you are an "amateur hiker," and by that I mean someone who has minimal hiking experience or is not in above average physical shape, this book will be your guide and mentor in getting you up and down the mountain in one piece.  In planning a trip to Whitney with a number of older friends this book was the best way to explain to people the rigors of the trail and how best to prepare for them.  I own several other guidebooks to the Mount Whitney area and they all contain good trail descriptions and many of them include a half dozen or so routes to the top of Whitney.  This book details only one route and includes a pacing guide regarding the time you should reach each waypoint.  I've not encountered a more detailed trail description in all my years of hiking and believe this is an excellent book for the target audience.  If you are a strong hiker with much experience or if you wish to try Mount Whitney on any of the alternative routes this book is not for you.
