 My son calls them "Monster Pants."  I call them a literary gift to share with him.  This collection of stories is my favorite sampling of Suess for many reasons.  While stories like "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" or "The Lorax" may be more entertaining, the four short stories here are just the right length to captivate younger readers like my two and a half year-old son.  I think the writing is some of Dr. Suess's best.  It has none of the forced rhyming found in some of his earlier works.  The stories all have a message or lesson to be learned, yet they are not of the blatant "hit you over the head" type as found in "The Bitter Butter Battle Book" or "The Lorax."  My only complaint is that the last story. "What Was I Scared Of?," is printed in black text on a dark background and is hard to read under the dim lighting we usually have when I put my son to bed.  Fortunately the story is easy and enjoyable enough to memorize with only a couple of readings and now I don't even need to have the lights on to tell my son about "a pair of pale green pants with nobody inside them."
