 Stanley has introduced a number of FatMax tools in the last few years.  Frankly, I think some of the FatMax tools are just marketing gimmicks, but the screwdrivers are some of the best I've ever used.  What makes these screwdrivers special is the tri-lobe grip (FatMax grip) which makes them easier to grip and easier to apply torque.  You can buy cheaper screwdrivers at your local hardware store and they are likely to have simple round or square handles.  I have many of these ... screw drivers which I now use for opening paint cans.  The FatMax screwdrivers are so much more comfortable that I will search my shop for one before I'll resort to using a cheapy screwdriver.  The tri-lobe handle design has been in the Stanley product line for over 15 years and I would say that it is as important an innovation as some of the stuff Stanley did with hand planes over a hundred years ago.
