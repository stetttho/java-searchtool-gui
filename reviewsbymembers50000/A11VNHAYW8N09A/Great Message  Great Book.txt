 This story focuses on one simple question that every child thinks at one point or another.  The question is whether their parents will always love them no matter what the child does.  This story confirms for children young and old, that no matter what they do, their parents (mama) will still love them.   The story is delightfully told from the perspective of the Intuit culture.  The mischief the child creates deals with things that are unique to that culture such as accidentally dropping ptarmigan eggs, spilling the oil in the family's lamp, slipping an emrine in mama's mukluks or turning into a Walrus.  My son and I enjoy talking about how different cultures live and what they believe and this book has started some fun conversations.  I believe the story does not prompt children into asking the "wrong" question as mentioned in other reviews.  The story promotes the idea of a parent's love and acceptance no matter what their little hellion does and does it with a wonderful story and captivating artwork.  This has become one of our favorite books.
