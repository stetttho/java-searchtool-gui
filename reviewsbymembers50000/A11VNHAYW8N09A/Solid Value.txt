 This is a well made product that works extremely well with the DW746 saw. If you buy the outfeed table new with the saw, setup takes only a few minutes. If you already have setup the DW746 then installation will take a little longer as you need to loosen the rear fence rail to fit the brackets for the outfeed table. I strongly reccomend that you buy this table at the same time that you buy the saw. Once the brackets are installed on your table saw, setup of the outfeed table is a breeze. The table is very sturdy. As noted in other reviews, you could build your own outfeed table, but I think this is a better deal. After factoring in my time, the ease of use of this table, and the cost of materials I was money ahead by buying the table rather than building one. Besides, I'd rather be building furniture than shop jigs. My only complaints are that the plastic coating on the leading edge of the outfeed table is showing some scoring after only a couple of months of use. I noticed the scoring after cutting melamine, but I feel it would have happened no matter what material I was cutting. It just may have taken a little longer to notice if I'd been cutting a softer material like pine.  I also wish the table was a little wider. One hint, when installing the brackets on the back of the table saw there is some play. Install them as low as possible so that you will have extra room to get the connecting carriage bolts in and out easier. I learned this the hard way.  I originally installed the brackets high and this game me little room to get the carriage bolts connected.  The lower position makes this task very easy.
