 I don't recall seeing this movie in theatrical release so it may have gone straight to video.  Since its better than most of the other movies I've seen this year I'm not sure why is may have gone straight to video.    The plot revolves around a youngish corporate executive involved in some mysterious dealings and now someone is trying to kill him.  As he desperately fights to stay alive he's trying to figure out who's out to get him.  I was on the edge of my seat through out the movie.  I won't say anything else about the plot lest I give away too much other than it has a great surprise ending.    I'm glad a friend recommended this to me.
