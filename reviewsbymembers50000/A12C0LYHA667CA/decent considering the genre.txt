 I saw this CD at wal-mart and thought: What the heck it's on Drive thru and the label says it sounds like TBS.  It can't be that bad.  My first impression was good.  The first track: "bleed for you" really got me pumped about this band.  Sure, it sounded like a lot of other emocore bands, like matchbook romance and Early november but in a good way.  It's a lot moe pop-punk that those bands.  This can be taken good or bad depending on your taste.  The chord progression and vox is almost NFG like, but heavier.  There's occasional screaming and intensified drumming that make this CD very emocorey.  HIPV does a great job of melding this softer pop-punk sound with a slightly hardcore vibe.    I found that this band has many pros and cons, so the best way to visualize them would be in just that way...  PROS-  -better than average drumming.  It's not often we see double bass in the kind of music.  That's awesome.  -HIPV has a nice rythm section, but who doesn't in this genre?  -good screamer, Rob Freeman gets the job done.  -Good job melding of genres that usually don't work well together    CONS-  -the singer sounds like jordan pundik...  EW  -There's a lot of potential for this band to grow into something more but they don't show it.  -lyrically this is sub-par.    -It sounds redundantly like other related bands.    -over-produced  -i could have done without the acoustic songs    This Cd manages to outdo recent bands in the same pool, like armor for sleep and Matchbook romance, but it comes nowhere near to matching up with TBS's Tell all your friends.
