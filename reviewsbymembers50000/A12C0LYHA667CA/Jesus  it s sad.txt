 Okay first off, everything that Joey T said, is ecaxtly what I would have said in this review.  I can't agree with him more.  I mean, these guys aren't bad, but they rip off a lot of people and they aren't even good at it.  Now before you say anything stupid hear me out on this one real quick.  First, let's get past all the teen chicks who think this band is good.  I have to say, all the girls I know (a lot) who like this band, have only heard one song by them.  (i dare you to guess) and quite frankly, that's the ONLY good song on this record.  The rest are carbon copies of eachother.  Crap rip off Thursday/TBS screamo that literally just sucks worse than the first time it was done.  Heck, I love TBS, thursday's awesome too.  Thursday practically invented the screamo we know today and TBS is one of the most original emotionally charged bands in the genre.   Admit it scene kids, TBS FOUNDED this genre of music.  All this coping stuff like Hawthorne heights, silverstien, and bayside...  All on victory BTW, was just Victory's last ditch effort to make a bunch of TBS esque bands and hope that kids would belive that these guys were just as original as TBS.  When it all comes down to it, I blame victory for this crap.  I mean, even now they still keep pumping out the emo clone bands like to no end.  For the love of god, stop it victory.  So admit it girls, your not really emo or hardcore.  Your precious little minds can't handle anything outside the realm of pop.  So even when a band like this comes along trying to look emo, while playing the same pop rock radio crap that you like, just skip it and go listen to green day.   And secondly, these guys truly do suck.  The sreamer sounds like he's gargling, and the so called "triple guitar" is rarely, if never used.  I gave this two stars for the one song they have that's got an ounce of originality, ohio is for lovers.  And that one is overrated...
