 Ok first off, to call this or anything like it EMO is dumb...as a matter of fact the whole EMO craze is a load of crap.   Now i'm gonna quote Geoff Rickly on this who in my eyes is the king of all things emotional.  He says this: "Since the Emo means: emotional music, wouldn't that make a whole lot of other genres Emo too?  If that's true then that would mean people like perry Como are EMO because he sang about girls!"  So basicly you kids who think EMO is just stuff like TBS and Brand New and The Used are wrong.  That is why I say Emo is a dumb term.  Now, to talk about this band!  They are very emotional no dought!  They have some good things to say in their music! However, I have to say one thing to this band that's negative.  They really aren't doing anything all that original.  I notice many reviews claiming this is a classic.  But while I do agree this album does bring a few new ideas to this genre's table, I would hardly call it groundbreaking.  Don't get me wrong though this is a solid band that has some pretty inovative stuff that you just don't see with related bands like Taking Back Sunday and Saves The Day.   I heard that Jesse from this band had a beef with Adam Lazzara from TBS on tour about something.  Evidently they got in quite a fight over something.  But that's beside the point.   Anyway, this is a good album but I didn't think it was really all that original.
