 For the most part, I think MCR used to be a cult band.  A few guys out to play the music they love and base it on something that would be kind of different.   I'm guessing Gerard way decided on a gothic theme to go along with their already established punk melodies.  If we look at some of their video's and footage we can tell they poke fun at all the things they represent.  The only exception being Helena, which I think is the only serious song on the album.  The rest of there songs seem to circle around the whole killer guy concept.  The music on Three cheers is solid too.  It's not original and I have heard much better, but props to them for keeping a solid image while also playing decent music with lyrics that actually provoke thought.  All in all I like Three Cheers.  People will say they are gay.  But who cares if they are.   People will say they wear  makeup.  That really doesn't matter because it's been done before. And that's my only complaint, MCR is basicly a band that draws all it's perk from other past bands such as Misfits, Letterkills, Alexisonfire, TBS, and Thursday.  Just to name a few.  But other than that, this is a good band, and album.
