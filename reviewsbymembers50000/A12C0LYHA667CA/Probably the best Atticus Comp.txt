 I have to say, I enjoy all 3 Atticus CD's greatly, despite the fact that many people claim that they demean in quality as they grow higher in number.  I do think though, that this one is probably the best all around.    With a large variety of songs to choose from here, any  pop-punk/emo fan will be delighted with this CD.  I notice that this particualar comp has far more exclusive tracks than 3.  That's why i think this one better.  From the start we are treated with a pop-punk assault from the alkaline trio that any fan of the genre will surely enjoy.  Following that is a great song from a great band from the emo genre: Finch.  I love this song.  The next few tracks are also very enlightening such as the NFG chrstmas song and some very good pop-punk tracks from some lesser known bands like Midtown and The Movielife.  Other high points of this one include, The Starting Line, Sugarcult, Glassjaw, Name Taken, and The used.  I was however, dissapointed by a couple of tracks like bright lights big city by: madcap.  And Friday Night by slick shoes.    Even though, the good far outweighs the bad and this Comp is definately a deal for 8 or 10 bucks.
