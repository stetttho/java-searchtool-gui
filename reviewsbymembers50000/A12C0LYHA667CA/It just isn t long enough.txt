 After buying the art of drowning I became an AFI addict.  I then bought Sing The Sorrow and was not satisfide with the poppy sound it had.  I decided to buy this hearing it was a lot like TAOD.   Well, it was cheap and yes it is a lot like that cd.  Every song on here is awesome, but don't take my word for it, go ask every reviewer on here.  The cd starts off with the fast "Fall Children."  This song sounds like it could have been on TAOD but was too punky sounding.  If you love hardcore and AFI this is a grat song.  The Halloween cover is another really catchy true to punk song.    The 3rd track is a bit hard to get into at first due to it's complexity.  It takes growth time.  Finally, totalimmortal...  What can I say this is easilly one of AFI's best.  It sounds like what would happen if you put their greatest hits in a blender to make one song.  Anyway, I recomend thing for any AFI fan or Punk fan.
