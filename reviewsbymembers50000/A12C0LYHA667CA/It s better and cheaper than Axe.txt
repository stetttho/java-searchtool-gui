 I've tried a lot of body sprays/deodorants whatever and I can safely say that BOD is the best deal of them all.  Sure, Tag and AXE feature more variety and sex appeal but let's be honest guys.  When it comes down to it, all your really trying to do is smell good for the ladies.  The truth being that it doesn't matter how much you invest in expensive big name products that are overadvertised.  The real question is: Does it make you smell good?    My can of BOD was $1...  Yes, a buck, and I've been using it for over 2 months in excess.  It's still over half full!  Wow that's a lot.  I will say though, that this stuff doesn't really stay with you as much as i'd hope.  It takes a good 3 or 4 well placed sprays to get it to stick.  But, with as much in one can as this, who needs to be liberal?!  The fragrance is great.  Just as good if not better than the competitors.  I really like blue musk.  It's really pleasing to smell but somehow really manly.
