 This band has an odd identity.  They seem generic at first look, but a close listen will reveal something much greater.  These guys aren't just an underoath/static lullaby knockoff.  You can listen to this EP and see that.  There's so much stuff done on here that's never been done for this kind of music.  It's almost like screamo vocals and guitar meets hardcore drumming.  I love it.  Many will label this as sketchy run-around hardcore that fails to deliver but that's probably just them failing to be able to realize how much originality really exists here.    The variety of musical element's YR uses is astounding.  Metal, emo, hardcore, pop, progressive ect...  That's only a few, but you get the point.  On top of all that though, the production is cleaner than a baby's bottom.  It sounds very close to overdone but fortunately this kind of music can take the heat.    One sad part though, is the fact that it sounds like what it is.  (A bunch of genres put together into a sound the band likes)  yeah sure, the riffs are sickly, and the songs are all rich in variation...but there's nothin here I haven't heard before in on form or another.  It's almost like buying a quick compalation of all the genres listed above.  The fact is, YR has no sound of their own, just a mix-and-match copy cat EP that is slighty over-produced.    I haven't listened to lightworker so if it's more original then forgive me, but this band has no real artistic talent.  The just play other peoples music well and blend it well.    3 stars for production, vocals, talent, and looks...
