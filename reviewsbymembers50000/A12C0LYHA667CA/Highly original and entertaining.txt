 First off, there's a few things I think everybody should know before they buy this.  1.If your a fan of a different genre and go buy this, it's hard to get used to.  Me for example, usually listen to Emo/metal/punk.  These genres really don't touch this CD in any way, and neither do many other genres.    2.I bought this CD after hearing that it was lyrically awesome.  My friend told me the lyrics were deeper than stuff like Thursday and Saosin so I was intrigued and bought it.  In a way, it was totally different than what I expected (an emo masterpeice...)  It's not emo at all guys.  3.to categorize this stuff is impossible...  The lyrics if anything are just honest... (what emo should have been)  The music is totally weird.  It's basicly above average guitar work with organs and cellos...  Weird I know, but original yes.  So we come to the ugly organ.  An honest opera of romance and heartbreak in the most heartfelt way from Tim Kasher.  Lyrically/ I;m gonna call this Emo revival.   The music is diverse in it's own way.  From fast powerful songs to slow sad melodies, it's quite a ride.  There are a couple fillers here but Best Buy has this for 12 bucks which is a deal.  Sure it will take like 6 spins minumum to actually like this a lot, and some songs on here are pretty weird at first.    I'll finish by saying this is not for everybody.  If you don't care about lyrics and meaning...this isn't for you.
