 I don't care about they EP's usually suck rule.  This is the best EP I have ever heard!  It surpasses everything they have done past this.  It's just an awesome cd!  Go pick it up at FYE for 11 bucks if you like hardcore or emocore or the like.  it's a steal of a purchase.  Even though there's only 7 tracks on here, every track is truly a dream.   I cant think of much bad about this album.
