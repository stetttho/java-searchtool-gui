 Ok, I'm a HUGE hardcore fan.  I never really liked metal at all, or even metalcore.  I have heard Norma Jean being called metalcore by most.  That drove me away from this album.  After a while i decided: **** it.  I'm gonna buy their new cd and see what this is all about.  After a long listen to this CD, I concluded that this is definately not hardcore, but something more. Norma Jean brings a varied assortment to the table.  While it's a lot like Bless the martyr, this CD also manages to branch out with the new singer.  (I think he's as good as the last one) The guitars are definately technical, if anything.  NJ has a cool way of making the guitars sound chaotic and unorganized, when they really are very technical and organized at heart. If you don't know what I mean that's ok...it takes some explaining. The singing is IMO very good.  The guy clearly has a very powerful scream and the few lines of melody he emits manage to be good too.  The only thing wrong with the vocals is that in some parts it gets repetitive.  EX:  A guy screaming the same two words 30 times in a row for 20 seconds does get old after a bit.  But this isn't really a major flaw. As far as drums go this CD is average.  Nothing to write home about.  If you want to hear some real drumming go listen to Mastodon or something.    This cd manages to keep up the same heavy,fast, and random pace for most of the cd which is good.  Even the couple of slower songs are great.    So basicly, go to best buy and buy this.  It's got good guitars, good screaming, and it's very chaotic and random.   I love it.
