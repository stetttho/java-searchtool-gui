 I don't care if Cove sucks.  I give Saosin credit for so quickly compiling this disk right after Cove joined up.  This is easilly enough material to hold us over until the full length comes out.  Come on people!  It's an EP!  It's not supposed to be awesome anyway.    Saosin has already established two new songs with Cove that are featured on this disk.  (although the new track Uphill Battle is not)    If you don't like bury your head then that's just sad.  It may not have that perfect old saosin sound you all like but it comes pretty frickin close plus it's better than some of the old stuff IMO.  The acoustic VER. is also pretty cool and a nice bonus.  The revamped version of No Angel is also on here and it rocks pretty sick.  It's a lot different then the old one.  If for no other reason buy it for the live track.  Any fan of Anythony green Saosin will want to have Lost Symphonies just because it's one of their best songs.  So seriously, go buy this on ebay or something... now
