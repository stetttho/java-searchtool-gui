 This album is a lot of different things.  It's post-hardcore.  It's rock.  It's emo.  It's even metal in a couple places. One thing's for sure, it's not the new thursday.  Geoff Rickly did a  lot of changing both vocally and mentally between this and War All The Time.  Mostly for the better.  Which makes this album a second choice in my book.  There are a lot of good things about this one though.  The album opens with a pretty little intro and then cuts to the fast and catchy Understanding in a car crash. One of the best on here.  If you purchase this after WATT you will realize how bad Geoff sang on this record.  It just sounds weird for him.  Anyway, As the album moves on with the fast sort of heavy concealer, it gets very switchy.  Thursday has a habit of going from a fast hardcore sound to a slow emo sound.  It's weird.  The lyrics however, are just as good as WATT.  I know you hate me comparing the two but it fits dont it?  Anyway, some of the song matter on here is quite dark, even for thursday.  Death, suicide, break ups, killing, murder and all that you would usually expect from them.  I think one of the major flaws with this album is the fact that Victory records produced it weird.  A lot of the music sounds more technical than it should be and the vocals are very rasped.  To make a conclusion about this album, I would recomend you not get this and go buy war All The Time.  Then if you really liked that then you should buy this used if possible.  It's not bad, it's just not their best.
