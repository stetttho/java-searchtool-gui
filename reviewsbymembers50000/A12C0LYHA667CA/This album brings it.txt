 Before I start, I'd like to give a bit a background about how I got a hold of this album.   Usually I listen to punk/emo/emocore stuff but after seeing this album on amazon being compared to numerous hardcore and screamo artists, I decided that it was time I checked this band out.  I went to best buy and got this for 10 bucks... (a steal) I seriously had no idea what I was buying, I had just seen a lot of people recommend it that had my tastes.  So I threw caution to the wind.  At first listen, I began to think I had purchased a cheap alternative rock/metal cd...  Something I hate. However, I listened a couple more times and realized that this was actually hardcore/metal.  This band sounds like afi meets post-hardcore alternative!  Cool!  Anyway, if you like hardcore/screamo/metal, or just good rock...go pick this one up.  It's impressive.
