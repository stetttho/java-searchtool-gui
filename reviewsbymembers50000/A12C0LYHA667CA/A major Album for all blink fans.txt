 many people say that Enema was the point where Blink went from pure punk to pop punk sellouts.  I dissagree.  I think that when Scott left that they figured they had to create a new sound for themselves to keep it fresh.  Before they new it they were selling millions of CDs and were on TRL all the time.  After that, well...that for another review.  Anyway, if you like punk, buy this.  If you call yourself a true blink fan then buy this.  Most of all, if you want a great album that changed rock music forever then buy this.  Another thing, most of the best songs on this album are the ones with Mark singing.  Odd though because Tom is supposed to be more of a lead singer...  1.Dumpweed--10/10--a great chorus and a strong opener.  2.Don't leave me--10/10--One of the best on the album.  Very hard verses.  3.Aliens exist--9/10--cool sort of techno song.  Doesnt really sound like punk but still awesome.  4.going away to college--10/10--very emotional song with an awesome chorus.  Best song on here.  5.what's my age again--10/10--second best on here.  Great chorus and transitions.  6.dysentary gary--10/10--funny song with cool guitaring  7.adam's song--10/10--a slow song about suicide.  Really touching  8.all the small things--10/10--great single.  Coulda been better but it's great anyway.  9.the party song--10/10--hilarious song but sort of weird.  Very very very fast!  10.mutt--10/10--very diverse musically and good lyrics  11.wendy clear--10/10--great song period.  more emo than punk  12.anthem--10/10--opening is weak but the rest of it is awesome
