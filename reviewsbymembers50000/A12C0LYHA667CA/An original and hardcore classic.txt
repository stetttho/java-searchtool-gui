 This album should be in your collection if you like any kind of metal or any kind of core.  This CD has a mind of it's own.  There's a lot of turns and twists that will have you wandering what's going on in this guys mind who's writing the music.  The guitar work is close to phenominal and I was impressed by the transitions from fast thrash hardcore to slow bass and piano interludes.  It's also lyrically advanced bringing some original ideas to the whole "emo" table.    And now for the bad parts...my complaints    The drumming is mediocre at best, but the guitars back it up well  The vocals are good for screamo standards and they do scream well.  The singing however, is pretty bad.  It sounds like a bulemic geek crying...  The whole album is really hard to get into.  At first 5 listens it sounds all the same, and it takes time to start to really see the depth.  other than that this is a great album that manages to break genre labels by making itself hard to place a label on.  It manages to be a lot of things at once while still holding a good bit of punch.
