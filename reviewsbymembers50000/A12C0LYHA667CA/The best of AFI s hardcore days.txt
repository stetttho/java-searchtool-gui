 Ok, if you are already an AFI fan, (of their newer stuff I hope) then this is the next album in line for you to buy.    Out of all the albums from AFI's hardcore beginnings, this one is the best.  It beats you harder than most other albums in it's genre.  The influences here are very apparent. (rancid, black flag, misfits)  But the album still manages to create a very original sound.  I must warn fans of the AFI we know today however, this is not anywhere near the same as the AFI that we now listen to.  Fans of Sing the Sorrow or the art of drowning will probably be dissapointed.    But, if you really and truly want to become of the hardcore AFI, I encourage you to start here.  There's some great vocals on here from Davey and even though Jade wasn't in the band for this one, the guitarwork still delivers in true hardcore fashion.    If your not an AFI fan, but like hardcore, this is a great addition to any Punk collection.  This album reminds me a lot of some of black flags stuff.  Davey's howls and sad moans are what really makes this one stand out from the crowd.  Although not as skilled as his current day self, he is even still a heartfelt vocalist.    All in all, this is probably my third favorite AFI cd right behind TAOD and All all hallows.  With 14 hard hitting tracks for about 13 smacks at a best buy is a good deal in my book.    So what more can I say?  Go buy this guys.  It's some of the best Hardcore you can put in your player.  Davey Havok will make you wonder where his voice has been all your life.
