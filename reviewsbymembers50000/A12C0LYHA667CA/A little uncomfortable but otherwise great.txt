 Before I start there's a couple things you should know.  First off, I bought an earlier Version of this about a year ago.  The only big difference is that mine has a foam earpiece and the new one is leather.    Also, I did buy mine for my PS2 but after a couple months of use I decided to make the switch to CPU gaming.  To my joy this headset worked fine on my CPU via the USB port and I use is routinely on TS.  Sound-As far as hearing other people, it's great.  I can easilly equalize the voice over volume with that of my game.  People I'm talking to say I sound great so I'll take their word for it.  Comfort-this is where this device fell a bit short for me.  Yes, it is better than the average headset in terms of "I can't even tell it's there" status, but not by much.  The mic is a little too close to the mouth and it can get touchy at time.  The headphone also gets really muggy and makes my ear hot.  Other than those two problems though, it's quite comfortable.  FEATURES-wow!  There's alot to go for here.  Volume control, mute button, shirt clip on...  It's got it all.  All these features work well and do exactly what they should.  OVERALL-This is a great mid-priced headset with high dollar features.
