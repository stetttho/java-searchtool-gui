 Usually, I'm not a huge pop/punk/emo fan.  I go for more hardcore stuff usually.  But me being a fan of their older stuff, I decided to through caution to the wind at wal-mart and pick this bugger up for $9.95.  At frist listen I was struck with the strong feeling that this was more of the same from: Say it like you mean it, only more unoriginal and a bit less catchy.  However, after about the 8th song down I started to rethink the album as a whole.  Sure, it was still very close to the Starting line's usual sound, but it's  a lot more mature lyrically (more on that later)  The singing is a million times better than Kenny's other work.  He really has matured in both areas.  As far as the actual music, it's a bit different than SILYMI but still pop-punky.   I'm sick of people judging these lyrics before giving second though to them.  It's a little thing called Emo and even though I don't believe in the genre any more, it doesn't take an idiot to see that about half of TSL's lyrics are metaphorical.  Kenny said it himself that the "tear your ass up" line is just slang. And don't anybody say that Bedroom talk is an immature sex song.  Go read Ken's explanation on the site then watch the video.  It's a masterpeice.
