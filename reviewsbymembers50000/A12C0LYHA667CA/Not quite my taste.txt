 I bought Emery's first CD about 5 months ago after hearing that they were like underoath.  I found that while, they were more poppy and less intense then Underoath and a lot of bands like them, they had a unique and intriging sound.  Eventually I got tired of their sound and put up the CD for a while taking it out for a couple listens every so often.    So naturally I couldn't wait to buy this CD.  I did fear though, that the sophomore release would slump.  I suppose it does, in some ways.  The first thing I noticed, is they still retain the general sound of TWE.  Not a bad thing though.  Also, the keyboard is a lot more evident in this one.  They get a bit more techno in this release.  Other than that, this is basicly the same Emery.  One thing that bugs me about this CD is that unlike in TWE where they had two types of songs.  (fast and slow)  Now there are a lot of songs that are half fast and half slow.  I don't like the tempo changes, it sounds too much like Brand New songwriting.  The lyrics IMO are just as good if not better than before.  Some songs like:  Listening to Freddie Mercury are pretty intriging.    The vocals also are a lot like before.  Where the singing is still very unique and the screaming has that distinct howl.  Still, the songs seem to get weaker as the CD's go on.  About track 7 the CD goes downhill.  With a few slow more than forgettable songs and a weird filler track.  Still though, there are at least 7 good tracks on here and it earns it's 3 star rating.
