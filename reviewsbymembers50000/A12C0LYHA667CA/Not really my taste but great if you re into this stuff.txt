 I first heard about Anadivine over the summer, browsing amazon CD's.  I heard Alcohol and Oxygen and decided to but this EP.  My first impression was that this band was a more classic-rock/emo orriented version of Coheed and Cambria.  But after a few more listens I found that they were more than that.  Lyrically this band is far above average.  Although I would categorize them in the emo lyric pool due to the numerous songs about girls/emo stuff, they do a better job than most bands in the genre.  There's some pretty deep meanings here if you look deep enough.  So cuddo's to that.  I also noticed that there's a guest appearance from Claudio from Coheed on here.  That wasn't much of a surprise being that their sound reminds of that band.  In fact, they use a lot of the same elements.  The mainly rock guitar with a bit of metal mixed in and those ever so high screams that manage to sneak in every once in a while.  These guys are all clearly talented with their instruments and manage to create a fun and original sound.  Songs like Filling the lungs and Emily show this clearly.    Now, that's not to say this EP does not have flaws.  There are just as many throwaway songs on here as good ones.  Maybe only 2 songs that really stand out.  Again, I don't usually go for stuff like this so ignore that if you like this style of music.    The biggest problem I saw with this was that I kept thinking I was missing out on a good band.  The song alcohol and oxygen is probably on of the best I've heard as far as Emoish stuff goes, but the rest of the CD lacks.  Basicly, what I'm saying is that this band has much potential and they need to find their sound.  I'll expect better from them in the future.  I wouldn't be surprised if these guys reach CO&CA level prestidge.  They difinatly have the talent and the connections.  So, overall this EP gets a 6 out of 10 and I would say buy this if you like mellow rockish emo or Co&CA, and maybe for indie fans too.
