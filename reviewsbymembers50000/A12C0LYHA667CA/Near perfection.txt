 These headphones provide a great combination of Sound and comfort.  I have had mine for almost a year and the sound quality is still above decent.  Many headphones lose a lot of quality after a few months of use, but these still seem to be holding out quite well.  They don't noise cancel or anything but they can get loud enough to where I can mow the lawn and still hear my music.  In terms of comfort these are the best I've ever owned.  They fit so well and weigh so little, that after a minute or two of use, you won't even think you are wearing them!  They are also very discreet and low profile.  Hats aren't a problem due to the plastic strip that goes behind rather than over.  (a great design idea)  The only complaint I have is that you can't lean back on anything with them on.  So if your sitting down, you won't be able to bend them to lean your head on a chair.    Probably one of my favorite things about these is the durability.  I carry my Player and headphones around in a book filled bag on the go.  Trust me, I have tried a lot of different headphones and most of them simply can't take the pressure.  About 80% of the ones I've tried break after a couple weeks of "bag storage" due to all the pressure I exert on the bag and the stuff I put in it.  These headphones however, have gone almost an entire year in my bag, and are still in perfect condition!!!    So if your looking for a durableand comfortable headphone that will retain it's sound for a while, this is the way to go!
