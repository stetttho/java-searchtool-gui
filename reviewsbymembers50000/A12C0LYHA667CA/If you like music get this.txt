 I Don't know where I heard about these guys.  Maybe it was here on Amazon.  I can't remember.  Well, that's not the point.  The bottom line is:  This CD is one of the best powerpop/techno/indie/emo EPs I have ever heard.  Yeah, that's a mouth full but that's how I would categorize this.  It's that varied.  Every song on here is catchy as hell.  Given there's only 6 songs, but every one is golden in it's on way.  I seriously don't know why this band isn't all over airwaves.  Perhaps it's due to all the different styles they incorporate.  However, I think that when it comes down to it, they are pop.  I showed this CD to some of my friends at school who usually stick to mainstream stuff.  (fallout boy, green day)  At first they were very skeptical, because most of my music falls under the "screamo/hardcore" radar.  However, after hearing "Dear Jamie"  They fell in love with it and demanded copies.  After a couple weeks half the school had fell in love with this band.  BTW that was back when they were ENTIRELY indie status.  Now they are a bit more popular.  I don't know why I like this CD so much.  It might be the sound effects, the lyrics, the guy's voice, or the guitarwork.  It's all just so well done.  I can see anybody liking this.  The addictiveness is amazing.    The songs seem so similiar, but yet they are very different.  I simply can't express the diversity Hellogoodbye offers.  There aren't many bands that can claim a sound like this.  Sure, there are similiar acts, such as Plain White T's, or Zolof, but even those bands don't sound like this.    Lyrically I was greatly impressed.  Usually in this field of music you won't find stuff this deep.  It's almost Emoish.  The subject material pretty much sticks with girls.  (go figure)  Still though, there's a lot of poetic prowess.  Good job Hellogoodbye.    SO overall, you need this if you enjot music.  It shall satisfy.
