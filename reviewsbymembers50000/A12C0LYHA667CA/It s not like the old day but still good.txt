 Well, Personally I liked Dookie the best.  It was a solid punk album anyway.  The one thing I hate about modern green day is that everyone thinks they are a punk anarchy band.  News flash: Green day isn't punk anymore!  It went out with Nimrod.  Now, American idiot...that's another story.  It's not even remotely punk, except for like two songs.  Green day has definately grown torward the pop genre in the last decade.  I'm not bashing them but they really aren't that good now.  Am I the only one that thinks BOBD is a bad song?  I mean, it's a frickin ballad...that's just gay.  Other than that, it's a solid pop album...buy it if you like pop, but please don't expect it to be like dookie or punk music.  Oh, and to the woman with the 13 year old girl who still plays with strawberry shortcake...I'm sure god understands that people need to get beyond stuff like that in life...eventually! You need to realize that your innocent little teenager isn't gonna be playin with fake cell phones till she's twenty.  Get a life lady!  listen to some real music!
