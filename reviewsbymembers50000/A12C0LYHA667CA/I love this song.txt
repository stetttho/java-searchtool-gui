 For those of you with doubts on whether Luti-kriss was as good as present Norma jean, this is the song to download.  IMO it's just as good if not better than the new Norma Jean CD.  If I'm correct they had a slightly different but you can barely tell.  Scogin was pretty young when this came out and it shows.  His screaming in the soung sounds reminescant of an older teen or someone in their early 20's.  This song is just so good.  It's about God and his saving of the human race through jesus.  yeah, that's right fans...  More extreme christian hardcore.  Love it please.
