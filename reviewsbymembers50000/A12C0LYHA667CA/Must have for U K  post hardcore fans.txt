 These guys came out of nowhere for me.  I've always been HUGE fan of the U.K. post-hardcore/metalcore scene.  I actually prefer it over US releases.  Bands like Funeral For A friend, Lost Prophets, Hondo Maclean, The Blackout, and When Reason Sleeps all have been some of my favorites coming from this genre.  I was looking in a AP last month and saw an add for this EP.  I decided to get it because it looked cool.  After some research I learned that these guys have a lot more talent than most bands in this genre that have been at the switch for quite some time.   Now I'm not saying that this EP can outdo FFAF's Seven ways to scream you name, (not even close)  but it's still a very fine Post-hardcore release.    The vocals here are better than most U.K. outfits.  He reminds me of a cross between Matt from Funeral for a friend and the screaming is very original.  The guitar riffs here bring a lot to the table.  It's very evident from the riffs and vocals that this band is from the U.K. scene.  They've got a decent rythm section too, something that Funeral for a friend lacks nowadays.  The drumming is par for the course.  Nothing awesome here, but this genre isn't exactly known for it's drumming.  The lyrics are also reflecting of the genre, occasional cussing and I hate you lyircs.  Overall this is really a typical U.K. Post-hardcore record.  But then why do I give it 4 stars?  Because these guys have a lot of potential and they aren't afraid to stand out from the crowd.  That's what.  I think that if they play their cards right, they could well be the next Funeral For a Friend.  I would recomend this EP for anybody who like metalcore or post-hardcore.
