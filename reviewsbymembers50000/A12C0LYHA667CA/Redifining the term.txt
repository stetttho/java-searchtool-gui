 The saosin started when Anthony Green (a vocalist for 4683985435 million other bands before)  came on board with the other 4 members of Saosin.  They recorder an EP that will forever in my book go down as the cd that changed the word Emo or Emocore or whatever forever.  Not only is this CD great, but anything by this band is completely awesome and Teeming with Emotion.  You can just tell.  But wait, don't even get me started about the live shows.  They are like no other live band in existance.  There's bodies flying, screaming, guys going all over the place, and just raw emotion coming out of both Anthony and Beau.  It's amazing.  Plus. unlike so many other so called Emo/screamo/emocore bands out there, he means it all.  I rate harshly so don't worry  1 seven years--9.5/10--easilly one of the best songs ever written.  This thing is just amazing.  Download it somewhere NOW and you will know why you like this band.  2 translating the name--7.5/10The album title song.  It's one of the songs on here that isn't awesome but still great.  3 3rd measurement in C--8.7--Frikkin good!  This is one of their very deep songs kyrically that ends great.  It's one of the best.  4 lost symphonies--8/10--this song's groovy and fast.  It's got a great beat.  Not one of my fav's though.  5 they perched on their stilts--9/10--oh my god@@@@@@THIS IS THE BEST LIVE SONG EVER MADE@@@  Seriously though, this song is god.  if you can find the live version at Arlenne's grocery online somewhere it is indescrivable.    Overall-I have to give this a 8.5/10 just because it didn't have the other awesome songs they have like "I can Tell" and "mookie's last christmas"
