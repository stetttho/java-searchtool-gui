 Since I can't define Some Girl's sound to a single genre, it would be better to describe their sound based on what bands the members come from.  From the legendary synth-grind act known as The Locust comes one of the more prominent members, Justin Pearson, along with additional members from bands like Give Up The Ghost and American Nightmare.  There's a lot of influence and skill involved in the band.  It's a surprise that they can get together and make music like this, despite their differences and busy schedules.  But alas, Some Girls creates a genious equation that seems to stun even the most seasoned listeners of aggressive music.    Most of the songs here are similiar in nature.  The traditional grind/hardcore drumming patterns and occasional blast beats.  The guitars range in style.  Some songs have more traditional San Diego scene guitar elements, while others seem to take off in their own direction. However, the vocals are where this band really shines.  Wes Eisbold gives ranting hardcore screams accompanied by the shreiking Justin Pearson.  This combination never gets old.  Just when you think you've figured out the pattern, one of them comes up with a different way of screaming the words just right so they change in appearance.  What can I really say more?  This band shreds.  If you like any of the bands these guys come from, I would highly recommend you pick this up.  For that matter, all fans of aggresive music should check this out.  It's that good.
