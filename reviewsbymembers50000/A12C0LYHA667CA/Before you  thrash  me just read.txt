 Alright, first off I HAVE heard ALL of good charlotte's music so your not gonna tell me I don't know what I'm talking about. And second, there's some things that you fans need to know.  1.GC is not punk...sorry.  They used to be close to it but theyre not even remotely punk anymore.  They are pop.  Since they claim to be punk though, that means they are posers. This may come as a shock to some of you but real punk is Ramones, DeaD Kennedy's, adicts, misfits, and stuff like that.  Sadly, almost all the REAL punk bands are either dead or broken up.  Sorry kids...  2.GC also claims to be a very emotional band but I don't see where that comes from at all...  When half your songs are about pizza and other gay crap like that, that doesn't qualify as emo or whatever you guys want to call it.  Another poser point right there  3.They dress like punks...once again, posers.   Ok, so the actual album!  This is typically more cookie cutter pop-punk money maker material.  I do give them 2 stars for some of the original instrumental material but other than that it's a ripoff of older pop-punk bands like blink 182 and green day.
