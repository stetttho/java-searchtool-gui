      When The Emperor Was Divine is a well written , tragic story. The story begins the day before a  nameless,Japanese American woman and her two children are sent to an internment camp during World War II. The father was arrested shortly before on suspicion of being a traitor.The family's transportation,stay in the camp in Neveda,and their return home is told. This short book is very powerful.  With concisness, the author captures the racism and injustices the family endured. The story is told without sentimentality and does not preach. I have read stories about the Japanese internment during WWII, but I never read what their return home was like. That was the most disturbing part of the book for me. When The Emperor Was Divine is a good book discussion book.
