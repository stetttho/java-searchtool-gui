      Life Expectancy is an entertaining book . Koone has two of his main characters enage in amusing dialogues. After  awhile I skipped this. I did plenty of skipping and skiming which helped me enjoy the story. This is a beach book or a weekend read. It has a clever plot. If you don't have high expectations, you'll enjoy the book better.B for the genre . This is really a 2 1/2 stars book.
