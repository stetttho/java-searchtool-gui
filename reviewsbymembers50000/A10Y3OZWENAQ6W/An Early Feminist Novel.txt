      I have read this book three times. The first time was 40 years ago. The second time was in my forties. I couldn't believe all the ideas I saw in the story that I didn't see when I was 12 years old. The women characters are very strong  and described beautifully. The story is touching and Willa Cather describes the landscape vividly.  Now almost ten years later I read the story for the third time for my book discussion group. All of them loved it.  There is alot to discuss.
