 The Secret Life of Bees" is an entertaining book and an easy read. I enjoyed it very much, but it's not a great book.  The author demonstrated that  a family does not have to be a traditional composition. Many people's families can be made up of friends. Men don't nessecarilty have to be in a family. I am  a single middle-aged woman , so the power of the 'daughters of Mary' hit home. But I am sure married women as well could   relate to it. This novel doesn't have the universal appeal  that say another southern novel"To Kill A Mocking Bird " has but then that novel is a classic. After reading "The Secret Life of Bees" I want to form deeper bonds with my friends, live in a pink house , and develop with my friends some traditions.  Read this book over a weekend. It's a chick book.
