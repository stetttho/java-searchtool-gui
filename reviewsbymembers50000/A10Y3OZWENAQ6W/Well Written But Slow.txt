      This collection of stories was my introduction to Alice Munro.  The stories are  well written but, tedious at times. I read this book for a book discussion and there is lots to discuss.  I didn't look forward to  reading this book after work. The interesting thing is that the more I think about the stories, the more I appreciate them.  Except for one of the stories, the plots are really different and Munro is able to tell a person's life in a short amount of time.  I recommend this book with reservations.
