      This book had hills and valleys.  Sometimes it was entertaining and other times very silly.  It took me almost a week to get through the last 30 pages- I kept falling asleep. I was also  at times  embarrassed for the characters because of the dialogue.      The best parts of the book were the chapters dealing with how the different spices could help the different customers. I also enjoyed the parts  in the begining when the main character was describing her training on "the island".       Raven or "my American" (the love interest) had no appeal and he had alot of ridiculous thing to say.       I love fantasy and I really was looking forward to reading this book. It started out  good  and then slide into the land of the sillies
