      This book is beautifully written. I felt at times that I was reading classic mystery while sitting infront of a fireplace on a snowy, overcast day and drinking hot chocolate. The only flaw to this scene was that there was more atmosphere  than "meat" to this novel. The book should have been titled the "Searchers" because that's what the characters did in the novel. I wanted something to be resolved.I was never bored however and I did enjoy the book.I also felt cheated ,although I now want to go to Romania and Bulgaria. It's a fun book.In summary, I recommend this book , but don't expect greatness.
