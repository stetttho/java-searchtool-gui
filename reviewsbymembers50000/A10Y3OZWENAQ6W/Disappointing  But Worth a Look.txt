 I had  high expectations for Atonement.This may be why I was very disapointed. The first 100 pages move very slowly and then the pace picks up.Ian McEwan is a very good writer. The ending left me feeling cheated. I can't believe how  a lie was atoned for. There is alot to discuss  if you are looking for a book discussion novel. I am sure there would be different opinon on what took place in this novel. Go for it!
