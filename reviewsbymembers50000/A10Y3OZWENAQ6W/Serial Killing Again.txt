 Before I give my review of Broken Prey I want to state that I am a big fan of the Prey series. I look forward to a new  Lucas Davenport novel every year. The books are very entertaining. Broken Prey was a page turner, but it reminded me of other John Sandford novels that had serial killings. There is great deal of violence and lots of red herrings. It is not the best of the Prey series, but  I enjoyed it. A good weekend read.
