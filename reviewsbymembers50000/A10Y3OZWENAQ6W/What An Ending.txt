 This was my first Dennis LeHane novel. I read this book two years ago and as result of this, I read several other novels by the author. First, I never saw the  surprize ending coming. Afterwards I went back over the book  and  I saw that there were incidences that now made sense . It's an excellent book. Two law enforcement officiers arrive on Shutter island (which houses a psychiatric hospital in order to investigate a missing patient.   A storm prevents them from returning to the mainland. That's as far as I'll go.
