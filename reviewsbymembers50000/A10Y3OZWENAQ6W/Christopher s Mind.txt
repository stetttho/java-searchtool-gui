 When I read about this book I thought it would be a real Who Done It sort of mystery.  Well it's not that sort of mystery. Early in the book the identity of the person who killed the dog is revealed, after that the real story begins.  It was fasinating to learn how one particular higher level austic child's mind operates.  It was also troubling how  having a handicapped child can effect a marriage.  This is a very good book.
