      I enjoyed Bangkok 8 very much although it dragged at times. This is a very different story. There is a Thai detective who often speculates what other persons were in former lives and who has a mother who was in and  later returns to the sex industry, the Bangkok sex industry, the Thai culture, and a supernatural ending. The story is funny at times. I rate this a B+ to an A-.
