 I read this book because it was selected by my book discussion group. Some day it might be made into a movie for Lifetime.  Story takes place in the present in Italy. A young chef falls in love with a beautiful blonde American student. His friend a waiter starts to date her. The waiter passes himself off as a chef and asks his chef friend's help in preparing  wonderful Italian dishes for the American girl. There's more to the plot. This is a lightweight novel- a beach book. I did want to visit Italy and eat Italian food. My book club's discussion was very short.
