 This is a book that all librarians should read. It demonstrates that sometimes a great novel can influence us. This novel takes place during the cultural revolution in China. Two young students are sent to the countryside to be reeducated.One of the young men falls in love with a young woman who is a seamtress in the village. All three are captivated by a suitcase full of forbidden western novels. This story is sweet at times but, not sappy. At times I wanted to shout hurray! I liked it but I have to say that a few people in my reading group did not and thought it was boring. Give it a chance!!
