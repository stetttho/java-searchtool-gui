 This is the third book by Michael Connolly that I read . The first two were Harry Bosch mysteries. This book is not. Chasing the Dime is an easy and entertaining book to read.  I didn't make any connection to the protagonist in this novel like I had in the Harry Bosch novels but that's okay. This is a fast paced story.This is a book to read during a weekend, on an air plane, or at the beach. Enjoy it!
