  This was a very entertaining book (B+).This story chronicles the rise of Teresa Mendoza from the girl friend (in Mexico) of a  low level drug transporter to a woman who is the head of one  of the  largest transporters of narcotics in Europe. Along the way Teresa  has love affaires , disposes of traitors and enemies, and reinvents herself.  She was not someone I admired but she was never dull. I enjoyed reading about southern Spain,Gibralta, and Spanish Morocco.  I would like to read other books by the author.
