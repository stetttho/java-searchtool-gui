      This is a sad, interesting story about one family In Kabul. I had difficulty reading the last 70 pages because I didn't want to learn about what happened to some of the people in the story. I cared about them. The author stays out of the story so, the this book of nonfiction seems like a novel.It's an easy read but in me it brought out strong emotions.  I would strongly recommend this book
