 This is the first book by Nuala Faolain that I read so I don't have anything to compare it with.  I am also a middle aged woman so many of the statements she made hit me right in the chest. I could feel her pain. Although I related to her story, I found the book tedious at times. I would  not recommend this book for everyone.  I don't believe that women in their twenties or thirties would fully appreciate Naula's story.
