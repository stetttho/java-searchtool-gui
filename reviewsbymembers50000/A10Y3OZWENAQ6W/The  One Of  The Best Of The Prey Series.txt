      The notion of several generations of families who were agents of the Soviet Union living in Minnesota was very interesting (Great Plot). This story was very different from John Sandford's other books. The main characters were more developed than those in other "Prey" books( I felt sympathy  for the some of the  bad guys.).   I highly recommend this book.
