      This is a very sad and wonderful story. I am not going to summarize the plot. This is a long book, but it was nevering boring and it is easy to read.  I cared for the people very much in the story.This book would make a great discussion about hope,  friendship,  and family. This is a great book for church book discussions. It's not sappy or sugary sweet .
