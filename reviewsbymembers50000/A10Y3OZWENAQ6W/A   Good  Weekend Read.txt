 I enjoyed the novel Pompeii very much  but I wouldn't consider it a great book. Some parts of it dragged but, there were many interesting scenes.  I  was very interested in the Augusta Adequate and the dailey life of the Romans. There were a few surprizes. I would recommend this book to people who enjoy historical fiction. Someone in my book discussion group wants  us to read this but, I feel that although it's entertaining , there's not much to discuss.
