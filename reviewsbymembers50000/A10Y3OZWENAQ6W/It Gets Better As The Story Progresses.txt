      Like some other readers , I had very high expectations for Case Histories. I am a little disappointed. It was a good novel. but, I wouldn't consider great. There are a few mysteries in the story but, it really isn't a hard core mystery novel or a crime novel. There are many likeable and sympathtic characters.  The book is about how tragedies of a criminal nature effected families.  I liked the protagonist Jackson.The story does get better as you get more into it. The ending was satisfying.  I would rate this novel A -.
