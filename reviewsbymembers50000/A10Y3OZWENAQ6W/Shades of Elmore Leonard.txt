      Skinny Dip is an off-beat crime novel. Some of the "good" guys are really not that good. This novel is funny. It reminded me of something that Elmore Leonard would write.  A short summary of the plot is this; a woman on a cruise is thrown overboard by her husband.  She survives and  seeks to get even with him. There's  much more to this story and many funny  characters.   After I read Skinny Dip, I read two more Carl Hiassen novels and just took another one out of the library.  What can I say, I like his novels
