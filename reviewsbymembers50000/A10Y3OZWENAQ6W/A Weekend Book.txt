 The Eyre Affair is definetly a fun book to read. It is slow moving in the beginning but by page 100 I was hooked into it.   This fantasy takes place in England in the 1980s. It's not the England we know but one where the Crimean War is still raging and literary  and art police are present. The Eyre Affair is both a fantasy and a science fiction novel. Time travel  is present and  there is a machine which enables people to enter into novels. This book is funny at times . It's a good rainy day book.
