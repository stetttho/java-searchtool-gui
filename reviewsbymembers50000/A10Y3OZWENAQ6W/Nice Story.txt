     I rate this book an A. The story centers around two distant cousins who are raised together. Both girls lose their fathers under mysterious circumstances. They are raised by their mothers and an aunt in a crumbling ancestrial home in Calcutta. The girls have arranged marriages.That's a bare bones descrption of the story. The relationship of the women in the household is interesting and touching. In fact, there are many interesting people in this tale. I learned new things about the Indian culture.
