 I read this book because it was selected by my book discusssion group. I would never had finished it, but for the fact that it was my book discussion group's selection. I  never felt that I understood Queen Noor. She was very guarded in what she  wrote. I'm sure this has to do with the fact that  she lives in Jordan and her children are members of the royal family and possible heirs to the throne. Queen Noor wrote of her devotion to her husband, children, royal relatives and her adopted country Jordan , but I'm sure there must have been some domestic problems. I would think that King's Hussein's children from his previous marriages might have resented Queen Noor. You 'll never know from this book. I never learned what her personality was like. I never got ther sense of who she was and is . There's  alot of history presented and that's interesting. I've been to Jordan twice so, I enjoyed reading about places  I had visited . Maybe in thirty years time when many of the persons in this memoir are gone we'll learn more information about the reign of Queen Noor . Read this book if you want to learn about politics and history but don't expect to learn much about a person.
