      I am not going to describe the plot, since you can read it on the jacket of the book, but it was very well developed.  I felt  I understood the characters very well and I cared about some of them. This is a great story for a book discussion. I don't think I have ever read a novel about the people of a German village during the time of Hitler.  I highly recommend this book
