 I hestitaed for a long time to read this book because of its subject (the rape and murder of a child). Please don't let this subject prevent you from reading this book. The crime is at the beginning of the book and is not detailed. The little girl(the victim) narrates how her tragedy effected her family. It sounds as if this is a real downer story, but it isn't. The little girl helps her family discover her killer and there is divine justice at the end. Please read it.
