     A Place of Execution is well written. Val McDermid was able to capture the atmosphere of a very, very small rural community. It moves a little slow at times. Maybe the first part should have been edited more. The second part of the book is at a faster pace. The character are well drawn and the plot is interesting. I would recommend this book. I rate this an A-
