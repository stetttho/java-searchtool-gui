    I rate this crime book an A-. The story was interesting as well as the investigation techiques presented. I didn't bond with the lead investigators. I did feel sympathy for some of the characters. Three women are killed in arson fires that burn so hot that very little is left. Meanwhile, there is a boy who lives with an abusive stepfather. The boy has a relationship with a kind pyschic .The boy's story and the fires come together. For its lenght, this book is a quick read. This novel however, could have been edited more.This was my first Ridley Pearson novel and I would read him again.
