 After I purchased this CD/DVD combo, I brought it yesterday to a church where I go to rehearse for Sunday services. Everybody who saw the DVD portion of this disc was blown away. A friend of mine kept shaking his head and saying, "Where did I go wrong?" He had wanted to learn the piano but found he couldn't. (Fortunately he went on to become an airline pilot for TWA, so he didn't do so badly.) But that left the rest of us scratching our heads over how it is that these kids are so wonderfully talented, and the rest of us aren't. They're so young, and yet any one of them can play a 19th century technical monster with all the aplomb and grace of a Vladimir Ashkenazy or a Marc-Andre Hamelin. What gives with these kids? Well, for one thing, they are all very devoted to their craft, spending as much as 6 or more hours a day practicing, and that helps. (I don't even spend 6 hours a day watching television except when it snows like today and I can't get out.) For another, they are very much in tune with each other. Now I've heard recordings of so-called monster concerts before (i.e. concerts where 16 pianists are all banging away at once on eight pianos.) Those concerts always sounded like you were really listening to 16 different pianists who were only slightly together. But with the Browns, the sound is so together that it sounds like what I'm listening to is a single pianist who just happens to have ten arms and hands and fifty fingers.  So my best recommendation is that you buy this album and play it for your friends and watch their reactions. Then they'll want to buy their own copies, hopefully, unless they try to steal yours like one of my friends did. You will not be disappointed.
