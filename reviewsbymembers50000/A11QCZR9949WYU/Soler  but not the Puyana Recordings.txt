 When I first saw this CD advertised, I thought it might be a reissue of the album produced by concert artist Raphael Puyana many years back. While I was somewhat disappointed to discover that it was not, I was otherwise delighted with the whole of this unusual set of CD's. It is wonderful to own at last all the concertos written by Soler for two organs. The only flaw here is that the organ pieces were recorded in Italy and not with Spanish organs which sport a fair amount of honking reed pipes. Still, the musicians have managed to capture the magical Spanish rhythms of Soler's work. The second CD contains an interesting selection of sonata's for harpsichord, along with the hypnotic "Fandango." While I am still hoping that the Puyana recordings of Soler's works will be reissued, I am grateful for the fact that these CD's have been placed on the market.
