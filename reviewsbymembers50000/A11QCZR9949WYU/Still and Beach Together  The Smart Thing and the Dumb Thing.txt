 Okay, the people who put together this CD didn't have a bad idea to begin with. Ask any decent musician about who gets slighted as a serious composer and he/she will probably say African Americans are not taken seriously and neither are women. So why not take two important works, one by an African American and one by a woman, on one CD? They couldn't have made a better decision. Both Still and Beach are great lyricists. Their symphonies are top notch and deserve to be better known. So far it seems like a good decision all round. But now comes a slight problem. Beach's symphony is about 50 minutes long and Still's symphony is also very long. They both won't fit on one CD. So the solution becomes to slice and dice the lesser known of these two works, Beach's Gaelic Symphony, and that was a tragic mistake, especially since this particular recording of the Afro-American Symphony is so well done. The only real solution, as I see it is to get the works on two CD's. Fortunately, there are three other recordings of Still's symphony and one other recording, much more substantial, of Beach's to choose from. So this CD gets three stars from me for the superb performance of the quirky and bluesy Afro-American Symphony and none for the Beach which I will now have to get on the other CD. The guys who thought this whole thing up should have thought of that in the first place. Now that would have been really smart.
