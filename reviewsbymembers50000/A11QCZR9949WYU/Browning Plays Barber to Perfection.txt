 This particular CD is great for two reasons. First, you get all the solo works for piano composed by American composer Samuel Barber including his sonata, all four Excursions, and the Ballade and Nocturne. Second, everything recorded here is played by John Browning, acknowledged as THE top performer of Barber's music. With a combination like that, you just can't go wrong.
