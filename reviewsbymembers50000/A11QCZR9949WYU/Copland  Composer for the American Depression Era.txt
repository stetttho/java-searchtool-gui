 I will never forget the day that I first found a 33 1/3 recording of The Tender Land in Bailey's Music Rooms on Church Street in Burlington, Vermont. I made my way up the hill to the Billings Student Center, found an empty listening booth, opened up the record, and started it spinning. When I heard the glorious ending of the First Act: "The Promise of Living," I dissolved into tears. Now it is many years later, and there's a new recording, this time a more complete version, but a chamber version at that. I can only say that this work still moves me even today as it did then, and the chamber version seems a much better rendition than the one I originally owned for two reasons: First, because it's more complete, so the plot makes better sense. Second because it is a chamber version, it has a greater tendency to evoke the stark realities of Midwest farmlife in the depression era. Copland essentially grew up as a composer during that era, and it is worth studying some of his starker piano pieces, especially the Piano Variations and the Piano Sonata, to see how he evolved from a spare style that beautifully evoked the America of his day to the more substantial works that came later: Appalachian Spring, Billy the Kid, Rodeo, and this great opera called The Tender Land. If anything, this opera is proof that the lessons he learned during the Depression were not lost on him, and became the basis for all the great music that followed.
