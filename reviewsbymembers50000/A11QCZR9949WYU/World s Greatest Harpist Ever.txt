 For a long time now, I have wanted to own a recording of Harpo Marx playing his favorite instrument. Like many of you, I remember those stunning performances included in many of the Marx Brothers movies. Well, none of these performances come from those films, but they are a treasure all the same. Harpo made these recordings in collaboration with his son Bill who was a talented musician and arranger. I think you will agree that the two of them have created a classic.
