 For me, nothing evokes so strongly the human struggle with concepts of God and Faith than does these three symphonies contained within a single set. These works, including the Serenade, cover a period stretching from the early days of American involvement in World War II until the late 1970's. His first symphony, based on Jeremiah, begins the struggle but doesn't resolve it. The second, written for piano and orchestra (here the piano part is played beautifully by Lukas Foss), is based on W. H. Auden's play THE AGE OF ANXIETY and follows the form of that work. (He did essentially the same thing later when he wrote the Serenade based on one of the dialogues of Plato.) The epilogue of that symphony offers some hope at the end of that struggle. But in the Third Symphony, Kaddish, we are again plunged into the depths of the conflict, and more overtly than ever before. Again, there is a sort of resolution at the end, but not an entirely satisfying one, and I suppose that really is as it should be. For those wishing to study these symphonies to see what you can get out of them, I would highly recommend getting a copy of Auden's AGE OF ANXIETY and Plato's Symposium which forms the basis for the Serenade either here on this website or from your local library. I warn you that these works are not for the feint of heart. Expect to do some very serious investigation, but I do promise that such an investigation will pay very high dividends.
