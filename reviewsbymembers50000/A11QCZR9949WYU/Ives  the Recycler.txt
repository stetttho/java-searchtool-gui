 It is a well-known fact that many composers have gotten into the habit of rewriting and/or recycling older compositions as something new. For example, Handel recycled a lot of his organ concertos as concertos for harp and/or harpsichord, as well as a number of recorder sonatas. Ives was very keen on recycling his own works in different formats. One only has to peruse certain of the Ives songs, for instance, to realize that some of that material showed up in his symphonies. His fourth symphony alone sports two movements which were recycled: one from the first string quartet, and one from a song. It is refreshing to see, at last, a collection which demonstrates so thoroughly Ives's process of recycling not only his own tunes but other people's as well. In particular I was pleased to see that this recording includes "Calcium Light Night" which uses George F. Root's "Tramp! Tramp! Tramp!" Also we have what is perhaps the first recording on CD of The Pond, which Ives wrote as a tribute to his father who used to play "Kathleen Mavourneen" on the trumpet at a pond near their home in Danbury, Connecticut. I was surprised to learn that Ives had rewritten The Pond not just once but twice. I find myself in agreement, by the way, with the other reviewer concerning the omission of the song "The Cage" which is a lovely and very brief song. However, this particular song is available on other recordings of Ives's work, such as the recording of Ives songs by Jan deGaetani and Gilbert Kalish, so I didn't miss it that much.
