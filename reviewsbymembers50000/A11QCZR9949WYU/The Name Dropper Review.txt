 Okay, forget Ashkenazy. Forget Argerich. Forget Perrhia. For pianistic skill and interpretation, Hamelin has risen to the level of Rachmaninoff and Art Tatum. This CD will convince you that he IS the Bill Gates of keyboard performers. He certainly makes the rest of us piano players look like rather wearisome ivory ticklers. All kidding aside,I think Hamelin has proved that he can simply do anything he wants with a piano. I am hoping that, in the not too distant future, he will tackle the Ives First Piano Sonata and Liszt Sonata in b minor. We can only hope.
