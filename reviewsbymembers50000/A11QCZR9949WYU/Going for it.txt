 With yet another stunning performance released on DVD, I find myself again reviewing one of their sterling effortless efforts. This time around I want to comment on their repertoire which is far from being a classical standard repertoire of any sort. When I was the age of the youngest brother, I was very interested in learning to play the piano compositions of Aaron Copland and Charles Ives. My college professors thought that I should not waste my spirit on these unimportant works and that I should spend more time working on pieces by Bach, Beethoven, Brahms, and Mozart. When I looked at what the Browns are working on and how they choose to perform the pieces they play so well, I began to realize that someone very near and dear had probably told them to "Go for it. Follow your bliss. Work on what really appeals to you and run with it." I am particularly interested in Melody's approach to the two Gargoyles compositions which she plays with youthful exuberance. I noticed that same youthful exuberance in her rendition of Debussy's L'Isle Joyeux on the first album, an exuberance which I have found lacking in performances of this work rendered by older, more conservative pianists. And all the Browns are the same with regard to this. Whether performing separately or together, their repertoire allows them to show their talent in the best possible light. And there will be time for the more conventional composers later. For now I say to them, "Go for it. Don't hold back." And then just sit back and enjoy the show.
