 Recently, I discovered a score for one of Beach's two hermit thrush pieces at the Dartmouth College Bookstore. Since I am from Vermont, and the hermit thrush is the Vermont state bird, I was more than intrigued by this piece: "A Hermit Thrush at Morn." I was amazed to find how modern this piece sounded, at least for the day in which it was written. Parts of it were based on the Wagnerian style so common in late nineteenth century music, but there was a feel about this, as though the bird whose song she had copied had unwittingly dragged her into the modern era. While I would not avoid listening to Beach's more substantial works on this CD, such as the stodgy "Prelude and Fugue, op. 81," I find Beach is more interesting in her shorter pieces which are full of fun and good humor. You should also check out the last CD in this set, FIRE-FLIES.
