 Amy Marcy Beach was born in the United States just after the end of the Civil War and died very late in 1944 just months away from the end of World War II. As a musician, she was largely self-taught and not by her own choice. She would have liked to get some training, but the strictures of the male-dominated society in which she grew up limited her education and, to some degree, her options for a professional career as a musician. Despite all these obstacles, she was able to pursue a very active life as both pianist and composer, and it is her importance as a composer that is highlighted in this CD and the two others in this set. Although Mrs. Beach was not a distinctly American composer in the same way that Gershwin, Ives, and Copland were, she had a penchant for nature, and used it extensively for inspiration in her work. While most of her work is derivative, being solidly based on European conventions and styles, her nature pieces mark her as a very distinctive and modern composer. I highly recommend from this album "A Peterboro Chipmunk," "Young Birches," "A Humming Bird," and "By the Still Waters," this last being very modern indeed. And although the other pieces on this CD are European in style, they will not disappoint you.
