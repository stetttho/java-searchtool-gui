 Mr. Lewenthal always had a flair for the dramatic, sweeping onto the concert stage wearing a red lined cape which he would remove before sitting at the piano. This collection of concertos and works by Alkan is no less dramatic, especially the Von Henselt Concerto which shines above the other recordings of concertos on this collection. However, I am most attracted to the second CD in this set which includes Lewenthal's fiery version of Liszt's Totentanz and a collection of quirky piano pieces by Alkan. It's almost a misnomer to call Alkan's Sonatine a short work for keyboard. The Sonatine is 35 pages long, longer than many Beethoven Sonatas, and yet Alkan referred to it as a sonatine. I would also like to call your attention to the Funeral March for a Dead Parrot. Alkan, of course, collected parrots and loved to write marches, such as the excellent Le Tambour Bat aux Champs in this collection. The original program notes for the 33 1/3 recording for this piece which I used to own implied that Ray Lewenthal himself sang the basso profundo part found toward the beginning of the march. The text consists largely of the words "A tu dejeuner, Jaco?" which is the French equivalent of our "Polly want a cracker?"  This is a classic recording and an absolute must-own for fans of Ray Lewenthal.
