 Born in Bogota, Colombia, Raphael Puyana has been a major player in the world of harpsichords for a long time now. He was a student of Wanda Landowska, and his crisp, scintillating performances really grab the ear. I tried to get this particular recording from another website and they were unable to get a copy for me. Then I tried Amazon, and they got it to me right away. And to think I might have missed out hearing these brilliant renditions of Bach if I had not tried to find it here.
