 When I first saw this album advertised in a catalogue, I was somewhat skeptical about yet another version of the Ives "Concord Sonata," until I noticed that it was performed by Mr. Hamelin. I happen to own several CD's recorded by Hamelin of the work of Charles Valentin Alkan, and recorded very well. That made me curious as to how Hamelin might handle the Ives work, so I ordered the CD. I was not disappointed. He manages to capture the spirit of Ives's work better than any recent recording I have heard including the Gilbert Kalish. But in my opinion, the best performance ever of this work is still the one made by John Kirkpatrick. I am still waiting for that one to be reissued on CD, but in the meantime, the Hamelin is the best version anywhere.
