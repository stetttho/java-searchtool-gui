 I bought this CD on a whim due to the uncanny ability of "Seven Nation Army" to stick in my head and I can only say this is an absolutely incredible album. My personal favorites now are "Black Math" and "Ball and Biscuit." For a time I did not fully realize what exactly drew me so intensely to it until someone said to me regarding the Whites "I'm not into classic rock." Then it hit me: as a lover of late-60's to early-80's rock from S&G to the Stones to early punk, this album works some magic to recall to mind the days when rock was what I would hesitate to call "pure" but seems to avoid description otherwise.  Oh, and don't let the quirky cover fool you: this album does not contain a shread of gimic. Elephant is packed with very solid lyrics and some truly amazing electric guitar passages that make me keep turning up the volume. I find it hard to get all the way through this CD becuase I keep wanting to hear the songs over again as soon as they have finished.
