 I bought this CD after hearing Rufus on the soundtracks for Shrek and Moulin Rouge. I was at first a tiny bit disappointed because the style differed so greatly from his rendition of Hallelujah, which was the basis for my purchasing it to begin with. After a second listen, however, I really enjoyed it. He has a unique style that does a good job of complementing such an amazing voice. My only criticism was that the songs California and Grey Gardens were a bit redundant. Check out Greek Song, Poses, and One Man Guy, which I feel are the biggest gems on the CD. Definitely a great album, I'll probably be buying his first one soon.
