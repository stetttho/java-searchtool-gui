 I first read this book at ninteen and hated it for the first few chapters, but thankfully it was required reading so I was obliged to continue and thus it developed into one of the most meaningful books for me to date - years later it still holds a place of honor in my mind's anthology of great literature.  I did not find that I related that much to Holden personally, but his general ideas, insecurities, and his desire to feel as if he has a place where he can belong and feel loved (hence the inclusion of the crucial character Jane, who is never actually in the story) are characteristics that not only teens but adults can relate to. In a way, it is a comfort to me becuase it serves to remind me of what it was like being a teenager and how throughout that poetentially difficult period in life we are not as alone in our feelings of confusion and desire to feel some peace as we may think we are. While I would not call this a "feel good" book by any means, the vulnerability that comes through in Holden's inner monologues is touching and heartfelt in it's truth. I love this book and think that it has something to offer everyone, no matter what age you may be upon first reading it.
