 I watched this movie on TV a few nights ago for the first time and absolutely loved it. I know some of you may be wondering why I gave it five stars, but it was just so unique yet adorable that I had to. I am a Ewan MeGregor fan and watched it on the basis of his being in it and it was just one surprise after another. I just kept going "what in the world?" and couldn't believe some of the stuff those people thought of - like his morphing dreams/realities, the two angels, the entire ending... Hmm... Anyway, it was just all around such fun to watch because it was so unexpected and hilarious. Few movies can get away with being totally bizarre and out there while still maintaining a bit of normalcy and sense, but this is one of them. Definatley a must-see for anyone who likes romance, comedy, or just plain goofy movies.
