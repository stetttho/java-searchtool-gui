 As a Simpsons nut I was so excited to buy this set. My favorite Simpsons episode ever is "Bart Verses Thanksgiving" so I was thrilled to find it a part of the set, since I didn't know when it had been aired before. Also, it has twice as many episodes as the first set but only costs a couple dollars more, so you get more Simpsons for your buck. My only complaint is the DVD menus make you wait too long between screens to actualy get around to seeing the show. Less spinning, more Simpsons, please.
