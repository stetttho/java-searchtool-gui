 I bought this and the next day tried the recipe for basic madeleines on the cardboard band that it comes wrapped in. They turned out great and didn't stick at all. Also, they came out so cute I felt like a gourmet chef or similar. The only thing I found though, was they needed less time in the oven than the recipe said.
