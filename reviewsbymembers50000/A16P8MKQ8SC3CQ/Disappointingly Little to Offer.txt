 I bought this book based on other reviews, thinking I would be provided with a lot of unique and fun suggestions for activities, but everything in it is pretty commonplace. There is little that the authors offer that someone with a little creativity of their own could not think of without spending money on a book. I was also expecting a bit more explicaiton for the ideas, but they pretty much just consist of a heading with very little development. I already knew I could brew beer at home, I bought the book thinking they would have told me how to do it, not just that I could do it. They are essentially saying: "Here are a lot of fun ideas, but we'll just suggest them to you and you can plan it on your own." Plus, a lot of the ideas aren't my idea of fun at all, such as sitting in on a town meeting. This book could have been a lot better if they'd spent more time developing fewer ideas, or just made it larger to develop them all a bit more. I rarely regret buying any books, but I  definitely regret buying this one. Cute idea, but not well thought out at all.
