 I bought this book based on the positive reviews it received from other customers as well as the cover pattern. It was delivered today and I just finished printing out the return label from Amazon. While the bolero jacket on the cover does conatain an interesting texture and is attractive, it is the ONLY pattern in the book that, in my opinion, merits a positive review (and even that is a stretch for the "fitted" jacket as the sizing begins at 38" for a small, something that I, with a chest measurement of 32" could never wear without looking rediculous). The other patterns reminded me of 80's and early 90's knitting patterns. That is to say they are primarily shapeless, baggy, uninspiring, and out-dated (here under the guise of being themed after a specific design style, which I, having an art degree, could see no evidence of). They remind me of the free patterns that come with cheap craft store brand yarns (a few throws and pillows were of this nature).  If you do not like the kind of patterns I described, do not be fooled into thinking that there is anything unique or interesting in this book just because the cover pattern is promising. You will just end up wasting your money mailing it back. I suggest at least looking for it in the bookstore first to see what the rest of the book looks like, something I should have done as well.
