 okkervil river listens like reading someone's diary: embarassinly personal, full of all the things you never wanted found out, tearing away your pervious conceptions until you are almost sick from too much truth. will sheff's voice catches you off-guard, sometimes almost like a male chan marshall in it's tentitive quavering and at other moments worthy of a tennessee williams play in it's intensity. my personal favorites are "the war criminal rises and speaks" and "the velocity of saul at the time of his conversion." i don't see the point in comparing these guys to anything. if you do, they're bound to come up short for something like pretentions to uniqueness. okkervil river can stand alone.
