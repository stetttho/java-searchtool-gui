 After several second-rate Astrud compilations, Verve has finally reissued her one recording with the Walt Wanderly Trio, with bonus tracks and 20-bit digital mapping that results in great clarity and seperation of sound.  The  six tracks from these sessions tacked on to the end of BEACH SAMBA was a  cruel and unusual teaser for Astrud fans, not to mention the smattering of  tunes that ended up on various compilations.  But one no longer has to  spend a small fortune ammassing the tunes from these compilations in order  to reconstruct a piecemeal version of the album, because Verve's "By  Request" series has finally come through.  In my opinion, this is the  greatest summer/springtime record of all time: the echoing organ, the  percussion, Astrud's vocals--one can't help but picture a polka-dotted  beach ball bouncing around on South American shores.  Astrud's voice, while  never technically stunning and more Chet Baker than Ella Fitzgerald, serves  as a stunning counterpart to the small combo's rhythmic drive.  Honestly,  at times you'd think it was a nonet rather than a trio due to the rich  production style that sounds much more like Joao Gilberto's recordings for  World Pacific than the subsequent West-Coast influenced Getz recordings.   The majority of the tunes are uptempo, with only a couple of ballads thrown  in for balance.  The Portugese cuts are excellent ("Nega Do Cabelo  Duro", "Voce Ja Foi Bahia"), as well as "Goodbye  Sadness (Tristeza)" and the minor hit "Call Me".  For the  price, this is a magnificent bargain.  Now if Verve would only put out a  remastered version of the recording she did with Jobim (apart from the  antiquated, horrible-sounding SILVER COLLECTION disk), all would be  complete.
