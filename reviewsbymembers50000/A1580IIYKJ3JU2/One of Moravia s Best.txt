 At long last, Moravia is once again available in translation.  Apart from his first work GLI INDIFFERENTI, IL CONFORMISTA is probably the author's most successful novel.  Well, the most infamous anyway.  The setting is  fascist Italy just prior to the Second World War and the plot is loosely  based on the assassinations of two of Moravia's cousins who were political  activists standing up to Il Duce's regime.  Moravia takes these events and  constructs a masterpiece of postwar Italian fiction, relentless and loaded  with insightful ironies.  There are some major differences between the  novel and Bertolucci's film, which is wonderful in its own right.  So don't  let that deter you from reading the book.
