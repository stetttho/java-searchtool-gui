 The other reviewers are right on the money.  This, along with A CERTAIN SMILE, A CERTAIN SADNESS with the Walt Wanderly Trio, is Astrud's best recording.  The first twelve tracks or so are the sessions she cut with  Jobim in 1965, of which "Aqua De Beber" is the masterpiece.   There are also some interesting song selections that are pretty atypical  for Astrud, including a nice version of "Who Can I Turn To?"  BUT  PLEASE, I BEG YOU, REMASTER THIS DAMN THING!!!  Not only is the sound  quality and separation totally erratic, but the first several seconds of  "Dreamer" have been truncated off!  Therefore, I have dropped it  from five to four stars.  For God's sake, the sticker on the back of mine  says PRINTED IN WEST GERMANY!!!  WEST!!!
