 Kracauer's "Salaried Masses", finally translated after seventy years, is a fascinating study of Weimar society, with a particular emphasis on the workforce and the dynamics between employers and workers.  This  analysis, along with his collection of essays entitled "The Mass  Ornament", shows a side of Kracauer that surfaces only occasionally in  his more popular works like "From Caligari to Hitler", a side  that is highly critical of social institutions, especially those structured  upon a fascist hierarchy.  His discussion on the tactics employers use to  train and pacify workers is outstanding (early secretaries were taught to  type with the rhythm of music coming from a phonograph; the corporate  "trainers" slowly increased the speed of the record until the  women were typing with sufficient speed).  The role of company-sponsored  sports or recreational events (baseball, picnics, etc.) does not escape  scrutiny and it's amazing how relevant much of this material is in today's  corporate-dominated culture.  It's a brief and highly-engrossing read that  anyone interested in the functions of social institutions should enjoy.
