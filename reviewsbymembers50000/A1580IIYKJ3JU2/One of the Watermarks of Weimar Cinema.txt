 Pabst's "Die Bchse der Pandora" is one of the best examples of late Weimar filmmaking and probably a good starting point for those new to the genre itself.  The story combines two of Wedekind's plays,  "Erdgiest" and "Die Bchse der Pandora", into a single  script, albeit highly condensed and abridged.  Wedekind scholars would be  aghast (and were).  Nevertheless, this is definitely the high point of  Brooks' undeservedly-short cinematic career, and the rest of the cast is  exemplary as well, especially Fritz Kortner.  Many point out the  "erotic" elements of the film, but this is marginal at best and  usually only touted by those smitten with Brooks herself, who has attained  a cult status over the years, primarily due to her virtual disappearance  from film after the 1930's.  This print, reconstructed from piecemeal  versions scattered around Europe after the end of the Second World War, is  excellent, with a new piano score by Timothy Brock.  A DVD version of this  film would be nice.  Then they could offer the alternate endings which were  tacked on by shocked censors in the late 20's, such as LouLou's devoting  the rest of her life to the Salvation Army at the close of the film, after  realizing the errs of her "evil ways".  And yet another version:  European censors, who couldn't stand the immorality of a father and son  falling in love with the same woman, deleted the intertitles that indicated  the two men's relationship, therefore inadvertently making them appear to  be homosexual lovers, a fluke which surely won them no brownie points with  the Third Reich.
