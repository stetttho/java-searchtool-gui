 Finally, someone had the common decency to reprint Moravia intranslation! And they also picked the best titles.  Il Disprezzo (TheContempt) is the best, most honest, unflinching look at the disintegration of a relationship that I have ever read.  Last released in the States in the 1950's, with the inauspicious title A Ghost at Noon, this is the same excellent translation by Angus Davidson, who translated almost all of the authors works up until his death in 1990. If you've ever experienced the conclusion of a long-term relationship and for some masochistic reason want to remember what it was like, this is the book for you.  I guess that's not a ringing endorsement. But trust me, Moravia's penchant for psychological details is so devastatingly on-point, you'll find yourself nodding nauseatingly at the pathetic delusions and convoluted rationalizations taking place between the couple.  It should be noted that this isn't the book's only focus.  Quite uncharacteristically, Moravia tackles popular culture and the highbrow-lowbrow dichotomy in a darkly humorous fashion.  I haven't seen Godard's film adaptation but I understand that it is an incredible achievement in itself.
