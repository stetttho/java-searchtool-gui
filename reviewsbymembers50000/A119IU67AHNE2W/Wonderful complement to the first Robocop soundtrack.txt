 In many ways, my reaction to the Robocop 3 album is similar to my reaction to the first Robocop score release:  It leaves me wanting more!  However, as a whole, I'm happy as can be to hear Poledouris return to some of my favorite themes.  The album is just a bit shy of 30 minutes and includes variations and reworkings of many of the themes from the first Robocop movie.  Two notable thematic additions are the eastern-flavored Kanemitsu theme (heard only briefly in OTOMO UNDERGROUND) and the patriotic-sounding theme for the Resistance.  I was personally hoping to hear more of the Kanemitsu theme, but unfortunately there is only that brief cue.  For those looking for the Robocop march/theme, you'll get a few tastes here as well.  This CD isn't quite as strong as the album for the first film, but that doesn't mean that it isn't good.  If you're a fan of Poledouris or simply a fan of Poledouris' Robocop theme, this makes for a great complement to the first score.  However, if you don't own the score to the first Robocop film yet, I would recommend getting that one first.
