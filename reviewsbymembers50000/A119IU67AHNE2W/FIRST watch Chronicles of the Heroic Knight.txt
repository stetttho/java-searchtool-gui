 (UPDATE: I wrote this review for Legend of Crystania, the MOTION PICTURE, but apparently Amazon displays this review also for THE CHAOS RING.  If you're looking for a CHAOS RING review, please skip this)  As a bit of background info, in RECORD OF LODOSS WAR: CHRONICLES OF THE HEROIC KNIGHT, Ashram and Pirotess leave the island of Lodoss and set out on their own, and in LEGEND OF CRYSTANIA: THE MOTION PICTURE, you can see what became of them.  However, the animation style of LEGEND OF CRYSTANIA: THE MOTION PICTURE is rather plain and does not even attempt to match the character style and animation set forth in the Lodoss OVA or TV series.  The overall plot is rather mediocre and focuses on a completely new set of characters.  Ashram and Pirotess are really only marginally involved in the plot, which makes it an even bigger disappointment, as they are the sole tie to the rest of the Lodoss universe (and my only reason for buying/watching CRYSTANIA).  If you haven't seen this, you aren't missing much.  If you want more Lodoss, go watch RECORD OF LODOSS WAR: CHRONICLES OF THE HEROIC KNIGHT instead.  However, if you're a Lodoss completist, you might want to check it out, just for the sake of finding out what happened to Ashram and Pirotess.  The bottom line is, don't expect too much from CRYSTANIA if you're coming to it as a Lodoss fan.
