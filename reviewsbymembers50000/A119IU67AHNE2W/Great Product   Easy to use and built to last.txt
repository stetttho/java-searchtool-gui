 I own and have used this KVM for years and it's great!  The thing is built rock-solid so it's survived its share of moves and drops.  Even if you only have 2 machines, it's nice to have 4 ports in case you want to hook up another machine to troubleshoot or whatnot.  Switching between the 4 ports is also nice and convenient, because in addition to the front-mounted button, you can also just tap the Scroll Lock key twice, followed by the port number 1-4, or the up/down arrows to switch between your machines.  I've used it with various versions of Windows as well as a various Linux distros and have had no issues.  Overall, this thing has been awesome and I'd recommend it to anyone.  My only complaint is that it can only emulate a standard keyboard and Intellimouse-type mouse, but this is a general issue with most all KVMs and probably more due to keyboard and mouse manufacturers not allowing KVM manufacturers to emulate their products.  So if you're new to KVM's, be aware that if you have a fancy keyboard with tons of extra multimedia buttons or you have the latest greatest gaming mouse with tons of extra side buttons, you'll most likely lose that functionality when you plug it into a KVM switch, unless you switch your drivers back to a standard generic mouse/keyboard.
