 Active Server Pages (ASP) has proven to be a very popular technology for web developers. The main reason for this has been ease of use. Even though ASP can run on other platforms, it is mainly found on the Windows platform. The advent of Microsoft's .NET framework has caused many people to wonder about the future of web development for windows based developers.  'Professional ASP.NET' is aimed at existing ASP developers who are considering the move to .NET. The authors begin the book with various introductions, i.e. ASP.NET, .NET framework and the main languages that it supports. The emphasis then shifts to the bread and butter aspects of ASP.NET, the server controls, data access, debugging and error handling. The book also covers some important issues such as the architecture and how to use and extend the intrinsic server controls. Chapters are also dedicated to Web Services and other devices such as phones and PDAs.  Chapter 23 is concerned with the issues involved in migrating your existing ASP applications to ASP.NET.  The final chapter is a case study of implementing a simple n-tier e-commerce application with ASP.NET.  All in all the standard of ASP books from Wrox have been high in the past and the leagacy of books such as 'Professional ASP 2.0' lives on with the latest offering.
