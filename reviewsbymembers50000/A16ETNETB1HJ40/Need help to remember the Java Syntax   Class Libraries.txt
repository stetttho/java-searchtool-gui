 This book is for developers with programming knowledge that want to quick learn all the main concepts in Java. The book is made up of three main parts;  an introduction to java, description of the Java syntax and finally solutions to common Java related problems.  Most of the book is reference material, devoted to describing the Java syntax and class libraries, just what a new Java developer needs.  Flicking through the book, the reader will notice that nearly every page has either a diagram (UML class diagram), a source code snippet or a table. This helps to break up the text and make the book very readable.  The following topics are briefly presented in the book:  * creating and using objects  * methods (call by value, call by reference)  * main packages and classes in the Java 2 library (System, Files, JDBC,AWT, Swing, Collections).  We would recommend this book to new developers but also others needing a quick reference book on Java. It does not cover everything in detail but it will help developers that keep forgeting the syntax.
