 The aim of this book is to explain VB.NET to newcomers and developers that have used other programming languages. The first two chapters cover the absolute basics of .NET and VB.NET. The next five chapters explain VB.NET programming using lots of screenshots of the new Microsoft IDE.  In a few cases the author repeated the same text on different pages but this may be intentional to reinforce the concepts. The author explains all the steps to get your first application developed and running. We liked the way the pages are organised with lots of screenshots to explain the necessary tasks. Learning to program can be a daunting task for any newcomer; hence this book is an excellent learning resource. There are 18 example applications and even the first application is not just a simple Hello World program, so the reader will learn a great deal whilst they progress through the book. The database section of the book is very good and covers most of the database related tasks that would be required in real life projects. The last section briefly covers web forms and web services. This moves more into the realm of ASP.NET but it provides a good insight. As an educational tool for readers new to programming, it is very good but programming veterans will find this book slow in places.  If you are a VB developer and want to learn VB.NET, this book may be too basic for you, however it is excellent for starters. We can see how this book would be useful to college/university students learning programming for the first time. We would thoroughly recommend this book to people interested in learning to program.
