 This book is devoted to C++ developers with aim of integrating XML technologies. The author assumes basic knowledge of C++ and XML.   The first chapter summarises the concepts used in XML and DTD. DTD limitations are addressed in chapter 15. XML fragment examples are used throughout the chapter. The second chapter gives a brief over view of the XML family of technologies (including XLink, XPointer, XPath and XML transformation). Chapters 3 - 8 discuss processing XML with C++. Topics include Event-driven processing (expat - non validating XML parser) and C++ wrappers and example code. Chapter 4 cover SAX and C++ with fully code example (XML trimmer). Chapter 5 goes further into detail about SAX C++ 2.0 and more advanced topics. Chapter 6 and 7 show the power of DOM. The chapters include an XML editor with full source code. Chapter 8 provides a detailed look into SAX and DOM from an Advanced C++ programmer perspective, covering design and memory allocation. Chapter 9 introduces XML Schemas, TREX and other modeling languages. Chapter 10 looks at both XPath and XPointer with C++ source code examples. XSLT Transformations are described in chapter 11, with examples of using conditions, low and high level api. The chapter concludes with a sample application (vxslt). This chapter could have been much longer and more detailed, however the author gave a good overview of XSLT. MSXML, Xerces and Xalan are the main toolkits developers are using to implement common activities. Chapter 12 presents these toolkits with simple C++ examples. Chapter 13 is interesting because it is about XML Messaging and creating XML-based extension languages for C++ programs. Chapter 14 focuses more on XML messaging with an overview of SOAP and XML-RPC. The final chapter covers XML's role in database representation, such as serialisation and communication of database data. Some of the code examples are Microsoft Visual C++ specific but most code should also work with other C++ compilers on other plaforms. The author has done a good job in summarising the main topics of interest for C++ developers and does not venture into too much unnecessary detail. We would recommend this book to all C++ developers what really want to make use of XML in their applications. visualbuilder.com
