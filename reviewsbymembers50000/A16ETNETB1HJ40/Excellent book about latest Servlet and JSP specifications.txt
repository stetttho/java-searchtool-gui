 This book is for those readers that understand Java and are familiar with Servlets and JSP. It is a sequel to the very successful Core Servlets and JavaServer Pages by Marty Hall. Its main focus is to explain the Servlet specification 2.3 and JSP 1.2. This includes coverage of Filters, portable web security and new tag library capabilities. The first chapter describes how to setup the popular Servlet/JSP engines. The next two chapters cover an introduction to Servlets and JSP. Chapters 4 and 5 explain how to deploy and web.xml. This also includes your first main taste of filters in this book.  Later chapters explain web application security (configuration and programming based), filters (examples include logging), application events framework (such as listening to changes made to session attributes) and loads about the new JSP 1.2 tag library improvements. This book is totally focused on Servlets and JSP, so don't expect anything on EJB, UML or J2EE design patterns. What we really like about this book is that it is packed full of useful source code snippets and handy configuration settings. Even if you don't use one of the servlet/JSP engines mentioned you will find many useful topics. Another good book about Servlets and JSP, which should be on your bookshelf.
