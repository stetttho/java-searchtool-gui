 The book's first chapter introduces eai  and an overview of j2ee technologies. Chapter 2 discusses choices and strategies when deciding on integrating applications. It can be quite dry and academic at times but worth reading. Many fundamental concepts are presented and provide the building blocks for the rest of the book. There is no real mention of j2ee or java in this chapter, the strategy is universal across different component models and architectures (j2ee, corba or .net). There are chapters on ; how j2ee could be used for eai. when in the project to integrate. what are the different techniques used to integrate. How can xml and messaging be used for eai. Modeling process using uml. There are two chapters focusing on corba and rmi-iiop Chapter 12 shows how to integrate using ejb. This also covers using ejb 2.0, message-driven beans and cmp 2.0. The reader should be familiar with ejb, cmp, bmp and the value object design pattern. The book also has chapters on the j2ee connector architecture, windows com bridges, transaction management (ots, transaction api), security management, presentation and finally web services. The section on security and single sign-on is interesting. This book is aimed at java developers with a few years experience. You will need good knowledge of java and some knowledge of xml, uml and component architectures (CORBA, ejb). If you need to understand how to integrate your new j2ee solution to use existing (legacy or otherwise) applications then this is a good book to read.
