 This book is all about learning lessons from common Java server-side development failures. It is aimed at intermediate java developers that have a basic understanding of design patterns. Bitter Java is all about applications and examples of antipatterns and refactoring. It is about finding a problem and then going through the various solutions (continuous improvement). We found the relationship between the first two examples ("Magic Pushbutton" and "Magic Servlet") very interesting. The author has a good method of explaining the problems to new Java developers. The first solution included the command and MVC design pattern. It is refreshing to read a book that comments on techniques included from Jakarta Struts. Problems addressed in this book include: 	Monolithic Servlets and JSPs 	Caching dynamic content 	Memory leaks 	Database connection overuse 	XML misuse 	EJB Round-tripping 	Entity bean misuse 	Lack of coding standard  	Performance tuning This is one of those books that you will want to read from beginning to end. We found the many personal stories before each key topic very enjoyable to read. Web page references are used throughout the text (mostly from IBM's web site). This book is packed with useful design tips and techniques for the serious Java server-side developer. Go and buy this book because you will want to read it many times.
