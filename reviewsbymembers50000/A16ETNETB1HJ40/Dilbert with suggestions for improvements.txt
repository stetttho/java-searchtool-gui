 As developers, we often go with the corporate flow and take for granted all the sensible techniques we learnt as students. This book will make you rethink and remember all the crazy comments made by our managers. Similar to the way the Dilbert books mocked corporate culture and behavior, this book provides the useful tips to improve our surrounding environment. The first few chapters give scenarios for popular misconceptions such as why a programmer will not code all day, illogical decisions made by executives, vague requirements and seeing yourself as an enemy. After you read about the story about the networking solution using floppy disks, we are sure you will be able to relate it to your own experiences. Many of the answers are based on playing corporate politics and soft non-technical skills. The book covers the author's personal experiences as he talks through the various issues. This book is compulsory reading for any new programmer and a necessary wake up call for professional developers.
