 Professional JSP (2nd) is a huge book with over 1000 pages and 18 different authors. This book is aimed at developers seeking  intermediate and advanced knowledge about JSP.   The first 4 chapters cover the basics of web development, servlets and JSP. These chapters could have been taken out to focus more on advanced topics (such as integrating with EJB). Chapters 5 and 6 present JSP pages working with servlets and JavaBeans. This includes a simple implementation of the MVC design pattern using JSP, Servlets and JavaBeans.  Chapter 7 focuses on the Web Application Architecture wih more detail about designing JSP based applications. Chapters 8 - 11 go into detail about Custom Tag libraries, from building a simple tag library to custom tag idioms.   Chapters 12 -17 include topics such as Java and XML, JDBC, Security, Filtering and good practice.    Chapter 18 goes through the implementation of a maintainable database explorer.     The rest of the book covers debugging JSP, improving performance, Jakarta Struts, WAP, Generating Binary Content and using JSP within the Java 2 Enterprise Edition. Many JSP developers will want to read this book to learn about Struts and other ways of producing maintainable JSP based web sites.     This is not the kind of book you would read from start to finish but as a quick overview and reference of some advanced topics. Don't expect to become an expert by reading this book but you will have a good idea what you can and should do with JSP. Most JSP developers will find something new in this book but some will require more detail. We would recommend this book to JSP developers who have read the beginners JSP books and want to learn more about JSP.
