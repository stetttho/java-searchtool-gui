 This film is a textbook example of how difficult it is to translate a book into a movie. Good as it is, as well cast and acted as it is, the movie still cannot get into the interior of the characters the way that David  Leavitt's book does.   The change of setting from New York to London works  well because the basic issues are universal. For those people struggling  with the issues that this movie presents, it is a godsend. There is no  sugar coating of the marital issues that Owen and Rose must face. Eileen  Atkins is marvelous in her  subtle portrayal of the suppressed rage,  resentment, frustration and fear mixed with love that she feels towards  Owen. Owen's dilemma is well portrayed and his breakdown and reaction to  his son's coming out is perfectly on target. One wishes that the episode of  the botched phone call were better filled in. In the book it represents a   cry for help and an almost blind reaching out that  is thwarted by the  reality of indifference and mocking irony of the target of a prank. The  movie glosses over and changes the situation making the impact much  less. The movie was produced for television by the BBC and WNET and the  scale is right for the small screen. The only jarring and inexplicable note  are the interludes of the disturbed child and the crane. This is taken  directly from the book and is equally jarring in that setting. The author  is making a metaphoric point but it eludes me. That said, definitely see  the movie but if you can, please read the book as well. You will find it  enlightening, moving, and perhaps life-changing.
