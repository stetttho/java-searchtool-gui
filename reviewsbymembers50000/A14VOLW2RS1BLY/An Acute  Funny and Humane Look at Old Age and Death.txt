 Memento Mori--"Remember you must die"--is the persistent message that intrudes itself into the characters here, a collection of very elderly Englishmen and women of the mid-1950's. Don't be put off by the message,  although most of the characters are. This is not a gruesome book. It is a  humane, gently hilarious and deadly accurate depiction  of what happens to  people as they reach and live in old age. The message is a foil for the  author's revelation of the individual natures of her characters.  I was  amazed that I laughed out loud at several points, so acute are Ms. Spark's  observations. If you have known very old people or are one yourself, at  least one who has a sense of humor and irony, you can appreciate the  universality of these people and their attitudes.  The individual  characters are bound to their own times and situations, youth in the high  Victorian Empire and the years thereafter into the twilight of the post war  traumas of diminished England. But I am certain that wherever you are, if  you have known old people, and observed them interacting with each other,  you will recognize Spark's cast of characters and their adventures.  The  loves and hates, successes and failures that marked their youth are all  carried forward and nursed. People bide their time to avenge, in mundane  and petty ways, the petty slights and bullying of their spouses and friends  accumulated over a lifetime.  It all comes together memorably in a very  readable way.
