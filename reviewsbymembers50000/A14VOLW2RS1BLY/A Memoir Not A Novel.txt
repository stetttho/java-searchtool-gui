 If you approach Ravelstein as a memoir rather than as a novel you will not be disappointed by the minimal nature of plot and the rambling nature of the narrative. Allan Bloom apparently was a fascinating individual and as Bellow has done in previous works for other memorable individuals such as Delmore Schwartz in Humboldt's Gift, he creates the work around the larger than life personality of one of his friends while he himself acts as narrator and sidekick.  The most valuable effect that reading this book had on me was that it led me to read Bloom's Closing of the American Mind, a monumental work of erudition and opinionated impassioned analysis. For that reason alone, it is worth reading Ravelstein.
