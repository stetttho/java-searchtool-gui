 In the 30 odd years since I read this book it has never been far from my thoughts. It has changed my understanding of how people think and how they look at their world. I cannot do true justice its impact.  We are apt to  think that people are the same wherever and whenever they lived. This is  probably a legacy of our democratic, universalistic heritage. It is also  what gets us in trouble when we get involved abroad in changing other  nations and their societies. Auerbach shows us that humankind is not and  has not been alike in its thoughts, aspirations and character but has  distinctly changed and varied over time and place. By closely reading,  analyzing and comparing texts of different periods through time, the author  demonstrates how the structure of language interacts with the structure of  thought, how the way one writes delimits ones vision. This is a more  radical thought than its converse that the way we think affects how we  write. To Auerbach, an early medieval religious writer, because of the way  that Late Latin worked, could not think the way a classical author could.  This seems intuitively wrong to a person who has knowledge of one language,  but if you have ever tried to translate anything beyond the simplest  sentence, you can appreciate what Auerbach means. This is one of those  books that stay with you for a lifetime.
