 It has been over 30 years since I first was enchanted by this book. I have read it at least twice since then and it is never far from my thoughts. The observations about the 15th Century that Huizinga made over 70 years ago  have an immediacy to the world that we live in today. When the phenomenon  of Madonna and her secular and semi-sacreligious use of Catholic imagery  burst on the scene, I immediately recalled Huizinga (though it was maybe 15  years since I had read the book). This book along with Erich Auerbach's  Mimesis are giants of the 20th Century's understanding of the past. Any  educated person should be familiar with this book.
