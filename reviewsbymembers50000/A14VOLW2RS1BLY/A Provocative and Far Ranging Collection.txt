 Edmund White is one of the foremost novelists of our day. He is also a literary critic and social observer of the first order.This collection of essays and reviews spans the period of the late 60's through the mid 90's  and charts the changing views and mores of the gay world of which White is  an important member. In addition, White's literary analysis of both well  known figures such as Nabokov and lesser known poets and authors from all  over is acute and thoughtful. White's discussion of his own work is  invaluable to those of us, like myself, who are devot?s and places it  within the greater context of literature. Reading these essays and reviews  made me want to explore further the authors and poets favored by the  author, and that is what literary criticism is all about.
