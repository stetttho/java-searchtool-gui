 If you think that James Dean invented the Rebel without a Cause, read The Counterfeiters. It is easy to see that this book could outrage "cultural conservatives" especially those who never bother to  read it but condemn it by its reputation or blurb. On the surface, one may  think it is "epater les bourgeois."  One could easily call it  scandalous in the matter-of-fact treatment of how the younger characters  behave amongst themselves and in relation to their elders.  But in the  end, the message of this book is highly moral. It is a warning against  naivete, complacency and delusions about others and oneself. In our  dealings with those we love and care about, we fail to communicate our true  feelings and thoughts out of timidity, self-absorption, pride, fear, spite  and ignorance. (A good word for one cause of miscommunication that probably  is taken from the original French is "pique.") Even the desire to  protect the object of our love causes us to lie and hide the truth. Because  of our lies and omissions we suffer immeasurably and cause others to  suffer.  In a tribute to the power of love, Gide generously grants his  best characters the opportunity to redeem themselves. The worst characters  remain stagnant behind masks of insincerity or fall into hopeless  degradation. Some of the characters in this book are truly evil. They reach  a crescendo of depravity made possible by the misplaced good intentions of  those who could have stopped them earlier. And one gets the sense, that as  in life, even after the most horrid events, the surviving characters will  muddle through, some having learned something valuable, others having  learned little or nothing.
