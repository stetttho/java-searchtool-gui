 This collection of Thomas Mann's early short works presents one of the greatest authors of the 20th Century in an expert and fluent translation, unbowdlerized.The title story, Death in Venice, is an example of lush late  Romanticism in its most extravagent and vivid form. Mann, as always,  dramatizes the tension between the bourgeois life of strict propriety,  symbolized by the renowned Gustav Aschenbach, the protagonist, a literary  titan specializing in learned tomes, and the seductions of art and beauty  as symbolized by Venice and Tadzio, the focus of Aschenbach's fatal  obsession. Some might find the description of the dissolution  and its  content as repugnant. But if you allow yourself to visualize the words as  written and at least allow yourself to feel something of what Aschenbach is  feeling, you will be transported outside of yourself strangely and  hauntingly .The other stories, including Tonio Kroger, an earlier work that  brought Mann great renown after the publication of Buddenbrooks, his first  novel, are also wonderful examples of how the tensions of art and life,  growing up and thinking affect their main characters. Not to be ignored is  the sexual tension that pervades all of Mann's work and is deeply embedded  in  his consciousness. (I highly recommend Anthony Heilbut's critical  biography of Mann for an understanding of the man, his work and the context  of German life, literature and history in which it was written.)
