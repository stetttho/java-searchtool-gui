 This is the final volume of the trilogy that includes A Boy's Own Story and The Beautiful Room Is Empty.The book is much longer, covers a longer period and is more rambling than the other two. Some of the prose is  intense to the point of eliciting disgust. This can be a turn off but you  must remember that White is writing from much pain and from a perspective  much closer to the events he is describing. There is a good deal of  self-pity, but after all the AIDs epidemic hit the author very hard. I  suppose this is a roman-a-clef and it can be fun trying to figure out who  the characters represent.Don't read this book before you read the other  two.
