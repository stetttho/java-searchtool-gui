 Eric Ambler specialized in stories of international intrigue featuring unlikely protagonists.  Dirty Story is no exception.  You'd have a hard time finding a protagonist more unlikely than the very weasel-like Arthur Abdel Simpson.  By birth Simpson is 50% British and 50% Egyptian.  But by nature he is 100% chiseler.  When circumstances dictate that he leave Athens rather abruptly in order to avoid arrest, Simpson finds himself signing on with a mercenary security force in French Equatorial Africa.  This despite the fact his background and temperment make him utterly unsuited for such a job.  Dirty Story is about a violent border dispute over mining rights between two third world nations.  Be forewarned that most of the native Africans in this novel are spoken of in very disparaging and racist terms by the white characters.    Ambler is a very skillful and clever writer.  The narrative moves along quite smoothly and a number of astute, insightful observations about geopolitics are made.  This novel clearly is one of Ambler's lesser works, but worthwhile reading nonetheless.
