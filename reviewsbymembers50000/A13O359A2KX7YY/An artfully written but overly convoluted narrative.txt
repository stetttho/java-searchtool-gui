 To refer to Nick Chalmers of Pacific Point, California as a troubled young man would be completely understating the case.  The truth is he's guilt ridden to the point of being suicidal. Private eye Lew Archer, whose newest client is Nick's mother Irene, is determined to unravel the complex web of events that has brought Nick to the wretched mental state in which he now finds himself.  The Goodbye Look serves up plenty of typical Ross Macdonald fare as the narrative, an exceedingly complex one even by Macdonald's standards, unfolds.  Three families, the Chalmers, the Truttwells and the Swains are plagued by a series of intertwined tragedies that have played out over 25 years and more.  As Archer traverses much of the southern California landscape steadfastly trying to sort out this sordid saga of murder, larceny, infidelity, parental malfeasance and hidden identity, the reader is drawn into Macdonald's world.  A world where the sins of the father's are invariably visited upon the children and one's destiny is determined before one is old enough to have any say in the matter.  Enhancing this book's interest quotient is the fact that Archer himself becomes an active participant in the ongoing soap opera when he engages in sex with a married woman.  Not just any married woman, but one who has, as it turns out, played a key role in the mystery Archer seeks to solve.  As is the case in most Lew Archer novels, the dialogue and descriptive prose are first rate.  However, The Goodbye Look is not quite as strong as some of Macdonald's other work because the plot is so twisted that its unravelling raises as many questions as it answers.  Readers, particularly those who are already Ross Macdonald fans, will enjoy certain aspects of this book.  For example, a scene where clues are found by viewing a decades old home movie is particularly well written.  But overall, The Goodbye Look ranks a notch or two below the author's best work.
