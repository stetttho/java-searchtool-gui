 Ross Macdonald is best known as author of the Lew Archer series of hardboiled detective novels.  But he also wrote a few Lew Archer short stories. The Name is Archer consists of 7 of these stories. The writing in all 7 stories is first rate.  Each of the narratives flows along smoothly.  Macdonald consistently uses a very descriptive brand of prose that quite effectively brings  the reader vivid images of what is happening as Lew Archer tackles the very worst of what humanity chooses to dish out.  Ever the cynic, Archer delivers some very funny wisecracks, a number of which are priceless. As for the plots of the individual stories.... well suffice it to say that some are better than others. One of the best is story #3, The Bearded Lady.  In it, Macdonald covers many of the themes that can also be found in his novels.  These include: jealousy, greed, betrayal, infidelity and the consequences of having an inadequate father figure.  Any fan of hardboiled crime fiction will undoubtedly derive enjoyment from reading this book.
