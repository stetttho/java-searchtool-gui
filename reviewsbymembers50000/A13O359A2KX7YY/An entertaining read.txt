 Bino Phillips practices criminal law in Dallas and he's very good at what he does.  When one of his lowlife clients, a drug pusher named Sonny Starr, is murdered, Bino suddenly finds himself at the center of a major federal investigation. This entertaining novel is populated by a number of colorful characters.  Besides Bino himself, there's Karen Allen a sexy FBI agent, two ruthless redneck criminals named John-boy and Buster, a bookie known as Half-a-Point Harrison and many more. But author A.W. Gray is at his best writing action scenes.  Particularly well done is a segment describing a store robbery as it horrifyingly unfolds. Bino is a quirky, irreverent book that does for the city of Dallas what Elmore Leonard's fiction has done for Detroit.
