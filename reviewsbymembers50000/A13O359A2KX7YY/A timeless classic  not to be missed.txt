 For many people, mention of the name Sam Spade quite understandably conjures up an image of Humphrey Bogart.  But Hammett had in mind a detective with a very different type of physicality.  His Sam Spade is tall and blond.  To look at him is to see a "blond satan".  In any event, the fast paced plot of The Maltese Falcon revolves around a mad race for possession of a priceless statuette, the falcon of the book's title. Three supremely greedy thieves vie for sole ownership of the bejeweled bird.  They are: Brigid O'Shaughnessy (if that's her real name) the seductive femme fatale.  The well spoken, gluttonous Casper Gutman. And Joel Cairo, the effeminate "Levantine".  An unwary Sam Spade finds himself suddenly thrust into the midst of this unholy trinity's machinations as he seeks to find out who killed his partner in a shooting that takes place between the first two chapters.  Hammett's writing is extraordinarily strong.  He has a unique way of structuring his sentences in a simple yet elegant fashion.  The story itself is complex and far from spiritually uplifting.  Murder, greed, deception and double-crossing suffuse the entire narrative.  And the hardboiled Sam Spade, though certainly not satanic, is no Boy Scout to be sure.  The Maltese Falcon is arguably the book that brought the hardboiled crime novel into popular acceptance.  It's an American classic and a must read.
