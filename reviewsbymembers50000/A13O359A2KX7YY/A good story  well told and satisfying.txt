 Eric Romstead would be the first to admit he didn't know everything there was to know about his father.  Hell, he hadn't even seen the old man in four years.  But when he's told by police that his father was killed in a drug deal gone bad, he knows full well that isn't the real story.  Man on a Leash by Charles Williams is an exciting, suspenseful murder mystery told as a third person narration.  Williams consistently employs detailed descriptive passages that serve to draw the reader right into the action packed plot as it swiftly unfolds.  Moreover, Eric Romstead, his murdered father Gunnar and key supportive characters are well fleshed out and realistically depicted.  This is a fine example of mystery writing.  A compelling story with realistic characters told in straightforward fashion.  You can't ask for more than that.  Highly recommended.
