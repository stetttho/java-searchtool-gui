 The narrative of Stormy Weather unfolds like a soap opera on LSD.  In it, Carl Hiaasen skillfully interweaves several plot threads each riotously funny in its own right. With a hurricane ravaged Miami as backdrop, the author uses a large cast of colorfully bizarre characters to expertly lampoon life in South Florida. Found among the many subplots are the following: While on his honeymoon, New York ad man Max Lamb is abducted.  Not by space aliens but by a scary hermit called Skink, who happens to be a former Florida governor.   As she searches for her missing husband, Bonnie, Max's bride, meets and becomes attracted to Augustine Herrera.  Augustine is one of the book's more normal characters.  That is if you overlook the fact he enjoys juggling human skulls for relaxation. Two hapless con artists named Edie and Snapper take up residence in a stranger's hurricane damaged house with plans to collect the sizable insurance payoff. A corrupt building inspector named Avila is a devoted follower of Chango, a santeria god who seems to require increasingly exotic species of animals for sacrifice. And there's much, much more. Stormy Weather is great satire.  Filled with the most outrageous dark humor imaginable, it just drips with cynicism.  Another outstanding comic novel from the warped but nimble mind of Carl Hiaasen.
