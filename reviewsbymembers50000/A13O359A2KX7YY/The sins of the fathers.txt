Of course, as with all Ross Macdonald novels, the case at hand only represents the tip of the iceberg.  Archer, ever the tenacious investigator, finds that a series of unhappy events ocurring in the distant past has culminated in little Ronny's abduction.  Fast paced and compelling, the narrative of The Underground Man is artfully written.  Macdonald employs countless descriptive phrases that are deliciously original and extremely....well, descriptive.  The dialogue is engaging and authentic sounding.  And the many characters are sketched out in a way that gives them a realistic feel.  As for the plot, it's an intricate one.  Ross Macdonald novels are never otherwise.  Artful, challenging and satisfying, The Underground Man is an excellent example of Macdonald's best work.
