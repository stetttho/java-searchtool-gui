 Dead Line is the third entry in Brian McGrory's Jack Flynn series.  It's every bit as good as the two earlier novels, The Incumbent and The Nominee, and that's saying a lot.  This time out the extremely likeable Mr. Flynn finds himself embroiled in a very interesting case that pushes his skills as a newspaper reporter to their limit.  Early in the narrative, a young attorney named Hilary Kane is murdered, presumably because she has uncovered new information about a brazen, 13 year old multimillion dollar art heist that has remained unsolved. The case assumes political undertones once Toby Harkins, the son of Boston's mayor, Dan Harkins is implicated in the theft.      There's plenty of action as Jack's frantic search to find Hilary Kane's murderer takes him to Rome and Paris and subsequently back to Boston.  His devotion to the case makes him a target and on more than one occasion, he finds himself in mortal danger.  No matter how harrowing the situation, Jack never abandons his very appealing, largely self-deprecating sense of humor.  Dead Line also contains a number of interesting subplots which serve to add substance to Jack's persona by exploring his relationships with other characters.  Three such characters are his girlfriend Elizabeth, his pet dog Baker and his coworker Vinny.  Their presence helps the reader appreciate Jack Flynn in all his three dimensional complexity.  Another solid 4 star effort featuring the thoroughly entertaining Jack Flynn.  Dead Line is an engaging thriller written with plenty of good natured wit. Read it.
