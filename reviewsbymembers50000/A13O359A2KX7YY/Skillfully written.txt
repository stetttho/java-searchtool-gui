 This pamphlet sized publication is really a short story which can easily be read in one sitting. It's about an ex-con and a mystery woman who meet one stormy night and are forced to take flight from the woman's rich boyfriend as well as the police. Hammett's craftsmanship as a writer is well demonstrated here.The dialogue is superb; crisp, uncomplicated and studded with 1930s slang.  The narrative portion of the text is equally remarkable with sentence structure that can best be described as elegant in its simplicity.  Hammet provides the exact amount of information necessary to move the story forward.  No more, no less.  Leaving to the reader's imagination the tasks of fleshing out the characters and supplying the individual backstories that have led up to the unfolding drama contained in this compelling and cogent work.  Woman in the Dark is a great example of storytelling at its best.
