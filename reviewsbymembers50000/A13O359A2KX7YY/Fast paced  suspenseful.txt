 College senior Phoebe Wycherly has gone missing and her wealthy father, California oilman Homer Wycherly is desperate to find her.  So, he hires veteran PI Lew Archer to track her down.  Most of the narrative unfolds in northern California, many miles away from Archer's home base in Los Angeles.  Reading The Wycherly Woman is a real joy because the plot, though complex, is smoothly laid out with each chapter logically leading to the next.  Also contributing to this novel's enjoyment quotient is the smart and plentiful dialogue Macdonald provides his characters.  As Archer steadfastly pursues the facts behind Phoebe's disappearance, the suspense builds and builds.  This has the effect of making The Wycherly Woman one of Ross Macdonald's most engaging mysteries.  I do, however, have to deduct one star from the rating.  The plot device on which the solution to the mystery rests, is based on one character assuming the identity of another with the use of a rather transparent form of disguise.  Though one could believe that some might be fooled by this, Macdonald has structured the plot such that Archer himself is also taken in.  And that goes against everything we know about the ace detective's ultra acute powers of observation, especially when it comes to "reading" people.  A flawed yet extremely well written example of hardboiled detective fiction.
