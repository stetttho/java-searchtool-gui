 Savage Art is a truly remarkable work of scholarship.  In it, Robert Polito meticulously separates out fact from the considerable amount of mythology that surrounds Jim Thompson's life. Since so much of what Thompson wrote is autobiographical in origin, a knowledge of Thompson's very unusual life history helps the reader better appreciate his work.  So it is not at all hard to argue that this is not only a well written and fascinating biography, it is an important one as well. Polito explains, in exacting detail, how Thompson's life and consequently his writing was influenced by the interpersonal and societal forces he encountered as he matured.   To put it another way.  Jim Thompson's worldview was shaped, nurtured and, some would say, warped by his life experiences. He then took this unique worldview and used it to interpret the self same experiences which formed it. The result is Thompson's very significant contribution to 20th century American fiction.  Dark, disturbing books inhabited by sad, desperate characters trapped in hideous circumstances.  These are novels that boldly explore areas that would otherwise be unexplorable. Savage Art is very much a monumental achievement.  Essential reading for Jim Thompson fans.
