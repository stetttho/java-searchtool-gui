 The Long Goodbye is a novel with lots of meat on its bones.  The plot is engaging and complex, the characters are all extremely colorful, the dialogue is superb and the descriptive passages are in a league of their own.  Chandler also provides us with an abundance of social commentary while exploring a number of important themes. One of these themes is the nature of friendship.  At the start of the book, Philip Marlowe, a well established literary character notorious for being a cynical loner, finds a friend.  The friend's name is Terry Lennox and he's what could be described as a lovable lush.  When Terry confesses to committing a brutal crime, Marlowe is unable to believe his friend could ever be capable of such a thing and, against all odds, looks to vindicate him.  Along the way, Marlowe meets Eileen and Roger Wade, an unhappily married couple who belong to roughly the same privileged social circle as Terry.  A fabulously successful writer of romance novels, Roger is also a tormented alcoholic.  A good deal of the book is concerned with examining the Wades' dysfunctional marriage. This is a wonderful book, full of insight and bursting with humanity.  It is a marvelous showcase for Raymond Chandler at the height of his literary powers. Highly recommended.
