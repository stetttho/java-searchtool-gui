 This early Lew Archer novel starts off in straightforward fashion.  Mrs. Samuel Lawrence of Santa Monica, a poor but proud widow, hires Archer to find her missing daughter, a young nurse named Galley.  Archer goes where the clues lead and soon finds he is involved in something more than a simple missing persons case.  Slowly but surely, the hardboiled PI becomes immersed in the sordid world of heroin addicts and dealers.  The Way Some People Die contains plenty of good dialogue as well as numerous descriptive passages notable for their insightful detail.  The intricately constructed narrative contains several intriguing plot elements that are ultimately tied together in the final pages.  A 4 star effort, not quite up to the standard of Macdonald's best work, but nevertheless a worthwhile read for hardboiled crime fans.
