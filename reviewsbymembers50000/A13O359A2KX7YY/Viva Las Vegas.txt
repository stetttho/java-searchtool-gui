 In this the 4th installment of the Tony Valentine series, James Swain expands his horizons by incorporating subject matter related to international terrorism.  A wise move.  Because, let's face it, after a while the different ways of cheating at cards begin to sound very much alike to readers not intimately familiar with the gaming life. Loaded Dice takes place in Las Vegas, the site of the first Tony Valentine novel, Grift Sense.  And some of the same colorful, interesting characters introduced in that book reappear. There are a number of engaging subplots which simultaneously unfold over a very short period of time.  Tony uses his brains, brawn, agility, computer skills and marksmanship to save the day on several occasions.  Not bad for a guy who, in one more year, will be eligible for Medicare. This is a very entertaining, tightly written novel.  And like Swain's 3 other Tony Valentine books, it is extremely readable.
