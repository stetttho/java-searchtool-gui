 Few fictional characters score as high in the category of likeability as does Jack Flynn, The Nominee's main character and sometime narrator.  Jack is an investigative reporter for The Boston Record, New England's most respected daily newspaper.  Two major storylines dominate the narrative of The Nominee.  Lance Randolph, the governor of Massachusetts, has just been nominated to be the next U.S. Attorney General.  Jack has reason to believe Randolph has a secret in his background that will scuttle his Senate confirmation and is waiting for the right moment to go to press with what he knows.  Secondly, when Jack's close friend Paul Ellis, the Record's CEO, becomes a homicide victim, Jack takes it upon himself to identify the murderer, thereby placing his own life in jeopardy.  This highly readable novel has many interesting subplots which serve to flesh out Jack's persona.  Like his on again, off again relationship with the lovely Elizabeth Riggs, a reporter for a rival Boston paper.  Furthermore, author Brian McGrory's writing style is quite engaging, consistently displaying an unselfconscious brand of wit throughout.  A solid 4 stars for this second novel in the Jack Flynn series.  It's a great follow-up to McGrory's equally engaging first effort, The Incumbent.
