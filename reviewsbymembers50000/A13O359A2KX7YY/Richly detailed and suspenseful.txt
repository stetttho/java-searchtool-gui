 In The Red President, Martin Gross tells the story of a closeted Communist who becomes a contender for the highest office in the land.  Intricately plotted and well researched, this novel gives the reader a look at the inner workings of the CIA and the KGB at a point in history that would turn out to be the waning days of the Soviet Union.  Though not quite as jarring as The Manchurian Candidate, to which it will undoubtedly be compared, The Red President is a suspenseful, action packed Cold War thriller that does not disappoint.  It's safe to say that spy genre fans will find this book highly entertaining.
