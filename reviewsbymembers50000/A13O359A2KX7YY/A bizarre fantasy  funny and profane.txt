 Private eye Nick Belane serves as main character and narrator in this profanely funny parody of hardboiled detective fiction.  A foul mouthed, alcoholic loser, Belane plies his trade from the confines of his Hollywood office. With an eclectic cast of supporting characters, including grotesque space aliens that can take human form at will, Pulp is also part science fiction.  This book's strong point is its very sharp dialogue which is, at times, laugh out loud funny.  A 4 star effort, not for everyone.
