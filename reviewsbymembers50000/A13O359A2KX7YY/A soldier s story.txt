 Charles Willeford was a decorated hero in WWII.  But when it came to compiling his memoirs of military life, he chose to recount his experiences in the pre-war peacetime army, both stateside and overseas in the Philippines. This book is the author's autobiography covering the years 1935 to 1939 or ages 16 to 20, when he served as an enlisted man first in the Army Air Corps and later in the cavalry. Since Charles Willeford was a natural born storyteller, it's no surprise Something about a Soldier is an easy and interesting read.  Through dozens of anecdotes related by Willeford in his patented deadpan style, a funny but not particularly pretty picture emerges.  Senseless bureacracy, out of touch officers, mindless work and counterproductive regulations all conspired to make the author's experience during those years a less than satisfying one.   But there were a couple positive aspects to this time in Willeford's life as well.  He had plenty of time to devote to improving his mind through reading.  And he enjoyed a very active sex life thanks to the always available prostitutes, camp followers and other willing women that were part of Willeford's military experience.  Though to be honest, many of the sexual exploits described sound less than appetizing. Something about a Soldier is an entertaining and well written memoir.  The anecdotes recounted reveal a lot about army life and many of them are pricelessly funny.  Worthwhile reading for all Charles Willeford fans.
