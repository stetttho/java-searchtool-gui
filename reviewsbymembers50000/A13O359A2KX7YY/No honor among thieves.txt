 This extremely fast paced story traces the activity of Gerry Kells, gentleman gangster, as he plies his trade in and around Los Angeles.  There are no heroes in this novel.  Only thieves, gamblers, gunmen, blackmailers and corrupt political bosses. Kells is present in every scene.  If he's not being beaten up, he's doing the beating.  If he's not being framed for a crime, he's doing the framing.  Fast One is pulp fiction in its toughest, most socially irredeemable form.  An action packed, fun read.  But one that doesn't quite live up to the hype.  Unfortunately, the new Blackmask Online edition has an inordinate number of typographical errors that are irritatingly distracting.
