 James Swain has really hit his stride with Mr. Lucky, the 5th and latest novel featuring Tony Valentine. The title character, Mr. Lucky, is a nondescript nobody named Ricky Smith, a native of Slippery Rock, North Carolina.  Ricky has somehow managed to win hundreds of thousands of dollars in one fast and furious night of gambling at the tables of a Las Vegas casino known as the Mint.  No one comes by that kind of luck honestly. So Tony Valentine, retired cop and gaming expert, is hired to both prove that Ricky cheated and to gather enough evidence to bring him to justice. While Tony temporarily moves to Slippery Rock to do just that, his son Gerry finds himself in Gulfport, Mississippi where he incurs the wrath of a murderous family of rednecks. Swain skillfully moves the narrative back and forth between these two intriguing storylines.  Consequently, there is never a dull moment in the entire book. Mr. Lucky is a hugely entertaining novel. The explosive first chapter grabs you by the throat and after that there's plenty of page turning action to keep you interested.  Read this book.  You will enjoy the experience.
