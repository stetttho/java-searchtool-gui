 As an investigative reporter who is not shy about getting involved in the uglier side of life, Quinn, the protagonist of Dead Man's Dance, is no stranger to humanity's dark underbelly.  But when he has to investigate the brutal murder of his own stepfather, his protective veneer of professionalism and objectivity is entirely stripped away. Dead Man's Dance is a well crafted murder mystery populated with a host of interesting characters.  Readers know from the onset of the narrative that the killers are two frighteningly creepy hired guns named Hugo and Rick.  The novel's mystery therefore revolves around the identity and the motivation of the person who has paid them to kill. As Quinn pushes forward in his search for the truth he becomes aware that events occuring 3 decades in the past, some of which involve him personally, have led to his stepfather's killing. Robert Ferrigno is a very talented novelist.  The story is nicely paced and quite engaging.  And the characters are well fleshed out and interesting.  I look forward to reading other books by this same author.
