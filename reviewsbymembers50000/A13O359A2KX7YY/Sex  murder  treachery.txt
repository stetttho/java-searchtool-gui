 Find a Victim is a classic example of California noir.  While driving from L.A. to Sacramento, ace private eye Lew Archer stumbles upon a city known as Las Cruces where sordid secrets abound. Archer is a card carrying member of the hardboiled school of criminal investigation.  He's a tough customer who can take a beating as well as render one if necessary.   Early in the narrative, a truck driver is murdered.  As Archer seeks to solve this particular crime, he soon learns of a complex web of betrayal and deceit which binds together a number of Las Cruces' citizens. This novel is about the seemier side of life. Illicit sex is a recurring theme, as are greed and jealousy. MacDonald uses a highly descriptive type of prose, much of which is quite artfully written.  And there are several distinct subplots which are all tied together at the story's dramatic conclusion.  Though I found the narrative to be more convoluted than necessary, I have no trouble recommending Find a Victim to anyone who likes their mysteries hardboiled.
