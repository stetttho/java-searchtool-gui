 The late Charles Williams is perhaps best known as a writer of taut action-adventure novels usually with a nautical tie in (Dead Calm, Scorpion Reef, etc).  He also wrote the very compelling noir masterpiece entitled The Hot Spot.  The Wrong Venus therefore represents a 180 degree departure from William's usual literary fare.  It's an over-the-top comedy about Americans in Paris. This very funny book is populated with a number of interesting characters.  A spinsterish authoress of best selling sex drenched novels, some thoroughly inept kidnappers, a ruthless French gangster and a six foot tall blond beauty of a ghostwriter who's pretty good at judo... to name only a few.  There's also plenty of slapstick action and an abundance of very clever dialogue. The Wrong Venus is a wonderfully entertaining showcase for a  surprisingly different side to Charles William's substantial talent.
