 Now this is a murder mystery worthy of the name. Richly drawn characters, a skillfully constructed plot and an ending which cannot possibly be forseen add up to make Funeral Food a terrific read. And as if all this weren't enough, the reader is treated to an unsentimental portrayal of life in small town America that rings true. Kathleen Taylor can write with the best of them.
