 The year is 1987.  The place, London.  Someone in the British Defense Ministry is funneling top secret military information to the Soviet Union.  John Preston, a British intelligence agent of considerable skill, is handed the rather daunting task of finding out who is doing it and why.  Meanwhile, in Moscow, a diabolical plot is being hatched to bring Communist rule to the British Isles using the most nefarious of tactics.  Frederick Forsyth masterfully interweaves these two storylines using a narrative style that is detailed to the nth degree.  The Fourth Protocal is highly suspenseful and filled with unexpected plot twists.  Moreover, Forsyth dares to employ the unusual and somewhat risky technique of using a real life historical figure as one of the main characters....in this case the notorious double agent Kim Philby.  The Fourth Protocol is an extremely engaging, well crafted and meticulously researched cold war thriller that does not disappoint.  It ranks right up there among the genre's finest.
