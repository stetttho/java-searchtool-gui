 The Criminal by Jim Thompson is a very short novel. A quick read.  But my oh my what a punch it packs.  Fourteen year old Josie Eddleman has been raped and murdered.  The accused is 15 year old Bob Talbert, Josie's schoolmate and neighbor.  Is Bob innocent of the crime?  Probably.  But then again, maybe he isn't. Thompson never completely resolves this question because this book is not a whodunit.  In fact, it is not a conventional novel at all. Thompson has divided The Criminal into 14 short chapters.  Different characters involved in the case each serve as first person narrators in one or two of these chapters.  There's Bob himself, Bob's father, Bob's mother, the DA, an investigative reporter, the defense attorney, etc.  Thompson very skillfully has each narrator give their own perspective on the case while at the same time providing breathtaking insights into his or her own life. This book is a real treat.  Page after page contains great dialogue and vivid introspection.  Seemingly without effort, Thompson addresses a wide variety of interesting and important themes. The Criminal is a masterful work of fiction.  It's the kind of book that reminds us how powerful writing can be.
