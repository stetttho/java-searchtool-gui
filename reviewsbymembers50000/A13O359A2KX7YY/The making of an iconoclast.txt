 In I Was Looking for a Street, Charles Willeford (1919-1988) tells in straightforward fashion what his early life was like.  Orphaned by age 8 and a rail riding drifter by age 13, Willeford's childhood was a tough one.  But there isn't an ounce of bitterness in this memoir.  Instead of cursing his misfortune, Willeford sees each setback he endured, no matter how terrible, as a learning experience.  With a minimal amount of sentimentality, Willeford tells how the middle class life he was born into rapidly evaporated when tuberculosis claimed both his parents and, a few years later, the Great Depression thrust his beloved grandmother Mattie into poverty.  He goes on to compellingly describe his life as a "road kid" among the hobos and tramps who hopped freight trains in a never ending journey to absolutely nowhere.  Fans of Willeford's novels and short stories will definitely want to read this short but amazing autobiography.  Told with the author's trademark matter-of-fact style, the anecdotes contained in I Was Looking for a Street are quite interesting and reveal a lot about the origins of Willeford's unique worldview. Highly recommended.
