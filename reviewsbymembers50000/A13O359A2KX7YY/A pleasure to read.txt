 The Gargoyle Conspiracy is an exciting, suspenseful international thriller that does not disappoint. Ahmed Bel Jahra is a ruthless, cold blooded terrorist operating under the sponsorship of the Libyan government.  His goal is to make a name for himself by assassinating the American Secretary of State.  All that stands in his way is one man, Simon Hunter, a counterterrorism agent for the State Department. Marvin H. Albert has created a truly remarkable story which unfolds in a very skillful manner.  The narrative switches back and forth from Bel Jahra's intricate preparations to Hunter's dogged pursuit of the would be assassin and his accomplices.  In the course of this masterfully told tale, the reader is taken to many interesting locales all around Europe and North Africa and is introduced to a number of fascinating, believable characters. Mr. Albert has done his homework.  That is to say the material presented is extremely well researched. This results in The Gargoyle Conspiracy coming off as frighteningly realistic. This well constructed, satisfying novel is far too good to remain out of print. It deserves to be reissued and widely read.
