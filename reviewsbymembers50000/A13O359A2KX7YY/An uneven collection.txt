 As a huge Charles Willeford fan, I try to read everything by the master I can get my hands on.  Taken as a whole, this collection of 25 short works does not come up to his usual high standards. Six or 7 of the included works do qualify as compelling reading. An unfinished novel entitled "The First Five in Line..." is vintage Willeford. It has wonderful character sketches and  insightfully predicts the current phenomenon of reality TV. Too bad it was never completed. Also among my favorites is "The Man who Loved Ann Landers", a short story consisting of a series of letters by a delusional lumberyard owner to the well known syndicated columnist.  It is hilarious and very well crafted. Unfortunately, too many of the other stories miss the mark by lacking sufficient substance to make for a satisfying reading experience.  The Kafka inspired "Everybody's Metamorphosis", which is apparently intended to be a satire of literary criticism, comes off as just plain tedious.  Exactly the opposite of what one expects from Charles Willeford.   The paperback edition contains several typographical errors that are a minor distraction.
