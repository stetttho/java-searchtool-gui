 This wartime story of murder and betrayal was written by Ross Macdonald early in his literary career.  Before he completely found his voice as a novelist and when he was still known by his given name of Kenneth Millar.  Ensign Sam Drake, an erstwhile journalist, serves the dual role of narrator and protagonist.  Chapter one finds Sam on shore leave in Hawaii.  It's February, 1945.    As Sam and his fellow naval officers enjoy themselves at a party, one of the female party attendees is found dead.  Is it murder or suicide?  And if it's murder does it have anything to do with matters of national security.  These questions continue to plague Sam as he travels stateside.   In typical Ross Macdonald fashion, the plot takes a very complicated trajectory.  Black white racial discord, the 1937 rape of Nanking, fine nuances of cryptography and the Tiajuana sex trade all have a part to play as the convoluted narrative unfolds.  Fans of Ross Macdonald will certainly want to read this early entry in the Macdonald canon.  The richly descriptive brand of prose the author is famous for can be found in abundance.  But much of the dialogue in Trouble Follows Me is stilted and generally lacks the zing found in many of the later Lew Archer mysteries.  Moreover, there is too much reliance on coincidence to suit me.  Suffice it to say that Trouble Follows Me is an easy, interesting read that fails to satisfy in the way that Macdonald's later novels do.  But the hint of greatness soon to come is there.
