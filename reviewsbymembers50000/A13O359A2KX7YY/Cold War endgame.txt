 James Ash is a reporter for the Washington Post.  At least that's his cover.  He's really a Soviet spy, one of an elite group of agents groomed since childhood to infiltrate key institutions in the United States.  But something has changed.  His recent assignments bear little or no relation to the national interests of the USSR.  And to further complicate matters, there is a continual barrage of news from Moscow pointing to the Soviet Union's imminent disintegration. As a result, Ash does not know whom to trust, where to take his orders from or where his loyalties should lie.  He falls for a girl named Jennifer, the host of a call in radio talk show.  But can he really trust her?  Could the FBI or even the KGB have sent her his way? The Last Spy is an intriguing novel which captures the all consuming paranoia that is an unavoidable occupational hazard for any undercover agent.  It has a sufficient amount of suspense and there are several very clever plot devices. All in all, this is an intelligently contructed spy novel which most readers should find quite entertaining.
