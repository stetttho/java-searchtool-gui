 Jack is a former minor league ballplayer who dabbles in breaking and entering. That is when he's not engaged in more legitimate endeavors like carpet cleaning or picking cucumbers.  Nancy is a risk taking party girl with a mean streak a mile long.  The Big Bounce is largely about the odd relationship between these two rather unsympathetic characters.  Nancy wants to use Jack to pull off a big heist.  Jack pretty much just lives from day to day.  The words loyalty, ambition and commitment evidently are not part of his vocabulary.  Elmore Leonard's talent for writing realistic dialogue is well represented here.  As is his signature habit of populating his books with quirky characters.  The plot is somewhat on the thin side and a few of the scenes appear to have been added in for padding.  The Big Bounce is an easy and amusing read.  But not one of Leonard's best efforts by a long shot.
