 Hawk Moon is a well constructed murder mystery set in a rural Iowa community.  Two Native American women, Sandra Moore and her sister Karen, have been killed in a very grisly fashion.  Robert Payne is a private eye and former FBI profiler who is asked to consult on the case by Cindy Rhodes, a local policewoman.  As it happens, Cindy's husband, David, is the main suspect. A similar crime had occurred in the same locale nearly a hundred years before and the author, Ed Gorman, cleverly juxtaposes the current investigation with the one that took place way back then.  A remarkable juggling act to be sure. Some interesting twists are revealed as the plot unfolds and Payne ultimately brings the guilty party to justice in a dramatic showdown at the book's conclusion. That's the good part.  Now for the bad. Quite frankly, I find Gorman's writing style, at times, irritating.  Despite the grisliness of the subject matter, he tends to frequently lapse into a type of maudlin prose that has a smarmy earnestness about it.  Most of this out of place sentimentality gains expression through the musings of the lead character, Robert Payne.  This causes Payne's personality to come through in an unflattering manner, as that of an idealistic Pollyanna. Hawk Moon is an engaging, interesting tale, marred by stylistic choices that detract from its effectiveness.
