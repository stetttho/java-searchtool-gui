 Written some one and a half decades after Ross Macdonald began his professional literary career, The Galton Case has the distinction of being the author's breakthrough novel.  So said no less an expert on the subject than Macdonald himself.  It was in the pages of this book that Ross Macdonald succeeded for the first time in saying exactly what he wanted to say in the way he wanted to say it.  The story is complex yet satisfyingly tidy in structure.  Seventy-three year old Maria Galton is a fabulously wealthy resident of Santa Teresa, California.  She wishes to be reunited with her son Tony who, because of a family rift, has not been seen in over 20 years.  Lew Archer is hired by Mrs. Galton's attorney to do what he can to locate Tony.  Several clues suggest that the missing man may have moved to the San Francisco area under an assumed name.  Archer wastes no time in putting together the whys and hows of Tony Galton's disappearance.  To reveal any more of the plot would be unfair.  Suffice it to say that the carefully crafted narrative is fast paced and extraordinarily compelling.  Macdonald has suffused The Galton Case with a very appealing style of prose that is both smooth and highly descriptive.  And the realistically depicted cast of characters is an exceedingly interesting one.  The underlying messages Ross Macdonald sought to convey in this book and most of his other fiction come through loud and clear: -One's destiny is largely determined at birth. -Depriving the individual of his or her birthright can only lead to disasterous results. -Family is the most important aspect of our lives yet, all too often, family units are irretrievably dysfunctional.  By any and all measures imaginable, The Galton Case ranks among the best detective novels ever written.  A very enthusiastic 5 stars.
