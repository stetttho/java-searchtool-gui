 Two deerhunters cross paths quite accidently.  Acting on an impulse, one of them, Andrew Neville, inexplicably stabs the other to death. After commiting this horrendous act, Neville feels no remorse whatsoever.  Remarkably enough, he then proceeds to take for himself everything the dead man had possessed.  His beautiful wife, his child, his home and even his career. The story is told from the point of view of the killer, making it that much more horrifying.  Added in for good measure are a grubby private eye and a frighteningly creepy groundskeeper.  Author Ron Faust makes good use of an elegant brand of prose that works quite well.  Particularly when it comes to describing nature and outdoor scenes in general. Split Image is a daringly different type of book.  Disturbing and captivating at the same time, it makes for a great reading experience.
