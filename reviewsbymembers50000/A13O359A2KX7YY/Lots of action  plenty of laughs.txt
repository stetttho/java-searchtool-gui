 First of all, let me report some detective work of my own.  At the end of chapter 25, Tony Valentine cites an anecdote which fans of the late Dashiell Hammett will undoubtedly recognize.  It's a close variation of the famous "Flitcraft story" told by Sam Spade in the Maltese Falcon (the book, not the movie). The rest of Sucker Bet is, however, quite original. In this the third installment of the Tony Valentine series, author James Swain takes us on a hilariously over the top joyride through South Florida.   The story is a gutsy one.  Complex and full of surprises but at the same time not overly convoluted.  The plot starts off with Tony Valentine investigating a dishonest blackjack dealer at a low rent Indian casino in the Everglades. But that's only the beginning.  Before long, Tony finds he's become involved in a gangster's scheme to make millions from the outcome of a college basketball game. A lot happens along the way.  Tony is attacked by alligators.  He exposes a clever way of cheating at blackjack.  His beloved neighbor Mabel is taken hostage. And his ne'er do well son, Gerry, cuts short his honeymoon to help his Dad out.   Swain introduces us to a number of really interesting and colorful characters.  Candy Hart, the redheaded hooker who falls for her client.  Splinters, the Cuban limo driver who doubles as a hitman. Bobby Jewel, the 400 lb bookie and many many more.  But perhaps the most unforgettable supporting character is Mr. Beauregard, the ukulele strumming chimpanzee who is smarter and more insightful than most human beings. Sucker Bet, like Funny Money and Grift Sense before it, is remarkable for its "readability".  Page after page and chapter after chapter just flies by. James Swain is obviously a talented writer. It'll be fun to see what else he has in store.
