 Ike Van Savage PI serves as both protagonist and narrator in this intriguing crime novel set in Rochester, New York during the summer of 1959. And author Jack Kelly expertly sets just the right mood to conjure up that place and time.  Van Savage advances the story while at the same time making wry, sometimes comic, observations about human foibles and failings. While this is going on the reader gets to learn quite a bit about Ike's fears and self doubts as well as his personal relationships.  Early in the novel, Van Savage is hired by Vicky Petrone, the beautiful wife of a local crime boss who has reason to believe her husband wants to kill her.  As the investigation unfolds, Van Savage finds out there may be a connection between this case and two other cases he has on his plate.  One a series of arsons, the other an adultery investigation.  Eventually, Ike and the reader both learn in piecemeal fashion that Vicky has a very interesting past that she had failed to voluntarily reveal. So far so good.    My problem with this otherwise appealing book centers around the way in which the various plot elements are ultimately tied together and resolved.  Let me just say that in trying to jolt the reader with a surprise ending, Kelly sacrifices the believability he has worked so hard to cultivate.  The "mastermind" who is finally brought to justice is someone who in the real world would lack the means, motivation and street smarts necessary to carry out the complex web of crime the author has described.   Jack Kelly is obviously a talented writer. A less contrived, more convincing plot, would have made Mobtown a great crime novel.
