 If I had to summarize Dying to Meet You in one sentence, I'd have to say it's a case study of one man's descent into madness. Lowell Marshall was an acclaimed concert pianist.  But tragically, arthritis has crippled his hands and he can no longer play. Now, at age thirty-five, he has no prospects for suitable employment.  What's more, his marriage is rapidly deteriorating.  Lowell decides to seek solitude in a country cottage.  A dank, dismal place with no electricity or running water.  There he finds an old photograph.  Taken well over one hundred years before, it's a portrait of an attractive young woman.  Lowell becomes enchanted with this mystery woman from long ago and his mood immediately improves.  Soon thereafter, he meets Rose Ballater, a seventeen year old girl who lives on the farm next door.  She bears an uncanny resemblance to the young woman in the picture and Lowell becomes convinced he and Rose are soulmates. Dying to Meet You is an engaging tale with a narrative that unfolds smoothly.  Introspective characters, clever plot devices and a highly descriptive writing style all contribute to the substantial appeal of this compelling novel.
