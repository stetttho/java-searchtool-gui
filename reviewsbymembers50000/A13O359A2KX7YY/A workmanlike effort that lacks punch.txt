 This murder mystery contains all the necessary elements.  A clever, likeable investigator who does double duty as narrator.  A clearly delineated sense of time and place.  An intriguing murder with a number of potential suspects.  And a surprise ending which, if not entirely convincing, is at least plausible on some level.   Sam McCain is a 23 year old private eye who also happens to be a lawyer.  He loves the small Iowa town in which he grew up and where he still lives.  Almost everyone is fond of Sam and his only discernible vice is that he smokes too much.  When a woman's body is found in the trunk of an Edsel, Sam is pressed into service to find the killer.  As the investigation unfolds, there are many scenes which serve to evoke the feel of life in smalltown America in the 1950s.  Moreover, author Ed Gorman gives us a fair amount of good natured humor and the occasional moment of poignancy.   For me, two words sum up the mood of this novel, breezy and nostalgic.  Gorman has done a competent, workmanlike job in writing this book.  Somehow though, after turning the last page, I felt vaguely unsatisfied.  It was as if I had completed a tasty meal and still felt just as hungry as I was when I started.  Or as the precocious Sam McCain might have put it, "I guess nostalgia isn't what it used to be".
