 In this riotously funny satiric novel, Carl Hiassen again lambasts those who would dare spoil what remains of Florida's natural wonders.  Greedy real estate developers, unscrupulous lobbyists and corrupt politicians are all skewered with Hiaasen's patented brand of uncompromising cynicism.  Twilly Spree, the environmentally conscious protagonist, serves as Hiaasen's alter ego.  He's young, rich, impulsive and, let's face it, an ecoterrorist.  Also playing a key role is the recurring character known as Skink, the ex-Governor now living under the radar as an eccentric hermit.  Hiaasen deftly adds some very nice touches to enhance the appeal of Sick Puppy.  Among my favorites is the creepy and sadistic hitman appropriately named Mr. Gash.  Also adding to the fun are the side splitting descriptions of staged big game hunts.  A subject so laughable on its face one would think it immune to satirization.  Yet Hiaasen manages to accomplish just that in inimitable style.   Sick Puppy delivers plenty of the kind of laughs Hiaasen fans look for.  Recommended to readers who appreciate humor that is audacious, outrageous, cynical and, yes, a little sick.
