 The Postman Always Rings Twice by James Cain is a seminal work of the noir genre.  Gritty and emotionally wrenching, this book unapologetically exposes the dark underbelly of human nature.    When waitress Cora Papadakis and aimless drifter Frank Chambers first meet, the mutual animal attraction is powerful.  So powerful, in fact, the two of them conspire to do away with Cora's husband, a hapless Greek immigrant. I don't think it would be giving anything away to say things end badly for all concerned.  A short novel with plenty of dialogue, The Postman Always Rings Twice is a very quick read.  Interestingly, the passage of time has served to alter reader perception.  The sex scenes, deemed positively scandalous when the book was first published, are rather tame by today's standards. Nevertheless, you will not want to miss this viscerally intense classic.
