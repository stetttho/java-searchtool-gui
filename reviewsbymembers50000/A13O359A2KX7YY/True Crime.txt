 Everyone has heard of David Berkowitz, the "Son of Sam" killer who terrorized New York for over a year in the 1970s.  But few would recognize the name Craig Glassman, a very average everyman who just happened to occupy the apartment immediately below Berkowitz and wound up playing an instrumental role in his capture.  In Off the Wall, Charles Willeford gives the reader an interesting take on the severely deranged Berkowitz and his claustrophobic, delusional existence.  He does this by juxtaposing descriptions of the killer's life with descriptions of the life lived by his neighbor, Glassman.  Readers familiar with Willeford from his many fictional works will recognize certain aspects of his writing style here.  Like his matter-of-fact, but thorough, descriptions of everyday things such as food, clothing and furniture.  Generally speaking, this true crime book is not as engaging as Willeford's fiction.  The  reason for this is rather obvious.  Because Off the Wall deals with a very real, tragic crime complete with many real life victims, it would be disrespectful and out of place for the author to employ the cynical, iconoclastic and irreverent point of view that usually characterizes his work and in fact has become his trademark.  Off the Wall gives an informative and frightening look into the life and mind of David Berkowitz.  Definitely a worthwhile read, but one which does not afford Willeford the opportunity to display the unique talent responsible for his reputation as a great writer.
