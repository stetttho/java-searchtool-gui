 Lackey Ferguson of Fort Worth, Texas is hardworking, honest and likeable.  Together with his friend Ronnie, he owns a low rent construction outfit.  Plus he has a beautiful and smart fiancee named Nancy Cuellar. When Marissa Hardin, a wealthy customer's wife, is brutally murdered, Lackey becomes the police's prime suspect. This despite the fact the physical evidence indicates he didn't do it.  Meanwhile the real perpetrator, a severely disturbed ex-con, is left free to continue his murderous ways.  Prime Suspect is a well constructed novel about a man's victimization as a result of circumstances beyond his control.  Author A.W. Gray has infused this book with a healthy amount of ironic, sometimes dark humor and the looming presence of the sadistic killer establishes a palpable sense of menace.  The characters are realistically drawn and the plentiful dialogue is both believable and engaging.  I found this book to be an interesting read.  Its strongest feature is the richly drawn cast of characters.
