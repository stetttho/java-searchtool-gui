 Mr. Paradise is Anthony Paradiso Sr., a wealthy 84 year old criminal attorney.  Mr. Paradise pretty much signs his own death warrant the minute he informs Montez, his man friday, that there's been a change of plan.  He's decided to bequeath the house to his granddaughter and not to Montez as he had previously promised.  But Chloe wasn't supposed to die too.  That's Chloe Robinette, a call-girl and Paradiso's favorite playmate.  She wasn't supposed to have been there when the hitmen Montez hired came a calling. Frank Delsa of Detroit Homicide is the lead detective assigned to the case.  Frank is a seasoned investigator who displays a presumably rare lapse in professionalism when he becomes involved in an affair with Kelly Bart, Chloe's lingerie model roommate and a key witness to the crime. This book is a great example of the kind of smart, hip crime writing Elmore Leonard does better than anyone else.  His famously pitch-perfect ear for dialogue has never been more acute than it is here.  And the reader is introduced to an entertaining and diverse collection of really dumb criminals who keep doing inexplicably dumb things.  As the narrative unfolds, Leonard adds in a number of nice touches.  Like a flashback scene where Delsa and his late wife, also a cop, confront a pair of thugs in a parking lot. If there's anything wrong with this book, I couldn't find it.  It's great to see that Leonard still has the touch that has made his writing so distinctive and beloved.  Mr. Paradise ranks right up there with the Dutchman's best novels.  Old fans will love it.  For readers new to Leonard, it's a great place to start.
