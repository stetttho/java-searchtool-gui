 The Golden Gizmo is a tall tale which meanders aimlessly, ultimately winding up nowhere.  Written with sufficient surrealism to easily accomodate a supporting character that happens to be a talking dog, there just isn't anything here to engage the reader's interest. The main character, Todd Kent, is an early incarnation of Roy Dillon, the young L.A. con artist Thompson so masterfully brought to life in The Grifters.  But that's where any similarity between the two novels begins and ends. The Golden Gizmo is a real clunker.  Sometimes even great writers like Jim Thompson will step up to the plate and strike out.  Not recommended.
