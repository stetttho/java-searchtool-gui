 Cast a Yellow Shadow is the sequel to Ross Thomas' debut novel. The Cold War Swap.  Both books feature the team of Mac McCorkle and Mike Padillo, a pair of restraunteurs who moonlight in the adrenaline rich world of international espionage.  Mac's Place, the popular eating establishment they co-own, is now located in Washington, D.C., a world removed from Bonn, West Germany, its original site. The plot revolves around a plan to assassinate the prime minister of a Rhodesia like African country as his motorcade tours Washington's historic streets.  In order to get Padillo to be the triggerman in this nefarious scheme, those orchestrating the assassination kidnap McCorkle's wife.  If Padillo doesn't shoot to kill, Mrs. McCorkle will die. This is an intricately plotted novel of double and triple crossing told with a healthy dose of urbane wit.  Perhaps its strongest feature is the very clever and authentic sounding dialogue Thomas has written for his characters.  Another strength is the realistic way the ambiance of 1960s Washington is depicted. All in all, Cast a Yellow Shadow is a very worthwhile read.  In my view, it's a sequel which surpasses the original.
