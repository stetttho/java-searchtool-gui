 Charles Bukowski's alter ego Henry Chinaski narrates this profanely funny autobiographically based novel.  Bukowski rather coarsely but fairly convincingly puts the lie to the conventional wisdom that honest work is an enobling experience.   In Post Office, Henry Chinaski reluctantly accepts employment first as a letter carrier and later as a postal clerk.  You see, Henry has three expensive hobbies: drinking, fornicating and visiting racetracks.  Without the steady income the post office provides, he would not be able to maintain his chosen lifestyle.  So he compromises his principles and becomes a working stiff. Using a number of illustrative vignettes, Bukowski brings to life the mind numbing drudgery and utter humiliation that comes part and parcel with many, if not most, jobs.  For so many people, work is a trap, a collosal burden that saps their humanity.  And this book does a beautiful job of showing just that. There's also plenty of funny, irreverent material about the women in Henry's life.  Some of whom he rather flippantly refers to as shack jobs. Post Office is politically incorrect, vulgar and frequently offensive.  But it is genuinely funny and a lot of truth can be found in its pages.
