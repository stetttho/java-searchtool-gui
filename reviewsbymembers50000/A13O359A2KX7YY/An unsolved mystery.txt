 Notwithstanding the Hard Case Crime emblem and the provocative artwork that adorn its cover, The Colorado Kid is a  decidedly "softboiled" work of fiction.  But that's perfectly okay.  Stephen King has been around long enough and has paid enough dues to be forgiven for engaging in some harmless bait and switch.  The Colorado Kid succeeds in doing what good fiction is supposed to do.  It transports the reader from his or her own world to an alternative world of the author's creation.  This book is written with such utter craftsmanship, the reader is completely drawn into the idiosyncratic island community of Moose-Lookit just off the Maine coast.  Its residents seem real.  Their conversation and actions are totally convincing.  This marvelous page turner of a novel takes place in the present day.  But it's about a highly suspicious death that occurred some 25 years before.  Let me amend that last statement.  The book is not so much about a suspicious death as it is about our reaction to the mysterious and the unexplained. We never do learn who or what killed the poor fellow who comes to be known as the Colorado Kid.  But King's skillful writing gives our imaginations the opportunity to run wild as we confront the unknowable.  The Colorado Kid distills good storytelling to its essence.  One would be justified in thinking of it as a novel about mystery itself, rather than just a mystery novel. A solid 5 stars.
