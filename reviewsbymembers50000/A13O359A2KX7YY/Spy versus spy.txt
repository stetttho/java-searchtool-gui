 It's the late 1930's and the European continent is poised on the brink of war.  British engineer Nicholas Marlow accepts a position in the Milan office of a machine tool manufacturing company known as Spartacus. Since Spartacus' products are used in the production of munitions, Marlow has access to information of value to those engaged in espionage. A bit naive, Marlow is rather easily sucked into the cloak and dagger intrigue endemic to that time and place and rather unfortunately incurs the wrath of Mussolini's secret police. Cause for Alarm is an engaging spy novel that has a smooth narrative flow.  Moreover, Ambler's detailed knowledge of his subject matter is quite apparent.  A solid 4 stars for this early contribution to the genre.  Well worth reading.
