 The legendary Frederick Forsyth uses his considerable storytelling skill to relate this short but powerful tale.  A young RAF fighter pilot becomes lost in the fog on his way home for the Christmas holiday.  Just as he is about to run out of fuel, another plane miraculously appears and guides him to safety. The Shepherd is a very well written, haunting short story.  One that would have made an excellent episode of The Twilight Zone or perhaps Alfred Hitchcock's old series.
