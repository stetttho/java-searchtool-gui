 Just as Charles Willeford did before him, Scott Phillips writes darkly comedic novels punctuated with shocking acts of violence.  In Cottonwood, Phillips continues this tradition but does so in the context of a well researched story that unfolds in a day and age well beyond the memory of anyone now alive.  Cottonwood, a small fictitious Kansas farming community,  sees itself boom when the prospect of a future as an important hub in the cattle trade materializes a few years after the end of the Civil War.  Narration is provided by the book's main character Bill Ogden.  Ogden is a man of many talents.  A very incomplete list of his skills would include farming, saloonkeeping and photography.  He also is quite adept when it comes to sexually pleasuring a diverse demographic of women, one which ironically does not include his own wife.  Ogden is a bit of a paradox.  Sometimes his actions seem heroic but more often than not the word scoundrel fits him better than anything else.  What is the book about? A number of things. Greed, jealousy, infidelity, lust, murder, the pioneer spirit, the human capacity to do whatever it takes to survive.  Throw in a tornado and a German speaking family of serial killers and you have a novel guaranteed to entertain the most jaded among us.  As he did in his second novel, The Walkaway, Phillips shows an amazing ability to transcend time frames.  The second half of the book takes place a full 17 years after the first and only a few details about what transpired in the interim are spelled out. Surprisingly, this unconventional structure does not detract from Cottonwood's appeal one bit.  This novel is written with a healthy dose of dark humor and it unfolds in a way that gives the reader credit for having a modicum of intelligence.  An enthusiastic 5 stars.
