 The key to Dashiell Hammett's greatness is found in his unique writing style.  His sentences flow effortlessly across the page.  Many imitators have come and gone but none have matched his smooth yet jarring prose.   The Continental Op, or operative, is that nameless San Francisco detective whose personal life away from the job, if indeed he has one, remains the greatest mystery of all.  Edited by Steven Marcus, this delightful book is a collection of seven short stories all of which feature the title character.   Every story contained in this volume is first rate. Each drips with delicious descriptions of greed, deception and betrayal and each is skillfully constructed so as to maximize suspense. Read this book. You will not be disappointed.
