 Murder Book is narrated by the main character Billy McGrath, a 15 year veteran of the LAPD.  There's one unusual thing about Billy. Prior to joining the force, he studied philosophy at the graduate level.  That background gives him an interesting introspective voice that is put to good use in relating the book's unfolding narrative. Guilt ridden and depressed over the imminent move of his ex-wife and beloved daughter out of state, Billy is beginning to exhibit behavioral changes.  He no longer sleeps very much and he foolishly takes risks, some of which could be interpreted as suicidal. Called upon to investigate the murder of Mae Richards, the mother of one of LA's most notorious drug kingpins, Billy recklessly decides to use his position to pursue agendas at odds with his sworn duty to uphold the law.  As a result, some very disasterous consequences develope. With a number of interrelated subplots, including one about a Hollywood celebrity suspected of having killed his wife, Murder Book succeeds in grabbing onto and holding reader interest.  Moreover, there are plenty of surprise plot twists and well crafted action sequences that add to the novel's substantial appeal. This is an intelligently written crime novel which dares to feature a protagonist who, though very articulate and insightful, is a seriously flawed human being.  A solid 4 stars.
