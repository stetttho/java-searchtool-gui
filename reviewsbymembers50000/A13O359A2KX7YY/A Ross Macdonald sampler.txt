 Strangers in Town contains 3 previously unpublished detective stories by Ross Macdonald.  Story #2, which is also entitled Strangers in Town, and story #3, The Angry Man, both star Lew Archer, the fictional PI most identified with Macdonald. Story #1, Death by Water, on the other hand features an investigator named Joe Rogers.  The introduction, written by editor Tom Nolan consists largely of biographical facts about Macdonald with special emphasis on his time spent in the Navy during and just after WWII.  Death by Water (1945) is a very well written, cogent, straightforward murder mystery...with nothing hardboiled about it.  A perplexing death is explained using a certain forensic finding.  I was able to spot this critically important clue a mile away because I had read The Blue Hammer just a couple of weeks before.  And it so happens that the same forensic finding appears in that 1976 Lew Archer novel as well.  (Not to mention the fact that the writers of CSI Miami had latched onto the same gimmick and made it their own in a recent TV episode.) In any event, for what it is, Death by Water is first rate.  Stangers in Town (1950), in contrast, very much belongs to the hardboiled genre.  In it, Lew Archer works to exonerate an African-American youth accused of a brutal murder.  Archer's investigation brings him into contact with organized crime members and some other interestingly shady characters. The plot is a bit contrived, but overall, Stangers in Town is an engaging read.  The eventful narrative of The Angry Man (1955) unfolds over just a very few hours time and addresses themes and subject matter Ross Macdonald is famous for having specialized in.  Namely, dysfunctional families with long held secrets, seductive females, all consuming jealousy and greed intense enough to kill for.  Vintage terrain for both Lew Archer and Ross Macdonald.  Overall, this book rates 4 stars.  Worthwhile reading for all Ross Macdonald fans.
