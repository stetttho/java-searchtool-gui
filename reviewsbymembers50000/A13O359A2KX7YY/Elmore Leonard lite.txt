 Ex-cop Tony Valentine is able to spot a casino cheat a mile away.  That particular skill comes in very handy when he returns to Atlantic City to avenge the death of his friend and former partner who has been murdered while investigating a blackjack scammer known only as "the European".  A great starting point for a detective story if there ever was one.  Unfortunately, Funny Money fails to make the most of this terrific premise. Before I list my criticisms, let me first say that James Swain deserves credit for writing a book that is extremely readable.  Chapter after chapter just sails by.  Also, the Tony Valentine character is well nuanced with a number of interesting attributes. Most of the other characters, I'm sorry to say, are not nearly as well developed, making it hard for the reader to get a feel for them.  In fact, some of the crooks are nothing more than one dimensional stereotypes. The story itself seemed to be cobbled together rather haphazardly with little attention paid to smooth plot developement.  And since so many of the characters, from the casino owner on down, are involved in something shady, the reader rapidly loses interest in finding out which of the multiple rip-offs resulted in Tony's partner's untimely death. Funny Money provides a rare look into the fascinating world of casino gambling.  There are a number of clever lines and some of the situations are entertaining.  But ultimately, the book disappoints because of a failure to use interesting, believable characters to tell an engaging story.
