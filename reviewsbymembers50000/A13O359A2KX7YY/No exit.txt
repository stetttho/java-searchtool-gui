 The Nothing Man is an unusual and interesting novel narrated by the main character, Clinton Brown or Brownie.  Brownie is a wounded war veteran who is glib, smooth talking and good at his job as a small town newspaperman.  But Brownie carries with him a terrible secret.  One which I won't divulge here. It's a secret so horrible to contemplate it causes him to drink nonstop and renders him fully capable of committing brutally violent acts to prevent others from learning what it is. There's a lot of flippant humor to be found throughout this tragic tale.  But that's in keeping with Brownie's personality and he is, after all,  the narrator. I fully understand that The Nothing Man was written as a portrayal of a man's descent into madness and not as a realistic description of a crime spree. But still, the plot is too contrived to suit the very real emotional territory being explored. And that is the book's main flaw. Nonetheless, I give it 4 stars because of Thompson's willingness to take on subject matter that 99.9% of other writers wouldn't go anywhere near.
