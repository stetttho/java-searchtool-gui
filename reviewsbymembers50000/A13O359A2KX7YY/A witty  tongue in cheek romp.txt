 Out on the Rim starts out delightfully enough.  The year is 1986, the place Washington, D.C.  Sixty year old counterterrorism expert Booth Stallings is hired by persons unknown to deliver a $5 million bribe to a troublesome Filipino rebel leader. But Stallings does not see himself as a mere delivery boy.  He'd much rather get his hands permanently on the 5 million.  Knowing he'll need some help and after consulting with his lawyer son-in-law, he takes on as partners Artie Wu and Quincy Durant.  Two lifelong friends who know their way around both the Far East and other people's money. By the time he gets to Manila, Stallings finds that he has four partners, not two.  You see, a con man named Otherguy Overby and an ex-Secret Service agent named Georgia Blue have cleverly insinuated themselves into the mix. Out on the Rim is an entertaining and complex tale of intrigue.  There's plenty of double crossing and lots of unexpected alliances turn up.  In fact, about two thirds of the way through, the complications start to get a bit out of hand.  And that is the book's main flaw. Written with wit and urbane humor, Out on the Rim is deliciously engaging.  But the number of twists and turns could have been 50% less without detracting at all from the fun.
