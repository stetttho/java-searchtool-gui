 Jim Cassidy is a bus driver by day and a drunk by night.  He becomes convinced that if he leaves his voluptuous tramp of a wife, Mildred, and takes up with the waif-like, angelic Doris, he will at long last be able to escape his hellish existence. But he soon discovers that redemption is not that simple. Cassidy's Girl is about the dark, depressing lives of a group of alcoholics inhabiting a rundown neighborhood bordering the Philadelphia waterfront.  It is a no holds barred study of people whose lives are simultaneously fueled and poisoned by alcohol.  Goodis describes how this community, of sorts, functions.  Acts of friendship alternate with acts of violence.  Love and affection coexist side by side with hate and betrayal. Goodis' portrayal of the frustratingly hopeless environment in which the characters find themselves is vivid and expertly drawn. The plot, however, is not as compelling as it might have been.  Instead of flowing smoothly, the narrative has a herky-jerky quality with events occurring seemingly at random. That is to say the motivation behind the actions of key characters is many times unclear. Cassidy's plan to rescue Doris and himself is, as you would expect, eventually ruined.  But the cause of this ruination is not just fate or inevitability.  Cassidy himself makes conscious choices which directly lead to his own defeat. Cassidy's Girl is classic noir.  Unapologetically downbeat, it fearlessly explores the ugly, hopeless side of life. Proceed at your own risk.
