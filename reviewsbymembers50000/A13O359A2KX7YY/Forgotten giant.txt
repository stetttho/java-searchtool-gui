 Robert G. Ingersoll (1833-1899) was a giant of his time.  Sadly, his life and work are known to only a few today.  Even the most educated among us are unlikely to have ever heard of him.  Ingersoll was many things: skilled lawyer, dynamic orator, progressive Republican and proud religious agnostic.  Perhaps more importantly, he was a loving husband and father and a kind and gentle man.   His advice and counsel were sought by many Presidents and would be Presidents.  Aside from a stint as Illinois Attorney General, he never held public office himself.  His outspoken disavowal of his Christian background rendered him unelectable. Yet thousands would happily flock to hear his fiery and riveting oratory as he travelled widely expounding on a number of topics.  It has been said that in the pre-phonographic era his voice was heard by more Americans than that of any other individual.  This slim volume gives the reader a sampling of a few of Ingersoll's essays and speeches.  Each is artfully written and together they illustrate his love of truth and beauty and his uncompromising hatred for unnecessary suffering, ignorance and hypocrisy.  Perhaps the best selection is the first, entitled Why I am an Agnostic.  Ingersoll was ahead of his time and now, more than 100 years after his death, it is apparent he was ahead of our time as well.  I can honestly say he is the only historical figure I have wished I could have met.  For a thorough introduction to the life and humanistic philosophy of Robert G. Ingersoll, I suggest reading Robert G. Ingersoll, a Life by Frank Smith.
