 Sam Birge, the very same homicide detective featured in Krasner's much earlier novel, Walk the Dark Streets, is again called upon to investigate a perplexing killing.  This time the victim is 21 year old Wes Gowen, a would be writer and poet whose lifeless body is found in the hallway of a downscale apartment building. As Birge and his partner, Charley Hagen, question the building's tenants as well as the denizens of a Bohemian style restarant housed on the ground floor of the premises, a troubling web of dysfunctional interpersonal relationships emerges.  Just as in Walk the Dark Streets, the voice of the victim is resurrected through the discovery of a revealing journal which proves invaluable in piecing together the circumstances under which the crime took place. Death of a Minor Poet is a serious novel that explores the consequences of poverty, dysfunctional families and youthful mistakes. A sad, sobering, cogent read.
