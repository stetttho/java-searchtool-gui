 The Box by Peter Rabe is an exceedingly odd novel.  First of all, it is decidedly hardboiled, in that there's plenty of cringe inducing cruelty, unpunished violence and nonstop tough guy talk.  The narrative contains a great deal of detailed description yet at the same time much is left to the reader's imagination.  James Quinn is a mobbed up lawyer from New York who literally finds himself deposited in the cutthroat town of Okar in a North African coastal country, probably Libya.  He is without passport and he is without money.  The only thing he posesses is a finely honed knowledge of how the criminal world functions.  So he does the only thing he can do and that's to move in on Okar's ubiquitous smuggling trade.    He also meets a beautiful woman, a jaded, world weary American expatriate named Beatrice.  Beatrice quickly falls madly in love with Quinn, though the reader will be at a loss to understand why.  The Box contains a number of passages that individually make for compelling reading.  But taken as a whole, the overall narrative flow is neither smooth nor logic driven.  One gets the impression that this story is an allegorical one and that Peter Rabe intended it to convey a far deeper meaning. Perhaps something about the immigrant experience.  I'm sorry to say that any such deeper meaning was woefully lost on me.  Would I recommend this unusual novel to others?  You know, I'm not really sure.
