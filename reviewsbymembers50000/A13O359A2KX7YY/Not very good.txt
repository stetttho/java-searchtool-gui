 Bluebottle takes place in New Orleans, circa 1975.  The main character is Lew Griffin, an African-American PI with an eclectic literary taste.  Griffin is shot by an unknown sniper as he exits a bar one evening.  He survives but the recovery process takes nearly a year. A year during which he is handicapped by blindness and a loss of sense of time. This novel is first and foremost a study of Lew Griffin the human being. It examines his relationships with others as well as how his early experiences have influenced his present attitudes and behavior.  The mystery or crime aspect of the novel is a secondary consideration.  Sallis sparingly drizzles in information about Griffin's shooting, including how organized crime and a white supremist group may be involved. The frequent use of obscure literary references is overdone.  If you are able to understand all of them, then you, my friend, need to get out of the house more. Quite frankly, I found this book disjointed and hard to follow.  I didn't enjoy it.
