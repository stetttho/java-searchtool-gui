 The legendary Jim Thompson has a well deserved reputation as a great writer.  Gripping, compelling and unforgettable, a number of his books rank with the very best of 20th century American fiction.  The Alcoholics, I'm sorry to say, is not one of these books. The narrative unfolds over a one day period on the grounds of El Healtho Sanatorium, a rehabilitative facility for alcoholics. The plot itself is rather flimsy, so the book's success or failure rests firmly on the shoulders of its characters and the things they think, say and do. By and large, Thompson has populated The Alcoholics with characters who are way over the top.  Exaggerated caricatures of real life personality types.  There's Dr. Murphy the suicidal psychiatrist, Miss Baker the sadistic RN, Rufus the overly zealous orderly and an assortment of strange alcoholic patients.  Quite frankly, I found only Josephine the uneducated but highly capable cook to be of any interest at all. Thompson's best work can be found in the realm of the noir.  That is to say in those books where he takes real life and mercilessly exposes its hidden, dark underbelly.  When he tries to create surreal characters and settings, as he does here, the end result is far less satisfying.
