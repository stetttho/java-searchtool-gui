 The narration in this fascinating gem of a novel is provided by the main character, Collie.  Collie is an escaped mental patient and as such he is homeless, friendless and directionless.  Quite by chance, he makes the acquaintance of Fay Anderson, a young widow who drinks too much.  Fay introduces him to an associate of hers, an ex-cop and two-bit swindler known only as Uncle Bud. Uncle Bud has plans for a crime which will make all three of them rich.  Now Collie may be certifiably insane but he is not stupid.  He sees Uncle Bud for what he is and initially steers clear.  But because he is attracted to Fay and because he has no place else to go, he changes his mind and, against his better judgement, agrees to become part of their hopelessly doomed scheme. Reading After Dark, My Sweet is much like watching a train wreck as it unfolds.  You want to cover your eyes but you can't. Thompson's writing is just too compelling. He masterfully takes the reader on a relentlessly downward spiral into complete and utter chaos while simultaneously introducing unforseen surprises every step of the way.  This is a great novel.  Imbued with a palpable aura of impending, inevitable disaster, it grabs you by the lapels and doesn't let go.  Jim Thompson was in top form when he wrote this one.  Do yourself a favor and read it.
