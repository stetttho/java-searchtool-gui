 Written in 1935, this is Eric Ambler's very first published novel.  As the author explains in the introduction, The Dark Frontier was meant to be a parody of the brand of adventure thriller he enjoyed as an adolescent but came to find rather silly when he reached adulthood. That Ambler's tongue was firmly implanted in his cheek while writing this novel is quite obvious from the outlandish premise. Henry Barstow, a mild mannered, straitlaced scientist, sustains a blow to the head which renders him unconscious.  He then awakens as a different person.  He is now Conway Carruthers, an Indiana Jones type action hero.  Barstow as Carruthers travels to a fictitious Balkan state where he helps revolutionaries overthrow the government, squelches a nascent atomic weapons program and pines for the love of an evil countess. All the while risking his life at every turn. Some insightful social and political commentary can be found in the midst of this intentionally bad novel.  And it's interesting to read Ambler at the beginning of his literary career.  But, since the writers and the writing being parodied, have been long forgotten, it's difficult for the modern reader to fully appreciate the book's intended comic nature. Overall, I would characterize The Dark Frontier as a decent first effort by a young writer who would go on to accomplish great things. However, I would only recommend it to diehard Eric Ambler fans.
