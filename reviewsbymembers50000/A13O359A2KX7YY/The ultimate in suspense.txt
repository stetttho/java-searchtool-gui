 Waltz into Darkness transports us to a time long ago, to the year 1880.  Louis Durand is a wealthy but lonely New Orleans bachelor who, early in the narrative, marries a comely young woman named Julia Russell.  But Louis and Julia are essentially strangers to each other.  Their courtship, such as it was, has taken place entirely by mail.  The first days of their marriage are quite blissful.  But then author Cornell Woolrich masterfully introduces ever increasingly unsubtle hints that Julia is other than she presents herself to be.  By the time Louis realizes he has made a terrible mistake in taking Julia as his wife, it's too late.  In the blink of an eye, he is removed from, what is to him, paradise and thrust into a hellish nightmare.  And that's just the beginning.  There's much, much more.  Waltz into Darkness is written as a third person narration.  By using an arcane sounding, flowery prose and incorporating a number of melodramatic embellishments, Woolrich expertly recreates the kind of writing one would expect to find in a Victorian era romance novel.  And his use of the element of suspense is no less than magnificent.  Time and time again he brings the reader right up to the heart pounding brink only to then pull back so the suspense can build once more.  This book is superbly crafted and shows what a virtuoso novelist Cornell Woolrich was.  Highly recommended.
