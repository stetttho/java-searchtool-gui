 This short book is a collection of essays which explores the phenomenon of original paperback novels, with special attention paid to the lives and works of the three writers mentioned in the title. James Sallis explains how each author's individual demons influenced his writing.  And he demonstrates how each of the three used the medium of pulp fiction to create novels which shatter the reader's preconceived notions of reality while unapologetically exposing the ugly side of human existence. For fans of noir literature, Difficult Lives is a worthwhile read.
