 As risk manager for a very busy Denver hospital, Vicky Lucci has an extremely hectic work schedule under normal circumstances.  But lately, Vicky's job has gotten even more complicated.  You see, several patients have recently been transfused with the wrong blood and it's unlikely the cause is merely accidental. First let me say what's good about this book.  The Vicky Lucci character is very thoroughly fleshed out.  The reader gets to learn quite a bit about her from the things she does and from the extensive amount of introspection the author has written for her.  She comes off as a believable human being complete with a number of imperfections. Now for what is not so good about this book.  First of all there are way too many characters.  Some are introduced, never to be heard from again.  And a number of Vicky's fellow hospital employees are impossible to differentiate from others with similar jobs.  Moreover, the narrative is cluttered with too many subplots, most of which are never satisfactorily resolved. Vicky eventually finds out who is responsible for the mismatched blood but only after a frustratingly prolonged sequence of largely unrelated events. My overall impression is that Bad Blood would have benefited from tighter editing.  A more streamlined version would have been better.
