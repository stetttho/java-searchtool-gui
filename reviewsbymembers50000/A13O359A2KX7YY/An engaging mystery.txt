 The Blue Hammer by Ross MacDonald is a tale of two cities.  The coastal town of Santa Teresa, California and the isolated desert community of Copper City, Arizona.  Chapter 1 finds veteran private eye Lew Archer at the Santa Teresa home of copper magnate Jack Biemeyer and his wife Ruth.  He's been hired to locate a potentially valuable painting that is missing from their residence. It doesn't take long for Archer to establish that the Biemeyer's flower child daughter, Doris, and her art student boyfriend, Fred Johnson, have something to do with the painting's disappearance.  But the case takes a much more serious turn when, later that same night, the art dealer who originally sold the painting to Ruth Biemeyer is bludgeoned to death. This intricately plotted mystery is less a story about stolen artwork or even murder than it is a study of family secrets reaching back over more than a generation.  Lost love, jealousy, dysfunctional relationships, homosexuality and substance abuse all play a part in the interesting narrative that unfolds in the pages of this novel.  And the ending is a really great one. Well constructed and compelling, The Blue Hammer is first rate storytelling.  Well worth reading.
