 The Instant Enemy is the quintessential Ross Macdonald novel.  Why?  Because it incorporates so many of the elements Macdonald held near and dear to his heart.  These include:   -Family tragedies that repeat themselves over the generations. -Unexpected familial relationships between characters.   -A young person's journey to claim a birthright unfairly denied.   -The notion that one's destiny is largely determined at birth, if not before.  The book starts out with Lew Archer being summoned to the  Woodland Hills home of Keith Sebastian and his wife Bernice.  Their 17 year old daughter has run away and they want Archer to find her without involving the police.  Archer soon learns that the girl is traveling in the company of a 19 year old delinquent named Davy Spanner.  What's more, it appears that they are planning to commit a very serious crime against Sebastian's boss, the fabulously wealthy oilman Stephen Hackett.  Archer wends his way up and down much of the California coast steadfastly seeking to unravel the truth behind the shocking series of events that rapidly ensue.  The fast paced narrative unfolds quite smoothly as one unexpected complication after another is brought to light.  And Macdonald's prose is first rate. Whether depicting the scenic landscapes of the California coastline or the changing face of American society as it reflects the turbulence of the 1960s, the writing is remarkably deft and descriptive.    Thoroughly engaging, suspenseful and rich with surprise, The Instant Enemy ranks among the finest novels written by Ross Macdonald.  Do yourself a favor and read it.
