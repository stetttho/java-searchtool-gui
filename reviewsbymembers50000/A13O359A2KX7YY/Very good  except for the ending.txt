 Charles Williams was a talented storyteller.  The narratives to his novels unfold in a remarkably economical and straightforward manner.  Go Home, Stranger is no exception.    Gulfcoast bayou country serves as locale for this interesting mystery.  The protagonist is a man's man named Pete Reno.  When Reno learns that his brother-in-law, Mac McHugh has been murdered, he vows to let nothing get in the way of his finding the killer.  The trouble is the police are convinced they are already holding the perpetrator.  Her name is Vickie Shane and she's Mac's widow and Pete's kid sister.  Reno has reason to believe that a mysterious individual named Rupert Conway holds the key to exonerating Vickie.  His search for Conway takes him out to the bayous where the swampy terrain, the seering heat and some less than friendly natives conspire to impede his investigation.  Go Home, Stranger has some excellent descriptive passages and the dialogue is quite good, as well.  There's just one problem with the book, but to my mind it's an important one.  When, towards the end of the novel, Reno discovers the solution to the mystery, it's a bit of a disappointment.  A very key plot device comes off as overly contrived and unconvincing.  This is a very well written mystery novel marred by an ending which is a bit of a letdown.  To experience a really great Charles Williams novel, I suggest reading The Hot Spot.
