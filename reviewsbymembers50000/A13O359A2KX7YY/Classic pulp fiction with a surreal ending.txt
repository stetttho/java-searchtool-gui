 Doc McCoy is a criminal mastermind and his wife Carol is his willing accomplice.  After a particularly bloody bank heist, the two of them make their way to California only a step or two ahead of the law and a former colleague hellbent on killing them.  Their plan is to sneak into Mexico and permanently avoid capture by living amongst a criminal colony beyond the reach of justice.  The Getaway is a short, fast paced novel that adheres to the traditional conventions of pulp fiction.  The narrative is unapologetically violent and gut wrenchingly raw as it tells of Doc and Carol's murderous exploits.  But there's more to it than that.  Thompson skillfully imbues the characters, even the most minor ones, with a psychological complexity breathtaking to behold.    About three quarters of the way through, Thompson surprises the reader by making the storyline ever increasingly surreal.  Ultimately, creating a world that can only be described as Kafkaesque in its depraved yet methodical bizareness.  A lesser author would never have been able to pull off such a monumental transition in narrative tone.  Yet Thompson makes it work and in doing so has created an experimental novel that has deservedly become a classic.
