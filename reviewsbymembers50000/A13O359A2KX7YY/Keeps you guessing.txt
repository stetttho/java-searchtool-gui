 Many mystery novels are the literary equivalent of fast food. Not The Survivor's Club. Lisa Gardner has served up a gourmet meal with this one.   She has taken the time to give us an intricate plot which unfolds in such a way as to maximize suspense while keeping the reader engaged. Furthermore, the characters are richly fleshed out, thereby making both them and the story interesting and believable.  And for the more serious minded reader, The Survivor's Club delivers an ample amount of social commentary without being preachy.  This is one great novel. Suspenseful, well constructed, thoroughly engaging, substantial, and at times a bit frightening. The Survivor's Club has it all.
