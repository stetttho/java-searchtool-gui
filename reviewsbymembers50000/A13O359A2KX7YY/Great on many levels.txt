 In the part of the world once known as the East Indies, The Republic of Sunda, a former Dutch colonial outpost, struggles with its new found independence.  Unfortunately, the ruling government is both corrupt and ineffectual, setting the stage for civil war.  Steve Fraser, a British engineer completely disinterested in the nuances of internal Sundanese politics, finds himself right in the middle of the military conflict.  In typical Eric Ambler fashion, he becomes the novel's unlikely protagonist.  State of Siege is a remarkable work of fiction.  In it, Ambler touches on a number of geopolitical issues without clubbing the reader over the head with dogma.  Moreover, neither the government nor the rebels are presented as being morally superior to the other.  Both are shown to be seriously flawed entities.  In other words, rather than romanticizing the conflict, Ambler presents it with realism.  The narrative is taut, fast paced and compelling.  Quite an achievement especially when one considers that well over 50% of the story unfolds entirely within the confines of a single  building.  Originally published in 1956, State of Siege contains a number of important messages remarkably relevant to today's international scene.  Highly recommended.
