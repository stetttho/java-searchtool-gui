 There are only two words to describe this book: wow and bravo.  Each of its 17 chapters is a compelling mini masterpiece of storytelling.  The title character is a young financially challenged mother who is forced to fend for herself in the decidedly unfriendly milieu of Depression era Los Angeles.  After considerable struggle and plenty of hard work, Mildred eventually becomes a successful business woman. But while Mildred is achieving economic independence, her daughter Veda, a precocious 11 year old at the novel's onset, matures into a hateful, greedy young adult who makes her mother's life a living hell.  Author James Cain has offered up a virtuoso performance in the writing of this wonderful novel.  Chapter 1 is pure genius.  It starts off with images of perfect domesticity; a husband doing yardwork and a wife decorating a cake.  Then it suddenly spirals downward into the abyss of irretrievable family break-up.  Each subsequent chapter is masterfully built on the one before to paint a vivid picture of Mildred's world as she wends her way through the obstacle course that is her life.  Mildred Pierce is a gripping, page turner of a novel.  An enthusiastic 5 stars.
