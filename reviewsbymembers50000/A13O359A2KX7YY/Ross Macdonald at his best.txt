 Ross Macdonald was in top form when he wrote The Zebra-Striped Hearse.  I found this engaging Lew Archer mystery to be an incredibly compelling page turner of a novel.  The narrative begins with ace PI Lew Archer being hired by Mark Blackwell, a wealthy, puritanical, ex-army colonel.  Blackwell's daughter Harriet has taken up with a penniless artist named Burke Damis.  And quite naturally, Dad does not approve.  So he hires Archer to look into Damis' background.  Archer's subsequent investigation takes him to a number of different locales in California, Nevada and Mexico and proves to be quite fruitful.  He learns a number of disturbing things about Mr. Damis, including the fact that Damis is not his real name.  But that's only the beginning.  Archer and the reader eventually learn that nothing is at it appears.  As the suspenseful plot unfolds, a hidden web of intrigue, deception and family dysfunction is skillfully unmasked.  And ultimately, the multifaceted plot all comes together at the stunningly effective conclusion.  The Zebra-Striped Hearse is a prime example of Ross Macdonald at his very best.  An enthusiastic 5 stars.
