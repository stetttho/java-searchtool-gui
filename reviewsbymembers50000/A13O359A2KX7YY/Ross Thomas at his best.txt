 The lion's share of the narrative of this superbly crafted mystery unfolds in Washington, D.C., circa early 1970s. Deke Lucas makes his living by uncovering waste, fraud and abuse for various governmental agencies.  And he's very good at what he does.  So good in fact that Frank Size, a syndicated columnist of considerable reknown, lures him away from his latest governmental post to investigate a very intriguing news story.  It seems that one of the U.S. Senate's rising stars, an Indiana Democrat named Robert Ames has abruptly resigned his office amid rumors of his having taken a $50,000 bribe.  Since Ames and his wife are millionaires many times over, the incident makes little sense. Moreover, the ex-Senator seems to have fallen completely under the control of a sexy young woman named Connie Mizelle.  As Deke Lucas attempts to get to the root of what has befallen Robert Ames, a number of deliciously interesting complications are revealed.  Written with abundant wit, this fast paced, action packed story is filled with unexpected twists and delightful surprises.  If You Can't be Good is a great example of Ross Thomas at his best.  Highly recommended.
