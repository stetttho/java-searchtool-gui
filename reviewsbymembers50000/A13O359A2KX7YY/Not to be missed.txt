 Originally published in 1939, The Big Sleep is the first novel to feature fiction's legendary private eye, Philip Marlowe.  The book starts off with Marlowe visiting the majestic estate  of dying millionaire, General Guy Sternwood.  As the General hires Marlowe to investigate a bookdealer who is extorting him for one thousand dollars, he happens to mention that he sorely misses the company of his son-in-law, an ex-bootlegger, who has inexplicably disappeared. A very fast paced and eventful search for the truth ensues, during which Marlowe encounters many colorful characters.  Topping the list are the two wild Sternwood daughters, Carmen and Vivian. The Big Sleep contains subject matter considered racy by 1939 standards.  Specifically, pornography and homosexuality both play key roles in advancing the story.  Chandler's writing is no less than masterful.  The dialogue snaps, the descriptive passages are vivid and the complex plot comes together at the end. There are really two main characters, Marlowe himself and the city of Los Angeles.  Marlowe is a loner and if he is not an alcoholic, he could easily be mistaken for one.  Always ready with withering put downs, he is a world class cynic who paradoxically adheres to a high minded code of honor.  Los Angeles is portrayed as a dreary place, often rain soaked and in the throes of serious growing pains.  The claustraphobic, shattered lives of many of its inhabitants made all the more grotesque by the coexisting wealth and glamor. The Big Sleep has earned its reputation as an American classic and definitely qualifies as a must read.
