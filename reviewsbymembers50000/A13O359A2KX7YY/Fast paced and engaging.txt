 This is the first novel in James Swain's Tony Valentine series.  I had already read the sequel, Funny Money, and quite frankly, had found that book to be rather mediocre.  Grift Sense, I'm pleased to say, is much, much better. This very entertaining book grabs your interest on page one and holds it to the very end.  Most of the action takes place in Las Vegas and Swain has succeeded in conveying the unique feel of that intriguing place. Perhaps the most amazing aspect of Swain's writing is its remarkable readability.  Both the dialogue and the narrative portions flow so smoothly, the reader can't help but keep turning pages.  Where this novel differs from the weaker Funny Money is in the critically important areas of character developement and plot construction.  Grift Sense has several well defined characters, each with a number of interesting and many times colorful attributes.  And the plot unfolds in a way that really engages the reader's imagination. My only gripe about this otherwise appealing novel concerns the way in which the crooks manage to rack up big winnings at the blackjack table.  If this method worked in the real world, it would be used all the time and the game of blackjack would rapidly become unprofitable to casinos. Grift Sense is a lot of fun to read.  I'm looking forward to seeing how the third Tony Valentine adventure, Sucker Bet, stacks up against the first two.
