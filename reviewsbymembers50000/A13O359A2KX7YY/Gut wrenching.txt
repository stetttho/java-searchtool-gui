 Be forewarned.  This novel is not for the faint of heart.  If you are easily offended, do not read The Grifters. In this classic example of pulp fiction, Jim Thompson takes us on a cruel and hideous journey through a few weeks in the life of Roy Dillon, a practitioner of the short con working in Los Angeles.  Thompson's writing is raw and unflinching.  No holds are barred, no topic is taboo.  He has created a fascinating portrayal of society's criminal netherworld in a way that is thoroughly engaging even as it dares you not to avert your eyes. Reading The Grifters is a powerful, visceral experience that stays with you.
