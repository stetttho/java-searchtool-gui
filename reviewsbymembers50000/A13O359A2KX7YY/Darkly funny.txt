 Nothing says Christmas like strippers, cocaine and free flowing alcohol. Well, it does if your name is Charlie Arglist and you're a crooked lawyer about to blow town for good.  The dark, shocking, frequently violent, but solidly funny narrative of The Ice Harvest begins at 4:15 pm December 24th and ends at mid-morning the following day.  All of the action, and there's quite a bit of action, takes place in or near Wichita. Kansas.  Charlie has embezzled a staggeringly large sum of money from his gangster boss and is just hours away from disappearing to parts unknown with the cash.  While a major league snowstorm rages, Charlie spends his last night in town driving around visiting and sometimes revisiting a number of his old haunts.  These include a few assorted bars, his ex in-laws home, an old girlfriend's duplex, a couple of strip clubs, a massage parlor and a porn shop.  In keeping with the spirit of the season, he manages to stay more or less drunk the entire time, even snorting some coke for good measure.  As Charlie makes his rounds, bad things start happening.  His ex sister-in-law's husband vomits in the car, the abusive boyfriend of one of the strippers gets his fingers broken one by one, and oh yes, several people are murdered.  The Ice Harvest is a no holds barred study of a man largely bereft of redeeming qualities and the rather sordid world he inhabits.  Written with originality and a healthy dose of riotously funny dark humor, this book merits a 5 star rating.  I was inspired to read The Ice Harvest after seeing the newly released film of the same name.  The movie is faithful to the decidedly noirish tone of the book, but the two differ in a number of places including the ending.  In my opinion, if you like the movie, you will love the book.
