 From the prolific pen of legendary crime writer Elmore Leonard, Mr. Majestyk is a short, straightforward action adventure novel with a touch of romance.  Vince Majestyk is an Arizona melon grower who rather unwisely incurs the wrath of a professional killer.  It's a story of cat and mouse that rapidly changes to one of cat and cat. This is a solidly written novel, which I'd have to characterize as a lesser work of the Leonard canon.  The dialogue, as we've come to expect from Leonard, rings very true.  Quirky characters and off the wall situations, staples of the author's best fiction, do not play much of a role here. Mr. Majestyk is an easy, enjoyable read.  But it is not the unique brand of writing that accounts for Elmore Leonard's stellar reputation.
