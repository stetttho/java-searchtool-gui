 Sometimes even very talented writers like Ross Macdonald will miss the mark.  The Barbarous Coast, I'm sorry to say, is an example of a great novelist not living up to his potential.  Oh, it all starts off interestingly enough.  Ross Macdonald's favorite and most famous fictional character, the hardboiled PI Lew Archer is recruited to help a naive young Canadian locate his missing bride.  Her name is Hester and she's a native Californian,  the daughter of long dead silent film star, Raymond Campbell.  As Archer pokes around Hester's last known haunt, an exclusive Malibu country club, he learns of an unsolved murder that took place there just under 2 years before.  So far so good. Unfortunately, the narrative then begins to devolve into a poorly coordinated, multifaceted saga of murder and blackmail that unsuccessfully tries to cover too many bases.  Macdonald introduces a number of supporting characters; a greedy and lecherous movie studio owner, his schizophrenic wife, a Las Vegas gangster with homosexual tendencies, a washed up boxer turned actor and Hester's sister Rina, a psychiatric nurse. Also introduced are Hester's mother and her aforementioned husband, both of whom rather surprisingly get lost in the shuffle.  Further detracting from the book's appeal are Macdonald's, shall we say, less than universally accepted theories of mental illness.  Theories he does not hesitate to present as facts on a par with the law of gravity.  Ross Macdonald fans expect his novels to be intricately plotted and many would be disappointed if they were not.  But the Barbarous Coast is a disjointed collection of plot threads that ultimately fail to blend together.  It appears as though he tried to cram too much material into this relatively short book.  A rare disappointment from an author capable of much better.
