 The Chill by Ross Macdonald has an intricately woven plot that could justifiably be referred to as byzantine.  Hired by a distraught bridegroom to find his runaway bride, the doggedly persistent Lew Archer soon finds himself investigating a series of murders that spans more than two decades as well as half a continent. This very intriguing "whodunit" contains smartly written dialogue, many well crafted and evocative descriptive passages, a large number of interesting characters and an unexpected gem of an ending.  Moreover, the narrative is fast paced, compelling and emotionally gripping. Definitely one of Macdonald's most unforgettable and jarring efforts.  Highly recommended.
