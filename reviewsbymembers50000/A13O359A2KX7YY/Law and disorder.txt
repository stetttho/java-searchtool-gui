 The Hot Kid is yet another example of Elmore Leonard doing what he does best.  Creating fascinating characters and then giving them plenty of authentic sounding dialogue to further enhance their appeal. Prohibition era Oklahoma is brought to life in the pages of this delightful novel of cops and robbers.  The Hot Kid of the book's title is Carl Webster, a youth with nerves of steel, who becomes a Deputy U.S. Marshal working out of the Tulsa, Oklahoma office.  Carl likes the idea of bringing bank robbers to justice and in fact he's very good at it.  If some folks want to refer to him as a living legend, well who is he to argue?  Another Oklahoman by the name of Jack Belmont is about the same age as Carl.  Jack decides to pursue a career as a bank robber despite the fact his father is a millionaire oilman.  Sadistic and not very bright, Jack assumes the role of nemesis to the vain but heroic "Hot Kid".  Recording much of the action is Tony Antonelli, a reporter for True Detective magazine.  Tony is into his work so completely, the two cents a word he receives as payment is merely icing on the cake.  One has to believe he'd happily do the same work for free.  There are plenty of other interesting characters as well.  Like Carl's taciturn father, Virgil.  He's a proud veteran of the Spanish-American War who just can't quite figure out how his son came to be such an unreluctant object of hero worship.  And those beautiful, brazen gun molls, Crystal, Louly and Heidi.  Why their presence alone makes the book worth reading.  The Hot Kid is great entertainment.  If you like quirky characters and great dialogue, this is the book for you.
