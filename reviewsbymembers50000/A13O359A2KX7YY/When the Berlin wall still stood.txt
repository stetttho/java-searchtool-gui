 Mac McCorkle and Mike Padillo run an American style bar and grille in Bonn, West Germany.  Well, McCorkle does.  Padillo is away quite a bit pursuing his other career.  He's a highly skilled operative for an elite intelligence agency. And since it's the height of the cold war, there's lots for him to do. Just as Padillo is about to leave on one of his assignments, he and Mac witness a murder as it takes place right on the premises of their own business establishment.   And that's how The Cold War Swap begins. Published in 1966, The Cold War Swap is the first of many Ross Thomas novels.  Witty, fast paced and action packed, this darkly funny tale pays tribute to the spy genre even as it parodies it.  There are more twists and turns than you could shake a stick at.  And there's enough double crossing to fill three books of similar size.   In truth, the underlying plot doesn't make much sense.  One gets the impression that Thomas first wrote individual scenes and then came up with a rather far-fetched storyline to tie those scenes together. The Cold War Swap has much to recommend it.  Not only does it contain interesting characters and intriguing situations, it also features a very sophisticated brand of humor.  But of the Ross Thomas books I've read so far, I found it to be the least satisfying.  Voodoo, Ltd. written by Thomas much later in his career is far better.
