 Spin is a highly entertaining political novel. The narration is provided by the main character Jim Asher.  Jim is a California surfer who has a lot going for him.  He's young, good looking, charming and of above average intelligence.  One day, Jim decides he'd like to get involved in Republican politics.  So he presents himself to the campaign headquarters of Edward Winston, a Michael Huffingtonesque candidate for U.S. Senate. Owing to a fair amount of luck and a brashness even he didn't know he had, Jim rapidly becomes a mover and shaker in the rough and tumble world of California state politics.  Seduced by the sex, money and power his new found career provides him, Jim does some unethical and completely illegal things to put himself at the top of the political heap.  Thereby setting himself and his allies up for a precipitous fall. This book has much to recommend it.  It's filled with humor and has a smooth narrative flow.  The outrageousness of modern campaign tactics and political maneuvering are captured quite well.  Sure, some of the situations described are a bit over the top.  But it could also be argued that there are other places where author Tom Lowe did not go far enough in lampooning his subject matter. Spin is an engaging novel that presents a laugh inducing insider's view of what politics and politicians have all too sadly become.
