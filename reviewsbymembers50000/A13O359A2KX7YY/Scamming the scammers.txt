 By now, anyone with a pulse knows that the internet cafes of Lagos, Nigeria are teeming with con artists who spend their days trying to separate the unwary from their hard earned savings.  Many, if not most, of the victims are Americans and more often than not the transfer of money is accomplished through the handy services of Western Union. Tuesdays with Mantu is a riotously funny book in which the author, Rich Siegel, chronicles his somewhat perverse exchanges of e-mail with a series of clueless Nigerian scammers.  The amazing aspect of this entire endeavor is the fact that none of the scammers ever realize they're being put on even though putting on people is the stock and trade of their own livelihoods. This book succeeds in demonstrating the craveness of the human spirit in a very entertaining fashion.  Readers with cynical minds will find Tuesdays with Mantu particularly wondrous in its content.  A great gift idea!
