 The unlikely protagonist in The Horse Latitudes is a former drug dealer by the name of Danny DiMedici.  Danny is an avid swimmer and, curiously, is also an authority on the civilization of the ancient Mayans. His smart, stunningly beautiful wife, Lauren, has left him and he has yet to get over the hurt he feels.  But now he learns that Lauren has gone missing and her stylish beachfront home is a grisly crime scene. As Danny wends his way through Southern California's not so hidden subculture of drugs and sex, searching for Lauren, the narrative takes on a surreal, otherwordly quality. And author Robert Ferrigno's frequent use of flashback sequences serves to enhance the surrealism.  Add in a mad scientist searching for the fountain of youth and a matched pair of pea brained, muscle bound hitmen and you have a novel which is genuinely bizarre. Ferrigno's writing is quite skillful at times.  I particularly liked the supporting characters, Karl Steiner and Jane Holt, the odd couple detective team assigned to the case. But ultimately, I found myself less than fully satisfied because of the way the plot unfolded.  The storyline resolves itself in the latter third of the book in a lame and seemingly random fashion. The Horse Latitudes is an interesting and, at times, engaging work of fiction.  But the disappointing, unsatisfying ending spoiled it for me.
