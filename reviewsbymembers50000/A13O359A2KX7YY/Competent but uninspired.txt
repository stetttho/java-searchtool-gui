 Paul Silver is a veteran newspaper reporter whose career is in the doldrums.  Out of the blue, he receives a tip that could make him a star.  A prominent Senator is suspected of selling state secrets to the Soviet Union and the FBI has him under surveillance. Of course, things are not as they appear and Silver is drawn into a nasty game of cloak and dagger that places him in real jeopardy. I'm giving False Front 3 stars because, though fairly predictable, the plot is mildly interesting.  Also the book brings to light the very real rivalry between the FBI and CIA. There is, however, little else about False Front to cause one to recommend it.  Except for the last 25 or so pages, the narrative is slow paced and frequently verges on being boring.  The dialogue is stilted and not at all convincing.  Accounts of the inner workings of the newsroom do not ring true.  And the same can be said for other descriptions of places and institutions. Overall, this is a very mediocre novel.  The best thing I can say about it is that it helps the reader appreciate other books where the writing is compelling.    With the number of political thrillers out there that are so much better, I wouldn't recommend bothering with this one.
