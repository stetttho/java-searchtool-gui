 There's no doubt about it.  Frederick Forsyth knows how to spin a yarn.  This international thriller takes the reader on a roller coaster ride that doesn't stop until the very last page. If, as many believe, The Day of the Jackal is the greatest novel of international intrigue ever written,  The Devil's Alternative cannot be far behind. Maxim Rudin is the President of the USSR and General Secretary of the Communist Party. He's having a very bad year. Not only is his health failing but his country faces an impending famine.  His enemies within the Politburo are plotting to oust him from power even as a group of Ukrainian nationalists plan murder and mayhem to embarrass the regime.  The US President, Bill Matthews, has come to the realization that only a massive infusion of American grain can prevent a starving Soviet Union from starting World War III. Superimposed on this backdrop are a number of other interesting subplots. These include a forbidden romance between a British intelligence officer and a Russian woman and the maiden voyage of the largest oil tanker the world has ever seen. Forsyth seamlessly weaves together all plot elements in a way that captures the reader's imagination and holds it at gunpoint.  Throughout the book, there are a number of genuinely surprising twists which are really quite remarkable to behold. The meticulous attention to detail that characterizes all of Forsyth's writing is very much alive and well here.  It's hard to imagine the scope and depth of research that went into bringing this book to life. The Devil's Alternative is a monumental achievement. Highly recommended.
