 A high ranking State Department functionary is kidnapped while vacationing in Mexico and is replaced by an exact look-alike working for the Soviet Union.  There are so many holes in this story, a slab of swiss cheese would be envious.  Yes, there's a degree of suspense.  But because of the plot's many instances of utter implausibility, the reader's reaction to the suspense can, at best, be only lukewarm. Far-fetched, illogical, uncompelling and at times downright silly, The Man in the Mirror is a very mediocre work of fiction.
