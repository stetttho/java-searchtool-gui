 Fiction doesn't get any more noir than Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye.  It's a gangster tale told by a gangster.  And not just any gangster at that. Ralph Cotter is evil incarnate.  He's an amoral criminal who kills in cold blood.  But unlike most other murdering thugs, Cotter is a cultured, educated man.  His Phi Beta Kappa key is probably the last thing he ever came by honestly. To make everyone aware of his intellectual superiority, he freely uses five dollar vocabulary words and regularly makes obscure references to the classics. Following a harrowing escape from a prison work farm, Cotter shacks up with a slutty gun moll named Holiday.  It doesn't take him long to find corrupt police officials he can blackmail into doing his bidding.  And his charming demeanor allows him to become romantically involved with the obscenely wealthy daughter of an ex-governor. Is the plot of Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye a believable one?  Of course not. I doubt it was meant to be.  This is an allegorical novel. A fairy tale for adults, if you will.  The novel's strength lies in its ability to convey certain truths about human fallability through the very detailed and astute introspection of the repugnant but fascinating narrator. Both Cotter and the book itself have an overpowering audacity that makes for very compelling reading.  Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye is an original work of crime fiction that embraces the noir tradition and takes it to a whole new level.  Highly recommended.
