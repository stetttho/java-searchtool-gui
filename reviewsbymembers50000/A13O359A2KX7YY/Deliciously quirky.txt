 The Money Harvest by Ross Thomas takes place in the Washington, D.C. of 1975.  The protagonist of this rather unlikely tale answers to the name Jake Pope.  Having overcome his impoverished roots in rural West Virginia, Jake went on to distinguish himself as one of the U.S. Senate's most formidable investigators. Now he finds himself called upon to foil a bold scheme to manipulate the wheat futures market.  Thomas has populated this wickedly funny novel with an abundance of interestingly drawn characters.  From a corrupt former Congressman to a ruthless and sadistic Chicago gangster to a wife-beating agricultural econonmist, these are literary creations notable for being over-the-top, exaggerated caricatures of real life personality types.  Written with an insider's keen knowledge of how things get done within the unique world of Washington, The Money Harvest is delightfully cynical and unapologetically irreverent.  This is not Ross Thomas' best novel nor is it his worst.  It falls somewhere right in the middle.  But an average Ross Thomas novel runs rings around 90% of the fiction currently on bookstore shelves.  Recommended to those who appreciate good satire.
