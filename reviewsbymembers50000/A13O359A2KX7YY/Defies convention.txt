 Straight cut is narrated by its main character, the highly introspective Tracy Bateman, a melancholy film editor who frequently quotes Kierkegaard.  While in Rome, editing a TV documentary, he is reunited with the beautiful Lauren, his estranged wife.  The overpowering feature of Straight Cut is its richly detailed first person narration which has the effect of making the reader privy to the nuances of Tracy's emotional state as he experiences this working "Roman holiday".  About midway through, Straight Cut turns, somewhat abruptly, into a story about the dark, nasty world of international drug smuggling.  Tracy's deeply introspective narration continues through this part of the book, even as the novel's tone changes from slice of life to action adventure.  In writing Straight Cut, author Madison Smartt Bell has created an artfully crafted work of fiction which ignores convention while daring to combine genres.  Interesting and original.
