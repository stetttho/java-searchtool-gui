 The Magician's Tale is a very well constructed murder mystery that does not disappoint.  The captivating plot unfolds in such a way that I'm sure most readers will have trouble putting the book down. I know I did.   But this novel has a number of great things going for it besides its very strong plot.  Photojournalist Kay Farrow is the protagonist and narrator.  Her character is extremely well fleshed out and quite believable.  And her voice is a remarkably convincing one.  So much so, it's hard to believe The Magician's Tale is the work of a male author. Another very positive aspect is the attention to detail. Be it the ins and outs of the photographer's craft or the sights and sounds of San Francisco, an abundance of nicely detailed description is provided. There is a fair amount of sexual content, much of it on the kinky side.  However, since it is presented in an inoffensive, nonexploitative manner, it serves to enhance rather than detract from the overall storyline. Written with imagination and skill, The Magician's Tale is a fascinating, page turner of a novel.
