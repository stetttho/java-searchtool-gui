 The Doomsters starts off with private eye Lew Archer being paid an early morning visit by an escaped mental patient named Carl Hallman. Archer notices that Carl is deeply troubled and confused yet surprisingly well spoken.  It appears that Carl's father, a very prosperous former state senator died 6 months earlier.  The death certificate says it was a heart attack.  But Carl has his doubts.  As Archer is drawn into the case, he gets to meet the members of Carl's very dysfunctional family.  There's his beautiful, long suffering wife, Mildred.  His not so brotherly brother, Jerry.  And his seductive sister-in-law, Zinnie.  Rounding out the cast of characters are a shady MD and a pot-bellied sheriff for whom Archer takes an immediate dislike.  The Doomsters is a skillfully told story of greed and betrayal.  Carl Hallman is a victim.  That much is clear from the very first chapter.  But the full extent of his victimization only comes out at the book's surprising conclusion.  With great dialogue, vividly descriptive prose and a fast paced narrative that unfolds smoothly, this novel is a real treat.  Do yourself a favor and read it.
