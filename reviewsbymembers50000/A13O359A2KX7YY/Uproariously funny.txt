 R.J. Decker is a down at the heel, Miami based private eye with anger management issues.  When he is offered the unlikely assignment of exposing cheating on the pro bass fishing circuit he is justifiably dubious.  But he can't afford to turn down the generous fee.  That's how Double Whammy begins. This is an extremely funny, way over the top dark comedy where the body count and the laughs quickly start piling up.  But what is it that distinguishes this book from the many other Florida based comedic crime novels that have become so popular in recent years?  Two things, the unrelenting humor and the off the wall characters. Many books are episodically funny.  And by that I mean there may be a funny situation every 40 or 50 pages.  Double Whammy is genuinely funny all the way through.  Everything that happens is outrageous and the outrageousness steadily increases as the story unfolds.  Few would argue with the observation that Carl Hiaasen's writing displays a take no prisoners tone when it comes to satirizing life as lived in the Sunshine State. There are more hilariously warped characters in this book than you can shake a fishing rod at.  To mention just two of the more colorful ones:  There's Skink, a roadkill eating recluse with the perfect white teeth of a TV news anchorman. And, my personal favorite, the Reverend Charles Weeb, a profane, sleazy, televangelist whose love of real estate far surpasses his love of any known diety. Double Whammy is a withering satire that pulls no punches. Its nonstop humor is both biting and original.  If you appreciate writing that isn't afraid to explore the less admirable aspects of what it means to be human, by all means, read this book.  You will enjoy the experience.
