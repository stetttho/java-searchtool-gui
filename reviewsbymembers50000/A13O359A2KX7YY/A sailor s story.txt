 Scorpion Reef by Charles Williams can best be described as an action-adventure novel that takes place in and around the Gulf of Mexico.  The protagonist is Bill Manning, a seafarin' man with a sensitive soul.  Bill's life undergoes an abrupt and profound transformation when a beautiful, statuesque blond named Shannon Macaulay enters his world. Bill and Shannon find themselves caught up in a nasty struggle with some very bad men over sunken treasure located off the coast of the Yucatan peninsula.  Using a very descriptive and detailed writing style, Williams successfully spins an engaging tale of mystery, romance and danger against the backdrop of the open sea.  And the ending is a really great one. My only complaint about this otherwise genuinely appealing book, is the overly convoluted, highly improbable backstory used to set up the narrative's underlying conflict. Scorpion Reef is a flawed but still highly entertaining work of fiction.  Well worth reading.
