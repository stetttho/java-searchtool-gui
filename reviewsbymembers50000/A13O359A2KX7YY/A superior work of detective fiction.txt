 Chandler's Philip Marlowe is the prototype for all the hard-boiled private eyes who have come down the literary pike after him.  Marlowe is never fully dressed unless he has a cigarette dangling from his lip.  Always ready with cynical quips, he consumes distilled spirits the way the rest of us take in oxygen.  And when it comes to solving a case, Marlowe never bends the rules.  No, he ignores the rules completely. The Lady in the Lake starts off with Marlowe being hired by a business executive, who wants to locate his missing wife. She's described as being quite a handful.  Young, blond and two times a maniac.....klepto and nympho.  Within about two days, Marlowe runs across two dead bodies and finds that a death ruled a suicide 18 months before is really a covered up murder. The plot contains many unexpected twists and turns that serve to keep the reader interested and very curious about what is going to happen next.  If I have any criticism of this book at all, its that a couple of the many plot devices seem a bit contrived. In describing people, places and things, Chandler does not spare the adjectives.  His remarkable prose provides very vivid images of what is happening and thereby allows the reader to be transported right into the narrative.   So, do yourself a favor and read The Lady in the Lake.  You'll find out why Raymond Chandler's stellar reputation is so richly deserved.
