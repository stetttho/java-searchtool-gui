 First of all, Term Limits by Vince Flynn does have some good aspects to it.  For example, it contains a discussion of how the CIA has come to depend on technological information gathering while neglecting development of human assets on the ground. Anyone who owns a TV or occasionally reads a newspaper knows that now.  But in the 90's, when this book was written, that information was not common knowledge.  So Flynn obviously did his homework, at least to some extent. Unfortunately, whatever merit Term Limits might have is completely overshadowed by the novel's very preposterous premise.  Flynn would have the reader believe that a small band of former navy SEALs would be so enraged over the federal government's unwillingness to balance the budget, they would resort to serial assassination as a means of getting it to do so. The idea of a balanced federal budget is an abstract and sterile concept.  It's just not the kind of issue that would engender the degree of passion necessary to motivate people to kill.  Term Limits is flawed as a work of fiction because its premise is way too far-fetched.
