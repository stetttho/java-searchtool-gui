 Early on in this intriguing but stylistically odd book, a British cabinet officer known only as "our man" stabs a woman to death.  Harry Fielding witnesses this act and has the presence of mind to photograph it as it occurs.  Harry is what is known as an understrapper.  That's a colloquialism for a small time crook who supplements his income by hiring himself out to the British intelligence service. The novel's narration is provided by Harry himself and consists largely of short,choppy sentences that betray no emotion.  The storyline is both interesting and engaging for approximately the first half of the book.  Then any semblance of narrative coherence all but disappears.  A series of subplots are introduced and individually showcased in a way that makes the book excessively disjointed.  A chapter in which Harry finds himself driving a truck in war torn Bosnia seems particularly out of place. Davison's writing style is too clever for its own good because it keeps drawing attention to itself rather than the story it's supposed to tell. Crooked Man gets a marginal 3 stars from me because the initial plot is a good one.  But, overall, I would not recommend it.
