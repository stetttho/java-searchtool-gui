 Mind Reader is a very engaging novel.  In it, Freemantle skillfully interweaves several interesting and distinct plot threads.  This motivates the reader to keep going on to the next chapter in order to find out what is happening on a wide variety of fronts.  Secondly, there's lots of introspection.  And by that I mean the thought processes of the characters are revealed in stark detail.  Consequently, the reader is made privy to exactly why characters say and do what they say and do.  This technique adds an extra dimension to the narrative, making it much richer than that usually found in similar works of fiction. Furthermore, the lead character, Claudine Carter, is well fleshed out, as are many of the supporting cast. Freemantle deserves praise for taking the time to give us characters that come off as real people and not just unidimensional stereotypes.  The only problem I had with this otherwise compelling book was the author's tendency, especially early in the narrative, to use awkwardly structured sentences.  Many sentences were overly long with too many subordinate clauses.  And many of the not so long ones were oddly worded.  Because of this I many times found myself having to re-read certain paragraphs several times in order to discern their intended meaning.   Nonetheless, because of its very strong plot and richly drawn characters, Mind Reader gets 4 stars from me.
