 Native Tongue is a way over the top, hysterically funny satire of life in South Florida. With incomparable skill, Hiaasen spins a whopper of a tale in which a grandmotherly but militant environmentalist fearlessly takes on a Mr. Francis X. Kingsbury, the very shady owner of a third rate Disney World wannabe theme park. It seems that Kingsbury's insatiable desire for real estate developement threatens to destroy the ecology of a segment of Florida's Atlantic coast. Another character, the environmentally conscious Joe Winder (serving as Carl Hiaasen's alter ego) is an investigative reporter whose career is on the skids. In fact he has sunk so low that he now finds himself working in public relations at the aforementioned theme park.   This book is overflowing with delightfully funny characters both human and animal.  For example, there's Pedro Luz, the steroid addicted chief of security who is impervious to pain and oblivious to the ravages his drug use is causing his body and mind. There's Joe's girlfriend, Nina, who makes her living in the phone sex industry. And not to forget Bud and Danny, two dimwitted burglars who are recruited to kidnap the two sole  surviving blue-tongued mango voles and live to regret the day they ever got involved in such an assignment.  On the nonhuman side of the ledger can be found Dickie the Dolphin, a theme park attraction who unfortunately is prone to becoming amorous toward humans of either sex. Skink, the reclusive roadkill eating ex-governor and state trooper Jim Tile, Skink's guardian angel are two recurring Hiaasen characters whose appearance in this book is most welcome and adds greatly to the fun. Native tongue is a pricelessly funny satiric novel whose outrageous situations and off the wall characters are supremely entertaining.  Moreover, Hiaasen's ear for dialogue is pitch perfect.  This is one funny book.  Do yourself a favor and read it.
