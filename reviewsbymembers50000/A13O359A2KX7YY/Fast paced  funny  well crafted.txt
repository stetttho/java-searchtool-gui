 Mike Saldinger writes for TV.  Most of us would probably think of that as a pretty nifty way to make a living.  However, Mike has a less enthusiastic take on the subject, describing his job as "Better than laying linoleum. But just." As the narrative to Shooting Script begins we learn that Mike is a bit depressed, primarily because of his relatively recent, painful divorce.  But his life is beginning to change for the better.  You see, he has just sold a two hour cop show pilot to one of the networks and stands to make a considerable sum of money as a result. Unfortunately, there's a fly in the ointment.  Fellow New Yorker, Nicholas Stavros claims that he is the true originator of the idea behind the pilot and is threatening to sue Saldinger for plagiarism. So when Stavros winds up murdered, the police naturally think Mike has something to do with it. Gordon Cotler has done a wonderful job in creating this delightful novel.  The characters are hilariously drawn and there's plenty of Hollywood insider humor.  But the best thing about Shooting Script is the seamless way the narrative unfolds.  Cotler advances the story very skillfully.  There are many interesting situations but none are gratuitously thrown in.  Rather, each plays a key role in the construction of the book's interesting and suspenseful plot. This novel should be required reading for all would be mystery writers.  It's a textbook for how to smoothly relate a story while maximizing reader interest.  Highly recommended.
