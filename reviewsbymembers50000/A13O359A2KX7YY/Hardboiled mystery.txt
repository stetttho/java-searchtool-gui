 Milo Milodragovitch isn't just any private eye.  He's cloned from the literary DNA of Phillip Marlowe himself.  Except it's the 1970's and instead of LA, Milo's shabby one man office is in downtown Meriwether, a city of 50,000 in the Pacific Northwest. When early in The Wrong Case, the comely Helen Duffy of Storm Lake, Iowa nervously enters Milo's place of business to hire him to find her missing brother, the reader is likely to feel as though he or she has picked up Raymond Chandler's The Little Sister by mistake.  That's how similar the two novels are in their opening passages. We soon learn that Milo is a deeply flawed individual with alcoholism as only one of his many problems.  He agrees to take the case, not out of professional interest and not for the wad of traveler's checks Helen eventually offers him.  No, he takes the case because he lusts after Helen's body.  At this point, one has to hand it to James Crumley.  Few other author's would have dared to offer up a protagonist who is that much of a creep. A lot happens as the narrative unfolds.  On more than one occasion Milo is beaten to within an inch of his life.  He kills a man using a derringer at close range.  He even has sex with an uninhibited hippie chick he meets along the way. Eventually, almost reluctantly, Milo discovers the key to the mystery surrounding Helen Duffy's brother.  It then becomes abundantly apparent to both Milo and the reader that the case he's spent the entire book working on has been in so many ways a wrong one. This is hardboiled detective fiction in its most unvarnished form.  Recommended to fans of the genre.
