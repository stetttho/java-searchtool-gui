 In this skillfully written tale of murder and intrigue, Ross MacDonald manages to "out Chandler" Raymond Chandler.  It's Southern California, circa 1950, and hardboiled detective Lew Archer finds himself traversing the same landscapes Chandler's Philip Marlowe does in The Big Sleep, High Window and The Long Goodbye. The plot of The Drowning Pool is complex enough to be interesting without being convoluted or forced.  Greed, blackmail, homosexuality and family dysfunction all play roles in advancing the nicely paced narrative.  Thrown in for good measure are seductive women, a number of action scenes and a Lolita like teenager named Cathy. MacDonald's very descriptive prose is quite effective.  And there's plenty of memorable dialogue.  My personal favorite: "Your reminiscences fascinate me. May I take notes?" You'd be hard pressed to find a more satisfying example of noir crime writing.  An enthusiastic 5 stars.
