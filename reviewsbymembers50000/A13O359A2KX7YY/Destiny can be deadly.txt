 Eddie is the name of the piano player of the book's title.  For the princely sum of thirty dollars a week, Eddie provides background music in a rundown dive.  He figures that if he has nothing, nothing can be taken away from him.  And if he stays in the background, like so much wallpaper, no one will ever bother him. Eddie's strategy for living works quite well.  That is until an untimely visit from his hoodlum brother triggers a cascade of events that threaten his very life. Shoot the Piano Player is a short allegorical novel that is dark and unapologetically downbeat.  Deceptively simple in its construction, there's a lot of truth about life contained within its pages.  If you take the time to read this book, you will learn more about what makes human beings tick than you ever would by reading any ten psychology texts put together.  An enthusiastic 5 stars.
