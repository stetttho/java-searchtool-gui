 Stuart Rogers has salt water in his veins.  He only feels fully alive when piloting sailboats on the open sea.  Having just purchased a forty foot ketch in Panama, he hires two men to help him sail it back to the United States.  But fate steps in and one of the men dies of a heart attack and has to be buried at sea.  But that's only the beginning. A couple days after reaching their destination on the Texas gulfcoast, the other man is brutally murdered.  At this point Rogers finds himself very much in demand.  Not only is he wanted for questioning by the police and the FBI, he is pursued by a gang of violent criminals.  The Sailcloth Shroud is a fast paced, well crafted mystery that unfolds very smoothly.  Author Charles Williams skillfully tells this interesting tale using Rogers himself as first person narrator.  One can't help but be impressed by the seamless incorporation of flashback scenes as a device to aid in the storytelling.  An engaging satisfying read.  Recommended for all fans of mystery novels.
