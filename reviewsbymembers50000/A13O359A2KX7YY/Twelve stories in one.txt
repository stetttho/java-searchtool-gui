 As he did to magnificent effect a few years earlier in The Criminal, Jim Thompson utilizes the unusual technique of multiple character first person narration in The Kill-Off.  This fascinating book consists of 12 chapters and each chapter is narrated by a different individual. The Kill-Off's considerable strength lies in Thompson's remarkable ability to reveal each narrator's internal life using realistic dialogue and vivid introspection.  Thompson is not satisfied in just demonstrating these characters' superficial warts and blemishes.  No, Thompson goes far beyond just that.  He skillfully reveals the gaping wounds in the psyches of his characters so as to allow the reader an unobstructed view into their claustrophobic and often hideous lives. The novel's plot revolves around the death of a town's resident busybody.  Of course the purpose of plot in a book such as this is merely to serve as a lattice on which the various character sketches can be hung. Consequently the danger is that too much plot will get in the way.  And that's what makes The Kill-Off only a very good novel as compared to The Criminal which is a great novel. The plot of The Criminal is an extremely rudimentary one. This has the advantage of allowing the reader to get to know the characters without worrying too much about the plausibility of specific events and plot devices.  The plot of the Kill-Off is a somewhat more complicated one and as such diverts the reader's attention from the book's main strength, its wonderfully and richly drawn cast of characters.  Jim Thompson's unique ability to brazenly and unapologetically reveal the ugly side of human existence is very much at work in this little known and underappreciated book.  Well worth reading.
