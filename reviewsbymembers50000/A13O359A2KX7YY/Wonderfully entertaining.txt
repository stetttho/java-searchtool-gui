 H.S. Nirdlinger (Don't ya just love that name?) is a very unfortunate individual.  After all, his wife Phyllis and his insurance agent Walter are complete strangers to each other at the story's onset.  Yet within the first few pages, the two of them are earnestly conspiring to rub Nirdlinger out for a big insurance payoff.  This delightful book, a novella really, has two aspects to it.  On the one hand it's a noir crime story that oh so explicitly reveals the human capacity for heartlessness, cruelty and greed.  At the same time, it's in many ways a black comedy wherein cleverly laid criminal plans wind up backfiring in the most ironic ways.  In any event, Double Indemnity is an outstanding work of fiction.  The plot is a nifty one and the dialogue is smart and engaging.  Moreover, Cain's detailed descriptions of the inner workings of the insurance industry lend authenticity to the narrative.  Double Indemnity is great fun.  Read it.  You won't be disappointed.
