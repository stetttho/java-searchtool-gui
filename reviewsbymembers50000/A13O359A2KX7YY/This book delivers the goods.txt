 At the beginning of Split Images, two Detroit natives meet in Palm Beach after one of them has shot a Haitian burglar. Robbie Daniels is a multimillionaire industrialist fascinated by guns. Walter Kouza is a former Detroit cop with a well deserved reputation for being trigger happy.  Walter is flattered that a rich guy is even interested in talking to a working stiff such as himself.  So when Robbie offers Walter a job as his personal chauffeur he accepts the position without much hesitation.  As it turns out, Robbie is really a psychopath who has been reading too many spy novels.  He has come to think of himself as some sort of international assassin and believes that Walter's background in law enforcement will be helpful as he pursues his human quarry. The two other main characters in this darkly funny story are Bryan Hurd, a detective in Detroit Homocide and Angela Nolan, a freelance journalist.  The two of them are on to Robbie's plan and work to foil him and Walter before the plan can be carried out.  Bryan and Angela also become romantically involved with each other in a subplot very germane to the overall structure of the novel. Elmore Leonard is in top form here.  The dialogue is realistic, funny and plentiful.  The bad guys are believable enough to be interesting but unbelievable enough so you don't have to feel guilty when some of their murderous antics make you laugh.  The action takes place in both Detroit and South Florida and Leonard pulls off the changes in locale with ease.  The plot is developed in a very skillful manner and there is an unconventional ending which some might find shocking. I have to agree with the reviewer who said he didn't understand why Split Images isn't better known.  This book is a prime example of why Elmore Leonard's reputation as a great writer is well deserved.
