 I Married a Dead Man is a remarkable work of fiction.  The plotting is less than air tight, but that's easy to forgive in view of the stellar success author Cornell Woolrich achieves in setting mood and creating suspense.  Helen is about 19 years old, so we are told.  Pregnant and alone with exactly 17 cents to her name, her situation is dire to say the least.  But Fate steps in and through a confluence of highly unlikely circumstances associated with a horrible train wreck, she is given the opportunity to assume the identity of another young woman.  Now she and her newborn son can live a life filled with love, security, wealth and privilege.  But happiness obtained dishonestly comes at a terrible price.  Inevitably, Helen, now known as Patrice, is forced to confront her past.  As the reader stands by helplessly, Helen is pulled into a downward spiral of depravity from which there is no escape.  Except for the prologue and the epilogue, I Married a Dead Man is narrated in the third person.  Yet it is told completely from Helen's perspective.  The reader sees, hears and knows only what Helen sees, hears and knows.  This has the effect of allowing the reader to experience the fear and terror Helen faces right along with her.  Woolrich has written this novel in a style best described as haunting, almost surreal.  Suspense permeates each chapter as we know that, ultimately, disaster is unavoidable.  We just don't know how or when it will manifest itself.  Darkly moving, with a palpable aura of impending doom that is skillfully sustained from beginning to end, I Married a Dead Man is a great novel.  Highly recommended.
