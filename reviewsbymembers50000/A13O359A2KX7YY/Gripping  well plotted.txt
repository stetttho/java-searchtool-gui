 The Hot Spot is narrated by Harry Madox a rootless drifter who arrives in town one steamy summer day.  He takes a job as a used car salesman.  But why go to the trouble of working for a living when the town's bank is so poorly guarded?  You see, Harry is not above stealing and he's not above having an affair with his boss' tramp of a wife. But when he falls in love with an innocent young girl he makes himself vulnerable and sets himself up for a precipitous descent into a world of inescapable torment.  The Hot Spot is a well plotted, engaging tale that has a very smooth narrative flow.  Charles Williams has written this novel using a style of prose that is richly detailed and remarkably descriptive.  And he unashamedly structures the story around a main character who is largely unsympathetic. Harry Madox is a thief and what one would generally refer to as a lowlife.  Ironically, it is the one decent aspect of his persona, his genuine love for another human being that does him in.  This is a powerful and moving book that is hard to put down.  Do yourself a favor and read it.
