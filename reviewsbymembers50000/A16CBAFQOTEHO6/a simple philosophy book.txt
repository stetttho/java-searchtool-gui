 I have always been skeptical of philosophy books, having been scarred at school and university by their academic pretentiousness. Descartes once wrote: "I am sorry this letter is so long. I did not have the time to make it short" This book is short and concise, yet more profound and well-thought out than the encyclopedic volumes that we all had to plough through. Admittedly, some of the essays are weaker than others. Some are vague, but most are brilliant in their thought and structure. Kolakowski isn't trying to give everybody else's definitions and views on topics. He just writes what he thinks and sometimes, he does miss a point or he doesn't explore a particular issue as much as he could. Nonetheless, this is a very good read and it does provide a valuable guide on how to think and argue about issues
