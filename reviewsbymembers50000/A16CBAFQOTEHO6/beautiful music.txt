 I had never heard of this CD when a friend gave it to me four years ago. I don't speak a word of Spanish, but I listened to it non-stop. One ugly day, I lost the CD and I was devastated because I couldn't find it anywhere.  When I eventually found it, after forgetting about it for a couple of  years, I put it on and it still is magnificent music. She sings so  powerfully and so movingly. Buy this!
