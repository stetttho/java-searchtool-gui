 If you've ever wondered who sampled what for which hits, this CD is your answer. You'll be surprised (or at least I was) by how many artists sample tracks that we all assume they wrote in the first place. Fatboy Slim, Massive Attack, Eminem and many others have pumped all the tunes on this CD to transform them into huge hits. My personal favourites: the original Praise You (very slow, very chilled) and the original Mo'Money by Notorious BIG which is a fantastic disco track by Diana Ross. Other tracks are either too obscure and you can barely make out what was sampled, or way too similar to the sampled version (ie MC Hammer took a song called "Superfreak", did absolutely nothing to it, and released it as Can't Touch This) This is a brilliant CD and I'd say that 90% of the tracks sound much better than the rehashed versions.
