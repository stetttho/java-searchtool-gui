 This was a real pleasure to read. It is beautifully written, extremely amusing and very accurate concerning the streak of vanity that flows through human nature. Like most authors of his day, Thackeray wrote this in serial form for a newspaper and the introduction of the book reveals that he was in it only for the $, hadn't properly thought about the structure of the book and just figured out what was to happen as he went along. This keeps the reader guessing as to the direction of the novel and each chapter becomes a novella revolving around one set of characters. The plot keeps twisting and turning at a delicious rate and Thackeray's occasional interventions to give his opinion about his characters made me laugh out loud. However, fact that the book was a series does become frustrating at times, when there are some inconsistencies in the characters. For example, one character (not giving anything away)emerged at the beginning of the novel as quite a headstrong, sympathetic and innocent character, yet during the novel she turned a little too quickly into a calculating, Machiavellic and frankly evil one. Another similarly went from lovable rogue a la Heathcliffe to dull and stupid in a matter of chapters. Nonetheless, I strongly recommend this book. It definitely rings true on many levels and all of us humans have vanity and greed dormant somewhere inside us.
