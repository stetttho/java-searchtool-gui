 It's true, there are two essays in this book that I have not finished (especially the essay on television). However, cruise ship holidays, pro-tennis tournaments, David Lynch and state fairs. Amazing writing, very  funny indeed. He manages to observe the social mores of the that special  tribe that takes 7NightCruises, gives advice on why not to date girls whose  mothers look like Lynchian characters and gives us an insight of tennis  players and their whimsical, yet understandable behaviour. Very funny  stuff.
