 This is not so much a review of Inifinite Jest or David Foster Wallace's unquestionable talent. This is a review of people who claimed that the book was sterile, long-winded, pointless, "a joke in itself". I  suggest you finish reading "Peter and Jane Go To The Beach" or  get your IQs tested. I understand that, for some people, books that exceed  25 pages are difficult and if there are more than two characters, things  really get tricky. Could you please stop polluting this space with your  pointless and pseudo-intellectual critiques. Long live DFW!
