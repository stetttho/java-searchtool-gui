 I can't really comment on the technical format or quality of the DVD, since I know nothing about this. What I can say is that the Coen brothers are really strengthening their reputation as one of the few truly intelligent acts in Hollywood. Loosely adapted from Homer's "The Odyssey", this film is truly "American"; icons such as apple pie, Americana music and Dapper Dan hair care(does or did it actually exist?) permeate this movie and it looks great. One does not really need to see it in terms of the original Odyssey: it's perfectly enjoyable even if you can't really remember Homer's version. George Clooney and the rest of the cast are stunning. The photography is amazing. My personal favourite moment: a midnight Ku Klux Klan gathering that is so well choreographed and so grotesque, you have to say to yourself that The Coen brothers are now a major force in shaping American cinema. Watch out for their new movie "The Man Who Wasn't There"
