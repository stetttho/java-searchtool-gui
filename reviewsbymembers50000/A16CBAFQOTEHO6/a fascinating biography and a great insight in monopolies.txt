 What really separates this book from other biographies is the virtually unbiased approach with which Chernow examined the subject and his clear understanding of Rockefeller's motivations and reasoning. I personally  thought that he emerged as quite a sympathetic character. He was extremely  simple and non-ostentatious (compare with Andrew Carnegie and JP Morgan).  He was very devoted to religion and it was religion that gave him the  justification for total control of the oil refining industry. He honestly  believed that this chaotic industry (populated in its early days with  unreligious cowboy types)needed a strong shepherd to control the flock.  With hindsight, we can see that his methods were not helpful to the greater  good, but in the 1870s business ethics were non-existent.  After a few  chapters, Rockefeller's humility and austerity does get a little tiring and  the constant references to Baptism show Rockefeller as a bit of a religious  fanatic. Finally, I thought it was generally fascinating to learn more  about this enigmatic man and his nascent industry. (Message to Bill Gates:  Rockefeller made most of his money after Standard Oil was broken up into  Exxon, Texaco, Arco, Mobil etc...)
