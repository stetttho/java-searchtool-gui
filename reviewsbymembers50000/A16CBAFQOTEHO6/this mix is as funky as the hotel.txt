 I stayed at Hotel Costes in Paris once, a couple of months ago. I was slightly nervous because I was with two quite conservative clients who, I thought, might not like it. It became immediately obvious that we were going to have a great time. As soon as we walked in the lobby, decorated like a boudoir from a Balzac novel, we heard this incredible music. All these beautiful boys and girls were grooving away, sipping cocktails and looking fabulous. There is a big outdoor courtyard by the lobby, around which are all these little "salons". The atmosphere was just intense and the music was definitely a major factor. When I bought this CD, I was immediately transported back to that night, where we revelled until the wee hours, despite having a meeting at 7am the next day. You will not be disappointed. Trust me, trust the other reviews.
