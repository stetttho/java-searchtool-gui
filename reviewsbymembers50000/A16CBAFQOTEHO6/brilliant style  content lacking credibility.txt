 Tom Wolfe, in this book, makes the same basic mistake as Karl Marx. He figured out what he wanted to say, researched it and made all his observations and all the facts concerning the subject fit his original idea. It really should be the other way around. I think Wolfe probably woke up one morning with a grudge against modern architects and decided to write this pamphlet attacking them and their buildings. While it is true that modern architecture has made some gigantic and monstrous mistakes, it has also produced some exceptional buildings. Norman Foster and Richard Rogers (to name only two of a wide range of very talented contemporary architects) would never be erecting HSBC or Lloyd's buildings if Le Corbusier and Gropius and Mies van der Rohe hadn't existed. In one instance, Wolfe criticises the latter for the Seagram building, claiming that it is full of contradictions to the Bauhaus rules. Perhaps, but the Seagram building is an architectural classic and it helped pave the way for a generation of sexy edifices. However, some of Wolfe's attacks are well founded. It is true that the Bauhaus architects believed themselves to be intellectual giants and that some of their ideas were spectacular and costly blunders (Will somebody please tear down Le Corbusier's Unite d'Habitation in Marseille?)Yet Wolfe strikes again with his brilliant idiosyncratic style that makes one forget the shallowness of his argument or the fact that it seems he bears a grudge against these people. It's a good book, it will make you laugh out loud and if you don't know much about architecture, it's a good start to get acquainted with the names of the main players and the buildings they designed.
