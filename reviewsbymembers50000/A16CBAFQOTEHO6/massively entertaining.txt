 Everybody has been writing that glamorama proves that bret easton ellis is past his prime, that it doesn't quite cut it when compared to earlier works. I strongly disagree. Readers usually get irritated with his name-and-brand-dropping, but that is the whole point of the shallowness of the 80s (American Psycho) and the 90s (although everybody thought that somehow it was a deeper and more meaningful decade). When the author tells us who is talking to who at which parties, the combination of celebrities is so preposterous and grotesque that one is forced to smile at this society, where celebrities seem to talk to each other, only because of their divine status. This is an extremely funny book, with very surreal characters. The locus of action includes some familiar places and names: New York as an island of bars, restaurants and clubs and not much else, Camden College and a cameo appearance by the Bateman brothers. However, it moves to Europe roughly half way through the book. Interesting contrast with American Psycho, the description of Victor's appartment is barely half a page. I do believe this book will be revered as much as American Psycho, once we all take a look back at the 90s and realise that it, like its predecessor, was a pretty ridiculous decade.
