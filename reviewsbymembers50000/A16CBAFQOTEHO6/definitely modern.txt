 I can't quite make up my mind about this CD. The first two tracks "Disco Science" and "Naive Song" are very modern tracks that will inevitably become quite cult. The tune is great and it really gives off some exciting vibes. However, one can't help but notice a vague similarity to Daft Punk, especially Disco Science. The other tracks are not bad, but slightly sub-standard when considering the first two. "Paradise (Not for Me)" which features Madonna is by all means a cool track but don't expect anything like Madonna's previous efforts (NB: This track is also on Madonna's "Music"). All in all, it's easy to get excited about this CD, because all of the tracks are fairly novel, but you'll end up listening to just three of them (exceptional)
