 I am so relieved that Daft Punk managed to bring out this album and show the music industry that they could go beyond "Homework". This album is slightly different; some of the tracks are a bit of a departure from their previous album, towards a style that sounds a little like Phoenix or Air. If you enjoyed Homework or Air's Moon Safari, you'll definitely like this...
