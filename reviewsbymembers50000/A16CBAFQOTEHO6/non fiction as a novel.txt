 Tom Wolfe who definitely ranks as one of my favourite authors wrote this  brilliant book about the Mercury Space Program. He illustrates perfectly  how and why these seven astronauts were hailed as heroes, the setting for  the story and what made these men tick. It's also very funny and can only  really be described as Intellectual Top Gun. The one criticism I have about  the book is that Tom Wolfe could have concluded the book by telling us what  happened to these men and how the space program developped, even if he does  it in a small epilogue. Nonetheless, it's hugely entertaining. You'll enjoy  it.
