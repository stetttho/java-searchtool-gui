 Austin Power meets Jean-Paul Sartre is probably the best way to describe this artist and his exceptional album. Gainsbourg is very famous in France for his beautiful music, for which he recruited such stars as Brigitte Bardot and his partner Jane Birkin. He is also remembered for such interesting episodes as telling Whitney Houston in a very coarse way that he wanted to sleep with her (on live French TV)or teaching Malcolm McLaren (of Sex Pistols fame)the more poetic aspects of female genitalia. Anyway, most of the tracks on this album are classics and the rest are hidden gems. So if you want to pretend that you're that roguish kind of a player, this is the first step.
