 Alien is one of the great sci-fi/horror films ever made.  Hitting theatres back in 1979, it created a true and new type of science-fiction.  I was fortunate to see the re-released in October of 2003 in theatres, and it is a great opportunity, one which shouldn't be missed.  Alien a film which made Director Ridley Scott, and actors Sigourney Weaver, Tom Skerritt, Ian Holm as well as others into stars.       The film takes place in space, where a group of explorers have embarked upon a true, fascinating discovery.  Huge eggs, which cannot be explained.  What they are, where'd they came from, how's they evolved?  What they discover soon becomes the ultimate horror.  A killing machine, stalking and taunting its victim one by one.  The film offers quite a few scary and chilling moments.  Director Ridley Scott, who has made many critically acclaimed movies (Gladiator, Black Hawk Down, Thelma & Louise, Hannibal,  and the recent Matchstick Men) makes one of the best films of our generation.      Alien: The Director's Cut, does feature new footage, about several minutes.  Alien came out on Halloween (10-31-03), and it would make sense as to why.  A great film, especially to view on the big screen if you haven't yet.      Alien is rated R for Science Fiction Violence/Gore and Language.  The film has one fairly bloody sequence as well as alien attacks.  The profanity is moderate.  All in all, an entertaining movie worth seeing.  Own the DVD or Video.
