 Confidence, a new con-caper from director James Foley and featuring an all-star cast is clever, funny and sophisticated.  Edward Burns plays Jake Vig the handsome con man, the leader of so-called "professionals."  Pulling off a con for these guys is a sinch or so it seems when Burn's men by accident steal money from the wrong guy, Winston King played by masterful Dustin Hoffman.  Vig has two options, die or pull off the slickest and biggest con of his career.  In the new pack he brings along a sexy con artist, Lily played by beautiful Rachel Weisz and his returning crew featuring Paul Giamatti, Brian Van Holt and Luis Guzman.  Though Burns is in on some trouble because a Special Agent is on his tail played by Andy Garcia looking rather old with his beard.          Though Confidence has a great, intricate plot that perplexes, the film features many colorful characters, different in a unique way which makes the film even more watchable and interesting.  The film is filmed in flashbacks in the sense that Burn's character is being held at gunpoint, which can be irritating at times.   Though viewing this film is well worth the money, infact I bought it without seeing it and I enjoyed it very much.  I wish I saw this one in theatres but oh well I'm glad I got to see it right away when it was released on Video and DVD.       Confidence is rated R for Language, Violence and Sexuality/Nudity.  The language can be rather strong and excessive at times, the violence is understated, which includes some gunplay (usually bloody) and fistfights.   The sexuality isn't explicit but it does contain reasonably strong sexual innuendo and partial nudity.  I highly recommened this one.
