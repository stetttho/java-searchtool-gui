 Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs is an American ganster classic.  It's clever and well written, nicely acted and intense and even a bit funny at times.  The film's cast includes an ensemble of fine actors including: Michael Madsen as Mr. Blonde, Harvey Keitel as Mr. White, Tim Roth as Mr. Orange and Steve Buscemi as Mr. Pink along with a small role from Tarantino himself.     In 1992, Tarantino stunned many with this fine acheivement in filmmaking, working from his own screenplay.  Madsen, Keital, Roth, Buscemi, and Tarantino play gansters all working together in an elaborate heist.  Suddenly, the cops are already in place and a bloody ambush takes place, and it seems that there is a set-up in play.  One of the gansters among them is more deceptive than he seems and the intensity is at its highest.       As well as know this is a Quentin Tarantion film so it's most obviously violent.  Reservoir Dogs is rated R for Strong Violence and Language.  The violence includes bloody gunplay, fisticuffs and grisly scenes of torture, including the infamous "ear" scene.  Michael Madsen is perfect as a psychopath, he's malicious, brutal and even in some cases funny. Tarantino soon went on the road to stardom making bigger movies, including the amazing Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown and the Kill Bill films, Vol. 2 is due out April 16, 2004 by the way.
