 The Italian Job, is a clever and sophisticated caper.  Nice cars, nice actors, nice settings, pretty much everything you'd like and want to see in a good movie.  Mark Wahlberg stars as the main character, Charlie Croker, a pro at what he does: stealing.  He's an excellent thief, and the main planner for a crew of theives including, Mos Def, Seth Green, Jason Statham, Edward Norton and Donald Sutherland.  The opening of the film starts in Venice with a smart heist in process.  When the thieves have gotten what they wanted: 35 million dollars in gold bars, one the theievs (Edward Norton) goes bad and makes it off with the gold and kills Sutherland's character in the process. Wahlberg soon recruits Charlize Theron (Sutherland's daugther) to help get revenge for their mentor and her father and to try and get possession of the gold back.        The film's premise is simple but cleverly done.  I for one never knew being thief could require so much dedication and devotion.  The main highlight of this film is the climax is the car chase involving those beloved mini-coopers.  I don't think this film had the best car chase considering there were other films with a lot better chases including T3:Rise of the Machines, Bad Boys II and The Matrix Reloaded.  Though it is pretty good and worthwhile.  I luckily got to see this on the big screen and it actually is worth it.  The DVD has some good features, including a lot of behind-the-scene featurettes.      The Italian Job is rated PG-13 for Violence and Some Language. The violence includes bloodless gunplay and some fistfights.  The language is occasional but not too strong.  See it!
