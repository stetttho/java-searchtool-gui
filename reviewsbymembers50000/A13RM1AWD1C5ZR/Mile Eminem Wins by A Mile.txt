 8 Mile, a new film from Curtis Hanson and starring Eminem was actually quite good.  I saw this film nearly a year ago, in theatres during its opening weekend and I must say, I wasn't displeased.  Though Emimen never will be someone I admire, I must say that he does have talent and that he can, ok hear me out on this, ACT!        The premise of 8 Mile is nothing incomprehensible, essentially Eminem plays Jimmy Rabbit, a guy from Detroit who has nothing going for him, but wants to be a rapper.  He has some good pals, including David Porter aka "Future" played nicely by Mekhi Pfiefer.  Rabbit lives in a trailor with his dissoluted mother played by Kim Basinger, they're relationship seems to be volatile and unsteady.  Gorgeous Brittany Murphy plays Alex, Emimen's love interest.  The film is nicely directed by Curtis Hanson also featuring a good screenplay from Scott Silver.  Hanson who made other great films including "Wonder Boys" and the excellent "L.A. Confidential," makes another wonderful film here. The true, exciting parts of this film are without question the rap battles, which are masterfully done.  Though I was sort of anticipating a nomination for the song "Lose Yourself", I didn't expect it to actually win.  I also thought that film might receive other nods, but oh well.  All in all, 8 Mile features a good cast.         Some things which I'm still uncertain about is how accurate is this movie in accordance to the real life of Emimen?I'm sure some of it is, but how much?  The sex scene between Murphy and Emimen's characters seemed gratuitous, it didn't seem like there was any chemistry between them and the scene didn't seem to have any special meaning or purpose.  It was also a tad long, or so it seemed, but not specifically hardcore or graphic, as demonstarted in one scene inMonster' Ball.         8 Mile is rated R for Strong Language, Sexuality, Some Violence and Drug Use.  The language well, sure that's obvious to expect and is the main reason for the "R" rating.  It's fairly strong, and is also included in rap lyrics besides dialogue.  The sexual content includes three fairly explicit sexual situations including the Murphy/Eminem sex scene.  No nudity, which they could've thrown in there cause it wouldn't have hurt or lessened the rating, and surprisingly there isn't any in the "Uncensored" edition on the DVD.  The violence isn't all particularly graphic or brutal, mainly some fistfights and a non-lethal shooting.  There is also some marijuana smoking.  All in all, a fine movie, worth owning on Video or DVD.
