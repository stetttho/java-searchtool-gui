 Enemy at the Gates is a fine war film, despite a few critical flaws which could've made a bit better.  Director Jean-Jacques Annuad creates an elaborate and perfect atmosphere for this film, which takes place during World War II.  The film is based on a unique true story.        It's 1942, World War II rages on, the fate of the world is being decided in a city on the Volga River, Stalingrad.  Jude Law plays Vasseli Zeitsev, a very skilled Russian sniper.  Jospeh Fiennes plays his friend, and is a Russian journalist who writes stories of Vasseli's victories and makes him more known to the public.  Ed Harris plays Major Konig, a German sniper who is sent to kill Vasseli and save Hilter from more humiliation.  Rachel Weisz plays the love interest of Law's character, for there's also a little love story involved in this war epic.  The film works better as a suspense thriller than a war film, but it indeed is great for its intensity.  Of course Saving Private Ryan remains the best or one of the best war films still and probably will continue to be.       Enemy at the Gates performed decently at the box-office for some critics really did bash it.  They said there more than enough inaccuracies especially with the accents, which I have to say is true, the Russians have British accents, while the Germans or atleast Ed Harris's character has an Ameerican accent.      Enemy at the Gates is rated R for Strong Graphic War Violence and Some Sexuality.   The violence is reasonably bloody, after all it's a war film and deals with sharpshooters.  The violence includes battle sequences and substantial gun violence, most of which is bloody.  There is hardly any profanity.  As for the sexual content, there's an explict sex scence which was really quite gratuitous and some other sexual innuendo.  No nudity.     Gates is good, but it still seems to be lacking and it certainly could've had some improvements to make it a great deal better.
