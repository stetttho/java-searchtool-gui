 Mary-Kate and Ashely Olsen are simply two of the hottest rising stars.  Well actually they're no rising stars, they've practically been stars since they were adolescents on a funny sitcom called Full House.  They're career started off to a huge success.  They soon made movies, tv shows, and apparrel of all sorts.        Winning London, which was relased in 2001, was another typical Mary-Kate and Ashley film.  I have to say for its nice locations, it's worth a look.  But the movie's plot is pretty formulaic and similiar to all their other movies, which can be a bit boring as well disappointing.  So you wonder why I honored this movie with 4 stars, I just can't get it out my head to be honest.  Ever since they showed it on the MK & A marathon on ABC Family on New Year's Eve of 2003, I became upssesed with it.  Infact, I thought of buying on DVD,  I still haven't yet.  There's just something about the movie with is so attractive, I suppose it's Mary-Kate and Ashley, I just like the film and the setting too.        The plot, I don't even know why I'll bother is simple as anything.  Mark Kate and Ashley play Chloe and Riley, not like on their show So Little Time, which is the opposite.  They're participating in a United Nations game/contest.  They are the winners of the preliminary competition and are asked if they'd like to compete in the real competition in London.  Of course they agree and are sent to London, where they meet cute guys who they hang out it.  Jesse Spencer plays Mary-Kate's love interest James.  Oddly enough Jesse Spencer is Australian and is being portrayed as British.  There are a few sterotypes and/or flaws in this movie.  What movie doesn't have flaws?       The film is rated G for General Audiences.  It contains nothing extreme obviously.  Mild sexual innuendo, mainly some kissing.  No profanity obviously.  A fine pick for all ages. All in all entertaining, and am looking forward to Mark-Kate and Ashley big screen debut, New York Minute due to be released in May.    See Winning London, I suggest renting it first.
