 Gigli, the highly unsuccessful film of 2003 has been called so many horrible things, there is no need for me to list them.  I honestly had some hope for this film when I saw trailers for it, because I never pictured it to be this bad.  Also the film had a fine director, Martin Brest who made such critically acclaimed films as Scent of a Woman and Midnight Run along with Beverly Hills Cop.  Ben Affleck amazingly gave a watchable performance as Larry Gigli, a mobster.  Jennifer Lopez plays Ricki, Larry's love interest who turns out to be a lesbian.  The plot of this film could actually be called original but it just isn't a bit appealling.  It was also very boring and not at all entertaining.          Gigli rated R for Pervasive Language, Sexual Content and Brief Strong Violence.  The film contains non-stop profanity, infact according to People magazine, the f-word is used 75 times.  The sexuality is reasonable, mainly one semi-explict sexual situation and sexual innuendo but no nudity.  The violence includes a point-blank shooting and a cut off thumb.    Not at all worth seeing, I sadly saw it in theatres in addition to 3 other people.  I wonder what will become of Martin Brest's reputation as a film director, it looks like he should make a movie based on a bestseller instead of writing something from the top of his head or maybe he should've casted other actors besides Ben & Jen.  In a way I feel bad for him but I feel more disappointed in myself having lost a precious 2 hours of my life.  Definetly winner of worst film of 2003 or at least a solid nominee.  Funny this is there were other films in 2003 which did worst then Gigli and no one even noticied them.  These films include, Marci X, which only made $900,000.  Grind which made $2.6 million.  The Order also performed at the box-office taking in about $4.3 million.  Other flops included, My Boss's Daugther, Dumb & Dumberer & Duplex.  So all in all there have been films that have been much worse then Gigli.  Gigli taking in only $3.8 million and costing an astounding $54 million to make which will be remembered as one of the worse films ever made.  Is it possible the duplicate the success of Gigli, who knows?  All I can say is let's just pray for Ben & Jen in their next film together caller Jersey Girl, which is written & directed by Kevin Smith.  So it should actually deliver some laughs, but well we'll just have to wait until February.
