 Rush Hour 2 is just as good as the original and perhaps better.  Jackie Chan does some pretty amazing and innovative work here with his creative and deadly stunts.  Tucker is always hilarious, making every other line make you laugh.  Director Brett Ratner and writer Jeff Nathason make a good sequel, this one for the most part is a lot funnier, in terms of action/ violence though it seemed equal though.     The plot of this one is pretty predictable but the film never manages to be boring.  Essentially, Tucker and Chan think their stay in Hong Kong will be a rural vacation turns out a bomb which detonates at the American Embassy has killed two American agents.  Chan makes a reluctant Tucker investigate with him.  From here this becomes a funny, worthwhile buddy picture. Though the jokes seemed to be a bit over-the-top in contrast to the origianl they still made you laugh.  The jokes were for the most part racist, if that bothers you then this one might not be a good pick for you.          Rush Hour 2 has stunning locations from Hong Kong to L.A. to Las Vegas.  A nice cast includes Roselyn Sanchez, John Lone, Zhang Ziyi (from Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) and Harris Yulin.  It's more than inevitable from the ending that there'll be a Rush Hour 3 and who could possibly not want there to be one. Rush Hour 2 is rated PG-13 for Action, Violence, Language and Some Sexual Material.  The violence includes mainly martial art fights, some bloodless gunplay(less that in the original) and at certain points excessive language, some of which is strong for the "PG-13" rating.     For the most part this is one great buddy comedy, I luckily had the privilege of viewing in theatres and was glad I did for it was well worth it.  I now own it on DVD and am pleased to have it part of my collection.  Buy it or atleast rent it.
