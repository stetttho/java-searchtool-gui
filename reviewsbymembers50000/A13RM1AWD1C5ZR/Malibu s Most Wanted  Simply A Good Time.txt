 Malibu's Most Wanted was for the most part silly and rather dumb but it was hilarious and for that I give it 4 stars, the one star deducted is for the amount reasonable silliness in this film.          Jamie Kennedy plays B-Rad, a white kid who thinks he's a rapper and is not whtie.  He thinks he's slick, cool and gifted, yet he's horrific when it comes to rapping with his bad rhyming and pathetic lyrics.  His father, a candidate running for governor of California doesn't want his son to ruin his campaign and so he requests his campaign manager (Blair Underwood) to hire two actors (hilarious Taye Diggs and Anthony Anderson) to scare the black out of his son and simply make him white.  Taye Diggs and Anthony Anderson try to be two ganster-like characters from the hood who are trying to make B-Rad realize that he can obviously never be black or be a rapper.  Regina King plays Anderson's counsin Shondra and soons becomes the love interest of B-Rad, which could set a bit of distraction.  The premise of this movie does sound rather unintelligent and is the least bit clever but it's an amiable farce loaded with laughs.  Director John Whitesell can coax out laughs here.  The main charaters behind the immense laughter here are Diggs and Anderson,  who pulled off there characters well and did look a bit convincing in their roles.  Kennedy alongside has his laughs as well.      Malibu's Most Wanted is rated PG-13 for Sexual Humor, Language and Violence.  The language is rather excessive with the frequent use of a certain b-word.  There is a sufficient amount of sexual innuendo, not explicit though.  The violence is infrequent and understated, mainly some bloodless gunplay and brief fistfights.  Worth owning, or atleast renting.   DVD includes deleted scenes, trailer and commentaries.
