 The Crow is based on the dark comic series by James O'Barr.  The film was directed by Alex Proyas who later made Dark City and the upcoming feature I, Robot, which is due out July 16, 2004.  The Crow is a stunning film, its visuals are dazzling.  This film of course is always remembered for the sad and unfortunate death of Brandon Lee, son of martial arts legend Bruce Lee.  Brandon Lee had emerged and stunned us with this great performance and if he had lived he could have had a promising and grand career as an action star.        Brandon Lee plays Eric Draven, a rock musician who is brutally murdered along with his fiancee.  A year later he comes back to life by the powers of a crow and the crow guides him as he seeks revenge for those who took away his life.  The movie does turn simply into a revenge flick, but it is a quite stunning one.  This film features some great action sequences and Lee as I stated earlier gives a great performance.  The film was released in 1994 and spawned two sequels, neither were as good as the original, infact the third went straight to video.  Due to Lee's unfortunate death, the filmmakers were able to finish the film using digital technology by what they had filmed of Lee's performance so the film could be released.  Proyas released the film to honor and in tribute of his death, some where upset by this but others think it was good of him.  This is a great film and I'm pleased to say it is a part of my DVD collection.      The Crow is rated R for A Great Amount of Strong Violence, Language, Drug Use and Some Sexuality.  The violence is pretty intense and some might be offended or upset by it, after it one can expect that considering this is a dark and gritty film.  The violence includes the use of guns, knives, swords as well as fisticuffs.   There's also use of profanity, most of which is strong, and some drug use.  Overall a great movie and one which should be seen.
