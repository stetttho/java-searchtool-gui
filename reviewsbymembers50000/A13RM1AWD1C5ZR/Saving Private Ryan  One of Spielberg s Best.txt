 Saving Private Ryan is the best, if not one of the best war films ever made.  It certainly is realistic and intense enough to be.   Tom Hanks delivers a fine performance as the captain of an army unit.  Director Steven Spielberg creates the film which some say he was born to make.       Ryan, starts out with the D-Day Invasion, which is filmed so realistically and is truly one of the best battle sequences ever filmed.  That scenes alone earns the film the "R" rating.  Tom Hanks plays Captain Miller, a captain in search of a private who he must find and bring back home after his 3 brothers are killed in action.  The film features an ensemble cast of great actors, from Tom Sizemore to Edwards Burns, to Matt Damon, to Vin Diesel, to Barry Pepper to Giovanni Ribisi and Adam Goldberg.  For being a 1998 release and then being re-released in February of 1999, this film does feature excellent battle sequences which are very realistic and well done for being a 1998 release.          It's easy to see why this film won 5 Academy Awards at the Academy Awards in March of 1999.  It won the award for Best Director, which it truly deserved.  There have been other great war movies including Black Hawk Down, Platoon and We Were Soldiers but none as good as Saving Private Ryan.        Saving Private Ryan is rated R for Intense Prolonged Realistically Graphic Sequences of War Violence, and for Language.  The violence as I've stated earlier is extremely graphic, specifically the opening battle sequence of D-Day.  The violence includes guns, others explosives and explosions and knives.  The language is reasonable and not too strong or pervasive.  Spielberg's direction is assured and powerful in crafting this masterful war epic.  The acting is superb and the script is sharp.  Definetly worth owning on Video or DVD.  I hope they re-released in theatres again, because it's that good.
