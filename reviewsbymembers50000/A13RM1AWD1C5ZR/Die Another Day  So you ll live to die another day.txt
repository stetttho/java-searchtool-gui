 Die Another Day, the 20th Bond installment is for the most part entertaining.  The best Bond film yet, well I'm not sure. Featuring a great cast including Halle Berry, Rick Yune, Toby Stephens, Rosamund Pike, Judi Dench and John Cleese as well as Diretor Lee Tamahori (Along Came A Spider, The Edge).        Pierce Brosnan reprises his role as the secret agent James Bond 007, which he still aces.  Bond is trouble when he learns he's been betrayed, soon he embarks on a craz North Korean (Rick Yune) who has an accomplice, our villan Gustav Graves (Toby Stephens).  Graves has a sophisticated weapon, a laser satellite and wants complete dominance over the world.  The movie's plot isn't totally original or intelligent but it still works.  Bond is on the trail with an assitant, our new, gorgeous Bond girl Halle Berry playing an NSA agent named Jinx.  The film features a few remarkable sets and locations including a set consisting of ice.  The gadgets aren't too amazing, mainly the car, the Aston Martin Vanquish with a unique invisibility mechanism.   Gadget guru John Cleese and Judi Dench as "M" sparkle.       Die Another Day is rated PG-13 for Action Violence and Sexuality.  The film is abundant in terms of violence, including gunplay, swordplay, a hovercraft and car chase and fistfights.  There is also a decent amount of sexual innuendo, and non-explicit sexual situations but rather steamy and erotic.  Worth seeing, I saw it in theatres and was glad I did and now own it on DVD.  DVD has a lot of features and is a two-disc set.  Purchase or atleast rent.
