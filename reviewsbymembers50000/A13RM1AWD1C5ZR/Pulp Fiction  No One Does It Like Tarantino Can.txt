 Pulp Fiction, the 1994 film which stunned the world.  Critics hailed this film as "the film which has redefined motion pictures in the 20th century," and it surely did.     Quentin Tarantion followed up with Pulp Fiction after his superb debut, Reservoir Dogs, infact it's hard for me to say which I liked better, because they're equally phenomenal.  Pulp Fiction also led many actors on the road to stardom including John Travolta who delivered a great performance, but the real star here is Samuel L. Jackson as Jules Winnfield.  Jackson just has a presence on screen which is fantastic, his portrayal of anger is displayed so realistically and whenever he recites a certain passage from the Bible, it makes you quiver in a sense.        The film revolves around three different stories, one involving two hitmen, Travolta and Jackson another involving a boxer (Bruce Willis) and the 3rd involves a couple planning on robbing a restaurant (Tim Roth and Plummer).  Also features nice performances from Ving Rhames who plays the manager of Willis who soon gets involved in a huge dispute with him, Uma Thurman who plays Mia Wallce, she's the girl John Travolta has to babysit.  Eric Stolz as Lance, Harvey Keital as Mr. Wolf, Christopher Walken and Quentin Tarantino also show up in some cameo performances.  Tarantino along with Roger Avary won the oscar for Best Original Screenplay in the 1995 Academy Awards and it's easy to see why.  This is one the best films of the decade, and still remains to be, it's a cult classic.        Pulp Fiction is rated R for Strong Graphic Violence and Drug Use, Pervasive Strong Language and Some Sexuality.  The violence is graphic, and you're obviously going to be expecting that, I mean come on it's a Quentin Tarantino film.  Violence includes bloody gunplay and fisticuffs.  The profanity is excessive and non-stop essentially and it's also quite strong. Drug Use and sexual innuendo, there is a nasty and unpleasant rape sequence, but not exceptionally explicit.  There's also implied nudity, specifialliy when Bruce Willis gets out of the shower and we really don't need to see, well I'll leave that to your imagination.  All in all, a fine picture and definetly is worth owning on Video or DVD, specifally the Collector's Edition on DVD, it's packed with special features.  Add this to your collection and check other Tarantion films: Reservoir Dogs, Jackie Brown, Kill Bill, Vol. 1 and soon to be released Kill Bill, Vol. 2. (April 16, 2004).
