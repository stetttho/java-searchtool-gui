 Scarface, the 1983 action-drama starring Al Pacino as a Cuban refugee is one hell of a movie.  Though dealing with much controversy, Brian DePalma makes a striking movie here.  Al Pacino plays Tony Montana, a druglord who is involved in the business and gets involved in a deadly trap and soon becomes a target.  The plot is isn't incomprehensible nor it is disposable.  It's an intitially intriguing film at the look of the drug business and how it can cause so much havoc and ruin a man's life.  Based on the old 1932 film made by Howard Hawks, there is a huge difference between them.  Scarface also features nice supporting roles from Michelle Pfeiffer, George Bauer, Robert Loggia as well as a few others.        Director Brian DePalma depicts much realism with quite a bit of over-the-top violence, including a chain saw scene (only blood is shown), a hanging from a helicopter but mainly fatal and bloody gunplay as well as excessive profanity, to be more specific the use of one particular word starting with an "f."  Though the film has an "R" rating, at first it was rated "X."  You may not realize it, but much devotion and hard work was put into making this film.  Oliver Stone wrote the screenplay, easy to say why it was controversial now.        The new DVD edition features some nice behind-the-scenes footage, mainly 3 documenataries on the acting, creating and rebirth of the film.  All featuring interviews with cast and crew.  Though if you viewed the film recently, it may not seem as over-the-top now as it did back in 1983.  Scarface is worth owning on Video or DVD.  Note: Not a film for young audiences.
