 Mixed reviews.  Always hard to come to a conclusion when half the reviews are 5 stars and the other half are one.  So let's break it down:  Sound, very good.  I had to toy with my 5.1 settings a bit but finally got it and was happy.  Sight:  great, sharp video.  Extras, good, some cool old footage.  So what's the problem?  First, I really wish this was a normal show with just Moterhead doing its thing.  Instead we get about a third of the songs with guests joining the band and it's totally lame.  Secondly, as seems to be the current fad the video jumps all over at that "MTV generation/beyond short attention span" rate.  The cameras are not still for a second.  I'm in my 30s and I know that the younger people have grown-up with this sort of thing but I still cannot get used to it.  So there you have it.  If you don't mind strobe-like, video game-like camera movements and hacks like Doro destroying Motorhead classics you will love this DVD.
