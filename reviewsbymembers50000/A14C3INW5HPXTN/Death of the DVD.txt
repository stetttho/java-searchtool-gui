 First off, the movie didn't hold up to how I remembered it. But if you're considering buying the DVD, chances are you love the movie. So I am not going to review it. But I was disappointed in the DVD itself. The back cover says "5.1 Surround" but there is nothing here. I even got up and put a different DVD in my player to be sure my rear and left and right speakers were working.I didn't expect start of the art sound, but saying "5.1 Surround" on the back cover is an total lie! If you have a good quality video version of this movie, the DVD will not be any better.
