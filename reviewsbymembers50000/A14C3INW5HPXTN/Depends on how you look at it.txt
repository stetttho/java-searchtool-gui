 Well it's Johnny Thunders any way you look at it.  The DVD production is pretty much the video pressed on a digital format (you didn't honestly think anyone would put any real cash into this, did you?). But it's not awful. It's rare to have any live video footage of this band so I would have to say it's worth buying.  It's short, sweet and Thunders close to his worst.  It will make you wish he was captured on video on better days.
