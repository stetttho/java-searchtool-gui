 No way!  If you're a Hanoi fan, I don't think you're going to like this.  This is way beneath Andy McCoy.  The singer is like a second-rate Tami Down (of Faster Pussycat) and the songs are just generic LA Guns type stuff.  I listened to this CD four times and I swear not one song sticks in my mind.  Wait, I lied.  "Don't You Never Leave Me" is good.  Yes, you read that correctly.  As if this song being on 5 Hanoi CDs is not enough it's been resurrected once again here. Pass this one and get Andy McCoy's brilliant "Building on Tradition".
