 This book has all the great Blues licks I have always wondered how to play. With the tablature and the CD, it is so easy to get the sounds you want. I couldn't believe how easy it was to learn such an aggrate of cool  sounding, smooth solos. So much stuff is packed into this little gem of a  book. I highly reccomend it.
