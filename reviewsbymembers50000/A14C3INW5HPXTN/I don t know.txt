 I have always heard that there were some foreign Exorcist rip-offs out there. The prospect seemed interesting.  I would not expect one of these to be anywhere near as good as the real thing but figured it might be cool to see. I also happen to like Italian horror so this seemed like a good place to start. Wrong.  There are some good moments and some nice camera work (which Italian horror films are known for) but the problem is that this movie moves very slowly.  Now in a movie like the Exorcist you don't mind the building pace, it's worth the wait and indeed adds to the film's feel.  But here I just found myself waiting and waiting for some action.  Once the action starts it's then over rather quickly.  If you're like me, you will be tempted to buy this movie...but really try and see it first.
