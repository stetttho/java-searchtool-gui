 Why, oh why did I not listen to the reviews.  I couldn't tell you how the transfers look...the DVD were toast upon arrival!  Yes, it's true...all true. I got the box and before I even opened the wrapper I heard the DVDs were loose in their cases and guess what?  Ruined!  Totally scratched and useless. Please believe me, don't waste your time.
