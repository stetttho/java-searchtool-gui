 I am not reviewing the movie itself (though it is not one of Cronenberg's better films) but the DVD media. I am so disappointed in the quality of this DVD. The picture is lame and the sound is just awful. I have great  equipment (TV, stereo surround, etc.) and then I see this! I know the movie  is from 1970 and low-budget, but there should have been some  "bump-up" in sound quality, at the very least, for the DVD  release.
