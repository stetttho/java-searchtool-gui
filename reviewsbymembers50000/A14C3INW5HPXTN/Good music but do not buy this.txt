 They need to find a better way to stop sharing.  I very rarely get time to listen to my CDs in my stereo.  So I buy them, rip them to MP3 and listen on my MP3 player during my commute to and from work.  Now, after paying 14.00 I cannot listen to my own CD!  An outrage!  Also, if you put it into a computer it opens its own program and will not play through Media Player or Real Player.  And...when you put it into a computer it loads hidden software on it and then will not play in any other computer!  I am sure someone has figured out how to make MP3s by now so just download it and you will have more freedom with the files than if you actually paid for it.  Unreal!
