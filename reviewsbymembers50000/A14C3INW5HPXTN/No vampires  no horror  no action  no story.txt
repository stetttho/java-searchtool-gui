 I just started reading Laymon.  I started with Loathsome Night in October and while not great, it was a good read full of cheap thrills and a need to know what would happen next.  I'd compare it to the kind of stuff Bentley Little writes: not high art, kind of hokey and cheap but fun.  So as my second Laymon read I decided on this because of all the great reviews.  Mistake.  First of all the characters, while being between 15 and 17, all act like little kids.  I think the writer was not able to get to the "place" in his mind and messed up as far as how one reacts at one's age. But the real gripe with this book is the story...there is none.  Seriously, the first 300 pages is the main three characters deciding whether or not to go to the show!  It's one big circuitous mess for 80% of the book.  No vampire action if that is what you're looking for.  If you are looking for Laymon's signature cheap thrills, look else ware.  No horror, no sex, no action.  Just kids walking around town trying to decided if they should go to a show.
