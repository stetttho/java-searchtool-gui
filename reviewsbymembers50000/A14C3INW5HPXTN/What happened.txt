 Wow! After two amazing CDs this is what KWS offers us? The sound and songwriting is rushed and the band sounds weak. The songs that were written strictly for radio play (more than half of the CD) are just awful. If  "In 2 Deep" is the only song you've heard, be warned, it's the  only good song on the CD. Very disappointing. By the way, is it just me or  does this CD sound a LOT like Hootie & the Blowfish?
