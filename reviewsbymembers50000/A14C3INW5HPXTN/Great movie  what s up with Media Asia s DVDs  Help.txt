 Has anyone but I had trouble with accessing the Langue section of the Menu on Media Asia DVDs?  I returned one, thinking it was defective.  However, any DVD I own from Media Asia is the same: It seems as if it's entering the menu and then just "bounces" me back to the main menu!  The rest of the menus are fine; only the Language is this way.  Thanks.  Scangemi@ohpny.com
