 Wow!  Man I gave this book the benefit of the doubt because of all the shinning reviews. Who the hell compared this to Strabb's Ghost Story?  After reaching page 250 (a grueling task) there was still no sign of a story here. Thorne goes on and on for countless pages with boring detail...what drivel. Do not buy this book! P.S. Who did the editing? There were more typos that I can count.
