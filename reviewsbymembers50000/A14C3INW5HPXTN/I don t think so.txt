 This was my first Ketchem book.  I choose this one due to all the rave reviews.  I don't know.  Perhaps I am missing something; perhaps not. Maybe this is just not my cup of tea.  I thought the writing was fair and the characters very fleshed out.  But there is just so much of a girl tied up in a basement being tortured that could be interesting.  It also got very frustrating watching all these people coming and going and watching the beat and not even saying anything about it.  Sorry, I just didn't get it.
