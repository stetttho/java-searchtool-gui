 This is an okay book. The story is sweet (however wastes many pages) and the Rites are good, basic yoga. It's yoga, not magic, make no mistake. After doing the five Rites (21 times each) for a few weeks I felt good; about as good as you can feel doing light yoga. But you are not going to loose a lot of  weight. Bald men are not going to grow hair. And you are not going to look  half your age (one story in the book tells of a man over 70 who, after  doing the Rites, looks under 40!)If you are very old and do nothing and start doing this, you should feel better. But really, do not believe all the insane stuff that people are writing here.  Seriously, if half this stuff were true word of mouth would be huge and the entire world would be doing this and no one would ever gain weight, be bald, have gray hair, need a cane, be sick and we'd all live to be 125.
