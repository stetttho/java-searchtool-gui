 I really like Bentley Little.  He seems to be a writer you either get or don't.  I get it.  However, this is not only the worst book Little has written but it's up there as one of the worst books I have ever read.  There is so much "nothing" going on here I am stunned.  It takes well over 300 pages (the book clocks in at 375) for any action and it's such a letdown.  It seemed Little wanted to school the reader on Russian customs more than anything else.  One of the main characters, an over-religious grandmother, stands in my memory as possibly the most annoying character I have ever endured.  If you are new to Little's work please begin with the Store, the Ignored or the House...great stuff there.  But this was seriously awful.
