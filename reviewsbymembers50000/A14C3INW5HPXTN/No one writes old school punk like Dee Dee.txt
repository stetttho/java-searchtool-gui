 The reason the Ramones still used Dee Dee as a writer (after his departure in '89) was because he's the God of this style of songwriting.  This is evident here.  The songs are mostly great and Dee Dee's voice is always complementary to his songwriting style.  Great stuff here, folks.  Only two complaints:  1) Joey Ramone guests on one song (I am Seeing UFOs) and it's one of the weaker songs on the CD.  Not because of Joey's voice but it's just a weak song.  2) Dee Dee's wife sings a few of the songs and while her voice is not bad enough to ruin the songs (she's a real soft, weak singer), it would have been great if Dee Dee sang them.  Come to think of it, one of the songs she sings (Get Out of my Room) would have killed if Joey sang on it rather than the one mentioned above. All in all, great CD.
