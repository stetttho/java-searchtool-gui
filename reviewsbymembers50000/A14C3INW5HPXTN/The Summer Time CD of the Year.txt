 Part Look What the Cat dragged In, part Buzzcocks, part Ramones. Great CD. Old-school pop/power/punk. Real R&R is finally back! I wish I had C.C.'s phone # so I could call him and tell him how happy I am with this  CD. It's just a shame that Poison fans will most likely not dig the fast,  old punk sound and Ramones' fans will most likely not give "the dude  from Poison" a chance. Buy it! Much better than anything Poison has  done since its debut.
