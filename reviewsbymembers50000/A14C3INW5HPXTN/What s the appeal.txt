 Man, this is the fourth or fifth Laymon book I have read.  I get his style: very circuitous "action", cheap thrills, anti-heroes.  Okay, I get it.  Here's the problem with that formula with this book.  Very much like "the Traveling Vampire Show" (hailed by fans as his greatest work and man that book just stunk!) In "Bite" the main characters just go round and round doing absolutely nothing.  I Swear Laymon wrote for three pages about one character getting dressed!  The thrills are just not here. Very little action. And the characters...  Yes, I get the "anti-hero" thing.  But Laymon just can't make you care.  Look at piece like Pulp Fiction.  Sure, we don't like the things the characters do or their ideals.  But we LOVE the characters themselves.  The characters in this book are SO annoying.  And the male lead is just pathetic!  The female lead just leads him around, making him risk his life over and over.  She gets him hurt over and over and he just takes it all and tells here how "brave" she is.  Man, even a dog knows not to go into the same spot after getting kicked enough.   I started reading Laymon with "Loathsome Night in October".  That's a book.  Messed up characters but you LIKE them.  The action in simple (like all Laymon books) but he keeps it INTERESTING.  And the cheap thrills are plentiful.  I swear this is one of the three worst books I have ever read.
