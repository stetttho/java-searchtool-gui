 This movie is definitely cool.  The band (Guitar Wolf) is also cool.  Fun stuff.  Campy cool.  But...well there is not exactly as much zombie action as I thought.  But that's not my main gripe. What really stopped this from being a total killer movie is the use of CGI!  Yes, all (and I mean all) of the gunshots to the zombies are CGI!  It especially look bad when the shot is to the zombie's head (about 96% of the shots).  Man, why did they do this?  Other than the CGI the movie kicks.  But it's really distracting because it looks like a rockin' Romaroesque romp one second and a cartoon another.  Still, it does not totally kill the movie but man, what a mistake.
