 This CD is so bad I am actually mad.  There is no way that these reviews are from regular customers.  Trust me, these reviews are from the creator of the CD and his friends.  It's sad because Amazon reviews used to be a great way to cut through the nonsense and get the real 411 from other "regular" customers.  But these reviews are lies.  I have a friend (who will remain nameless) and he published a book and had everyone he knew write in 5 star reviews before it was even out.  He also made over 20 logins with Amazon himself just for this purpose.  Sad.  Seriously, this CD is all talking and for over an hour the man names off body parts.  Now I have done meditations where a body part is named off and the listener relaxes it.  But this is literally a man just saying the names of body parts.  No direction, no relaxation techniques, no music, nothing!  Do you want to pay for a CD like this?  Honestly, anyone could have made this.  You could make this yourself easily.  What a rip off.  Please do not buy this.  "You have toes...and toenails...and toes.  You have toenails...and toes.  Toes and toenails.  Toes."
