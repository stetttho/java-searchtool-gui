 Sorry, folks, but this book does not hold up.  It's starts off with a fast pace and characters and a story that just sucks you in.  But as more (annoying, pretentious) characters are added...well it goes down hill.  This was a chore to finish.  The writer is clearly trying to appeal to the hip, cool, gothic youth and is kills what should have been a great book.
