 What's with all the five star reviews?  Wow.  I'm going with two stars because this book is made for kids and does a good job at attracting kids with all its funny pictures. But come on.  These are total common sense recipes. If you are getting it for the pictures and for kids to laugh, fine.  But for cooking (even for kids), no way.  And it is a cookbook rather than just another kids? picture book, right?  Seriously, the recipe for ?Eat a Pita Pizza? is ?buy a package of pitas, jarred spaghetti sauce and shredded cheese.  Put pitas on tray, put sauce on pitas, put cheese on pitas, put tray in oven at 350% and cook until cheese bubbles?.  Now, do you really want to spend hard earned money on that?  The recipes are really very insulting. Bam!
