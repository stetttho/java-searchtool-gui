 Let's start by saying I am a huge fan of City of the Living Dead and the Beyond.  So even thought I have never seen this movie, I bought it...mistake.  This does not have a fraction of the atmosphere as the for mentioned films.  And while I don't mind the thing we overlook in a Fulci movie (lack of concrete plot, bad acting, awful dubbing) where was the monster(s)?  It's like watching a Godzilla movie where the monsters are only in the last five minutes of the film after watching an hour and a half of nonsense!  And the DVD....  While the print is clean I have to say that Anchor Bay's job is a shadow of what they did on the films I mention above.  The sound is 2.0!  I was going to pre-order Anchor Bay's Demons/Demons 2, but after the job they did on this...no way.
