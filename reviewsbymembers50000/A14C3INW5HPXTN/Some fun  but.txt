 I have to agree with the reviewer who said that the Misfits still were good post Danzig but this has crossed the line.  Jerry Only has put together what he calls an "All Star" version of the Misfits.  What a joke.  I had no problem with the Graves' Misfits.  The songs were good, his voice kicked and they were less serious and more funny and that was cool with me.  Guys that age trying to be mean and scary would have been dumb (can we say "Danzing", folks?).  At this point Only does not want to hire anyone else to sing and is now the new lead singer and while his voice does not suck...this is just lacking.  Only says he wanted to pay tribute to the 50s but truth be told he can't write a song so they did what all washed up bands do: make a cover CD.  The DVD confirms what a joke they have become.  However, this CD/DVD is almost fun in it's sadness.  Buy it used for under $5.00 and have a laugh.
