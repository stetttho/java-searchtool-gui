 Okay, I really didn't think this CD was going to be this good.  I have always thought of Andy McCoy at the creative mind behind Hanoi and was not too crazy about Not Fakin' It (the only Monroe solo CD I ever heard before this).  But this is one killer CD.  I swear if this was more well known it would be much bigger.  Monroe plays all guitars on this and while there is no over the top guitar playing here, it's perfect and impressive.  The CD sounds amazing.  The only down points:  1) while this is a great version of Self Destruction Blues, I never like artists remaking their own stuff.  2) Not Bad For a White Boy, while a cool title is a lame song.  But otherwise, I swear this CD is amazing.  Too bad it's so hard to get.
