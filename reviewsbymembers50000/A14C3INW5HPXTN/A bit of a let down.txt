 The version of Lady's Boy on this may be enough to justify it's existence (it's awesome and just as I remember it) however, the overall package is a let down. I don't know exactly what extent vintage TS there is,  but it  seems a bit more than half of this stuff is nonsense. The songs before  Dee's joining the band is pretty lame. I'd recommend passing on it unless  you must have everything Twisted has done. I love the old stuff (Under the  Blade, Ruff Cuts) but this really does not cut it.
