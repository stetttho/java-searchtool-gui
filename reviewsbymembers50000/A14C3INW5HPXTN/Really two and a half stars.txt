 This thing does the job.  But people are going way too crazy with the 5 star reviews.  I know most people only feel the need to write a review for something they give either 5 or one star(s).  But come on.  This is a typical popcorn popper.  It pops.  Leaves an average amount of corns un-popped (yes I have used the good stuff) and does its job as well (or poorly) as every other popcorn maker on the market.  One reviewer noted that the stirring rod removed the non-stick coating where it rubs and this is true.  Silly that it's designed that way.
