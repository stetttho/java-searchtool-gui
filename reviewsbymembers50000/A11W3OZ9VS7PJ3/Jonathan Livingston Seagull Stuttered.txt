 I can't help but get the vague feeling that Bach wrote this book because not enough people "got" the ideas behind Jonathan Livingston Seagull, to which Illusions has often been called the sequel. I believe "repetition" might be a better word for it. Repeat the same basic lessons and subtext of that book, but add into that stickier and overly complex explanations of the exact same ideas and club people to death with the meaning. If you're bright enough to understand the lessons in the aforementioned book, you're much off better with it. "Illusions" is more or less just pummeling to death with new-age philosophy, and not even philosophy without significant holes. I can't say that it's altogether poorly thought out, or wholly uninteresting, but the resulting sticky, sugary mess of text is just a bit much to stomach.
