 "Trivial" would be the best way to sum up the Guide to the Camarilla. While White Wolf employs some skillful writers and paints some lavishly detailed portraits of the World of Darkness and its inhabitants, as seems to be the case with a good number of its supplement books, the Guide to the Camarilla does little more than shuffle around things that were already said. Unlike the Guide to the Sabbat (an organization left much more mysterious in the core rulebook), the Guide to the Camarilla takes everything already said about the Camarilla in the main book and repeats it. It seems as though entire sections of pages are devoted to reiterating the exact same point. Were some of the redundancy cut down, this would amount to little more than a handbook. The added clans seem completely inexplicable, as well as equally redundant (ANOTHER Appearance 0 clan? Ohh, and ANOTHER one? Boy, the Nosferatu must be jealous by now). Only the references to the Salubri and the gargoyles are at all new or relevant, and the latter is somewhat ill explained. The only conceivable useful portions cover Camarilla politics, which again have already been gone over fairly effectively in the main book, and the points that the Guide expands upon could already be inferred by anyone with a healthy amount of common sense. All in all, this guide is like the excess stuffing that manages to make your pillow lumpy and uncomfortably instead of additionally soft. At worst, the whole piece smacks of wallet-gouging.
