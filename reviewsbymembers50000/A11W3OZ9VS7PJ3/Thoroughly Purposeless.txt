 It seems to me that this was the product of "Gee, we just finished making money off the monster manual. How can we make some more? Let's just shuffle it around and publish it again!" This book is more or less just a nearly totally random collection of monsters. Some fiends here, an undead there, one totally random celestial, with absolutely no unifying theme or purpose. The monsters themselves are, as usual, well described, well thought out, and many have rather good illustrations as well. However, "What's the point?" is the question that surrounds this book. If you have the opportunity to pick this up for a couple bucks, then it might make sense, as this book, with its few new worthwhile additions and lots of pointless rehashes, is about the D&D equivalent of a 10 cent yard sale grab bag.
