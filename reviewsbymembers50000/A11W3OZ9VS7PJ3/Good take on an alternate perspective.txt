 The Dragon Blooded. Hailed as gods among men, wielders of semi-divine authority, heirs to vast wealth, power, prestige and authority. And, ultimately, second bannana to just about everyone. This sourcebook is great material for Dragon Blooded NPCs or players alike. It gives a great deal of insight into the strict, austere shadows of the Dynastic Houses and Immaculate Order, and the mixture of power and obligation that such lofty positions entail. The only issue I would take with the book is that of balance. Realistically, the Dragon Blooded command the key strength of superior numbers and peerless levels of social and political power. However, for a group which is supposed to be the weakest of the Exalted, they seem to have an awfully large array of powerful and well-thought-out charms, as well as powerful, unique martial arts styles which seem conspicuously absent from supposedly more powerful types of Exalted. Nevertheless, if these are perceived as problems, then most judicious Storytellers should be able to find ways around them, and I can't say anything bad about the writers' skill at portraying the simultaneous strength and weakness of the legendary Dragon Blooded. Whether you just want more realistic NPC interaction with your non-Blooded group or a foundation for Dragon Blood players, I can certainly recommend this addition.
