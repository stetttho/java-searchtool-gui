 I was delighted when I first heard about this book. I'd been peeved for some time by the focus on evil presented by the Book of Vile Darkness as being somewhat unequilateral. This book is, in essence, a guide to playing good characters. Not just run-of-the-mill good characters, but for those who really want to get INTO playing a truly good character, right along with all of its consequences and dilemmas. It's hardly easy or simple, but definitely interesting, and this book provides some great food for thought on such characters, as well as a handful of really nifty and fairly original prestige classes. However, apparently, there are some balance issues, as a few of the new classes and feats are rather disproportinately powerful (though a careful DM can balance these out with the alignment requirements and making sure that these prestige classes in particular are stricter about the characters being good). This book does Dungeons & Dragons the deep service of demonstrating that goodness is neither laughable, trivial, feeble, or misguided. It is a powerful force unto itself that is as every bit as real, potent, and meaningful as any other sort of power. This is the type of heroism that I feel this game was really made for, and the classes and feats herein are perfectly suited for characters who have reached epic levels of both moral development and power. In a nutshell: Nice guys only finish last because it takes them a little bit longer to wind up to deal the deathblow.
