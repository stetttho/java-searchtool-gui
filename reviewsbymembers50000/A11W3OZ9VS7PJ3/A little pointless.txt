 Okay, the whole "Bush is a criminal" thing is an overused and rather trite "viewpoint". However, it doesn't really mean I support his administration. That said, as "cute" as this novelty is, it's ultimately just a bit lacking in purpose. The thing that's surprised me most about this is just the viewer reactions. Apparently, everyone seems to think they're under legal obligation to buy or enjoy everything Amazon recommends to them, when in fact no one even forced them to click the link. The sum of the detractors' argument seems to be "Stop forcing me to click this link." and "Liberals liberals liberals liberals liberals. I'm not saying anything really, I'm just throwing around the word 'liberals' to mean 'people I dislike'." I thought this was about reviewing products, not about reviewing people.
