 Michel Montecrossa is one of the rare modern artists creating intelligent music. The question of war is certainly one of the most intriguing questions surrounding human life. And it is a delicate endeavor for any artist to touch this `Endzeit' theme with vision and hope. Michel Montecrossa is an artist who has this vision and capacity to show the signs of hope pointing the direction beyond the humanitarian failure which every war is. `The truth is peace and world union,' says Michel Montecrossa and he masterfully and convincingly sings about this theme in his 12 songs on the interactive CD-Plus `New Message'. It is no escapist music but positive and full of creative charm which makes it easy and uplifting to listen to the artistic expression of a profound, far reaching and serious question. The song titles already give a clear indication of the far reaching scope of the songs: New Message, True Politics, Europe Song, America Song, Allah's Advent, Hey, Brothers And Sisters, East-West Test, African Concert, If You Stop, Talkin' World Unity, New Creation, One World. In his songs Michel Montecrossa presents a rich variety of musical styles ranging from the vivid folk-like `New Message' to the cosmic symphonic `One World' with a good dose of rockin' world music on the way. The bonus-video `I'm a-lookin' for you, my Lord' is a touching rock ballad song with a straight forward spiritual atmosphere which extends into the music movie showing rare film scenes of Mira Alfassa - The Mother who is one of  the most recognised spiritual personalities of modern time. The `New Message' CD-Plus in addition contains an interesting interactive link to the internet presentation of Mirapuri, the City of Peace and Futureman in Europe, Italy which was founded by Michel Montecrossa.
