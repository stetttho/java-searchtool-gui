WITH HER VOICE AND PERSONALITY SHE HAS OPENED THE DOOR TO A FEELING WHICH IS BOTH HEAVENLY AND SENSUAL. HER MUSIC IS IN A SIMPLE AND HONEST WAY FREE FROM LIMITING BONDAGE TO SUPERFICIAL TRENDS AND THE SOUNDSTRUCTURES SURROUNDING HER ARE EXPRESSIVE OF THIS UNIQUE EUROPEAN - MEDITERRANEAN FLAIR WHICH IS LOVED ALL OVER THE WORLD. FRANOISE HARDY IS THE SWEET AND TOUCHING ARTIST OF TASTE, FRESHNESS AND EMOTION MAKING A LIGHT SHINE THROUGH HER APPARENT FRAGILITY - THE LIGHT OF HER STRONG SOUL. IT IS IN APPRECIATION OF THESE QUALITIES OF FRANOISE HARDY'S MUSIC AND ART THAT I MADE THIS PRODUCTION. 'TIME TO CHANGE' IS MY OWN WAY OF EXPRESSION. IT IS DIFFERENT BUT AT THE SAME TIME CLOSE TO THE SAME INNER SOURCE WHICH IS BEHIND FRANOISE'S WAY OF TELLING THINGS. THE SELECTION OF SONGS WHICH FRANOISE HARDY PERFORMED INCLUDES 'LOVE ME TENDER', PROBABLY THE ONLY SONG IN WHICH ELVIS PRESLEY PARTICIPATED AS ORIGINAL SONGWRITER. TO MANY OF THE OTHER SONGS FRANOISE HARDY WROTE THE LYRICS. THE MUSIC IS COMPOSED BY VARIOUS ARTISTS WHICH I ALL LIKE, IN PARTICULAR MICHEL BERGER AND JAQUES LACOME. ALL ORIGINAL FRENCH LYRICS WERE TRANSLATED BY ME INTO ENGLISH EXCEPT 'MESSAGE PERSONNEL' WHICH WAS TRANSLATED BY FRANOISE HARDY AND MICHEL BERGER. IN ADDITION TO THE SONGS ORIGINALLY PERFORMED BY FRANOISE HARDY I CONTRIBUTE MY OWN SONGS; SONGS WHICH I LOVE TO SING FOR FRANOISE AS A WARM GREETING AND 'THANK YOU' FOR HER GREAT MUSIC OF TENDER STRENGTH."
