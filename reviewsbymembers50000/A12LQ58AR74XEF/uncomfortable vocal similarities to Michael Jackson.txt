 I'm sure Sophie Hawkins is a very fine lady. I'm sure she has fans all across the world. But I'd never heard of her....had this title come up in my amazon.com recommendations so I sprung for a taste. I'm sorry but she sounds way too much like Michael Jackson, especially in the higher register moments. So, I'll stick with the other newfound amazon.com recommendation-artists that connected with me: Jann Arden, Rachael Yamagata, Amanda Marshall.
