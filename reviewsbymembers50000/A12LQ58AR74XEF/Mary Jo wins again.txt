 I have all of Mary Jo's books and each is a treasure. This one is another winnder. Nine chapters cover a number of techniques including paper mosaic with a double-sided tape base, Diamond Glaze 'glazing' on acetate, an image  transfer technique using color photocopies and self-adhesive laminate or  acetate and shrink plastic tricks & techniques. As usual, Mary Jo's  samples are marvelous and each technique is illustrated with step-by-step  photos. I HIGHLY recommend this book as well as all of Mary Jo's paper arts  books. .
