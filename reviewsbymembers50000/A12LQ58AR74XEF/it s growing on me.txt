 At first listen, I hated this CD. I was annoyed by the wierd little fem-yip Alanis tended to insert at the end of words/lines over-and-over-and-over to distraction. I did a listen through and shoved the CD into the discard pile. This week I grabbed a few newish CD's to take back to work and gave it another try. Now I'm playing it over-and-over-and-over. It's growing on me. I actually like all tracks now..whata' change! You'll recognize 'You Oughta Know', 'Hand in my Pocket' and 'Ironic', but all tracks are catchy and quite quite compelling. Please note that there are two extra tracks. Track 13: another version of 'You Oughta Know'....and wait roughly 60 seconds and the 14th track will play. Don't know the name of this one as I'm not an avid Morissette fan, but it's there. A quiet little number <G>. Anyway, now this CD is in rotation with Cheryl Crow, Sarah McLachlan, Billy Idol, and Fiona Apple (my current favs).
