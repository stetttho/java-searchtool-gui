 I first discovered Habib Koite on a Putumayo collection 'African Odyssey' and immediately ordered all three of his current albums. This one is my favorite. Haunting acoustic guitar with interesting African percussion, Koite's voice has the same soulful vibe as Eddie Vedder (for those who come from a more rock/US pop audience). Similar in feeling: Seydu "Freetown" and Boubacar Traore. Lush, acoustic vibe.
