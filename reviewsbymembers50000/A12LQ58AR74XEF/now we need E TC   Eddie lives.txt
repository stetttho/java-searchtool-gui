 While I love this movie, the sequel is even better! For any of you who lived the rock-and-role 70's and 80's, this movie will speak to you. The music takes on a life of it's own as well, and you'll find yourself searching out all the various CD's which support these cult classics. Now, we just need Eddie Lives on DVD to complete the experience....my tapes are wearing out!
