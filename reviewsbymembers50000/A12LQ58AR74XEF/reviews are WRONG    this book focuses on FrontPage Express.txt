 I bought this book because I wanted help working with Netscape Composer. The reviews indicate that this book focuses on this shortware. Unfortunately, the Second Edition (1999) does mentions Netscape Composer twice and includes ONE page discussing Composer. The rest of the book deals with use of FrontPage Express. I'll be returning this disappointment.
