 Although I never watched Alias when it first began, I've now found myself sucked into a world of entertainment that I'm definately enjoying. I bought the first season since I was drawn by the hype, but then immediately bought the next two seasons...without regret! The package deal of all three seasons is a more economical choice than I made! There's something for everyone here....a heartwrenching love story, McGyver-like techy twists, a lot of James Bond action, and the kind of psychological drama that entertain intelligent viewers. For those who don't want to think, perhaps this show might be boring....but for those of us who miss shows like the X-files, this hits the spot! I'm actually viewing and taping the 4th season and eagerly awaiting it on DVD (with all the extras I relish!).
