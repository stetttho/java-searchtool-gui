 After stumbling upon this book after deep disappointment with another multiple 'best-selling' author (Robin Cook) whose books were barely readable (simplistic awful dialogue/wooden writing style)....I am simply enchanted. This book reads almost like a parable and Hoffman's style is complex, lyrical, and involving. I don't see what others find to fault with this book. Realistic, well-fleshed characters, beautiful descriptive passages, gosh....I want more!
