 I'm not a mystery lover. I'm not an Alaskan Malamute lover. But I'm really enjoying these books! So far, this has been my favorite. The author has a great way of making dog-show talk accessible. I admit I'm constantly confused over Best of Winners vs Best Opposite Sex etc etc and avoid the conformation ring myself at all costs (PAY someone else to try to run a straight line down and back). Clever dialogue. Characterization that may be a bit over the top, but amusing. And I keep muttering under my breath that if the author only would admit that Siberian Huskies are 'better' than those hulking, dog-aggressive Malamutes her books would be even better <G> (yeah....I'm biased!).
