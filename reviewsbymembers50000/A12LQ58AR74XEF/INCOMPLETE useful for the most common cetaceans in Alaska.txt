 I have examined this field guide, but find no place for this on my reference shelf. Although user-friendly, this is an incomplete field guide. A number of whale/dolphin genera/species which occur in Alaskan waters are excluded. Although missing from this field guide, I have personally observed northern right whale dolphin and short-finned pilot whales in the Gulf of Alaska during research cruises. Risso's dolphin and false killer whale have been recorded from Alaskan waters and are also excluded from this book. A number of other ceteceans (especially Kogia spp, Stenella coeruleoalba, and several other Mesoplodon spp. especially M. carlhubsii) are potential accidentals in Alaskan waters during warm-water incursions and these are also ignored. Please consider purchase of a complete guide to cetacean identification instead. Try Leatherwood et al.'s "Whales, Dolphins, and Porpoises of the Eastern North Pacific and Adjacent Arctic Waters'.
