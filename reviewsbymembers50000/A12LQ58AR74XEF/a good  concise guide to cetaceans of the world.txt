 Not a particularly good field guide, as all cetacean genera and species are covered. I grab this book quite frequently when refreshing my mind on the distribution and distinguishing characteristics of a cetacean outside my field of expertise. For those interested in even more meaty fare, pick up Richard Ellis' 'The Book of Whales' and 'Dolphins and Porpoises'. Both books are must have additions to the serious cetologist's book shelf. My field guide of choice for North Pacific field study: Leatherwood et. al. 'Whales, Dolphins, and Porpoises of the Eastern North Pacific and Adjacent Arctic Waters: A guide to their Identification'.
