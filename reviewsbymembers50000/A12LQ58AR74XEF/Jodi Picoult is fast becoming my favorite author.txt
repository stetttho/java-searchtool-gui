 Although I'm usually a natural history and science fiction buff, I stumbled upon one of Jodi Picoult's other books, The Pact, and as soon as I finished that one, I knew I needed more from this author. I'm impressed with her ability to build characterizations, to use English in an entertaining, engrossing manner, and her story-telling gift matches that of the masters. This is NOT a light romance novel as suggested by other reviewers (I'd never have finished it if that were the case), but has a depth, a flow and a magic that grabs you. I was not able to put this book down until I finished! AND, I am NOT easily impressed by new authors! Try it!
