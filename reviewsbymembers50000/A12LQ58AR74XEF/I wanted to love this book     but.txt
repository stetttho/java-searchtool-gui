 One of the e-mail discussion lists I'm on recently had a thread about children's books and sled dogs and this was one of the books on the list. I ordered a pile of books and started reading. I loved most....this one fell short. It starts off fine, but the ending gives children unrealistic ideas about what happens when dogs get old. If the author had made it obvious that the end was a dream-sequence....not reality, this would have worked. But to leave the impression that an old sled dog has reached the point where they can only walk with difficulty can suddenly become the lead dog in a team and plead to go off with a musher and his team rather than stay with the child and resolve the issue of Zoe's health/life....well, you decide.   I DO recommend 'Kiana's Iditarod' and 'Akiak : A Tale from the Iditarod' neither of which deal with elderly dog issues but are great stories for children.
