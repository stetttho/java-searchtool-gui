 When faced with problem behaviors in a rough collie back in the 70's, I  read every dog behavior book on the shelves at the time. William Campbell's  book was the only reference which addressed the issues I needed to  understand. Campbell's description of 'active defense reflex' vs 'passive  defense reflex' dogs made all the difference in my understanding of  Shasta's behavior. He gave me all the advice I needed to turn this behavior  around with very specific instructions which worked to perfection.  We went  on, after reading this book, to earn a CD in obedience whereas before I  could not even touch his body without being bitten ('active defense  reflex'). I recommend this book to anyone I contact who is dealing with dog  behavior problems and I'm very interested to see how this new edition  compares to the one I purchased in the 1970's!
