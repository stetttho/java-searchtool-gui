 Maybe I'm just a sucker for Dennis Quaid's smile (shrug)....but I actually liked this DVD. I'd heard over and over what a dud it was from my co-workers, but, since I'm not apt to make my choices based on movie reviewers, I gave it a go. The dialogue wasn't bad....the special effects were fine, and the story line interesting. Gave me stuff to think about even though I might not buy the premise wholesale. All in all....a good movie ride.
