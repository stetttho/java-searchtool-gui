 Many orchid growers prefer working with species rather than man-made hybrids. For those growers, this book is invaluable. I actually have two copies: one at work to aid in discussions with co-workers who also grow orchids and one at home. A majority of the species mentioned are also pictured in fabulous photos. This book does not pretend to be all inclusive, but the most common species of the genera listed are included. That's certainly enough for me. If I become interested in a large genus (like Dendrobium), there are Dendrobium monographs available to fill that need.
