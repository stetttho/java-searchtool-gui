 I bought Richie's new album along with Bon Jovi's newest album 'Crush' and Jon Bon Jovi's 'Destination Anywhere'. The last two have been shoved into the 'oh well' pile and Richie's has ended up in the REPLAY over-and-over  pile. Makes me wonder how Jon (although I love much of the Bon Jovi music  and Jon's 'Blaze of Glory') has ended up as Bon Jovi's lead singer when  Richie Sambora outshines him in that regard. Marvelous vocals....as much  punch as another fav of mine...Eddie Vedder! WOW!
