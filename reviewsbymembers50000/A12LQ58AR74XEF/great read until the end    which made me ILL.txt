 I wish I hadn't read this book. I suppose this may be construed by some as evidence of a great author....who has IMPACT on his audience. I did enjoy this book until near the end, where everything falls apart and violence takes over. I'm sorry...if I'd KNOWN about the utter chaos of the ending, I'd not have ever started. Some may enjoy books which make them feel ILL at the end....I do not.
