 I purchased this out-of-print book in an attempt to track down some anecdotal at-sea sighting information for Tasmacetus referenced in another publication. Although this book does not document the sighting info I was looking for, it's full of quite a bit more useful information than I expected! 30+ pages of taxonomy, whaling info, natural history notes and first aid for stranded marine mammals is followed by identification sections. A two page chart showing blowing/surfacing characteristics of some of the larger whales (including all rorquals) is particularly useful, as is a 2 page key to toothed whales using teeth. The information on Ziphiid whale tooth placement is summarized well. This is followed by a species directory, divided into large whale, medium-sized whale, and smaller whale/dolphin sections. This is further divided into sections by morphological similarity (e.g. large whale with dorsal fin/without dorsal fin). All similar species are pictured together with outline drawings of head, and text summaries of key characters. Lastly, the species accounts include further information, including photos of stranded animals from the area. All in all, this is a useful addition to my cetacean reference shelf. The taxonomy is a bit dated, and some of the Ziphiid stranding information has been outdated by DNA testing of museum specimens. But most students of this group will already know this.
