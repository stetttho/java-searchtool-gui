 If you are looking for a field guide to the cetaceans of this area, please consider A.N. Baker's "Whales & Dolphins of New Zealand and Australia: An Identification Guide". The cetacean species accounts are brief, one-page summaries with limited information. Artist renderings of the animal are used instead of photos. In addition to species accounts, quite a bit of general information about evolution, reproduction, communication, behavior, strandings etc. make up more of the book than the species accounts. If I'd seen this on a book shelf, I would probably pass it up. I'd never pay $100+ for a copy (shrug).
