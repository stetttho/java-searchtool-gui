 franzen is just so deep.  it looks like he's having a lot of fun playing the tortured artist, especially with that self-indulgent photograph on the cover, geez, talk about laying it on pretty thick.  after reading the corrections i kept my expectations pretty low.  so i wasnt' surprised when i picked up this new book of essays on how to be alone, which should have been retitled  "how to be a pretentious artless snob, who likes to copulate with his own cleverness." but that probably wouldn't fit on the cover.  so franzen is obviously depressed and dismayed by consumer culture, oh boo hoo, so is every other young person in america.  his amateur psychology is akin to those literary discussions you might come across in some east village bar on a friday night.  franzen, for the most part, has the mind of an academic.  you get the feeling that he could've been a good professor at some elite university where self-indulgence and pretentious babble is appreciated and adored.  but as a creative writer, his stuff doesnt' work.  anyone with a college degree can deconstruct society as franzen does.  you don't see any other writers doing this kind of stuff, because frankly, these "woe is me! society is a big mess!" kinds of pieces are a waste of time.  they're the last refuge for writers who can't write fiction, but who still want to be famous some how.  in conclusion, don't read this, unless you're in a prison with a twenty year sentence and have nothing better to do.
