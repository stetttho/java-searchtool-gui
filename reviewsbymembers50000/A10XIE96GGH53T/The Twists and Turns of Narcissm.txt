 How does one become a writer? Well, from Updike's perspective all you need is some mindless ambition, coupled with a merely technical understanding of literature and writing.  If one is to be great, then one must follow Updike's formula on creativity which is: the more unintelligible the better, and to the extent that the reader is frustrated and baffled, made to feel insecure and dumbfounded by an empty metaphor is the extent to which your novel succeeds.  An author, Updike leads us to believe, sits high above in the stratosphere, writing tome upon tome of messianic goodness for the edification of the ignorant flock, who can't help but be awed by said author's transcendent knowledge.  Updike is obviously on another level.  Perhaps if I develop a megalomaniac delusional sense of self I could write just like him.  That would be groovy.
