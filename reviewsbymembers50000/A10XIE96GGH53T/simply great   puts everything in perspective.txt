 first of all, i would recommend that you read all of murakami's books before you tackle this one, otherwise you'll just be left in the dark.  overall, this book gives you the major themes and influences behind murakami's works, and how they relate to each other.  the bifurcation of worlds, Rubin tells us, is present in all of his stories, either explicitly or implicitly.  and throughout this book, we see murakami evolving.  he struggles with what it means to be a japanese writer, especially one who has nothing much in common with his predecessors.  we also see murakami, a loner by nature, coming to grips with fame and all its implications.  but this is not a biography.  what little biographical detail there is is presented as mere background information for how each novel was written.  altogether, this book will not disappoint.  rubin's writing style is clear and precise, and his analysis is right on.  altogether, rubin has written a great critique of murakami.  hats off gentlemen, hats off.
