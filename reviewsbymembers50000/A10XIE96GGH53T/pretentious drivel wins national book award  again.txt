 i guess there's so much that's bad about this novel that it would probably be best to focus on the good things, though they are few.  well, i liked the cover of the book.  the art work is masterful. and i like franzen's photo on the back.  with his black rimmed specs and his stylish GQ posture, just one look at him tells you "this is an artist of the highest caliber, who scoffs at all middle class reading habits."  his glare says "beware, this book requires deep reading, so steer clear Oprah's Book Club, lest i blow your mind with my run-on sentences and other tricks of the trade i learned in writing workshops"  well, for those of you who feel like basking in the glow of a writer who's more in love with his own cleverness than with writing well, then this book is for you. i'm sure shakespeare would say that this is a story told by a fool, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.
