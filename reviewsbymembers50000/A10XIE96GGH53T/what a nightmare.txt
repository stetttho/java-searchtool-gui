 though i've already reviewed this book once, i think it deserves more than its fair share of ridicule.  so yeah, i haven't changed my mind.  it's still as bad as ever.  sometimes i'll be taking a shower, and parts of the book will pop into my head for no reason, causing me to vomit and scratch my skin off like an addict in rehab.  not a pleasant experience let me tell you.  after this entire ordeal, i don't think illiteracy is such a bad thing as it is made out to be, that is, if it shields one from the tortuous prose of an artless poser like martel.  so my advice to those who never learned to read is this:  reading's overrated, so you are thereby free of the literary charlatanism running rampant in the world today, martel being one such offender.  therefore, consider yourself blessed.
