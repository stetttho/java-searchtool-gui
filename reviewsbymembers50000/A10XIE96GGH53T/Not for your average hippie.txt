 For some reason, Westerners think that Eastern philosophy is shallow, sentimental, unrealistic, and pseudo-intellectualism.  And who could say otherwise with all the half-baked "be at peace with yourself" self-help manuals being marketed today?  But Ouspensky is the real deal.  Instead of watering down eastern thought in the manner of hippies, Ouspensky presents man in all his complexity.  The reader is challenged, and we learn that awareness, real awareness, requires hard work, as opposed to the local yogi at your YMCA who tells you that mere meditating and stretching exercises will do the trick.  There's so much in this book to take in.  And at some moments you'll think that you're back in chemistry class with all the diagrams and discussions of hydrogens and triads.  But don't be deterred.  If you want to sit and meditate and be happy with your mickey mouse brand of self-exploration, then by all means, steer clear of this book.  But for those of you who are serious, this book can start you on the path like no other, so long as you are diligent and somewhat desperate for another way of being.
