 even though this book is about the 1950's, it is still the best novel on the suburbs that you will ever read.  i don't think any modern writers today can approach the monstrosity of suburban life with as much passion and honesty as Yates.  every one of his sentences seems to carry us headlong into a whirl wind of disaster.  watching the wheelers is like watching a train wreck in slow motion.  we'd like to turn away, and pretend that this is only a novel we're reading, but we know, deep down, that there's so much more going on here.  we feel as though Yates has carried us to the farthest recesses of despair; he has touched upon some semblance of truth, and we can't do anything but look and listen, and take it all in, in spite of the pain.  Kafka said in his youth that "we should only read the books that wound and stab us...we need the books that affect us like a disaster."  if there is any one novel of this century that fits that description, it is Revolutionary Road.
