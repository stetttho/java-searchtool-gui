 i don't know why Bukowski is so popular.  sure, he writes simply without any affectation, and all the scatological humor has probably gained him a huge following in the 15-25 yr. old demographic, but apart from that, there's nothing here that makes you go WOW!  i guess in bukowski's world, the truth is always disgusting and disturbing, and the individual must plod ahead through the chaos of filth and decay if he is to discover anything meaningful.  well, that's a good philosophy, but honestly, making references to crap, masturbation, etc.  does get repetitive after a while.  and why is this edition so big and expensive? seriously, this book good have been condensed into a smaller and cheaper two hundred page volume.  this book definitely ain't worth sixteen bucks.
