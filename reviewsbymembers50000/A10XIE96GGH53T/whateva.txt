 Updike writes poop.  Here is the clearest example of an author who writes more with his head than his heart.  Every new story he puts out is more gutless and inessential than the last. So snooty and cerebral, one wonders whether he has ever suffered or felt a genuine emotion in his entire life.  Sure, he can paint pretty pictures with words, but as for telling a good story, well, he never discovered what that was, and he still doesn't have a clue.  He's the reason why the New Yorker puts out till this day its dull, regurgitated, quintessentially New Yorker-esque type of fiction.  Updike once said of Salinger that "he gets more credit than he deserves."  Yup, that's the kind of talentless ego we're dealing with.  Updike, so afraid of Salinger's genius can do nothing but put him down out of fear and envy.  A mediocre amateur like Updike must always lag behind.  He's written more books than the Library of Congress has space for, but in the end, his texts have never surpassed the blind technical gropings of a second year grad student.  If you want to read this guy, then go ahead, let him bore you to tears, let him make you feel inadequate with all his linguistic highwire acts that signify nothing, let Updike, the arch pretender, help you along as you dig your psychological grave.
