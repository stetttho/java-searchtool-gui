 Though I hate America along with the British, this book tries to pass itself off as literature when it is nothing more than a juvenile rant.  College students could write better than this, and could be much more scathing as well.  The Booker Prize committee obviously had an agenda in picking this worthless piece of fiction.  Since the Brits don't know how to get back at America for its tyrannical foreign policy, all they can do to express their outrage is award this petty trifle of a book with England's most prestigious literary prize.  "Yeah that'll teach those fat Americans to mess with us!"  God, it's so pathetic.  Writing this novel is opportunism at its worst.  Giving it the Booker Prize is downright sacrilege.  This is just one of many colossal blunders that the world of literature has spawned throughout the decades.  And you can be sure there will be imitators, many of which will also receive awards.  Silly Brits.
