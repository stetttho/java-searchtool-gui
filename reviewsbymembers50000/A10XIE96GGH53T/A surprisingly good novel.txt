 at first i was sceptical as to whether Crowley, a mad magician, could write a decent piece of fiction.  well, he pulled it off in my opinion.  unlike our modern novels on drugs, Crowley never glorifies it; he doesn't resort to stream-of-consciousness or wacky, juvenile humor as most hip modern writers have done.  this novel, rather, maintains absolute objectivity while pulling us in to the roller coaster ride of heroin and cocaine use.  we get to see the ups and downs, without any self-righteous moralistic preaching.   and we also learn through this novel, that people don't merely turn to drugs to have a good time.  the actual catalyst for starting drug use is one's own sense of aimlessness, of feeling lost, and estranged from the world.  as drugs increasingly take a hold on our times, this novel forces us to question how and why this alienation occurs.  it is too easy to chastise all addicts as being degenerate evil doers.  we must recognize that the addict turns to drugs because he can no longer bear the illusions of society; he desires something better; he quests after a spiritual catharsis that everyday living cannot provide.  for Crowley, the answer to aimlessness is to stop drifting about mechanically in the herd, because most people out there, he tells us, are already dead; they shun new opportunities for growth, and slog along by inertia alone.  so what do we do? well, we can try to realize our own wills, vague as that may sound.  and once we actualize this will, then we can do what nature has always planned for us as individuals.  some people think they already possess this will, when all they are doing is aping the people around them.  the unified will is something greater than that.  it transcends the herd, and gives one a sense of purpose. []this book is good!
