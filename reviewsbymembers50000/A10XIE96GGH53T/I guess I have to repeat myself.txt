 This book is garbage.  Don't praise it like a monkey just because it won the Pulitzer.  You know you don't enjoy this book, so stop lying to yourself.  Eugenides doesn't need anymore empty adulation.  He already has enough brainless sycophants to last him a lifetime.  You don't owe this guy anything, nor should you respect the Pulitzer Prize on baseless grounds.  Come on, you know you hate this novel, just admit it, you have nothing to lose.  Acceptance, after all, is the first step towards liberation.
