 like john updike, saul bellow, joyce carol oates, and norman mailer, phillip roth is a veritable crap factory.  this book is one of the most tedious novels i've ever subjected myself to.  this guy just needs to stop writing altogether, along with the other old geezers i listed above.  all of these literary dinosaurs are flushing american literature down the drain with every new release.  my loathing of these people knows no bounds.
