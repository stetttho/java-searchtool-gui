 I bought this cd back in july and reviewed it then.  At first I just thought that my abhorrence for this album was only reactionary.  But I was wrong, two months later, and after multiple listenings I still find it to be just as bad if not worse than when I first listened to it.  This album will not grow on you.  And now it is time for the furnace.  Goodbye HTTT, it is time to meet your maker.  Radiohead is dead.
