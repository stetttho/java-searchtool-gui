 maybe i should cut martel some slack since this is his first novel, but i just can't.  like most people, i picked up this mess of a novel because of the pretty Booker Prize sticker on the cover.  the first fifty pages or so kept me interested, but after that, the narrative drifts off into a tedious longwinded account of Pi's life at sea.  if this is an allegory, i sure hope martel would get on with the show, but by the end, all we get is some trite writerly gobbly-gook about the redemptive nature of stories: so if we didn't have narratives, man would be forced to live a life of dry, mundane, reality--boy, that's original martel.  i wish you would have told me this earlier, like before i picked up the book, because there's nothing much else in this narrative (which reads like a grocery list) to warrant publication.  where in the world was the editor in all of this?  martel, like most amateur writers, is verbose and still struggling with his technique.  maybe he'll blow us away with his next novel, which i won't be reading.  and as for the people who hand out the Booker Prize, what the hell are you smoking?
