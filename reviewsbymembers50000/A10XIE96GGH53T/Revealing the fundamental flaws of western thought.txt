 Quantum mechanics, Zukav tells us reveal the fundamental flaws of wester logic.  Whether what is happening at the subatomic level is real or not is not the issue, the issue is that physicists like Einstein, Plank, and Bell have told us that our language is limited in describing the seemingly paradoxical nature of the quantum world.  This book shows us that science has proven its own impotence in the face of such "nonsensical" physical phenomenon at the quantum level and that the only truth that one can get at lies in experience itself and not in theory.   Eastern philosophy is not based upon Western notions of absolute faith in a higher being, because that would mean that God is something apart from ourselves, or dualism, which is what quantum mechanics refutes.  Eastern philosophies like Hinduism and Buddhism are similar to quantum mechanics in that they focus on the interconnectedness, or the oneness of all things, which is what actually occurs at the quantum level.  Eastern thought claims that truth lies in experience and intuition not in theory or language because language and theories are only symbols of the real thing and not the real thing itself.  Many physicists are loath to make connections between Eastern philosophy and physics, dismissing Buddhism as unprovable mysticism. And yet the great physicists of the twentieth century have proven that paradox is the nature of quantum mechanics. Therefore, our regular ways of thinking about reality cannot adequately explain the mysteries of the subatomic world, because the only  real answers are those that lie within experience and not theory.  But don't take it from me. Read the book, and Zukav will explain it himself.
