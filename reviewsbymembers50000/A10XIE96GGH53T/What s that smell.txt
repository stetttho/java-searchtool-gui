 Oh yes, i recognize that smell.  It's the fetid stink of mediocrity wafting through my cerebral cortex--a Eugenides type reading experience indeed.  I thought he was bad when he wrote the Virgin Suicides, but this longwinded, turgid, aimless novel far surpasses the banalities of the previous release, launching Middlesex into the realm of full blown charlatanism.  bravo, jeffrey.  those writing workshops have done wonders for your craft. not only are you drab and pretentious, but you are also destroying literature as we know it, squashing the enthusiasm that any reader might have had in arts and letters, crushing hopes left and right for anyone who expects more out of the literary world than mere word play and cleverness.  oh, eugenides, you've out done yourself.  the world of literature now has its new anti-christ.
