 perhaps i just hate allegories.  perhaps saramago's getting old and senile and can no longer create the kind of masterpieces we all expect from him.  there is virtually no narrative here to speak of.  saramago spends most of the novel going into the minutiae of clay making.  he also dissects every thought and feeling expressed by the characters, leaving the reader restless and starving for action.  but it never comes.  the allegory of the cave is quite predictable, and the overall message is nothing groundbreaking, nothing you couldn't find in any other contemporary publications.  honestly, after i finished the book, i felt cheated.  i think this novel could have worked better as an essay.  as a novel, the cave drags its feet.  after slogging through saramago's torturous descriptions of anything and everything, all we are left with are some commonplace banalities that were already self-evident to anyone who is familiar with capitalism and consumer culture.
