 this book had everything, suspense, action, and more importantly a good history lesson for people with little knowledge of the civil war or the holocaust.  Brown's perspective on how the last supper influenced the holocaust and slavery is brilliant, something i'd never seen before.  i mean, who knew that da vinci was fascinated by the apostle judas, and that within the painting, there is a code that reveals the coming of hitler, stalin, and our new world tyrant george bush.  absolutely mindblowing.  i guess art is packed with so many symbols that i never knew were there.  contained in christ's beard, we find out, is a subtle inscription in aramaic, an ancient language, which proclaimed da vinci's love for another man named Italo, thus proving, that da vinci was a homosexual after all.  man, all of this packed into one mind bender of a book.  it's just unbelievable.  brown has upped the bar for all writers out there.
