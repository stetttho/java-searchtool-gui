 i don't know why mailer is a literary icon.  calling his novels boring and pedantic would be an understatement.  this book is just a lot of senile doodling from a writer who has outlived his relevancy.  i don't know of anyone who likes mailer's books.  they don't get taught in schools anymore, and perhaps that speaks volumes about the durability of his creative vision.  this meandering brain-fart of a book, like harlot's ghost, will not stand the test of time.  i guess it's time to say goodbye to an icon, who, in all honesty, was never much of a writer to begin with.
