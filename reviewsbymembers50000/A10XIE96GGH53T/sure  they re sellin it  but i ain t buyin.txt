 it's ironic.  the more a book gets touted by the literary elite, the more mediocre it actually is.  while on the other hand, the truely good books seem to gain readership by themselves, with little advertising and prodding by the establishment.  so from now on, whenever i hear Oates or the new yorker talking about a hot new talent, i will gladly turn the other way.  this book is a literary fraud.  the literary world knows it, anyone barely literate knows it, but it is being forced upon the public for who knows what reason.  since literature is in its final death throes, all the critics and writers alike are trying to keep it alive somehow, even if they have to claw for scraps, and cling to  "hot new" half-talents like Foer.  in my opinion, if books like this are an indication as to literature's future, then we should just let literature die.  death is far more preferable than the shameless grasping for straws.
