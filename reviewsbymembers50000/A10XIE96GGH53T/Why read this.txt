 With so many good books out there just waiting to be explored, why would anyone read Norman Mailer?  This book is a testament to the author's own arrogance, and we the reader are forced to suffer through all its self-indulgent twists and turns.  Don't read books by this neanderthal.  He's way past his prime.  Actually, he never was in his prime.  All of his books are equally dreadful.  So let's put Mailer's books in the trash bin where they belong.  Haven't we had enough of these writers who write and publish by hubris alone?  Go away Mailer, your time us up.
