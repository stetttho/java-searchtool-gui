 God speaks through music.  In this life where I am forced to drink my suffering to the dregs, I can always put on this album and at least pretend that things aren't so bad.  For those forty minutes, I may know God, not superficially, not like mr. preacher man would have it, but through the unmediated, unadulterated bliss of music.  Everyday I stare into the abyss .  I am overcome by weakness and shiver before it. I feel like ending it all.  But then Mogwai comes, like my mother blowing on my scrapes and bruises, and it's all okay.
