 This is one of the most hilarious novels I've ever read despite all of the type-o's and incorrect grammar, but maybe the mistakes were intentional, who knows.  I must say that I've never read a novel as pornographic as this one.  All the sex might have had the effect of overshadowing what is truly an amazing philosophical idea and this might be the reason for its being dismissed by the public.  For me this novel gives me courage to face my own pending schizophrenia.  All of us are born with a splintered, spontaneous, amorphous being which is subsequently suppressed into unity by our parents, school, and all of society.  The die, Rhinehart believes, is a tool that helps us return to that innocent splintered state, where anything is possible.  Through conscientious dice play, a man should reach the point where there is no opposition between randomness and your own mind.  Your mind, essentially, becomes the die, and all of your repressed selves are given equal opportunity to reign.  The unified self is then broken and one achieves a Zen-like enlightenment.  So in the end, we come to realize that there is no you, there is no me.  Everything's a lie including the words we use.  And once we kill our incessant need for order and simplification, only then can true learning  begin.
