 This book is not meant to be read cover-to-cover.  It would take a very patient and determined reader to go through every example and exception and tax detail.  However, it is in these details that this book stands out.  The language used is straightforward, the examples are well thought-out and realistic.  Use the book more like a reference - go directly to the chapter related to your intended transaction; the chapters are quite self-contained. I believe this book is a necessary addition to any real-estate investor's library.  Spending 30 minutes reviewing the chapter related to your contemplated real-estate transaction will fill you with ideas for suitable tax strategies.
