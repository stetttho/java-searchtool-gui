 While the recorded sound of this set may not be as consistent or flawless as that in more recent (i.e digital) recordings, the music contained very quickly makes up for it.  Anda's music-making is very engaging and convincing, and the ensemble playing is generally very, very good.  The previous reviewer wrote: "... a thoroughly recommendable and economical collection of these concertos".  I couldn't agree more heartily!
