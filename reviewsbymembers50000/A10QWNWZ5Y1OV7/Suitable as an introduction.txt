 This book can serve as an introduction to taxes as related to real-estate transactions.  It is a quick and easy read, and seems to be targeted at the least sophisticated possible investor.  It does a good job of explaining the major points of the new tax laws, and is filled with short examples.  (In my opinion, at least half the examples are so simple that they should be eliminated, for they illustrate nothing beyond what can be said in a single simple sentence).  However, any slightly sophisticated investor will need more than this book can offer.  The strategies offered are seldom beyond the obvious and unattractive ones (e.g. move into your intended for-sale property 2 years before selling, then do that over and over).  In short, an easy read as an introduction, but leaves you wanting more.
