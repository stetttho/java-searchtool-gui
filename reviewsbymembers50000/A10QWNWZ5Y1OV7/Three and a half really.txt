 Well, there is certainly no shortage of extremes in opinion on this particular video!  I assure you, the truth (as always) lies firmly in the middle.  She moves her body around a lot, but so do countless others.  (Even though I'd rather not see it at all, it really isn't *that* bad.  And no one has a stance like Heifetz's, so let's not even go there).  Her Tzigane was not *horrible*, give me a break!  There are better ones, yes, but there certainly are worse ones too.  It is adequate, won't blow anyone away, but nice enough. It is fair to neither Heifetz nor Midori to bring up any comparison between the two.  Heifetz is a force of nature, and he sometimes pales in comparison to *himself*.  (E.g. compare recordings he made really early in his life vs those he made towards the end.  Which is "better"?  Depends on who you ask). I'd say for under [$$], this is a very nice video for 90% of violin/music fans.  The remaining 10% are looking for an all-time-great performance of every piece of music on the video, and are simply not being realistic.
