 I own a variety of books for learning Spanish, ranging from phrase-books (I know, what a joke), to classroom textbooks.  I only discovered this particular little gem a couple of months ago. This author excels at several things: 1) saying the most with the fewest words (I always like to cut to the chase) 2) using just the right number of well-selected examples in all the right places 3) answering your questions just when you are about to ask them 4) thoroughness and perhaps most important of all 5) fantastic pacing, it never drags, and yet never outruns you. There are many experts in the Spanish language, obviously, but it is truly a joy to find one who is also an expert teacher and writer. If you had been previously exposed to the Spanish language in any way, either via phrasebooks or a mostly-forgotten class 15 years ago, get this book.  It sets everything straight permanently in one single reading.
