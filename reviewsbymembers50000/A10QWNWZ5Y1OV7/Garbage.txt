 This was my first exposure to Ms Kotova's work, and I have to say it does not inspire me to listen to her more.  Perhaps I should have started with some other work of hers.  The folks who glow about her tone, etc obviously have no exposure to REAL cellist.  Suffice it to say, if you are a true classical music fan, run away from this garbage as fast as you can.  If, on the other hand, you live by the brilliance of cHarlot Church, or Andrea Bocelli, then this is exactly the sort of thing for you.  For those who sincerely want to hear what alternatives there are to this cellist, may I suggest anything by Janos Starker or Mischa Maisky, and Anner Bylsma for variety.  THEN we can talk cello.
