 I bought this CD after hearing the Ysaye Quartet in concert.  They had held a very fine performance.  However, I am disappointed with this CD.  The recorded sound is not ideal, but much more annoying are the the 1st violin's technical problems.  I do not like to wince during a performance of any music, but there were many such moments in this CD; intonation problems, muddy passages, dubious musical phrasings, and the problems start from the very beginning.  Far more impressive and satisfying is the Talich Quartet recording.  Also deserving of mention are the Emerson and Leipzig Quartet recordings.  Just stay away from the Ysaye Quartet recording.
