 The stories and anecdotes in this book are certainly gripping.  Other reviewers have revealed many of its highlights.  However, a better book would certainly have resulted if a more even flow to the story was maintained.  It is simply too jarring for the reader to be jumping back and forth in time so frequently.  I ended up without a clear chronology of any of the events, just a vague idea.  However, the overarching message is quite consistent - that Afghanistan was in a state of constant war for decades, that the Taliban really were just thugs..., and that women suffered greatly there.
