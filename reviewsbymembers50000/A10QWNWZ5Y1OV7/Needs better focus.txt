 A previous reviewer who accused the book of having too much fluff is, unfortunately, only slightly exaggerating.  If the author had taken the time to tighten up the book and used only half as many words as he did, the resulting book would have been first rate useful.  As it is, the book is a serious test of one's patience and concentration.  The ideas are very reasonable, but the reader has to struggle to separate the wheat from the chaff.
