 I got this CD for the Brahms variations initially, and went straight to it on my first listening.  I felt that the variations was technically and musically solid, but did not stir me as I would have liked it to.  Subsequently, I "forgetfully" played the Schumann Fantasie, and was quite really quite stirred then!  Mr Cohen may have spent more of his emotional energy on the Schumann, than on the Brahms, but this CD is still one of my favorite.
