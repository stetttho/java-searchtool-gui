 With such a catchy title, one should expect a book filled with practical, detailed, perhaps even step-by-step, instructions (or even suggestions) on how one could achieve the goal of "Learning Faster and Remembering More".  Instead, the book is more a digest or summary of the "latest" findings in cognitive/brain-physiology research.  Each chapter (usually 5-10 pages) tries to address a specific aspect of mental function.  Each chapter usually begins with a short exercise to illustrate the point that is about to be made in the body of the chapter.  The body of each chapter then explains the topic at some length in layman's terms and ends with a biblio. Unfortunately, the book is badly in need of depth.  Perhaps it is to be expected for a relatively small book with an ambitious breadth of topics.  It is an entertaining and quick read, but cannot seriously claim to teach quicker learning or better memory.  A more appropriate title might be "Interesting Tidbits about Our Brain".  I suppose the main idea one comes away with upon completing the book would be this: your brain thrives on mental exercise, keep challenging it at every stage of your life.
