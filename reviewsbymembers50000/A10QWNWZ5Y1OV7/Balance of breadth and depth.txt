 This book is not meant for beginners.  The reviewer who gave the book one star is simply clueless, who obviously chose to ignore the preface, which clearly says that "this book is for compressionists ..." (i.e., not for total beginners, who should see Digital Video for Dummies).  The author of this book manages to do exactly what he promises, which is to detail the use of a vast number of tools, to generate digital video in countless formats, on innumerable types of media.  The possible permutations when all tools, formats, and media are taken together is simply mind-numbing, which is why such a book is necessary in the first place.  Any dedicated amateur (or even professional) compressionist needs to know whether there is a better way to do what he or she stumbled across by accident on the vast Internet.  This book very clearly describes many of the best combination of tools and strategies to produce the best content possible.  The writing style is very fluid and friendly, although I would stop short of calling the book an easy read, because the amount of information is too overwhelming for a straight read; instead, I would use it almost like a reference and jump to a particular chapter to refresh my memory and skills just before undertaking a new compression task.  With so much information to write about, I am sure the book was an organizational nightmare for the author, and although he did an overall great job in organizing it, there are still numerous spots where he could have done a better job of introducing a topic before using it to explain other topics.  Examples that come to mind: referring to DirectShow without describing it, or creating examples based on video editing tools like Cleaner without first introducing the tool (there are others).  All in all, this is a book that I will continue to use often.
