 Berezovsky seems to have kept a mysteriously low profile after winning his Tchaikovsky trophy.  What a shame, he was stunning.  In this CD, he gets a chance to show what he can really do when faced with pages of piano music with more notes than a mere mortal can count.  When I contrast his treatment of these Etudes with that of Claudio Arrau's (and a very well-respected and enduring treatment that was), I can almost see the sparks flying off the keys, he plays with so much fire.  The Mazzeppa and Feux Follets especially showcase his power in brilliant contrast to his incredibly fine control.  Definitely a fun CD to have.
