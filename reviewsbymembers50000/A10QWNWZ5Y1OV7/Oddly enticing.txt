 Let me get my only gripe out of the way first - as a string player myself, the first thing I noticed was that Miss Ni has a vibrato that feels strangely inconsistent.  Nothing glaring, just a perception (which leaves me slightly puzzled).  Normally, something like that would be enough to make me shun a CD, but this young lady has such an abundance of musicianship that I cannot help but listen to this CD repeatedly.  It is musicianship of a very understated kind; it almost draws the listener in without being noticed.  One senses that a very powerful musical mind is behind the cello.  The only other cellist that exudes this kind of quality, IMHO, is Janos Starker.  (But please let no one start a comparison between the two, no flame wars please).  Miss Ni also certainly has sufficient technical prowess to more handle any of the peices on this CD.  I especially liked how she handled the Elfentanz, which is often a "closer" piece for albums and recitals alike.  Performers usually don't pay it enough attention and it inevitably gets a comparatively sloppy treatment.  Miss Ni makes it sound crisp and musical.  Well done.
