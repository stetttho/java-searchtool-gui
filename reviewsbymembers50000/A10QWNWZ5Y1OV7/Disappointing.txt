 Leila Josefowicz is one of my favorite violinists, and I like her in recording as well as in live performance, so it pains me to give her only 2 stars for this album.  Every piece in this album has an air of perfunctoriness, and the venerable Academy orchestra under the equally venerable Sir Neville never seem to click with their gifted soloist.  The recorded sound is good, not spectacular, but this neither adds to nor detracts from the fact that the "warhorses" on this album do not need another just polite compilation, especially from a violinist like Ms Josefowicz.  Listen to her ealier "Solo" album, and you will get an idea of what fire and passion Ms Josefowicz can add to her technical prowess.  Sadly, this is simply absent from the current album.  If you've never heard these pieces before, you wouldn't mind this album at all, but if you have heard the old masters (e.g. Heifetz, Ricci, etc) handle them, you will be left wanting much more.
