 There appears to be no possible middle ground between the extremes of opinion expressed by the various reviewers, but in fact, there is.  In no particular order: 1) Weiss' severe scolding of, and warnings about, brokers and brokerages were in fact right on the money.  He was proven correct by events that happened after he wrote about them.  In fact, some brokerages and investment bankers were worse than he had described. 2) Yes, in fact he does sell several newsletters of the doom and gloom variety, but to his credit, does not peddle them in the body of the book. 3) Mentioned should be made of his description of using Treasury-only checking accounts for regular banking.  It is quite useful. 4) Similarly mention should be made of his interesting strategy of investing in mutual funds, moving freely amongst the funds as other traders (e.g. me) would move amongst stocks.  Maybe it is common knowledge, but it wasn't to anyone I know.  I think this one I will try. All in all, for persons who read mostly conventional books for advice about stock trading, this book provides a very interesting perspective for traders of any age.  And it can be had for less the the commission cost of a couple of trades :).
