 I am not even a beginner, and I learned quite a bit about technique.  The instruction is phenominal, both on the physical and mental aspects and especially the breathing.  Thus, I am happy I bought this video.  It was not especially physically challenging, but I felt that I gained insight into the practice.  I also felt well balanced after completing this DVD.  If you are a beginner, I wholeheartedly say you must purchase this video.  If you are intermediate, you will still gain something.
