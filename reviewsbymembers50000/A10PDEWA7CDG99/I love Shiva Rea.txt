 This is another one given in the yoga matrix style.  I have only done the "prana yoga only" option so far, and I loved it.  It is a lot like the prana section in Yoga Shakti, but 41 minutes long.  You do stuff like go into cobra doing figure eights with your chest, in cat do circles with your chest, in bridge do free-form movements with your hips and hands. (There is a lot more, but it is hard to explain adequately.)  You are told to explore and do what feels good. It makes me happy, like a kindergardener doing modern dance.  I have no doubt that it will help me to avoid injury during traditional yoga practices, as well as get some different kinds of muscle tone.  The dance part I have only watched so far.  I don't know much about traditional "trance dance", so I can't critique the reiewer who said this didn't work well on a DVD. But I can say that as an avid dancer, who cares? You may not hit a true "trance" state, but I love the idea of dancing around, pretending to play the drums that are all around you.  (There is other imagery in the variety of dance meditations she presents).  This DVD is a perfect way to get into dance for those who are shy, because you learn that dancing is about how you feel.    Anyway, I am super happy I bought this DVD. It is different, but that is what makes it good. I am officially a Shiva Rea groupie.  Her style is great (as it was in Yoga Shakti): soothing, smart, present, not overdone.    BTW, per her website, this is only one of the three videos she is coming out with in upcoming months.  Another will be more traditional yoga, like Yoga Shakti, and the other about the mental and other aspects of yoga.
