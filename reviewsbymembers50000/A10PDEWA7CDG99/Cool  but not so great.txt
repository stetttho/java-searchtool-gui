 When this product comes out in a better version, I will be the first in line.  It was quick to set up, and had pretty good sound.  (No hissing, etc.)  It freed up space around my laptop (which is on a very small table). Plus, you control the playlist from this unit, not just your computer.  BUT it sorta skip/popped every few minutes.  This wasn't awful, but it started to drive me crazy.  Also, it should come with a remote.
