 I felt incredibly well balanced after this video, mentally and physically (like I had worked my front and back equally).  My whole body felt awakened.  There is a great warm up before you start (this is in the "Introduction" chapter.)  Then there are the usual sun salutations, and then a variety of other poses, such as back bend and balancing poses like dancer. Between pretty much every pose, you do a sun salute. Plow and a shoulder stand are at the end, as is yoga mudra.    The poses are pretty intermediate, and there is not much instruction beyond what is necessary to get into the pose.  Thankfully, there is no unnecessary chatter either.  The other reviewer said this was challenging, and it is.  The poses are held for the perfect amount of time to really get into them (I hate videos that go too fast, so you dont even warm up). With this video, I got very sweaty very fast. I left the video feeling totally stretched, strengthened, and energized.
