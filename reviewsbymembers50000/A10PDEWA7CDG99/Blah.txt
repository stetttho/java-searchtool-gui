 This is an okay workout, but I cannot get past the fact that Denise Austin always smiles and never blinks. It is actually quite frightening and I think that she has either had surgery or is on some serious meds.  Since I will see them 4 times or so a week, I prefer instructors that feel natural and real.  Also, there are better yoga workouts (that, yes, do focus on the buns), such as the Brian Kest series. (Buns sore for days...)  Further, there are better "buns" exercises, such as those _______ of Steel ones with Tamilee and the functionally fit lower body firming with Kathy Smith.
