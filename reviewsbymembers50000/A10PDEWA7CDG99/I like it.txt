 I have had this video for a while.  It used to be just about the hardest video I had, but I can now do it pretty easily.  Anyway, as others have said, it consists of Sun Saluations A and B, and then a long standing series.  Very few videos have a standing series that is this complete.  This video, because it is repetitive and she is quiet, allows me to focus on my practice.  Further, I do not think that you can build the strength necessary to move to higher levels without doing the Sun Salutations.  I do not think her voice is abrasive, just stripped down.  It always seems like she is hiding a smile.
