 When I got this CD, I listened to the first three tracks, and was like, what are these reviewers talking about, this album kicks butt.  Then, I was like "Oh." This album may as well have split personalities, because half of it is really good and sounds like the "Breathe" track, and half of it is HORRIBLE.  Maybe buy it on sale??
