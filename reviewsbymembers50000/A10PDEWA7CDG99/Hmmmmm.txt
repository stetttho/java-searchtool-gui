 I was very interested in trying something different, and I approached this video with an open mind.  Even after I watched it, I thought it might be worth doing.  Then I started doing it.  If this video was done by Kathy Smith, I wouldn't have been surprised.  To me, it is calisthenics, with the only yoga elements being Ravi's voice over.  That is not necessarily a bad thing, but this video was sooooo boring.  They have exercises like sitting in cross-legged position and standing up over and over.  Antyhing you do, you do it over and over. Or sit it frog (which is like the position you are in before moving into crow), and then standing up to forward fold.  Over and over. The repitition wasn't a release or meditative for me, just boring.  Before you buy this video, just do each of those movement for a minute each, and then imagine an entire video of doing different such repitious movements.  And, as one of those "power yoga people" I would say that this is not yoga in any sense of how we would think of yoga.  I have no doubt that this is an authentic type of yoga, since there are a million branches of yoga, but it wasn't for me.  No sun salutations, but it isn't only that, there is no yoga.  Not in the way I would think of it.     So, yes, I am sure that this video would be good for you in an aerobic sense.  You will trim and build muscle.  However, I would much rather cycle for that.  This video was unforgivably boring!!!  The four of the five of you who have said that my review was not helpful will regret purchasing this video.  That is my revenge.   Mua ha ha...
