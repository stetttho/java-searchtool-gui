 I am so happy that I bought this video.  It is a beautiful practice.  I couldn't help smiling after I finished it.  I felt like I had just fallen in love for the first hour after I had finished it.  You go through a very very wide variety of poses, which I am not going to begin to list. The best part is that you flow through them all, without explanatory breaks.  This can also make it kind of confusing, because some of the poses were unfamiliar.  But after doing the practice a few times, I am sure it will be much easier.  There is a breathing section in the beginning.  (This is not part of the 60 minute workout.) There is also a warm up.  The teacher is wonderful - soft spoken and soothing.  This is an intermediate workout.  I wouldn't say that this is the most challenging workout in terms of strength, but you need strength to do it.  This practice definitely challenges balance, endurance, and flexibility.  It made me nice and sweaty.  More importantly, it just made me feel ridiculously good, and I would recommend it to you whole-heartedly.  Edit: I did this workout another time watching form carefully, and it became even more challenging.  I rescind what I said about not challenging strength that much - it challenges your legs and requires core strength to do it all gracefully. (Arm strength challenged through sun salutes mainly, and there aren't too many). Also, it is challenging aerobically, but not too fast (it is challenging because it doesn't really have resting poses - it is all active poses). And I still felt absolutely wonderful at the end - it is just a beautiful, graceful practice.  Also, here are some of the poses:  warrior series, triangle series, sun salutation A (and B?), crow, dancer, pigeon (single and double leg), half moon... more and more
