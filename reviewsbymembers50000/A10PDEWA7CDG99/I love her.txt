 I have all of Rainbeau's DVDs.  This particular set is considerably easier than the Pure Sweat and Pure Power.  As an avid yoga practitioner, I would only reach for these DVDs if I were looking for something easy.  The thing that I love about all of her workouts, though, is the way she uses imagery to help you visualize what you are doing in the pose.  I find it really helpful.  In any case, despite the fact that I find these videos easy, they always leave me in a very good mood.  In fact, because it leaves me so happy and well-balanced, I bought this set for my friend who had never done yoga before.  Before her roommate promptly stole it, my friend said that it very tough and thoroughly enjoyable.  (She plans to steal it back.)  Whether you are a beginner or more experienced, you need Rainbeau Mars in your life.  Also, the performance at the end (which is the same on both videos), is truly beautiful and amazing.
