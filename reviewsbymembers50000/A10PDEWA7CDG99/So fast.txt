 I have an older flash drive (like 2 years old?) and it took 20+ minutes to transfer/backup my My Documents file.  With the Cruzer mimi, it took less than 2 minutes.  That was worth every penny, because now I will do it more often.  Plus, this hooks safely to my keychain (with nice thick plastic) and is so little.
