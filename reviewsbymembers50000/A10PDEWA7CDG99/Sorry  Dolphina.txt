 Mostly, my low review comes from not being huge fan of the "arabesque" move.  I was disappointed that it was relied on so heavily for this video.  I've always preferred layering moves(think drum solo focus on belly/hips) to travelling steps.  I would have preferred if she had used more layering moves.  Theres a shimmy section (which gets you're heart rate up for a few mintues), and a hip section and an abs section (which are okay), but then a lot of travelling steps.  If you are another dancer who prefers layering over travelling steps, don't get this video.  Do to the lack of layering (sorry, bitter) you don't get a great workout.  Also,I don't like the way it is broken up into sections: can't we mix it up!!
