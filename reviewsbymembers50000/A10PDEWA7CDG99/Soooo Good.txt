 I disagre with those who would give this album a bad review.  No, it is not Hounds of Love.  Nor would I want it to be.  I was looking for something that was current, because I was sick of the same old stuff.  This CD fulfilled my expectations.  What people call "uninspired" is a beautiful meditation on everyday life.  (And some that you wish was your everyday life.)    Nocturn is one of the most beautiful songs I have ever heard.  King of the mountain is great, it takes you back to the joy and simplicity of being a child.  I love this whole album.
