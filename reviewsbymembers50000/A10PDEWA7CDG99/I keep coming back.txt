 I've had Brian Kest, Baron Baptiste, nearly all the power yoga DVDs out there.  This is my favorite yoga DVD.  This DVD definitely flows, but it is not a traditional Sun Salutation.  You will go through chatarunga, up dog, down dog, and then warrior one.  You will repeat, adding warrior two.  Repeat, add right triangle.  Repeat, add crescent.  Repeat, add triangle.  You end up being in a static lunge for a while, which does burn.  You swtich sides at the end of the entire sequence.  There are also prayer and prayer twists thrown in there.  Then you move on to a standing/balancing series, inclusing what Baron Baptiste calls Superman, then half moon, etc.  You end with some seated work, and back bends.  Then corpse pose, with a wonderful description of the meditation.  There are 3 practitioners, with one doing modified poses and one advanced.  The instructor does the poses with them, but also stands by them to point out what they are doing.  I love the instructor, who is not overdone and doesn't get too mushy.  The whole video is filmed outside in Jamaica somewhere, and has very nice video and sound.  Buy it for something other than the sun salutation, not just to get you sweating (which it will), but to get you flowing.
