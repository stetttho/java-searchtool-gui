 I just got his and I love the second work out (that's my five star rating). The first workout is kinda the standard yoga selection. The second is much more interesting and challenging. I was a bit sore the next day (especially in my glutes), and that hasn't happened in a while. I think on the back it says "an innovative lunge series", which I found to be a turnoff. Fortunately, it isn't like traditional lunges, but a static lunge where you move your torso in various poses. (Traditional lunges really hurt my joints). You can defintely feel the burn, though. Plus, it has a lot of standing poses, which I like. There's a lot on here (at least workout 2) that isn't on my other videos.  As for the instructor, he is very calm and doesn't talk too much. His "jersey" accent is hardly noticeable. I also did not think he touched his students in weird ways...  I guess its worth saying that I found Kest's workout 2 to be a bit more challenging than Baron Baptiste's Soul of strength. Brian will take the moves even a farther than just non-modified.  He goes modified-non modified-super.  I'm not quite to super yet, but it's nice to know I could go there when I'm ready.
