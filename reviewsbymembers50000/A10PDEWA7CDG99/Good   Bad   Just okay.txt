 I did not like the Sun Salutations in the beginning of this workout.  They were too fast, so that when they were done, I was not even warmed up.  It reminded me of MTV Power Yoga, which I hated.  However, I really liked that there were a whole standing and then seated sequences.  I aleady have them, though.  The seated sequence was basically the same as is on Yoga Shakti, and the standing sequence the same as the Nicki Doane video Ashtanga Yoga Beginner's Practice (but shorter and therefore less good).  So, if you don't have any such videos, this is good because it was cheap and they talk in Australian accents.  (They say "Let's move into THE up dog.")  If you have a healthy-sized collection, though, it wont really add anything.
