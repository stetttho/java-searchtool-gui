 Jazzy mix of old school and new.  Badu is a master.  This CD needs to be experienced as a whole, I actually cannot listen to individual tracks on it.  It weaves back and forth between mystical and earthy, seemingly nonsensical statements and universal truths.  This one is powerful.  Is stays on constant rotation in the CD player.  Great music and great message, what more do you want.
