 I was curious how Yoga Journal would present Ashtanga vinyasa yoga.  Traditional this is a system of hatha yoga poses that are done in a specific order while continiously moving with the breath.  Originally, each individual pose was given to a student one by one when their teacher felt that they were ready. Now the Ashtanga Primary sequence is often taught in a class that goes through the first series in one session(which is 90 mins to 2 hours long and has some fairly intense poses). There are a number of ceritified or authorized Ashtanga teachers (given this distinction by the co-founder of this system who is still alive) that have videos of the whole first series.  The three I know of are all quite good and are done by David Swenson, John Scott, and Richard Freedman.  So what could another video have to offer?  Well, as Nicki Doane herself states in the interview, she feels that a lot of these videos are overwhelming for a complete beginner.  What she does instead is focus on the Sun Salutations; the very beginning of the first Ashtanga Series and breaks them down.  She then continues on to a few standing poses.  I believe for someone who wants an introduction to Ashtanga and cannot get to a good teacher, this video is actually quite a nice alternative and would recommend it.  In fact, if you want to go futher in the series than she does; it is highly recommended that you study with a qualified teacher to cut down on the risk of injury.
