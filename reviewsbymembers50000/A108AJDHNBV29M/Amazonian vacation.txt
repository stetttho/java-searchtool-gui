 This is one of those books to read when you don't have the money and/or time to actually travel the planet.  I enjoyed that Sy both had a grasp of biology and is a truly talented author.  She also obviously cares about the socioeconomic situation of the peoples who live in the area that her biological studies took her.  This book transports you into a magical world in which pink dolphins inhabit rivers in a mystical jungle.  Sometimes the truth is better than fiction.
