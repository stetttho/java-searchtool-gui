 This book is the author's answer to that most basic of questions.  His answer is a beautiful, life affirming one and given from the prespective of the cosmos.  It also highlights are responsiblity as humans - ones that can be done with great joy.  However, I don't know if I really see it as a synthesis of spirituality and science as it is made out to be.  This is one of the best books I have ever read, if I only read one book this year, this would be it. I don't want to give away too much, go read this book.
