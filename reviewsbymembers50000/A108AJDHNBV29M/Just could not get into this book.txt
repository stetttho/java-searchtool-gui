 I usually love Beagle, but nothing in the book caught my attention.  Beagle's typically poetic writing style was absent from this work.  An absense felt all the more because Unicorn Sonata was cursed with a bad plot.  Not that the concept was bad, it just moved too slow.  In fact, the plot often came to a complete halt.  Perhaps, this is because this book seems to have been written with a younger audience in mind than most of Beagle's books (I would say ages 8 and up).  I just felt this book was missing the magic his books usually possess, or perhaps I am too old for the magic in this book.
