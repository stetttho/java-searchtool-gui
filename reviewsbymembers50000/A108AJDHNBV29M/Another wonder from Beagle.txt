 First of all, Peter S. Beagle is one of my absolutely favorite authors, so I am predisposed to like his works.  That, being said, I really enjoyed this book.  His writing is extremely lyrical.  The people in his books, despite the fantastic situations in which they find themselves, seem very earthy and real.  Even the confusion of the ghosts and the way they respond to their circumstances are very believeable which encourages the reader to be sympathetic to their plight.  I love Peter's endings, I believe he is one of the masters of the bittersweet ending. If you are going to only read one book by this author, I would recommend The Last Unicorn, or, for older folks (20s or so) Folk of the Air over this one.  However, this is another good book by one of the masters of Fantasy.  Keep in mind that I think Peter tends to gear most of his books, including this one, for the young adult audience although most can be enjoyed by readers from 8 to 108.
