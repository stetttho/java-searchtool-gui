 I have been practicing yoga for several years now and have read tons of books on the subject.  This is an excellent book on the basics.  It covers 70 poses not including variations.  Countrary to my assumptions, not all of the posture's described are 'beginner's poses', there are a few more difficult poses that are common to certain schools of yoga.  The descriptions on how to do the poses are pratical - not so much detail that you're doing a 100 point check list.  Simplier modifications are often given, useful if one is not as flexible or strong as required to do the final form (or injured, or tired, etc.).  One addition I greatly appreciate is that counterposes are given for each posture, this gives a beginner some idea of what to do next.  In fact, for each pose, the following details are listed: counterpose, drishti (what you should look at), physical benefits, mental benefits, and countraindications (injuries or health problems that may prevent you from practicing a posture or require a simpler variation). The routines in the back of the book are short, but extremely helpful for how to build a routine.  There are routines for a gentle practice, flexibility, some examples of vinyasa segments, and both sun and moon salutations. I really am enjoying this book.
