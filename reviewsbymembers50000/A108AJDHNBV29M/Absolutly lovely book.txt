 I had been debating purchasing Shakti ever since it came out in 2003.  It is a small, hardcover book of beautiful yoginis in the nude.  Shakti captures the power, strength, and grace that women hold. The photographs manage to capture a feeling of motion and fluidity that I feel is lacking in other books that are devoted to photographs of yoga asanas.  Shakti's photographs are all black and white with a grainy texture which lends itself well to the artist's vision.  About half the pictures are more traditional yoga asanas. Regarding the other half of photos, I feel the photographer was trying to capture the essence of the feminine.  A wonderful book!
