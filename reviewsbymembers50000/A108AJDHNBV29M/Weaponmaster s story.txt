 So, now we know how Alberich arrived at his place in Valdemar. Overall, it is a pretty good story, I enjoyed it more than To Take a Thief. However, it is not nearly as good as Lackey at her best (the Vanyel / Magic trilogy, the Oath series, and the Storm series). But Lackey is a master of just telling a good old-fashion, fun, uncomplicated tales. And that is what this is. Alberich comes across as a grimy hero out of an old western. He adheres strictly to his own code of honor. This and his intelligence along with his friends help him to overcome all obstacles and save the day. It is, interestingly enough, a coming of age story of someone who is older than the usual age at which such stories are set.
