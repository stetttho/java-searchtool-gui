 This is a marvelous book.  The photographer skillfully captures the artistry of these masters at work.  However, what I really liked about the book is the asanas (poses) ranged from fairly basic to extremly advance.  Also, for some asana, several variations are given.  The combination of these two features mean those with a wide range of practices can actually use the book for ideas on asanas to incorporate into their own practice.  Since there are no explanations on the poses I would not advise a beginner doing this without assistance.  But, if you're an intermediate yogi and can figure out how to do a pose properly from a picture, this book can a truly remarkable source of inspiration for asanas to incorporate into your practice.  Also, as a side note, this book is huge.  I weighed it, it comes in at 8 lbs.
