 I really wanted to like this movie.  I mean, romance and scenic vistas are two things I typically really like in a movie.  However, I just found the movie too slow.  I really couldn't nurse up much identification /sympathy with the main characters.  Maybe if I would have grown up in a small town?  There were some redeeming qualities to this movie. Some of the scenes between the two men were really touching. I thought the movie improved greatly after the poet left and the main character (I can't remember his name) experienced some self discovery.  However, it took to long, in my opinion, for the movie to get to this point. Overall, I would say this movie is worth suffering through for the last 20 minutes or so of self realization, but just barely.
