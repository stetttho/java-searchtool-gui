 I, like several others stated, did not expect to like this book when I got it. I can't even remember why I bought it as opposed to some other yoga books I was looking at that day. I probably liked the wonderful black and white pictures. This book is not just an instructional manual on how to start a yoga practice at home. The more attractive element of this book for me was the authors seem to attempt to answer the unspoken question 'why we practice yoga'.  There are three types of sections in this book.  The first are instructional, beginning level yoga asana practices.  Another are the interviews between Rodney Yee and Nina.  And finally, there are Nina's short stories.  These three elements are interwoven throughout the book.  So that you will have a one page short story, then an interview, wrapped up with a hatha (physical) yoga practice sequence.  I was particularly fond of the interviews. They remind the reader that yoga is more than the physical practice of postures.  They also talk about yoga's influence on the authors' lives as a whole.  Since the interviews appear to have taken place over a somewhat extended frame of time (a few months to a year), you get a chance to see the authors grow over the course of the book. Anyway, because of this book, I later went on a retreat with Rodney Yee, which is an experience I recommend as well. This book was an unexpected gem.
