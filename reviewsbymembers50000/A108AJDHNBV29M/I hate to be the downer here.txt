 I really did not get drawn into this graphic novel.  Believe me, I really wanted too.  I loved both the Sandman series and Neverwhere by Gaiman. I have always enjoyed the illustrations of Charles Vess.  Despite this, nothing really drew me to care about the main character in Stardust.  There were, admittedly, some great moments.  Also a plus were some really cool side characters.  As for the plot, don't we all wish we could cross the gate into the land of Fey.  And finally, wonderful ending, it almost made up for the shortcomings of the story in and of itself. Overall, if you are a fan of the genre or Gaiman, this book is probably worth a read.  However, there are a lot of other good things out there.  For crossing over into magical lands, read the classic Lion, Witch and Wardrobe by C S Lewis or find out of print Joyce Gregorian Ballou books (the first to books in her only trilogy are for younger readers, but, interestingly enough, her last book is very adult).  For a darker trip, Neverwhere by Gaiman rocks.  Also, urban fantasy master Charles DeLint is another good option. For Graphic Novels, the Sandman series and Elfquest (the original 8) were 2 that I really enjoyed.
