 Dharma's little pocket book (it fits in my purse), much like his poster, is truly an inspiration.  It reminds me of Light on Yoga without the explanations and would be a wonderful companion to this book.  Much like Iyengar in Light on Yoga there is something about either Dharma's expression or body language that demonstrates a deep devotion.  You can tell that Dharma sees the yoga postures as a dedication.  Truly a work of art and devotion.
