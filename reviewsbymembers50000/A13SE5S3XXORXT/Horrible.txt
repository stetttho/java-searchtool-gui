 This is a HORRIBLE version of the DC comics characters.  The scripts, dialog, and animation are all saccharin and anemic.  Your 5-7 year olds might find this fairly amusing, but it's no where NEAR the quality of the DC Comics-based animated from 1992 and later..  Seriously, this series was a wasted of celluloid and is now a waste of plastic...
