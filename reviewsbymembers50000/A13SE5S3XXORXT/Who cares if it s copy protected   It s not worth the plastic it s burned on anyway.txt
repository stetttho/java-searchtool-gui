 So many of the reviews here ridicule this CD solely on the basis that it's copy protected.  That's TRULY unfair.  I hate copy protection as much as the next person, but the whole point of these reviews is to talk about the material on the CD itself to help potential listeners in their decision to buy the product,  and that's what I'm going to do.  This CD stinks.  Aside from the nonsense I had to go thru to get around the copy protection to put it on my iPod, this could have been one relatively great CD and instead it's a totally subpar 2-CD set.  Since the RIAA counts a 2CD set as two CD's sold toward a platinum award I'm pretty sure I understand *why* Grohl and company did this.  But they should have put better material on the CDs, especially the second disc.  The first disc, for the most part is pretty good.  However, the second disc is bad - really bad.  In fact it's so bad that I actually started falling asleep driving home listening to it.  Now, if that's what Dave Grohl was striving for - to increase the number of road fatalities due to people nodding off at the wheel - he might very well have succeeded.    Honestly, I think it's time to bid adieu to the Foo Fighters.  The magic that made "The Colour and The Shape" what it was is obviously long gone.  Go do  another Probot disc, Dave...  Mothball the Foo - obviously you don't care any more.
