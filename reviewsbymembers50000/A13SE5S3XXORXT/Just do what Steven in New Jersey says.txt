 I was ready to BLAST these in a review here, but - the 5-star reviews are right.  These things - when properly inserted and used with the correct size 'sleeves' for your ears and they are *amazing*.  I thought the ear-phones the iPod came with were amazing - but these have an even *better* range.  It's like I'm in the room with the artists when I listen using these.  I'm hearing the thump from the bass in the middle of my head... it's astounding...! They're worth every penny you'll spend on them.
