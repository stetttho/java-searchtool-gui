 The only (and I mean ONLY) reason to buy this disc is if you're a hard-core fan and absolutely *must* have the bonus track on it. And if you ask me, having KISS fans buy Alive IV *twice* to get all the material from the shows is a pretty lame thing for Gene Simmons to do (tho not surprising).  Instead, buy the two-disc limited-edition version of Alive IV (or even better - buy the DVD) and purchase the bonus track from one of the music download services.
