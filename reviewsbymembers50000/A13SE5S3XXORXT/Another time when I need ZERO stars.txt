 This has got to be the worst album of all time - it's that simple.  While there are a few moments on this album where you think to yourself; 'hmm.. maybe I won't have to chew my own arm off to get my money back on this disc', they're quickly shot down by every vocalist sounding like he's had cancer of the larynx and had his voice box removed.  These 'death metal' covers have little (sometimes none whatsoever) resemblance to their rockin' originals.  The 'musicianship' on this album (to use the term loosely) does NOT have to be heard to be believed.  Just think of a Rhesus monkey on Methodone playing a guitar while trying to shove is head into the nearest knothole in a wall and you'll have an idea of the sonic quality of this disc.  If you see this disc at your store.. run, don't walk, away from it.  The wallet you save may be your very own.
