 It turns out you can get a program called DVD-43 that will allow you to make backups of your DVD movies using this program by providing access to the DeCSS algorithm.  But the compression (modification) technology that this tool uses to accomplish this makes the video quality *unbearable* in the duplicate.  You can *see* the compression - even on a cheap TV set. Don't bother with this program - it's just complete junk.
