 I got this before I got the DVD, and I got the DVD of Alive IV later.  If you want to listen to the music from the show in your car, then this is worth the purchase.  Otherwise, there are no surprises.  It's the exact same material.  And I'd be willing to bet from the abyssmal sales of the CDs that people realize that KISS is simply a big audio visual show and not a band to listen to on CD anymore.  This is especially obvious since the Alive DVD has gone multi-platinum and the CD release has failed to even go gold..
