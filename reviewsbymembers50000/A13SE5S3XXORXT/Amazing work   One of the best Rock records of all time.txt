 I had a friend of mine pick this up for me in Japan, now everyone can enjoy this outstanding record.  Even if you're not an Anthrax fan THIS album is one you want in your collection. From first riff to last you're glued to this disc listening to it. Volume 8 is full of the humor and musicianship that people would expect from a band that's been around for 20+ years. And yes I said humor. Give '604' and 'Toast to the Extras' a listen when you get the chance and you'll hear what I mean. And 'Catharsis' and 'Inside Out' are probably two of the best all out rock songs ever written by Anthrax (or any *other* metal band for that matter). So?  What are you doing still reading this?
