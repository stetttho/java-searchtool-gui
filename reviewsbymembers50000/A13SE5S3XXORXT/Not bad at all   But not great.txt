 All in all the DVD Remote isn't bad.  It's got a couple of problems with it, however.  One is that the Confirm and Stop buttons are transposed.  No big deal.  The other one is that you have to push pretty hard on the 'Disc' at the center of the controller to be able to get it to work.  Until the Sony unit ships, however, it's a great choice and far better than the Interact version (which apparently has ALL of it's buttons mislabeled).
