 Gene Simmons really has to learn not to put a KISS logo on *everything* he possibly can..  I love Video Pinball games, but KISS Pinball is just annoying.  While I can (barely) live with a scrolling table area, the tables themselves are so busy it's almost blinding trying to play the game and keep track of the ball!  For [$...] it's not a *huge* loss of money, but don't bother with this game unless you're a *huge* fan of the rock group whose name is emblazoned on the cover of this title, (and you're into collecting memorabilia)...
