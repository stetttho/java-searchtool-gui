 Tom & Jerry's Greatest Chases is great!  It's the Hanna/Barbera/Quimby animated shorts from the 50's.  The other two are movies that were done in 1992 and 2001.  "Tom and Jerry and the Magic Ring" is *OK* and my kids enjoy it.  But "Tom and Jerry - The Movie" is just bad...  I can see why this 3-pack was put together - it's the only way to sell the junk disc...
