 I've been a metal fan for over 20 years.  As far as I'm concerned, other genres like hip-hop and rap are a joke and 'alternative' is a pale shadow trying to grasp onto the energy and power that is metal music.  Thanks to bands like Demons and Wizards that light and power still burns.  This new disc is amazing.  From the first riffs of the first tune "Crimson King" I was hooked.  People when they hear the disc in my car are always asking "who *is* that".. and they like what they hear.  Hansi Kursch is probably one of *the* great vocalists in metal today.  If you haven't bought this disc you really are missing out.  If you aren't a huge metal fan (but like alternative and want to hear something new and fresh) *get this disc*.  You won't regret it!
