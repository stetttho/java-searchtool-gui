 I have used razors as well as the Remington Microscreen, three Norelco rotary shavers (incl. the Quadra) and now the Braun.  And without a doubt the Braun gives me the cleanest, closest shave with the exception of the razor and with NO irritation.  The Norelcos constantly gave me 'shaver burns' at the base of my neck and the Remington was never 'as close as a blade'.  And razors would bring rise to rather nasty skin problems even with using aftershave and sterilizing the blades.  Without a doubt I am absolultely happy with my shaver.  Worth every penny.
