 This, simply, is a great show.  There's a good breadth of material covering the 3 decades worth of material from the group's massive catalog.  Unlike that rip-off 'Live in Las Vegas', this one definitely delivers.  The behind-the-scenes look at the making of the KISS Symphony is also interesting and gives some insights into the humor of the band.   All in all, if you missed the last tour, this video is a must-have..   The only other DVD I could recommend to KISS fans is Unplugged, if you can find it...
