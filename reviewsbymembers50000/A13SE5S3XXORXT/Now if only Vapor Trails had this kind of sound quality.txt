 This is a fun disc to listen to.  It's really interesting to listen to Rush's treatment of these 60's classics.  The mix and mastering is outstanding and leagues ahead of Vapor Trails.  It's a shame because when I listen to THIS disc I know what that band *should* have done sonically with Vapor Trails (VT's material is oustanding - it just sounds terrible).  I look forward to their next studio effort.
