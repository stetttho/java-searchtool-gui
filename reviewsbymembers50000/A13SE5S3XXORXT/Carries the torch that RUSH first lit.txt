 I heard Geddy Lee once say that Primus carried the touch that he and his band RUSH first lit.  Geddy is wrong.  Primus (more directly Les Claypool) carries the torch that *Frank Zappa* first lit.  Les is very ecclectic - like Frank.  But also very polished in his presentation - unlike Frank.  However, Les doesn't do progressive.  What he does is VERY cool, but it's NOT in the vein of progressive rock at all.  Rush lit the torch for progressive rock in the 70's.  Yes tried - but always sounded overproduced and pompous.  But in the 1980's Rush recoiled from the genre that they really made come alive.  Coheed and Cambria have continued the sound and power that made Rush a legend.  THEY carry the torch that Geddy Lee and RUSH lit.  Listen to this album and you'll see what I mean.
