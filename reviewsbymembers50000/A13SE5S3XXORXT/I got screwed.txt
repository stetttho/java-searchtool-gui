 All I can say is I'm truly shocked and dumbfounded by this record. I got screwed out of 16 bucks - plain and simple.  It's truly amazing what a turd this disc turns into, and while you're  listening to it, in fact!!  It starts out well enough; Sweet & Dirty Love, Firestarter, and Weapons of Mass Destruction are pretty decent tunes... Now, keep in mind that Firestarter is NOT an original - it's a tune from "The Prodigy" and in fact - sounds almost *idential* to the original version.  But it's tolerable...  Then, the disc turns into some kind of sick joke with Waiting for the Morning Light, only Gene is serious when he sings it. The next track, Beautiful, isn't. And then by the time you're put thru that torment you get to the title track and you just CAN'T TAKE ANY MORE!  I mean this disc truly saps your will to live. I thought Miles Davis' "Bitches Brew" was bad - that is high-concept art compared to this hunk of trash... I guess what I'm trying to say is - save your money and buy some WASP or Rob Zombie or ANYTHING ELSE... But not this...
