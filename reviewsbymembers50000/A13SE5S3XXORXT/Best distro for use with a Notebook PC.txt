 When I first got my Sony Vaio I ripped MS Windows off of it and got to work installing RedHat 8.  But after two days of fighting I was only marginally successful at getting it to work.  Even then, features like ACPI support still had to be compiled into the Linux kernel that came with RedHat 8.  After asking on some mailing lists, I was told that SuSE would be the way to go.  Those who recommended it were right.  I installed SuSE 8.1 and in a couple of hours I was up and ready to go.  As soon as I was able to order from Amazon.com, I got SuSE 8.2 and it's stability and robustness on the Vaio is even *better* than 8.1 was.  ACPI power management is more robust, KDE is better and the whole OS seems to run even faster than before.  Sure, you can go and get a 'free' distro from a website, but SuSE Professional is *worth every penny you'll spend* in the headaches it'll save you from in getting everything installed and configured.  SuSE really works hard to make a distribution that you'll be satisfied with.
