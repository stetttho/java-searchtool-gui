 I had a friend of mine pick this up for me in Japan, as it's currently not available in the USA market (thanks to a bad deal with a less-than-honorable record label).  And that's truly a shame, because even if you're not an Anthrax fan THIS album is one you want in your collection.  From first riff to last you're glued to this disc listening to it.  Volume 8 is full of the humor and musicianship that people would expect from a band that's been around for 20+ years.  And yes I said humor.  Give '604' and 'Toast to the Extras' a listen when you get the chance and you'll hear what I mean.  And 'Catharsis' and 'Inside Out' are probably two of the best all out rock songs ever written by Antrax (or any *other* metal band for that matter). So, if you can get this, get it.  It's worth every penny.
