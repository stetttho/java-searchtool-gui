 While it's not the cool all-metal stuff that I remember, I know my son enjoyed playing with this.  At least UNTIL the lever that keeps the crane up broke.  It's a shoddy piece of plastic wrapped by a thin tin shell.  I'm very unhappy with this.  And as for my son.. it's no fun seeing a 3-year-old cry...
