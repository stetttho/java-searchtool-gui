 This live CD was *amazing* to listen to.  The hair on the back of my neck was standing straight up from beginning to end.  The crowd was singing along with John Bush's vocals, Charlie's drumming was *amazing* and Frankie Bello's bass playing just knocks you on your backside.  It's a shame Frankie left the band - especially after hearing this.  At least he had one heck of a swan song.
