 So far this product has worked out very well for me on my laptop computer.  Movie capture for DVD has been fast with no problems in audio going out of sync with Video as was common in Studio 8.  Capturing direct to MPEG format for DVD has been a dream and allows me to have HOURS of video captures prior to making a movie. Pinnacle Studio 9 and the Hollywood F/X programs come with the package.  Studio 9 has no real new suprises in it (other than the direct MPEG capture).  I've run into a couple of UI-related bugs, that are fairly easy to work around.   One thing to note is how incredibly TOUGH the Moviebox is.  Made in Germany out of a cast aluminum shell and VERY high impact plastic, I'm pretty sure even the "pro-sumer" types would be impressed. Pinnacle's support, however, is terrible.  Hopefully you won't have too many questions about the product - if you do, don't expect answers from Pinnacle support - you won't get them.  That's part of the reason for the 3-star rating. If you're looking at the low-end Dazzle products from Pinnacle - don't bother - they're garbage.  The Studio products are really the only ones to bother with.  And if you have a notebook PC then *this* product really shines.
