 I really love Blackie Lawless' work.  The disc "The Headless Children" is without doubt one of my favorite metal CDs.  After I wasn't sure what to make of Neon God 1, but after listening to it and getting my head around it, I get it now. Blackie Lawless is fascinating.  You can listen to two albums that are 10 years apart and know exactly what to expect.  He's got a very consistant style, and that's a good thing.  Neon God 1 is no different.  Great songwriting with soaring vocals.  The storyline is strange and rather disturbing, but you still want to read it and listen to the disc.  If you haven't bought a WASP album before - this would be a great introduction.  This is a solid album.
