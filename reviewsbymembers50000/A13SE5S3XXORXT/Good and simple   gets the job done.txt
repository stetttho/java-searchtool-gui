 The optics on this camcorder don't make the rich colors I'm used to on my Sony Hi-8 8mm camcorder, but the camera is nice, lightweight and very easy to use.  And the battery seems to last forever.  DO NOT bother with the still photograph to SD card feature.  There is *no* excuse for how bad the picture quality is.  Get any cheap digital camera, if you want still pictures. You can find these for far less than the original US$600 MSRP now, which makes them a good deal...
