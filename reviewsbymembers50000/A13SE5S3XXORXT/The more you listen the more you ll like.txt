 I wasn't quite sure what to expect from Anthrax with WCFYA.  But this is a *great* record.  It's easily the best since "Sound of White Noise".  The playing is tight and the musicianship is excellent.  This band shows time and again why they are living legends of american heavy metal.  Interestingly one of the weaker tracks is the single- "Safe Home".  Don't misunderstand, it's very good.  But the title track, for example, would probably have made a better first single from the album.
