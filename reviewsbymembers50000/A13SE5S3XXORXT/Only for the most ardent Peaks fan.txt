 I finally had a chance to sit down and read this book.  Unless you are a die-hard Peaks fan who has to know everything about the Laura's life was like up until her death - don't read this.  It's very hard to read the erotic dreams that Laura was having (at the hands of her father/BOB) and you can't help but wonder if author Ms. Lynch (David's daughter) perhaps wasn't working through some of her own personal issues in writing it.
