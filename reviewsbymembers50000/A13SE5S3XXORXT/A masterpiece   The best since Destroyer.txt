 If Bob Ezrin got it wrong with 'Music From The Elder' then he got it *totally* right with 'Revenge'.  A new KISS enters the 90's with what is probably their most consistent and strongest sounding album to date.  From the scorching riffs of 'Unholy' all the way to the awesome melodies of 'Everytime I Look at You' this album is worth every second you listen to it.  For those who remember him, there is a final tribute to the memory of late drummer Eric Carr in 'Carr Jam 81'.  If there is only one KISS album you buy... well.. make it Destroyer.  But if there are only TWO albums you buy from KISS, make the first one Destroyer and the second one REVENGE!
