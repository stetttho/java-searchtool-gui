 I just recently listened to this album again after it sat on my shelves for about 2 years.  And where I thought it was haunted by a 'sophomore jinx' in that it wasn't a strong disc I have to take that back.  This disc is actually really great.  There is some terrific guitar work on it.  It's not one of my all-time favorite CDs but it's definitely ownable.  The single "She Loves Me Not" is actually probably the weakest track on the CD.  The rest of the disc is *far* stronger and heavier than that tune.  The mix is a little 'muddy' in a couple of spots (the cymbals are a bit muffled and could be more crisp sounding) but over all it's a great experience.
