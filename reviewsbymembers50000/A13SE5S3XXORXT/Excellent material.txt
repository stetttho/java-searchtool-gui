 Korn for the most part has done and outstanding job with "Untouchables".  Some of the tracks can wear a bit thin after a while and you end up hitting the "skip track" button after the first few listenings.  Overall the album will be money well spent. If you can, get the limited edition release with the Video and remix of "Here To Stay".
