 All I can say is I'm truly shocked and dumbfounded by this record. I got screwed out of 16 bucks - plain and simple. It's truly amazing what a turd this disc turns into, and while you're listening to it, in fact!! It starts out well enough; Sweet & Dirty Love, Firestarter, and Weapons of Mass Destruction are pretty decent tunes... Now, keep in mind that Firestarter is NOT an original - it's a tune from "The Prodigy" and in fact - sounds almost *idential* to the original version. But it's tolerable... Then, the disc turns into some kind of sick joke with Waiting for the Morning Light, only Gene is serious when he sings it. The next track, Beautiful, isn't. And then by the time you're put thru that torment you get to the title track and you just CAN'T TAKE ANY MORE! I mean this disc truly saps your will to live. I thought Miles Davis' "Bitches Brew" was bad - that is high-concept art compared to this hunk of trash... The ONE saving grace to THIS version of the record is the two additional tracks.  These tracks were actually on a bonus disc that came with the audio version of Gene's last book.  If you already have that, those are the best tracks from the entire disc.  There's no need to bother buying THIS version or the less expensive US vesrion for that matter. Again - save your money and buy some WASP or Rob Zombie or ANYTHING ELSE... even Metallica's St. Anger But not this...
