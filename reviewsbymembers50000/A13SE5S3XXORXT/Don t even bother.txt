 This thing is as bad as the other reviews you've read, and in my case *worse*.  I can't even get the USB driver for the device to install on any of my systems.  Both installers I've tried just lock up as the installer initializes. I'm taking it back and getting a refund.  I recommend you don't even try this thing.  The wallet you save may be your own.
