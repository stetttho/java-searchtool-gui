 First, my kids LOVE the V.Smile.  They want to play it constantly.    And I'm very happy about that.  However, there are a couple of things about the system that I find really disappointing, given the state of 'standard' video game consoles.  - The V.Smile requires batteries.  You can use a power adapter, but V.Tech doesn't include one.    - The graphics in the games are not even as good as the old Super Nintendo Entertainment System from 15 years ago.  - The sound quality is TERRIBLE.  Again, the Super Nintendo had better sound and that 15 years ago.  - The cartridges use an odd 'edge' connector that is very snug and is hard for little hands to plug in.  If they're not careful they could force it and end up breaking the V.Smile console.  All of this said there are some good things.  - The games are fun and kids really enjoy them. - The controllers are VERY nice for young children with big buttons, and very sturdy overall design.  If this was a system for teens I'd have given this one star, but it's for kids, and the kids enjoy it.  But for the reason above I will only give it 3 stars.
