 I love most of the material on this album, but I can barely give it a listen all the way through because it sounds *so bad*.  Counterparts, for example, is sonically crisp and clear as is Roll the Bones.  VT, on the other hand, is muddy and has far too much of the 'midrange' sound spectrum being pushed into the foreground.   A note to RUSH: please fire your mastering engineer and get a new one. Still, if you're a RUSH fan, this should be a part of your collection.  There's something for every fan to like on this disc.
