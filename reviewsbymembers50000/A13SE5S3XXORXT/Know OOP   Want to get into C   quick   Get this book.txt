 This book has *got* to be the easiest read for getting up to speed on C++ that I have found to date.  The examples are totally straightforward.  The book is well organized and pulls no surprises for the reader.  However if you don't know Object Oriented Programming (OOP) you *might* have a hard time picking up some of the finer details of just how truly powerful C++ can be.  In that case I'd recommend *also* getting Bruce Eckel's "Thinking in C++".  The combination of the two of these books will have you writing solid code in no time.
