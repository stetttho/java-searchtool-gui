 Nothing is better than seeing your 4-year-old laughing out loud to the same cartoons that you laughed at as a kid.  My kids love the Hanna/Barberra-era Tom n Jerry cartoons and this DVD set has *all* of the best from that era.  The Deitch-produced series don't cut it, and the Chuck Jones-produced shorts are anemic compared to these classics.  If you want the best of the Tom and Jerry animated shorts, this set will definitely satisfy.
