 OK, I prefer the performances on "Something Wicked..." or "Night of the Stormrider".  That said, this is still a great record and probably one of their best after the aforementioned titles.  It's sonically excellent and easily as tight as any thing they've done prior to this.  Tim Owens vocals are outstanding.  I find this album to be a bit 'transitional' in it's sound - as if Jon and crew have big plans in the future and this record is really more of a springboard into what's to come.  I look forward to the next IE offering.  Jon, Tim, and crew - excellent work.  Keep it up..
