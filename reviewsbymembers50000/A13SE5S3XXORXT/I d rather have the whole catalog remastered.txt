 This is a *great* 2CD compilation that gives a *great* cross-section of the work Anthrax did during the "Belladonna years".  However, I'd prefer they'd have done what Dave Mustaine did with the Megadeth catalog.  They should remaster *all* of the CDs - not just a sampling of each.  That said the remixed/remastered material on this CD sounds great.  If you haven't listened to the material from the classic Anthrax lineup in a while.. this will take definitely take you back.
