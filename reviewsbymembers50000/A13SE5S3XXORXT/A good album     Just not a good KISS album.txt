 OK, I'll admit it.  I like this record.  It's got some great material on it.  Escape from The Island, for example, is an instrumental masterpiece.  However, this should have had another band's name on it.  KISS has tried to broaden themselves in the past, and that can be a good thing, but it wasn't this time.  The album opens with flutes, and then into a quiet ballad.  Not what KISS fans expect when the last album that Bob Ezrin produced for KISS was 'Detroyer' (an absolute masterpiece).  At least Bob redeemed himself 10 years later with 'Revenge'.  In short, if you get this album, keep an open mind.  It's not what you'd expect from 'The Hottest Band in The World', but it's still worth a listen.
