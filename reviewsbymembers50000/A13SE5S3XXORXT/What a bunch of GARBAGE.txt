 The part of the book that really just makes me want to set it on fire is; "When I found out about [Monica Lewinsky] I was furious at Bill". RIIIGHT. Furious that he got CAUGHT, perhaps, but there were *too many* women that Bill has become notorious for catting around with for Hillary not to know.  It wouldn't surprise me if she had picked Monica out for him.   I wouldn't mind if she would be honest and say that she used Bill as a means to an end to get herself into politics.  At least then I might have shred of respect for her.  But that would require honesty and integrity.  Something the Clintons are NOT known for. There are better books out there with far better writing as well.  Might I recommend "Goodnight Moon", for example, if you insist reading on second-grade level writing... Regardless either buy this one used (I'm sure it'll be available in 2nd hand bookstores soon) or just save your money and your brain cells.  It is true, a mind IS a terrible thing to waste.  Don't waste it on this GARBAGE.
