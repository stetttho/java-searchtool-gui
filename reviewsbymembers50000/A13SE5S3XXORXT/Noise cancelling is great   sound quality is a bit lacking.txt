 My baseline for comparing any higher-end pair of headphones I get from Sony are *still* my 15-year-old MDR-V6 (digital studio monitor) headphones.  They were 150 dollars in 1989.  They still sound great and have only needed their earfoams replaced.  I just got a pair of these MDR-NC50s for 116 bucks.  And the noise cancelling is *outstanding*.  It's at *least* as good as the Bose (which I've also used).  But the sound quality leaves something to be desired - especially when compared to my MDR-V6's.  A lot of the midrange and trebles are being drowned out.  All in all they sound great, but I think Sony could do better.  Definitely worth the discounted price, however.
