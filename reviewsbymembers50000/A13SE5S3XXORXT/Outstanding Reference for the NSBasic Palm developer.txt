 Dr. Verive's efforts in NSBasic Programming for Palm OS are well deserved of praise.  The biggest challenges a technical  author has is finding the right audience to write to and then maintaining the interest of that audience.  Dr. Verive has done probably the *most* difficult thing a technical author can do:  He has written a book for *all* levels of programmer *and* has written it to keep the interest of the reader, regardless of their technical level. The book is very well organized so that the experienced programmer can quickly learn the features they need to be proficient in NSBasic/Palm.  However the book starts by *also* laying down an excellent foundation for the new programmer.  Subjects include programming techniques, and instruction on structured programming. The accompanying CD is a gold mine with lots of demo code and 'template' applications that you can use as the foundation for your own work. If you're new to NSBasic programming or just new to programming, get this book, you'll have it sitting at all times right next to your NSBasic Language Reference.  The combination of the two books you will find invaluable.
