 I dunno if anyone who reads this book will actually be as successful as Gene Simmons, but at least they'll be taken for a whole lot less cash than Tony Robbins takes people for.  And Gene is speaking from experience.  There are some great jokes, as well as great advice in this book.  If you get a chance, get the Audio CD version, too.  It definitely makes the morning drive to work more interesting..
