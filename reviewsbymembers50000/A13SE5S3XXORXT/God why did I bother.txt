 I finally got Metallica's St. Anger... and I really *hoped* the reviews I read on Amazon and on the Usenet Newsgroups were just overly harsh... They weren't... I mean.. DANG this thing is a turd.  The mix and sound are horrible..  The guitars clip constantly and the sound is so oversaturated that even if the material were *good* it would be unlistenable... Note to Lars and James: "KILL KILL KILL KILL" is NOT a lyric - you dopes!! On a scale of one to five stars I give it a big fat ZERO.
