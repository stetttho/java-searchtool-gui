 This game WOULD have gotten a rating of four or five stars, if it weren't for a nasty little bug that keeps you from finishing this game.  You can see ... for all of the details on it.  But in short, if you enter a 'Speedway' round and don't finish it and get your egg, you never will.  The game has been fixed and a newer version is available, but if you have the broken version the only way to finish the game is to send your memory card to Sony.  Since Sony won't replace the defective version of the game, I rate this one ONE star and recommend Spyro fans avoid it.
