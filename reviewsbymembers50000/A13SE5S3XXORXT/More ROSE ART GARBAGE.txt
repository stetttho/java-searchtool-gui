 I got this for my daughter for a Christmas present.  It jammed up after assembling it.  It is, with out doubt, complete trash.  Rose Art used to be a good brand.  Apparently someone has bought the brand name and figured that prison labor in China will somehow translate to quality products.  More than likely, however, they just decided to turn out junk without a care for the brand name or the people they would be ripping off.  This is not the only Rose Art product I bought - every other one I bought was broken or defective in some way.  But this is the LAST time I buy anything with that brand name I guarantee it.
