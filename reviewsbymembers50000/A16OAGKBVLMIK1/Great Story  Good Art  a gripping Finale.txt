 This Graphic Novel compilation is Frank Miller at his best. The story centers on a Bruce Wayne that comes out of a retirement after 10 years, into a world where all the heroes and villains have fled or have died. The first Tim Burton Batman movie is based on the dark atmosphere from this Graphic Novel. Appearances include the Joker, Catwoman, (Wonder Woman of sorts), Two-Face, Green Arrow, and a certain Boy Scout hero in blue tights working for the government.  Imagine a world where Reagan is still president and the US is at war with Russia.  Imagine a world with no superheroes, and city streets being riddled by crime and gangs.  This is the future of Gotham city.  This is a book that can't be missed. I highly recommend this book. (Not suitable for young children)
