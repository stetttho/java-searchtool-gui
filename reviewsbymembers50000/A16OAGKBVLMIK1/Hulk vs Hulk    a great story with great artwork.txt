 It is a future imperfect, where all the superheroes of old have died... except one. In the distant future, a group of rebels open a time portal to the past and brings through it Bruce Banner, aka the Incredible Hulk.  This is not the mindless Hulk of old, but the new Hulk with the mind of Bruce Banner. After adjusting to his new future surroundings, Hulk finds out that the mastermind behind his abduction is no other than Rick Jones, who is now old and wheelchair bound.  Rick has brought the Hulk into the future in hopes that he can restore freedom to a dictatorship world.  This future is filled with Gestapo-like police that has free reign over the residents.  However, the police all follow the leadership of the Maestro, a powerful dictator who is actually the future version of the Hulk! What we are treated to is a fantastic story of the future of the Marvel Universe, where the remains of heroes are kept in jars in Rick Jones' basement. This is a fantastic story of an alternate post-apocalyptic world run by the Hulk.  Peter David, who has written many Hulk stories, doesn't miss a beat in this absolutely fantastic tale.  He keeps the story very fluid and interesting.  The artwork is wonderful, as the legendary George Perez does it. I definitely recommend this book to any Hulk fan, or anyone looking for a quality story.
