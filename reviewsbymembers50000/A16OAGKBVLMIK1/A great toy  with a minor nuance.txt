 This is a fantastic toy, made of fairly durable plastic.  It takes a couple "C" batteries, and lights up with the on/off toggle button.   It makes light-saber sounds automatically, and when the plastic blade hits something, it makes a "battle" sound (like 2 lightsabers hitting one another). The light is fairly bright, and looks well around dusk.  The blade itself is pretty good quality, and should last a hundreds of hits pretty easily, unless you swing very very hard. The main problem comes from the on/off switch.  It is cubersome, being in the middle of the handle.  It makes holding the toy with 2 hands somewhat uncomfortable.  The other lightsabers are far superior in this aspect, but of course they aren't blue. Elsewise, this is an excellent toy.  Perhaps a little too dangerous for young children, but it is excellent for responsible children and teens/adults.  (And it is a great prop for costumes!) Definitely an excellent lightsaber available at this price range.  I highly recommend it.
