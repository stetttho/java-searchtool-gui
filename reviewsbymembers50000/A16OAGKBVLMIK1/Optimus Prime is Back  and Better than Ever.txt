 Optimus Prime returns to glory in the reprint of a classic!   The vehicle mode looks great, as do all the original Transformers do.  If you have never seen a Transformer before, you would never realize that this truck turns into a robot. The front cab transforms into Prime himself, looking as good as he ever did.  The attachable hands can easily be kept in the cab, while the gun may need to be in the trailer. The rubber tires and metal parts makes this piece durable and far more realistic that the newer all-plastic toys.   Transforming is fairly easy, but the parts can be a bit sticky at times. The trailer transforms into the autobot base, with a roller (a car companion).   I recommend Optimus Prime for any transformers fan, old and new.  It is nice to be able to own an original, and it is great to see how it all started.  I hope we will see more reprints in the future.  Optimus Prime is certainly a great start!
