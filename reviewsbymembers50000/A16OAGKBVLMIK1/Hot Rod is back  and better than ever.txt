 This reprint of the original Hot Rod is for old time fans and new fans alike. Hot Rod was the transformer that eventually became the new Autobots leader, Rodimus Prime. The vehicle mode of this transformer is stylish and futuristic.  The overall look is fairly close to the look in the cartoon.   I have always loved this car as it truly deserves the name "Hot Rod".  The dark blue windows gives it a gleem, while the wing shaped spoiler and side pipes makes it look fast. Transforming into robot mode is fairly easy.  Robot mode looks very good -- as good as any other G1 transformer.  Ages 7+ should easily be able to transform this. Overall this piece is very durable, and alot of fun to play with.  Robot mode looks good, while the vehicle itself looks great!  I highly recommend this for any transformer fan, or someone looking to introduce their children to the transformers.
