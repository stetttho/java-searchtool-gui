 Many moons ago, the powers that be decided to revamp the Transformers line by killing off many of the original characters, while introducing new ones, in Transformers The Movie.  Unfortunately it backfired, mostly because they killed off one of the favorite characters, Optimus Prime. This 2-part series seeks to remedy that mistake.  Optimus Primes' body is found floating in Space towards the sun, when it is hijacked by scientists who plan to use it as a weapon by implanting it with a highly infectious Virus that makes living beings hate and destroy (everything).  Failing to do this, the virus is accidentally spread across Earth.  ....  The mood while watching this is very heightened due to the Virus, which is spread simply by touch.  This mini-movie stars Optimus Prime, Rodimus Prime, Wreck-Gar, Sky-Lynx, Spike, and shows the transformation of Bumblebee to Goldbug. The Animation is fairly good, considering it was made for television.  It is of much higher quality than the series at that time, but not nearly as good as the Movie.   Clearly some parts were rushed, but overall the animation was better than average (it reminds me of original Transformers series before the movie).    The sound is as can be expected.  All the original voices are there, from Bumblebee to Sky-Lynx, and the everlasting Peter Cullen returning as Optimus Prime.  (note:  Did you know that Peter Cullen also voiced the autobot Ironhide, and Venger from the Dungeons & Dragons cartoon?)
