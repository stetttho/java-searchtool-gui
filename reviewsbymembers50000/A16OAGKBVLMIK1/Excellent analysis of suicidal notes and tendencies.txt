 The Author does an excellent job of analysis sets of Notes and explains the pattern through them all. In other words, the author didn't just slap together a compilation of notes -- he explains them and points out important details about how they are written. For example, did you know that Suicide Notes that were written hundreds of years ago has the same pattern as Suicide notes written today?  Did you know that most Suicide notes are torn up by the author immediately after being written?  This book covers these type of things and much more.  The author analyzes many popular celebrity notes too, such as Kurt Cobain (and his wife's reaction to it).  The most interesting thing I found in this book was the inclusion of the note O.J. Simpson wrote while in prison, which sounded very much like a Suicide Note and followed all the patterns of one.
