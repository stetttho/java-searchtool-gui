 The small transformers from the Robots in Disguise line has been an overall disappointment, and these two follow that trend.   Transformation from robot to car is easy enough, but the over fun level is low.  these robots are not nearly as 'cool' as the original line of transformers and re-using original G1 names for these toys is insulting. The plastic makes these pieces fairly durable to survive any trip to the bathtub or backyard.   If you see these on clearance then pick them up, but they certainly aren't much better than the cheap toys you find at the dollar store.  My recommendation would be to buy the bigger transformers.
