 Another film I just don't understand why it gets such great ratings. It is ground breaking in terms of violence and gore, lot of blood spurting, but I otherwise I didn't get much else from it. Not one I could watch over and  over again. I didn't buy the motivations. At one point they are very  ruthless then they have some kind of honor among thieves. The opening  battle is very good and shows the ruthlessness of the characters. The final  battle seemed to be to see how many squibs they could fire off in a minute.  The violence here seemed extremely gratuitous. I know they are the heroes,  but I can't understand why everyone else gets hit once, goes down and stays  down while the heroes get hit at least five plus times and still don't go  down. The acting I thought wasn't particularly great and the plot rather  slow at times. As far as the DVD goes, very good video transfer which is  unusual for films of this age. It looks like new. A very interesting  documentary that I thought was better than the film itself.
