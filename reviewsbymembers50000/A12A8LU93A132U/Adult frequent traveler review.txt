 PROS: Small. High tech looking not "toy" like. Backlight. Screen protected when stored. Rechargeable battery. CONS: Difficult to see screen without backlight even in good lighting conditions. No car charger available as yet. No spare battery available as yet. Requires small philip head screwdriver to replace battery. L and R buttons sensitive. Relatively expensive. Overall: Good buy for a frequent traveler killing time in long airport waits.
