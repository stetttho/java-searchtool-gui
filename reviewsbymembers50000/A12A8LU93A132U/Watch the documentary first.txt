 Wow! The plot itself plods along, but the cinematography is great. A film that is more appreciated after watching the documentary. The DVD is worth it for this alone. Most of the actors and crew had to be scuba certified.  If you are certified, you know this isn't trivial. The suits aren't props  either, but fully functional life supports. No wonder the film was called  the hardness shoot ever. The DVD is packed with extras. I mean whole  scripts not just the final script but initial scripts as well. I thought  Ghostbusters had a lot of extras. This much extra material is sometimes  hard to present, but unlike many DVDs that have very confusing interfaces,  this one makes it very easy to find the material you're looking for. All  together an absolute must for a DVD collection.
