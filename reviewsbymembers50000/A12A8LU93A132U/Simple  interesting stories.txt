 This book is really a collection of short stories that are all set in one alternative future. The first half of the book is a condensed version of the stories, told within the context of another story (ie. flashbacks), that follow in the second half. This isn't hard science. The stories drive the interest along. The stories deal with different consequences of psychic-like abilities and the ability to 'sleep' through centuries to wake up in a future time. Overall, all the stories are very good and explain a different aspect of the world Card is trying to create. Highly recommended.
