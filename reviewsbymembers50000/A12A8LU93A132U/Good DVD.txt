 I love the use of many different animation styles. It seems to capture the feeling of experimentation of the time. A great DVD video restoration with plenty of extras including interviews. I didn't know the voices weren't the  Beatles, fooled me. The English subtitles let me pick up puns I missed in  previous viewing. You even get subtitles in Japanese and Portuguese, which  is fun if you're trying to learn the language.
