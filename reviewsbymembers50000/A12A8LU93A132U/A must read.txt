 I thought this was a very well written book. The grammatical/spelling  errors aside, I like the style of the book. The author uses mostly  Beverly's letters to her parents to tell her story. Beverly wrote some  truly amazing letters. Her sense of humor, fun and outlook toward life  comes thorough. Some interviews with friends after her death are also  included. The author only touches on Beverly's life as a climber; after  reading this book you can see was only one aspect of her life. Beverly  comes across as a amazing woman someone whos lifestyle many can admire. I  think a must read for any woman in a male dominating sport or activity.
