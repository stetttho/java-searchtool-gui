 A kick back and enjoy film. One you don't have to think about much to enjoy. I thought all the actors did a fine job. The DVD is basic. No extras to speak of, but this isn't a film that requires deep analysis. You have to take it for what it is. Its a very good value for what it delivers; A few hours of enjoyment.
