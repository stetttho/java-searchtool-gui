 I loved this series as a child and still find the plot interesting. However, the science is a bad, snow on Mars etc. If you can overlook this the story is great. No DVD extras other than chapter search. They make up for this in the second DVD with a scene cut from the original Japanese series, character bios and better navagation. Not the best DVD production, but at least someone is putting this classic series on DVD. A must it you loved the series as a child or for your own children.
