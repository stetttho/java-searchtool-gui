 I got this book based on the excellent reviews. I've read Kenyon's `The Seeds of Time' and found it fairly entertaining.  I was very disappointed with this book. The character development was adequate. The book description makes it sound very exciting and profound. It was none of these although it could have been. The major revelation is glossed over and a reader can almost miss it. The plot deals mainly with the aliens' political intrigues that are almost too human. Why they do what they do seems to make no sense. The girl is secondary to the story and certainly no warrior as the book description portrays. She manages to stay alive on a world where everything seems to eat everything else. Harry Harrison's `Deathworld' comes to mind. The overall problem seems to be that events in the book unfold without any background. It's almost as if the reader is expected to know what happened to cause the events lending up to the climax. There are several stories and plotlines occurring in this book that really need several books to cover adequately. It's almost as if this book is a synopsis of a whole series.  As a result this is a book with huge possibilities that falls flat due to lack of content.
