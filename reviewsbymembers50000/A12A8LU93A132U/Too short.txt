 I got this mainly because it was 'Creature Comforts' that introduced me to Nick Park. No special features, not even English subtitles. As an American, I had a little difficulty understanding the British accents. Multiple viewing helps. Overall the DVD runs about 30 minutes. The 6 minute 'Creature Comforts' is the best of the four. Even at a low price this DVD is pushing the value envelope. It's not worth it unless you absolutely love Nick Park animation and have to have it in your collection.
