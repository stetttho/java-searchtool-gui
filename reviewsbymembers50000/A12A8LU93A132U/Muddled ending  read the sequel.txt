 I found the book interesting it that I wanted to find out what was going on, but the ending was unclear and exactly what was going on was confusing. Something to do with the reproducing cycle of Sira. It does make you want  to read the sequel if just to figure out what was going on it this book.  Which I suppose a first book in a series should do. Overall, I give it a  average rating. Not a book I'd read over and over again.
