 It's hard not to see the Arab-Israeli conflict in this novel of two people at war. The parallels are too strong. I'm sure the author used it as a basis for the plot, characters and background. I agree with another review that the author loves to use flowery adjectives and prose that at times gets in the way of the narrative. At times I was thinking, 'Just get on with it.' But after a couple of chapters, I got used to the style and just got into the flow of the novel. The book has a weak ending, with an ambiguous resolution, but I liked the author's style, it was different. I have to say though, I don't think I'll read another by this author. I like a little more substance behind all the artful use of language.
