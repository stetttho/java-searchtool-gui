 This movie is one of my favorite romantic comedies. What would you do if you were immortal?  Another twist, what would you do if your actions had no lasting consequences? I found no problem with the color fidelity on the  DVD, although I did see some scratches and blotches, but I've seen worse.  Since this movie isn't about the cinematography, this isn't a major  problem. For a relatively minor film the DVD is very good. The DVD has no  extras and the subtitles were not verbatim.
