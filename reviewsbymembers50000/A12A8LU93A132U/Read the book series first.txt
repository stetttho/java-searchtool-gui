 I love this film only because I love the series, and lets face it, you will not understand this movie unless you have read the Dune series and I don't mean just the first book. The film makes a lot of references to  things that you don't learn about until later books in the series. If you  like the book series you will like the movie as a supplement to them.  Otherwise, you won't like this film because a lot of the scenes require  information that just isn't given. It's almost as if this movie was made  for the people who have read the series.
