 Reading this book is much easier after taking the author's course. You get a better feeling for how the book is laid out after listening to the author's lecture style. An organic chemist by training, the author naturally gears this book to the organic chemist. He gives just enough physiology to understand the pharmacology behind it. The book follows his lecture course fairly well with more in-depth discussion on topics of interest. A standard reference text that should be in any chemists' library starting out in the pharmaceutical field.
