 This is a great groundbreaking cartoon series that as the producer says in the commentary, "... probably wouldn't get produced today." Realistic characters with their own problems, hang-ups and real-life issues about love and war. 12 episodes are included in this set. I think there were 68 episodes in 3 seasons of Robotech. A "movie" version of the first 13 episodes is included giving snippets of the various episodes in order through a flashback narration by the Captain. The only real value of this is a commentary track by the producer of the series giving a history of the production's conversion to an American audience. The picture or sound doesn't appear to be restored. Overall, this is a must have if you grew up on this series as I did.
