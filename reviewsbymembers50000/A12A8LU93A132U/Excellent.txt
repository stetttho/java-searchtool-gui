 I think it's hard for an author to continue a series in a particular universe and make it familiar yet different and interesting. Card continues to do this with Ender's Shadow. Even classic series such as the Dune universe start to get boring by the 4th book. Card is able to tell the same story from a different and interesting view point. Even though the main plot is known to most readers, this story of Bean holds its interest. You will definitely enjoy this book if you liked Ender's Game.
