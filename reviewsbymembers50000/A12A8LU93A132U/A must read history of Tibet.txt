 This book is a definitive history of Tibet covering a crucial period. Goldstein writes an extremely readable book. He covers a large time period using primary sources and interviews with the characters involved. He  limits his analysis of the events and lets the readers examine the  evidence. He gives evidence of the Tibetan government's faults as well as  the abandonment of Tibet by the international community. This book is a  must read for anyone trying to understand the current efforts of the  Tibetan government in exile. `Orphans of the Cold War: America and the  Tibetan Struggle for Survival' by John Kenneth Knaus is also an excellent  book that covers the US government's involvement with Tibet and gives extra  insight to the information given by Goldstein.
