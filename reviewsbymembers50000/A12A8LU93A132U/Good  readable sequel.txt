 A good follow-up to 'The Color of Distance', although not as strong. There were more noticeable plot elements that were hard to buy. One thing I found particularly unbelievable was the character of Bruce. In the first book, he  is portrayed as a caring, understanding and giving person who doesn't judge  the Tendu on human values. In this book his character does a complete 180.  He's a selfish, close-minded, bigoted jerk. This Jekyll and Hyde  personality was distracting and has hard for me to swallow. I felt like  smacking the character on the head. I guess this change was required for  plot.  The implications of Tendus' ability to heal and extend lifetime on  human society was touched on by the author, however, I think the impact of  the Tendu was downplayed much more than would be the case. Overall, this  book makes a good follow-up and worthy of a read. Several plot lines remain  open for a possible continuation.
