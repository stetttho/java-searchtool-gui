 This movie is a fun fairy tale that both adults and children will love. I got this DVD because I love the film, but the DVD is lacking. No extras  even English subtitles which would have helped because some of the accents  are hard to understand particularly Andre the Giant. Rumors about an  enhanced DVD coming out so you may want to wait.
