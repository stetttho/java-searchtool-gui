 I felt like I was watching an extended sitcom and if that's what you're  looking for, you'll like this film.  I won't belabor the film; others have  done that well enough. I'll just concentrate on the DVD features. The DVD  didn't have much in the way of extras. The interviews lasted less than 5  minutes per person. I didn't see a `Gag reel'. I must have missed it? The  trailer is just about standard now for DVDs. The commentary by the director  was interesting, pointing out tidbits like when lines were improvisation.   Overall, I didn't see anything that made me want this in my collection. I'd  say unless you loved the film I wouldn't bother.
