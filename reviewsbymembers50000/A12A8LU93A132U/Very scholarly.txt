 This history is written from the point of view of the evolution of Chinese  political thought and its affect on Tibet, more than a straightforward  history. The author deals more in broad Chinese influences than specific  ones, although he does discuss specific events. About half the book covers  the time period after 1951 to the late 80's and should have stuck with  that. Smith uses mainly secondary sources, like Goldstein, for events  before 1951 and primary sources for events after. Goldstein gives a much  better history of Tibet up to the Chinese `liberation.' The book is in  extension of Smith's thesis and reads a bit like it. He includes extended  quotes. It's much harder to read, follow and maintain interest. Smith is  obviously very pro-Tibetan, as am I, but this tends to make me a little  skeptical in my reading of this book especially when he starts to argue  over numbers. Overall, I thought this was a decent book especially for the  more recent events in Tibet, but I tend to be a little skeptical of Smith's  analysis.
