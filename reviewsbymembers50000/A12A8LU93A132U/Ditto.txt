 An entertaining story that tells of the Wars of the Roses from a more personality driven aspect.  This book is ann excellent way to learn about this historical period.  The only problem I had with the book is that Weir, sometimes switches back and forth between using peoples given names and  their titles.  I guess this is a difficult think to avoid because first  sons were often named after the father and titles were transferred only  after the previous holder died.  Conveniently, Weir includes a genealogy,  but even still it is sometimes difficult to keep track of the characters.  The nature of the beast, I guess, I haven't read a royal history yet that I  don't get the characters confused halfway thorough.
