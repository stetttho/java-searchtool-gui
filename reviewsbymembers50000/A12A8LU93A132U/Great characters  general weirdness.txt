 This book has great character development and scene setting which goes on for the first 2/3 of the book. I give it the highest rating for this. However, the rating comes down in the last chapter, which gets weird with  strange dream like sequences that I don't care for much. This is the type  of book you read in college where you have to try to analyze everything the  author is trying to say. I'm not sure what it was. For example, I'm not  sure what the title is referring too. I'm also not sure what the power  struggle was all about. The author seems to try to convey great  significance to an event that seemed trivial to me. The back cover credits  compare this author to Phillip K. Dick, but except for the weird dream  sequences, Reed's writing is much better. This book reminded me a lot of  Vonnegut's Slaughter House Five. The same sort of time travel weirdness and  symbolism with great writing. So an average rating for great  characterization and scene but a general weirdness that I don't care for.
