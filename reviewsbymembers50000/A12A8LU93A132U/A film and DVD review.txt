 I'll probably get bashed for not liking this film, at least it didn't live up to its hype of being an incredibly funny film, although there are some humorous scenes. The cameo by Charlie Sheen is the funniest part of the  film. I think Catherine Keener gives an amazing performance as a  self-centered coworker. She makes the character strangely attractive even I  wanted her. Enough about the film, what about the DVD? The standard theater  trailer and four 30 second TV spots are included. A documentary on  puppeteering is included which is sort of interesting. A 3-minute interview  with the director as he's driving is funny. It's like a motorcycle gang is  chasing him. I guess that's what working for a studio is like. Finally the  best part is a 6-minute interview/rant with a background driver for the NJ  turnpike scenes. That has to be the funniest thing. You just want to  sit-down, have a beer and let this person entertain you for hours. A DVD  that I wouldn't pay full price for I think I'd look for it on a discount or  previously-viewed  rack for the scenes I liked and the extras.
