 This cookbook had some limited use for me. It was a short introduction on tips for RV cooking. Overall some good general tips, but nothing that probably isn't in a good trade magazine. As an experienced camping and backpacking cook I was hoping for information on RV cooking now that I have a refrigerator. It does give some good recipes that utilize the better facilities of an RV. However about half the recipes assume you have an oven as well. My small Class B RV doesn't have an oven. Therefore, half the book is useless for me. Overall a slightly disappointing book that I wish I had looked over before purchasing.
