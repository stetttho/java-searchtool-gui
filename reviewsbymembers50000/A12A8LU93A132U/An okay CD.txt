 I got this CD because I loved Robert Rodriguez's soundtrack for  'Desperado'. I like just about every song on that CD. I got this one  because I like the opening title song and the barroom songs. I was hoping  to be pleasantly surprised by the rest of the songs, but unfortunately I  wasn't. The rest of the songs aren't bad, but they don't knock my socks off  either. You also get Chet's speech, which is hilarious. The hidden track is  the second part of his speech and should have been tagged on to the first  part, which I find a bit annoying. Also, the barroom songs didn't seem as  bright or peppy as they did in the DVD when I first heard them. This was  disappointing. They sounded more studio produced then live. None-the-less,  if you really liked certain songs from the movie and have to have them, I'd  get this CD otherwise I might skip it.
