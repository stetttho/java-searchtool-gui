 I'm repeating some of what a previous reviewer said about this DVD because I completely agree. "First the commentary is very good. They mix five different people onto one track." Although I would have liked  them to be in the same room, which was probably difficult to schedule with  the number of busy people who give commentary. The deleted scenes are okay.  They were all scenes in the film only in shorter versions. They seemed to  be mostly cut for length. Some deleted scenes from other DVD's would have  changed the whole feeling, pace and tone of a film, these, for the most  part, do not. "Finally, the Documentary material on the disk is  interesting but don't get too excited about it - it's nothing you couldn't  find on the internet with about 15 seconds worth of  effort." "Now about the two features the disk is lacking which  I think are serious short comings: No Subtitles and no Trailer."   Overall, I think a poor value for what you get. Is it worth the money?  Not in my book, there are better Criterion Collection DVD's out there. If  you love the film though you will like the DVD.
