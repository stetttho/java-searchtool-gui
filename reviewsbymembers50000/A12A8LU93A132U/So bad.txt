 I thought this was such a boring film its hard to evaluate the DVD objectively so I won't even try. Even for a pure action film I thought it was boring. I didn't care about the characters. The action sequences seemed fairly canned. How many car chases can a person watch? Admittingly its hard to make a scene that everyone has probably seen a hundred times, but as much as they tried the chase scenes were fairly standard. You can watch the action highlight featurette and the time needed to watch the whole movie. Overall a very bad value. If this was at a garage sale I may pick it up for a couple of bucks but there wasn't a single thing in the movie that would make me add this to my collection.
