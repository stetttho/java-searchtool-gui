 If you are expecting a biography of Dan Osman, this really isn't it.  Although the author gives details of Osman's life, the book is really about  the author's own journey; balancing his risk-taking activities with family  responsibilities and his relationship with Dan Osman. The Phantom Lord is a  metaphor the author uses for one's own fear; ie the book is about the  author and Osman dealing with their fears. Therefore, the book is half  about Osman and half about the author. For what it delivers, the book is  very well written. In retrospect to Osman's subsequent death, it is very  interesting. If you are uninterested in the author's journey, as I was, the  sections where he talks about himself are easily skipped. The parts, about  Osman, that I found interesting are fairly short and I'd recommend climbers  to borrow it. He spends quite a number of pages explaining various climbing  terms; therefore, I'd also recommend it to the general reader for its  excellent writing.
