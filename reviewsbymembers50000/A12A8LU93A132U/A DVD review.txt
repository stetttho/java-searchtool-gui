 This film is one of my favorite thrillers. The picture and sound are excellent. The alternative ending is better and makes more sense. Although it has just a few seconds added to the original ending it makes a big  difference. The commentary is by the director is very good giving a lot of  interesting trivia on the actors and the filming. The 'stunning' 8-page  booklet isn't that stunning. Only 4 pages of text and not much more  information than the director gives in the commentary. An excellent DVD to  have in your collection especially if you like thrillers.
