 Although I find the evidence circumstantial I find the theory highly plausible. As the author admits herself her aim isn't to prove Richard guilty. She isn't a jury and isn't trying to prove his guilt in a court of  law. She is trying to come to a plausible account of what happened. Given  that it was acceptable to kill one's rivals for political advancement I  find her theory acceptable although not proven. Although I think OJ did it,  I agree with the verdict of not guilty. The evidence was too  circumstantial. Same case here.
