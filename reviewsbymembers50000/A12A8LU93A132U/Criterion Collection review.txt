 This film is my all time favorite romantic comedy. It has a lot of similarity to my own relationships. The DVD is produced well, but the extra material isn't that great. The deleted scenes are all from scenes in the movie that were mainly cut for length. There is nothing there that would  have added much to the film, changed the feel or tone, and was rightfully  cut. The outtakes aren't that funny and are mainly either the actors  laughing or getting a bit tongue tied. The commentary was adequate, but  they had too many people on it. They are often talking over each other and  it's impossible to hear what they are saying. The introduction by Smith is  mainly him apologizing for saying '... DVD' several times in the  commentary; it was orginally recorded for laser disc. The introductions to  the deleted scenes and outtakes by the cast are mainly Smith, Mewes and  Affleck trying to be funny in improv. Improv actors they are not and  thankfully this can be skipped. Despite the Criterion Collection  shortcomings, this is a fantastic movie and doesn't have to be a Criterion  to be in my collection.
