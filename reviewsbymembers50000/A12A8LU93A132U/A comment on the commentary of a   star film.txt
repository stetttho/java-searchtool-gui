 This movie has been reviewed to death, but I wanted to comment on the commentary included with the DVD edition. First let me say that this in one of my all time favorite sci-fi flicks right up there with Alien, Dune,  Blade Runner. The commentary is however, the absolute worst I have ever  heard. The director runs out of interesting stuff to say. Carrie-Anne Moss  had the most interesting things to say, but you hear from her only briefly  in the beginning of the film and then at the end. She said nothing during  the whole middle of the film. Possibly she was intimidated by the special  effect supervisor which had the most to say, but fell into such deep  special effects lingo that, as a layman, I could only understand about 1 in  3 words. Plus his black humor was out of place and put me off. A ground  breaking film in terms of special effects I think should have a 5 star  commentary as well. A redeeming feature of this DVD edition is the  mini-featurettes that are included.
