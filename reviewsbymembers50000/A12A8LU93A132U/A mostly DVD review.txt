 I loved the first film, I gave it the highest rating. I found this one just replayed the a lot of the old jokes and they just weren't as funny second time around. The DVD seems to have more extras but again I don't  think they're as good as the previous DVD. The deleted scenes weren't great  and you can tell why they were cut, they aren't that funny. I was really  disappointed with the commentary. It too wasn't as funny as previously and  seemed a bit forced. I don't like commentary where you don't have to  actually watch the film to listen to it, a lot of it was like that. The Dr.  Evil biography was funny, but I'd have trouble watching it over and over.  The music videos were great, but will you buy a DVD for the music videos?  Probably not. I have this in my collection for the few scenes I found funny  like the Jerry Springer scene.
