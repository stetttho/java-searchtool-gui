 I only rated this DVD a 4 star because it is for people who have never taken Tai Chi. The title is a bit misleading. 6 forms aren't given. 6 movements are taught in one form, the simplified Yang form. As a person with intermediate Tai Chi experience I was hoping for expanded forms. This DVD is for a complete novice. As such, it is very good. The movements are given from the front, back and side so novices can easily copy the movements. Especially helpful even for an intermediate student was how the instructor pointed out common mistakes students make in the various movements. The lessons get longer as the student goes through them. The end of the DVD gives references to more advanced videos as well as Tai Chi movements for specific ailments. If you want to learn about Tai Chi without taking a class, this is a very good start. As a reference for more advances students, it is not really worth it.
