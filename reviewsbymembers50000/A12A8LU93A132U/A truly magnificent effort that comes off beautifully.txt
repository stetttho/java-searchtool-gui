 A beautifully researched book that covers the US's involvement with Tibet from 1942 to 1974. The author only spends one chapter to his personal involvement with the Tibetan resistance, the rest is the interesting  political maneuvering done it the time period. The author spent several  years interviewing many of the principal characters and researching the  available archives. Just about every statement the author makes is backed  up by a primary source. The author makes a very good attempt at an  objective portrayal of the events described although his main sources,  understandably, come from Tibetan, Indian and western sources. The Chinese  view comes mainly from published speeches. This book is also a good source  to other books about Tibet. One book by Sydney Wignall, 'Spy on the Roof of  the World' is also a interesting account of Chinese/Tibetan relations in  1957.
