 First let me agree with all the positive reviews. Second a fun suggestions is to watch this back to back with the American version of the film "The Magnificent Seven." It's interesting to see how the  characters and story are modified to fit an American audience. Cultural  differences between Americans and Japanese is interesting to see in the  context of the film.
