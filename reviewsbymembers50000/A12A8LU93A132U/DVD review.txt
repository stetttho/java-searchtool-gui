 A simple DVD as DVDs go. This DVD was surprisingly good considering the lack of extras. The picture and sound were excellent. Only filmographies of the cast were given, no biographies. A very good commentary from Costner and the producer. Costner didn't talk too much or though the scenes, but gave very interesting comments about the directing and acting. The producer doesn't say much other than to jog Costner's memory. This one seems ripe for a special edition and I'll probably have to replace it. If you love this movie, this is a excellent DVD to add to your collection even if it doesn't have a lot of bonus features.
