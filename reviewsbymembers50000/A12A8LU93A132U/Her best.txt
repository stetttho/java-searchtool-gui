 In my opinion this is book is her best in the series. The title I think is misleading a bit. The book mainly deals mostly with King Edward and Queen Mary. Of course, she deals with Queen Elizabeth more than adequately in her  next book. This book is an excellent bridge between 'The Wives of Henry the  VIII' and 'Elizabeth I'. The attempted coups, rebellions and assassinations  in interesting stuff. A must read.
