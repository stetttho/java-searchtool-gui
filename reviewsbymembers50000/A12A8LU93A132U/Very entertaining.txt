 A very entertaining novel that is really two stories in one. The book follows two parallel story lines, one for the humans and one for the aliens. The story lines converge at the end for the exciting finish. Both story lines keep you on the edge of your seat with suspense. The science was adequate with decently developed characters. The only problem I had with the book was the improbable surprise ending that seemed a little rushed to end the novel in a timely manner. Otherwise, I would highly recommend this to any science fiction fan.
