 This novel reminded me when I was a child and the first time I ate an artichoke. I remember peeling back layers till I got to the middle and didn't find anything, but then realizing I was looking in the wrong place.  Each chapter reveals another aspect of the main character's personality.  Spider's character becomes more solid with each chapter. There's a lot of  meaning in the conclusion.  What the author is trying to say is difficult  to determine but what ever it is, it is certainly profound. I'm still  digesting this novel. It's the kind of book that keeps you thinking long  after having read it. Certainly one that will give you new insight the  second, third, etc., time you read it. Recommended.
