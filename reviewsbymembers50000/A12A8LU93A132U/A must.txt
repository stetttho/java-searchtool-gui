 A very well organized phrase book, which made everything very easy and quick to find. A proper amount of color to help organize phrases and sections without being overwhelming. Just the right amount of material was  presented unlike a lot of phrase books which try to give you every possible  situation, this one gave only what is most common. It also gave any major  difference in Spanish between various Latin American countries. Although  there is a phonetic guide, all the phrases are also given phonetically, for  the American English speaker, right below. I used this for a trip to Mexico  for 10 days and never ran into a situation this book couldn't help me with.  When I had trouble with my pronunciation, I could always point to the  phrase. The font was big enough to see it clearly without straining, but  small enough that that whole thing fit easily in my back pocket. A must  have for any trip to Latin America.
