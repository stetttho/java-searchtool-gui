 One the best SF books I have read recently. The characters are multi-dimensional and their motives change as circumstances change. Every character had an interesting personality. Most SF characters are very one  dimensional (ie. good guy, bad guy, greedy, altruistic, etc.) Well's  blended these and other traits to make very realistic characters. The plot  was interesting with a surprise twist ending that I liked a lot. The  theocracy was a bit too unrealistic for me but worked in the context of the  story. Finally the sex was not nearly as gratuitous as the author likes to  make it out to be. The sex scenes fit in very well with the story and  seemed appropriate.
