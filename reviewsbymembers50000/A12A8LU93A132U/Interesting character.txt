 The only issues I had with this book is that Weir uses quotes in the beginning to describe Liz's feelings, actions and what people thought of her, only to find out that it was actually said much later in her life.  This seems to be a little misleading as people change over the years. The  endless courtships does get tedious at times but other aspects of her life,  the political intrigue, more than makes up for it. Particularly interesting  is Weir's psychological theories on why Liz acted as she did. On a nitpick  issue, the paperback has an unusually thin cover that curled like crazy. I  recommend the hardcover version instead.
