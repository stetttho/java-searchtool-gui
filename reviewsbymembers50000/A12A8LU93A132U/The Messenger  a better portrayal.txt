 This TV mini-series makes a decent made for TV film. The performance from Sobieski and O'Toole are wonderful. Sobieski portrays Joan as a very heroic martyr. The visuals were good and the battles well choreographed. I'm still  amazed no horses were hurt. I gave this a low rating because the writers  were extremely loose with the accepted events in Joan's life. I could count  about half a dozen events that history has no record of or even hint at  that was included in this version. Although I have no problem with writers  inventing a childhood for Joan, not much was known, or speculate about her  motivations and thoughts, but putting in scenes during her last 2 years of  fairly well documented life was too much for my sensibilities.  Even the  very well documented trial I thought was poorly done with more poetic  license then I could accept.  People have criticized "The Messenger"  because it portrayed Joan more as a victim of her beliefs, this may or may  not have been the case, at least it remained truer to the accepted facts.  Overall, I feel that "The Messenger" with all it's drawbacks is a  much better portrayal of Joan then this film with all it's speculations.
