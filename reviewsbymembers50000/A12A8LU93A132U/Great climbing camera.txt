 I got this camera because it's the lightest and smallest camera I could find with a zoom; a key for a climbing camera. It does not seem as rugged as some APS cameras and it doesn't have splash proof. I'm a little worried  about dust and water but it's little size makes up for it. The zoom is an  improvement over my last APS camera because it helps enlarge the size of  the climbers on the rock. It fits in my shirt pocket with no problem and  seconds as a nice travel camera. It takes decent picture in comparison to  other APS cameras as well as all the other common features.
