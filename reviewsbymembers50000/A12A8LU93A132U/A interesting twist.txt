 A fairly standard James Bond type plot, a highjacked nuclear weapon, that is made interesting by the twist of having the Arnold action hero trying to maintain a suburban lifestyle. None of the action was particularly amazing,  you've probably seen such action before, but the whole premise of all this  stuff going on while trying to be a proto-typical suburbanite is hilarious.  Imagine James Bond with a wife, two kids, a SUV, saving the world, and you  get the picture.
