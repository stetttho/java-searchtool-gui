 First let me state I'm a huge James Bond fan, I've seen them all. I could go on for pages why I didn't like this film much, and the rating reflects that, but I'll just give a few comments on the DVD extras. First the  introduction is too obnoxious and there is no way to skip past it. The very  short, 15 minute, 'making of' feature was more like a 'E!' feature from TV  with some rather boring interviews with some of the cast and crew. The  'secrets' section was very interesting with storyboards combined with  unfinished scenes that showed what the shots looked like before final  production. The video by Garbage is very good too. It's a great song  although short. The music video isn't just cut scenes from the movie,  although it has them, but a whole little story in itself. Finally a big  oversight in my book is a lack of English subtitles, although French and  Spanish is included. Overall a good DVD production too bad the movie wasn't  as good.
