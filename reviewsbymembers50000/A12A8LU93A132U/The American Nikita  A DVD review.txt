 Being an American, I have to say I like this version of the French classic better. Most importantly, the American version has slightly better plot elements that make more sense. Maggie (Nikita) is also more vulgar which would suit an American teenager better. It is also more action packed and has some great performances. Other than some small changes and a major change in the finale, this version follows the French version right down to the dialogue. Not much in terms of extras, even the production notes are short. The video and sound are excellent. I like both versions of the film, French and American, for what they each bring to the story.
