 This DVD is a very good value. The new (2001) documentary is very good. It runs about 30 to 45 minutes with interviews with Eli Wallach, James Coburn, Robert Vaughn, Horst Buchholz, the producer and the asst. director. Very interesting insights into the competition between Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen and Buchholz are given. A commentary track featuring Coburn, Wallach, the producer and asst. director is included this gives even more insight into the people involved in the film however some of the comments are repeated from the documentary. The only downside to the DVD is that the picture hasn't been restored but it is adequate. The sound was a bit muted especially during dialogue. I had to have the sound turned way up. The soundtrack seemed to be fine. Overall this is a great value for the extras included.
