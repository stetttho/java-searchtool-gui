 The special edition DVD is simply a must have in anyone's collection. Three featurettes are included; one for the original version, one for the special edition and one for the Universal Studios 3D show. It would have been nice to see the whole 3D show, but I guess you have to go to Universal Studios to see it. A 50-chapter supplement composed of text notes inter-cut with interviews and special features. Design, pre-production, locations, training, weapons, sound, editing, publicity only touches the information given. You name it they covered it. I especially liked the sound chapter where they broke down the various sound elements so you can hear them isolated from each other. The audio commentary is very good coming from just about every cast and crew member involved. Subtitles are given so you know who is talking. Some of the material is reused though. For example, some of the audio commentary is from interviews used in the featurettes. Sixteen deleted scenes are added in the special version, 18 for the extended special version. To get the extended version enter the roman numbers seen to the right of the main menu; they look odd, but trust me they are roman numerals. I already had T2 on DVD, but the special edition, just for the delete scenes alone, makes it more than worth replacing it if you already have it. The extra scenes give extra depth to the story and the characters. Most bonus features become boring an initial viewing, but I think the ones on this DVD can easily be seen again and again. Overall, if you were stuck on a desert isle, this would be the DVD to have.
