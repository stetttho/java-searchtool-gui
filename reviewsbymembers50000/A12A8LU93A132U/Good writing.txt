 One of the better expedition books written. Blum just describes the major events and issues. She skips over minute stuff that a lot of other expedition books tend to bog down in. Chris Bonington comes to mind. Blum writes very well, unusual for a mountaineer, and kept me interested thorough out the book. I usually don't get sentimental, but even I felt a pull at the heartstrings. An interesting look at seventies women issues and its affect on mountaineering. An overall very good read.
