 I have the first version of GPS III and the new version has some very good  improvements. Most noticeably, an upgradeable map and waterproof case (mine  has neither). As a climber and backpacker, I haven't had much need for GPS.  A road map and road signs get me where I need to go. Once an unexpected  detour (car accident) made it nice to have so I could get around it on the  fly.  I have also used it for playing around trying to find  off-the-beaten-track short cuts. It would also come in handy for navigating  off the coast, marking dive sites and whatnot, but I have yet to use it in  that capacity. In the backcountry, I find a compass and topo much more  convenient. They are lighter and I don't have to worry about batteries. The  battery life is very short. Mine lasted about 8-9 hours. They claim 24-36h  on the new version. This in my opinion is still too short. It's definitely  a battery-eating monster at 4 AA batteries. I use mine mostly in the car.  You have to buy the car adapter separately. Even with improved accuracy,  with the US government turning off the built in error factor, I still find  GPS a toy. Unless you need to ocean navigate, are a traveling salesperson  or just want a cool toy, I'd save your money.  Otherwise, Garmin GPS III is  the top of the line GPS with great features if you need them.
