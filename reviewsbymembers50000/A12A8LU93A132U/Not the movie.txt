 I'll admit I got this because I love the movie and I guess I was expecting the book to be better, they are usually are. But they were so substantially different from each other which isn't necessarily a bad thing. I liked the differences, but the novel got a little weird toward the end with some  dream like sequences that I didn't understand and I usually don't care for  dream scenes. If you are expecting a more in-depth version of the film you  get a little of that, but they are so different that you may not like it.
