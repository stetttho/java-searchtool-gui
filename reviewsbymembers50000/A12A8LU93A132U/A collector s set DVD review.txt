 Another must to have in anyone's collection.  The commentaries for both films are very good. The makers of the film point out inside jokes and other aspects of the animation and story. The first documentary is very good. The second documentary isn't as good as it is almost a repeat of the first. The supplemental disc mainly was a lot of text information on every aspect of making both Toy Story and Toy Story 2.  Although this information is informative, it gets boring quickly in my opinion. The outtakes for the second film are very funny. Just like the animation characters were real actors on a set. The outtakes for the first film are mainly computer animation errors that aren't that interesting. I especially enjoyed the CBS Children's Hour spots that were included. I think over 50 10-15 second spots are included. Concept animation such as Tin Soldier, Luxo Jr. and some beta Toy Story animation are included too. Included in the supplemental disc are some deleted scenes that are mainly shorten scenes that are still in the original stories. Overall this set is worthy for just the stories alone. The extra features make this an essential DVD set.
