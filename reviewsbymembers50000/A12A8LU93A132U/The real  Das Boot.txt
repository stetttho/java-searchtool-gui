 The movie 'Das Boot' was based on a work of fiction. This book is the story of a real U-Boat commander and it will just blow you away. It's incredible the nerves of steel these guys had. All most every passage had me thinking, 'That is just unbelievable.' This book is a fascinating story of the life of a U-boat commander both on and off the boat. A very interesting views into the mentality of both the German military and people at the time. I can't recommend this book enough. A must for anyone interested in the time period or military history.
