 A book that role playing gamers will probably enjoy. Terms I hadn't heard  since I was 16 playing Dungeons and Dragons; hit points, lawful good, etc.  I was expecting a mystery/adventure plot, but got a fantasy adventure.  Because the main action takes place in virtual reality, I failed to see the  urgency of the characters situation. Couldn't they make their world  whatever they wanted? Unlike other VR novels where people could die if you  died in VR. Not the case here. The main characters spend there time killing  virtual dragons, trolls, loch ness monsters, evil elves and harpies. I  found all this very boring. I think only teenagers and preteens would enjoy  this book. Most adults I think would find it boring. Hence only a one star  for me.
