 I decided to buy this DVD after reading a few glowing reviews for the storyline. I loved the story lines of Star Blazers and Robotech as a child and still do as an adult. I was very disappointed with the storyline in this series. The story revolves around a 14-year-old reluctant hero who should be in therapy living with his twenty-something female commander with sexual overtones and a touch of Oedipus thrown in. This seems to cater to boys struggling with puberty. The hero also seems to struggle with a non-existent relationship with a self-centered father that creates a self-esteem problem. Hence the psychological aspect of the story. The bad guys are giant monsters called Angels that show up every few episodes with no agenda other than to stomp neo-Tokyo into the ground. This supplies the action. It reminded me of watching Godzilla films where Godzilla fought a new monster in every film. No one seems to be concerned with why the Angels are attacking. Possibly this is explained as the series goes on. Only children can run the biomechanical robots that have to be plugged in that fight the Angels. Why only children can run the robots isnt quite explained. The video and animation where adequate. I was very impressed with the sound. An episode where it was raining changed tone when the point-of-view changed from outside to inside. It really sounded like you were there. Not something I expected from animation. Overall, I was hoping to get hooked by an interesting storyline. These episodes didnt do it. After reading some of the synopsis of the other episodes I dont think Ill spend the money on the other DVDs unless I can check them out by renting them first.
