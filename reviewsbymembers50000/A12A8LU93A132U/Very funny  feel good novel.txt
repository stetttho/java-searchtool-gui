 After reading the first chapter I thought this was going to be a standard, serious adventure novel after a few more chapters I was laughing out loud. The world Burns creates is extremely interesting and funny in a 'Snow Crash' sort of way. All the characters are very bizarre and you just want to know more about them. You put together Jamal, a black, over weight, omnipotent agoraphobic computer whiz; his girlfriend Amber, an Asian tabooed nymphomaniac; Dan, the 'Virtual Weatherman' with a celebrity ex-wife from Hell and a butch lesbian, biker, producer; Martina, a Russian, amazon, one-woman-army, bodyguard guarding her boyfriend the head of the United Nations; Davsheed, a gay Pakistani-American `Media Artist' working for the UN and his Native-American UN security guard boyfriend; Jane the pilot/commander of a mission to Mars with a egotistical, back-stabbing second-in-command; Ray Sunshine a charismatic televangelist; throw in some nationalistic, multi-phobic white supremacists and you get one hell of a story.  If great characters isn't enough, put in a fun story where many of these characters try to get together to save an alien living on a Martian moon and you can't miss. Finally give the story a feel good message about love makes this even more enjoyable. For a funny, feel-good story with fantastic characters you must read this book.
