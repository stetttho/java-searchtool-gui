 A terrible plot but there are some really funny scenes and some great one-liners. A film you just can't take seriously. Ian Holm, most people will remember as the robot in Alien, has great comedic timing. Some very  good visuals as well. I keep this DVD in my collection for Holm's  performance as well as the visuals.
