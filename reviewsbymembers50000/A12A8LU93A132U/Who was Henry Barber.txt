 A decent biography of Barber although it was published when he was only  28. It's hard to imagine such a prolific climber fading away at such a  young age, you don't hear about him much now-a-days. This book isn't really  written in chronological order and each chapter really can almost stand  alone. Details his trips to Austraila and Germany the best. Gives insight  into the statement I hear often climbing, 'Oh, that's a Henry Barber  route,' which mean that it was probably hard. A must read for any Northeast  based climber.
