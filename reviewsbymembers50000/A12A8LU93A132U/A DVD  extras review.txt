 This film is not one of my favorite Mel Brooks films. I like his more goofy films such as Blazing Saddles and Spaceballs. I got this DVD for the extras. The documentary is very good with some very funny outtakes. There  are also some excellent deleted scenes too. A couple of scenes that are  rightfully cut such as the reading of the will that would have explained  the beginning better, but definitely dragged on. A shorten version of them  should have been left in. A whole series of scenes that made Gene Wilder's  and Terry Garr's 'intellectual discussions' a running gag that definitely  should have been left in, they are hilarious. The outtakes are okay, they  could have included more, and only about 10 minutes worth is included. The  documentary has more and you get the feeling that a whole film could be  made from just the outtakes. The commentary by Brooks in very good, he adds  bits about the scenes, actors and other trivia that is enlightening. He  isn't too verbose and he doesn't run out of things to say, both of which  are common in other commentaries. Production photos are also included which  I have never gotten much from. Finally, there are included two interviews  with a Mexican newscaster which I found a bit weird and had me wondering  what they were all about. A Mexican news team must have been visiting the  film site. They are amusing in their own right, but doesn't do much but  take up space. Overall, not as many extras as some Special Editions but  adequate. This DVD is not a must have in my collection, but if you love the  movie, a good DVD for fans.
