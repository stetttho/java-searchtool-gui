 This film is basically a cult classic. You either love it or hate it. The Director's cut isn't that substantially different from the theater release version. I didn't need the voice over but then again I saw the original  version and understood what was going on. This DVD would benefit by having  both versions available. The unicorn symbolism I didn't understand either.  This DVD is worth it only if you have seen it, like it and want it in DVD  format. Otherwise, I wouldn't bother. By the way, the movie is  substantially different from the book that it was based on which I didn't  particularly care for.
