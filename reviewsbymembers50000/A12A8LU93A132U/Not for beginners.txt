 As an intermediate student of yoga, I found the workouts on this DVD were extremely fast. A good workout for someone pressed for time. The lower body workout was mostly a standard yoga set that most beginning students learn, sun salutations etc. The other two sets had movements and positions that I've never seen before. I wouldn't recommend this to a beginner. The DVD only explains the basic positions with still pictures. The instructors don't really explain the poses well enough for a beginner. For an intermediate yoga student pressed for time, this makes an adequate DVD to have in your collection.
