 One of my favorite war movies, if you can call it that. Really a story of a bank heist during WWII. A fun comedy that may make light of the war especially when compared to the recent movie, `Saving Private Ryan'. However, if you view this keeping in mind that it's fiction, I think you can enjoy it. This movie sort of does for WWII what `Apocalypse Now' did for the Vietnam War. I can watch this one over and over just for the great one liners and odd situations.
