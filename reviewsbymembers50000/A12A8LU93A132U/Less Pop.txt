 I got this because I loved Red Hot + Rio and wanted to hear more of a similar style. I was a little disappointed because many of the songs are repeats from the Red hot + Rio CD. Hence, minus one star. The difference is  this CD is not as 'Pop'. I imagine the songs are performed in the original  versions. Still I like the music which was more easy listening which is  good as background music during a romantic dinner.
