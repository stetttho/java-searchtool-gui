 I got a set of 250's for me and a climbing partner after we had an  accident and couldn't hear each other at the belays. Now anytime we think  we might not hear each other, we carry them. They are very sturdy and I've  banged mine around a lot climbing. The extra weight is reasonable and the  bulk is minimal. Although the 280 is slightly smaller, the weight is just  about the same (heavier Ni/Cd battery). The extra money for the slightly  improved features isn't worth it. We thought the voice activation feature  would be handy during leading, asking for rope, slack and what-not, hands  free (important while climbing). However, we found that the delay in  activation sometimes cut whole sentences and unless you held the microphone  right to your mouth, it sometimes wouldn't activate at all. This kind of  defeated the purpose of the voice activation in the first place. So we just  use them at the belays when a free hand is available. They also came in  handy on a trip to Mexico where we didn't have access to our cell phone  service. Overall, a very useful climbing tool.
