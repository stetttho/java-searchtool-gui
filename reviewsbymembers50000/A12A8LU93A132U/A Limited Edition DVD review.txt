 A very good set of DVD's. I would have preferred a double-sided DVD instead of two. The audio commentary was okay, but I've heard better. I liked the Mystery Theater 3000 way they set up the audio commentary, where you can see an outline of the director and Jones as they point at the screen. They also have a graphic where they can write on the film much like Monday Night Football. The bonus features had some very interesting items that I never seen on any other DVD. Interactive items where you can re-edit 3 different scenes and another where you can breakdown the special effects to their various components, very unique and interesting. Another feature where the aliens morph from initial concept to final look was also very interesting. There were no deleted scenes although the director talks about some scenes that were changed to modify the plot. Some storyboards from never shot scenes are also included. Overall, I'd say if you like science fiction or this movie, this is a must have. Otherwise, I might pass it up.
