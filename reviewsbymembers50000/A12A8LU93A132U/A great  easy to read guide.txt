 As a novice diver, I found this guide amazingly easy to read. Sites are rated on a 5 star system for both diving and snorkeling separately. Information on approach and typical conditions are given. Typical things  that will be seen are also given. Icons for quick reference on each site  such as approach by boat or shore, skill level, and other information make  finding suitable dive sites a cinch.
