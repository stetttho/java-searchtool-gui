 Wow! What a set, innovative tri-fold box, interactive menus, biographies with voice narration and bonus episodes makes this a must have collection. Over 24 hours of English humor included with the four seasons of Blackadder plus a reunion episode. I especially liked the narration on various aspects of British history and culture. As an American, this helped to understand and enjoy the regional jokes better. The picture and sound were excellent although at times the canned laughter obscured the dialogue. This was mainly a problem in the first season. As can be expected, some seasons are better than others, but the high production standards of this collector's set makes this a incredible value.
