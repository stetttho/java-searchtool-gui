 I bought this DVD with the idea that since the soundtrack was redone, it was just going to blow me away, especially the Day-O scene. I agree with the Widescreen review of this DVD on the sound quality. I didn't find the  soundtrack that impressive unlike some others done in 5.1 format. The  picture quality, however, did make up for some of the soundtrack  disappointments.
