 As a chemist in the pharmaceutical field I found this an interesting read, however, even I had trouble with a lot of the biology presented.  A quarter of the book is taken up in a scientific mystery plot much like a Robin Cook novel, which are even given a short plug in the book. I found the characters interesting and their underlying psychology believable, however some of their actions in terms of their relationships with each other I found a little farfetched. The story has an antagonist that you just love to hate especially if you ever had to deal with office politics in a scientific laboratory. A very enjoyable read that kept the suspense going the whole way through the book, which made it hard to put down. I would classify this as a thinker's Sci-Fi, in that a reader has to keep most of their brain cells functioning to enjoy this book. Overall, I recommend this book as worth a read especially for a scientist or fan of hard science.
