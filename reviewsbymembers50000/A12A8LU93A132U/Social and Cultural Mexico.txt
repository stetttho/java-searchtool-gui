 I read this after reading the US State Travel Dept. Info Sheet which tends to be overly conservative and makes places sound like demilitarized zones. This guide put a little reality back into it. The author gives some  cultural tips mainly for the gringo (US citizen) to help mostly in social  situations. Especially useful, were the tips on how to recognize a good  Mexican restaurant, how to address people in social situations, and other  Mexicanisms such as various commonly used slang. The author also describes  regional differences and urban/rural differences you may come across. I  feel this is a good guide to get a feel for the people and the place  especially for the casual visitor going to the non-tourist areas of Mexico  so you don't act like such a gringo. Not really a book to keep as a  long-term reference to Mexico, I'd try to borrow it before buying it. The  author does give minor Mexican differences in pronouncing Spanish, but I  think he assumes most readers have a basis for Spanish, or will have a  phrase book for this.
