 I've read all of the books in Weir's series, except 'The Children of Henry the VIII, on the English monarchy and they are all excellent. This one is informative, however it did drag on at times. I think she spent a little too much time on each wife and by the 5th, I was wishing she'd just get on  with it.  Weir's approach is to look at the personalities of the  individuals involved and how that affected their actions and ultimately  history.
