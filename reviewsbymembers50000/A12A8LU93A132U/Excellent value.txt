 This is a very good DVD production of Speed Racer. The picture and sound are good as well as the added features. The commentary from two of the voice actors was very interesting in describing how Speed Racer was produced as well as how it differs from how cartoons are made today. One of the actors was also charged with `Americanizing' this Japanese cartoon and he gives insight into how he did this. Lots of extras such as bonus features that much more expensive DVDs have. Overall, a very good value.
