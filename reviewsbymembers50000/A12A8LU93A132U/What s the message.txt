 This story is told from the point of view of three characters; a police officer assigned to find a murderer, a friend of the murderer, and a therapist assigned to examine the murder. Another story line about a robot mission to a planet in another galaxy is thrown in. The stories are loosely connected but really go in different directions. It's really three short stories thrown together. The story about the police officer was the most interesting followed by the therapist's. The friend's story was the most boring. None of the stories really have much of a resolution. Overall, it seems Bear was trying to say something about the nature of sentiency. However, I wasn't able to determine exactly what he was trying to say about it. I can't recommend this book because the author's message seems to be lost and the stories are only moderately interesting in their own right.
