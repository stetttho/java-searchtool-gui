 This film is simply fun action that does not require thinking about reality; i.e. the characters can out run explosions. It has some really great one-liners that made the movie for me. Samuel Jackson, with most of  the one-liners, saves the day. Samuel Jackson plays a shady  detective/con-artist. He plays the part just like his character in  "Pulp Fiction", Jules. In fact you can imagine this is what  happens to Jules after he retires as a hit man. Some of Jackson's lines  seem just like what Jules in "Pulp Fiction" would say. Geena  Davis is mostly a prop in this movie, but does play well, at times, as  person tortured by a dual personality. This movie is much like Lethal  Weapon 1 and 2, which is not surprising as they all have the same writer. A  DVD with not a lot of extras that a keep in my collection when I feel like  watching some fun brainless action.
