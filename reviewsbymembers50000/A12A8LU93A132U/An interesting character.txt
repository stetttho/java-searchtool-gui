 This novel is an exhausting account of Burton's life.  An incredible man of his time who coined the term safari.  The first half drags a bit as it  details his early life in India, however, his descriptions of his travels  though Arabia and Africa more than make up for it.  The author tends to  have a favorable view toward Burton, a disfavored view toward his  distracters and Burton's wife.  Burton was a product of his times and  although he believed in a rigid social order concerning the races, that  would be considered racist today, he abhorred slavery.  He also talked  rather openly about sex in a time of strong Victorian morals that  suppressed open sexuality.
