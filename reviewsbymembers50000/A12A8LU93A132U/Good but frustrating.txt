 Much better than the first book. The author explains more that helps to explain what was going on in the first book. However, now I'm not sure what was going on in this book. Exactly what the Drapsk are looking for is  unclear and even they admit they don't know what it is. The M'hir and its  nature is still confusing even more so now. I suspect a trend where you  have to read the next book in the series to figure out what went on in the  previous one. Which I suppose is a good thing in a series, if not just a  bit frustrating.
