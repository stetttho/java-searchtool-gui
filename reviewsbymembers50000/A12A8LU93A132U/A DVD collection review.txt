 A slightly above average collection of DVDs. Both films come with a 50-minute documentary. Like the films they represent, the first is better than the second. The second documentary is almost a repeat of the first.  The Jurassic Park DVD comes with production photos, cast/crew biographies, storyboards, including a couple of scenes not shot and some handheld video of some production meetings, who cares? A small dinosaur section writes about the different dinosaurs featured, but it is the same in the Lost World even though they introduce new dinosaurs. I found this disappointing, but it's nothing that probably couldn't be found with a little research in the local library or Internet. Lost World comes with the above with two interesting unshot storyboard scenes with a different ending featuring flying dinosaurs.  Two deleted scenes are included with Lost World, one a boardroom scene were they vote to fire Hammond as CEO, rightfully cut and another which gives more background into the motivation of Roland the head hunter which I liked. The production photos are even more boring, here mainly showing Spielberg looking thorough cameras or talking to actors.  Finally a item they call a trailer for the planned third film is included. Calling this a trailer is ludicrous. It consists of dinosaur roars and a logo with is completely uninformative. Why they bothered to include it is beyond me. Overall I think this collection is a poor value. I think I'd just get the first film on DVD and not bother with the second.
