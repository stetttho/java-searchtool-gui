 I can't say much that hasn't already been said about the movie, so I'll just comment on the deleted scenes. Most deleted scene I've seen would have had very little impact on the story or the characters. Gattaca has some  deleted scenes that would have definitely changed the feel for some of the  characters. I think a scene with Alan Arkin should have been kept in the  original cut as well as one with the janitor.
