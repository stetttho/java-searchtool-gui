 This book is a very quick and enjoyable read. The only reason I even considered reading this book is because I'm going to Thailand for 3 weeks and a friend mentioned that the movie was filmed in the area we'll be staying. It was fun to read about some of the places we'll be. I got the feeling that the author was trying to write `Lord of the Flies' for the X-generation. The best way to describe the book is a cross between `Lord of the Flies', `Apocalypse Now' and every other Vietnam movie made. The author makes many references to Vietnam. I haven't seen the film yet, but I think this could make a better film script than a book. The first third of the book was very interesting as the author sets up the environment. The middle gets a little bogged down especially as the main character has weird conversations with his conscience in the form of another character that dies early in the book. I got the feeling that the author was trying to say something deep about human nature, society, etc, but it doesn't come across. The ending was very exciting and would make a good film ending, but in the book it wasn't a surprise. From about half way though the book I knew what was going to happen the only question was who was going to die and who wasn't. Overall, I only enjoyed the book because it's about an area that I'm going to visit. As a reader born one year before the author, I didn't find that he had anything profound to tell me about my generation although it certainly seems like he tried.  I would only recommend this to people either visiting or returning from Thailand it has very little to offer other than a decent story.
