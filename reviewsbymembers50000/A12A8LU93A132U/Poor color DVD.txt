 I saw this just once in an American theater when it was first released and the one thing I remember was the intense, bright colors and gorgeous  cinematography. The story and acting get five stars, but when I saw the  film on DVD it had me wondering, what happened to the color?  I remember  it as breathtaking and now it seemed dull and washed out. Hence, I give  this DVD an average rating. None-the-less, a wonderful story even if it is  heavily fictionalized.
