 I think this is mostly a guy film. I don't know very many women who care for it. None-the-less, I don't know a single guy who can't quote at least one line from this film. I got the DVD because this is one of my all time  favorites, however some bonus features would have been nice. Commentary on  this film would have been excellent and outtakes were probably hilarious.  If another version with these features came out, I'd definitely get it.
