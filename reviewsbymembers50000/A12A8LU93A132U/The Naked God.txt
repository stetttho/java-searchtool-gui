 This section of the series, "The Naked God", is probably the best in the series next to the first two sections. The action moves fast and furious. Although it did have a "poof" magical ending, I enjoyed reading it. This combined with the first two sections of the book would have made an excellent series. The middle sections definitely dragged the series out longer than it had to be. A series that I read a bit at a time. A good time killer, but not a series that I absolutely couldn't have done without.
