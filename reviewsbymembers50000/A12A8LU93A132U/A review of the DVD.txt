 First let me state I like the movie, but I wanted to comment on the DVD edition features. The video at times has dust floaters in it much as you would see in a theater. The sound was inconsistent at times with either too  loud music or too soft dialogue. The commentary was some one of the best  I've heard. Most directors run out of things to say during the film. Terry  is backed up with some of the actors and they all offer interesting tidbits  about the making of the film.
