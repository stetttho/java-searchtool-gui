 I loved this book!!  It is very inspirational and uplifting.  Megan took what could have been a great tragedy in her life and made along with her husband Mark, something beautiful out of it.  Her book really brings home  the point - life is what you make of it!!!!  A must read for anyone,  especially those stuck in a rut.  Megan will definitely inspire you to move  out of it and live your dreams - she did and is.  Great work - Megan!
