 I loved this book and promptly ordered all his other ones.  Whether you are atheist, agnostic, spirtual, etc. this book will open a window to your soul. I am a Chiropractor, a writer and lecturer on spiritual principles  and read over 120 books a year - I think Ken Gire is one of the best  writers I have ever read.  This morning I began his book The Reflective  Life - as I tore myself away from it to get ready for work - I reflected  again on what a great writer he is.  In Windows of the Soul he talks about  his "dark night of the soul" so to speak, in regard to his  passion for writing - thank God he stuck with it for spiritual writing is  truely his calling - His writing is profound, humble, simple and stirs the  heart.  Read this book - you won't be sorry.
