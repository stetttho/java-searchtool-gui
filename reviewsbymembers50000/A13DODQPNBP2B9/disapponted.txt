 I think Ms. Deason's previous video, Yoga conditioning for Weight Loss is a fantastic tape and so far, my favorite by far! So when I saw this one I ordered it immediately.  3 stars may not be fair at this point because this video had some more advanced postures than the previous one, I may enjoy it more at a later date.  However, in her previous tape she had 3 other women doing variations of the poses which is great.  In this video she has the variations at the end of the tape, which are not of much use while attempting the postures at the time.  All in all, I was disappointed in this video.
