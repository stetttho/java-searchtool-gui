 I've enjoyed all of michael connelly's books, especially the Bosch books and I thought the Poet was fantastic.  While I enjoyed reading this book, I too agree, that this is by far not his best book.  However, evidenced by this one, even a bad Connelly book is better than most of the thriller fare.
