 I haven't been excited about George's last few books -- I truly missed the Havers/Lynley dynamic.  I agree with "Melissa's" 6/16/05 review SPOILER ALERT.............  Can't be too bad since so many already gave it away, but I too don't understand the disatisfaction with this particular character being killed off, well other than for the obvious reasons, being a heartbreaking tragedy for lynley, but as to the particular character - I have never cared for either her or Deborah and feel that they are both to fairly vapid females.  I've always thought that the strength of the books lied in the convuluted relationship of havers and lynley.  When reviewers went on about how they were wondering about helen's future, I thought, this isn't a romance novel!  Anyway, I'm happy to see that George has returned to her previous characters -- bravo! great book.
