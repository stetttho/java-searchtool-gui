 I have a bad habit of reading reviews even while reading the book, which I did with this one when I was about 1/3 through.  After reading many reviews about the end of the book I thought of skipping to that and am so glad that I didn't do that.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book and I felt that the ending really fit the story.  This book was well-written and thought-provoking.
