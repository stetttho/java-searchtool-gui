 I absolutely love the Mathew Scudder character.  I have read all the books in the series and find it to be one of the best.  I tend to like mysteries that have great character development and insights about life, human nature, etc.  This is one of the only series that I have read in this genre that I actually highlight great passages in every book.  I love how Block intersperses Scudder's AA meetings and his struggles with his addiction with the plot of the story.  Scudder is not as edgy and certainly more respectable than he used to be, but I still enjoy his story. I found this to be a really good book. The best scudder book, in my opinion is Eight Million Ways to Die.
