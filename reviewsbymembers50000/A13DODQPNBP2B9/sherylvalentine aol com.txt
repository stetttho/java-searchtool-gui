 This is a fantastic book!  I read A LOT of books, and Boundaries is one of the best I've ever read!  As a doctor of chiropractic and student/teacher of spirituality I have recommended this book to many people.  It covers all aspects of setting boundaries which in integral to our spiritual maturity. After reading the first 3 chapters I ordered all of their books! do yourself a favor and buy this book.  I didn't think I had any boundary issues when I started the book, lo and behold, I had a few! LOL!  This book has been helpful to my family, myself and my patients. Sheryl
