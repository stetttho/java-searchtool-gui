 Finally! A book on politics, by a Christian no less, that reflects my own views.  I'm so tired of reading that "liberals" are anti-God, anti-humanity, etc.  Most of the "liberals" I know are more involved with the world around them and the plight of people other than themselves.  The religious right is based on hate and fear and it is *finally* so refreshing to read a book that expresses what Jesus *really* taught in the new testament -- that is -- love one another -- *not* hate and fear all people unlike yourself.
