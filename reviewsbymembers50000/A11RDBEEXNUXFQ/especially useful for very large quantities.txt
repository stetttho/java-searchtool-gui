 In combination with the food grinding attachment, this accessory for the Kitchen Aid mixer makes short work of any sausage making task you set before it. I've helped friends cook feasts for 200+ people with this attachment and everyone eating was stunned at the short amount of time it took us to make their fresh, homemade sausage.  This attachment beats a hand-crank grinder and extruder easily. And because it attaches to the mixer itself, I've found it far more stable and easy to access than the grinder-extruder combinations that mount to the countertop. With precious little in terms of countertop space, the mixer takes up more room, but the ease of use more than makes up for that. In combination with the food grinder, I can process an entire deer's worth of meat in an evening with this attachment. Meat sausage isn't the only thing you can process with this fine attachment. Fruit sausages work equally well and the opening in the extruder is wide enough even for larger items. For the more creative among us, you can use the extruder to fill things like balloons and other awkward items much more easily than with a funnel and an extra pair of hands. You'd be surprised at exactly how many things you'll find you can use this attachment for. The cleanup of this attachment is a breeze. Nothing sticks to the plastic and soapy hot water makes short work of a dishwashing task that would otherwise be onerous on the hand-crank machines. Better yet, throw it in the dishwasher. For the work I've put mine through, this attachment paid for itself based on ease of use alone before I was done with my first batch of sausage.
