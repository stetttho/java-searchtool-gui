 While the first portion of this book details Milham's review and history of extant manuscripts of "De honesta voluptua" (On Right  Pleasure...), I believe the true value for me lies in the second portion  which comprises better than 3/4ths of the entire work. Milham's side by  side copies of the original text and her translation are the true meat of  the book. For the entire work, the scholarship is exacting, the notes  copious, and the bibliography extremely complete. Well worth the price for  the serious recreationist-collector (especially members of the SCA).
