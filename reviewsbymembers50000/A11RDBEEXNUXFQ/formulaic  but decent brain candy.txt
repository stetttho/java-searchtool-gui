 Janet Evanovich's ONE FOR THE MONEY seemed rather formulaic in its approach to mystery novels. None of the characters seemed to really grab me and keep me intersted for very long, the story was rather unimaginative, and the plot not so much contrived as...well, unintersting to me. Janet Evanovich seems like a fine writer and her books are good brain candy, well worth taking into the tub with you or falling asleep to before you go to bed. But in all honesty, I'm quite surprised this book was recommended to me. There didn't seem to be much that differentiated the story or the characters. Nothing seemed "fresh" in the same way that, say Nevada Barr did with "A Superior Death" or Laurell K. Hamilton has in the fantasy-mystery cross-overs with her Anita Blake novels.  It could just be that bail bonds are not my thing. But I suspect that it's a dependence on a formula that just doesn't work for Evanovich. I'll read more of her novels if they pass my way, but in all honesty, I'm not going out of my way to buy copies of the books in this series. And the ones I have so far, well, they'll go to the used book store along with the brain candy romance novels.
