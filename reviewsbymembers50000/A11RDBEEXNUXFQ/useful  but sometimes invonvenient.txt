 The pouring shield is a definite convenience on my mixer, making it easy to add both wet and dry ingredients without stopping the mixing process and raising the beater, whisk, or dough hook. It removes extremely easily from the bowl once you figure the trick of getting it on an off, and it cleans quickly with a swipe of hot, soapy water or a run through the dishwasher, much like all Kitchen Aid mixer attachments. I'm a little torn on the rating. I'd like to give it four stars, but I've only given the shield three stars because of a few inconveniences listed below. I'm happy it came free of charge with my mixer and I would probably buy another if mine ever became damaged. For someone without the pouring shield, I would certainly recommend they consider buying it, but with the following things kept in mind... I've found that when making anything, be it bread or cookies or whathaveyou, you really should consider adding absolutely no more than 1/2 cup (dry US measure) of ingredients at a time to the bowl. Best if you add less to the bowl a few more times. Every time I've made bread, if I try adding 1/2 cup flour or more during the last mixing stage, even the low speed of 2 results in ingredients splattered up onto and under the pouring shield.  In addition, the convenient separability of the pouring shield can fast become an inconvenience if you're not careful. If anything splashes, I've found that it splashes right into the little hinges that make the pouring shield separateable from itself. Once your ingredients are in the hinges, they're down the side of the bowl, onto your countertop, and probably onto you.
