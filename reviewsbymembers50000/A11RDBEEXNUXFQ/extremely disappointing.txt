 Rice cookers must follow the same "money factor" rules that telephones do. To a certain point, the more money you pay for a telephone, the better quality you get. I think the same holds true for rice cookers.  The Aroma ARC720G 10-cup rice cooker was on the low end of the price point scale, and it showed in the completely inadequate operation of the unit. Perhaps if I had aimed for a higher-priced model I would have had more luck. I wanted the 10-cup capacity and was happy this unit had such as a feature. Unfortunately the unit didn't work. Ever. The rice burned each and every time I used it. At first I thought it was me using the unit improperly, so I tried each suggestion by the manufacturer (rice rinsing, oiling the pan, preheating the rice, whathaveyou) and not a single one of them worked. Then I thought the unit was defective so I returned it to the store and got another one. Same problem. I repeated this again with no luck and that that point I decided that the unit was simply poorly designed and poorly constructed. If you want to steam vegetables and custard, fine, but maybe you'd be better off with a vegetable steamer designed specifically for that purpose. They're about the same price  or cheaper, but at least the cheaper ones  won't set off the smoke detectors in your house like this unit does during "normal operation." In general, this is a poor product, with crummy operation. I think you would be better off saving some money by buying a more expensive unit. You'll end up paying more for this unit in gas hauling it back to the store like I did.
