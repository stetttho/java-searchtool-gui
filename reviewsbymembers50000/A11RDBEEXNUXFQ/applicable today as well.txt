 It is a wonder to me that more people have not discovered translations such as this one, Vegetius's seminal work "Epitome of Military Science". Compare Vegetius to such works as the Sun Tzu's "Art of  War", but put it in the perspective of Ancient Rome and you'll be spot  on. I liked this work because it gave an excellent insight into all  aspects of managing military groups. It covered not only things such as  troup placement and tactics, but also much baser aspects of military life,  such as the logistics of training, what or how to feed large numbers of  troops, and how to deal with troop morale. For the historian (and members  of re-enactment groups similar to the SCA) this is an excellent book for  research if you're willing to ignore the fact that the text is only the  English translation and not a side-by-side comparison of the original and  the modern.
