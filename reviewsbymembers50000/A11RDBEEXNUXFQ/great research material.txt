 I am somewhat at a loss as to why this book, Code of the Samurai, fascinates me. I liked it enough that I bought a copy for my husband and would consider giving it as a gift to several friends who have interests in  "courtly behavior," "chivalry," and  "medieval" Japanese history in general (all are members of the  Society for Creative Anachronism, like I am). I have never made it  through an entire reading of The Art of War and quite frankly The Book of  Five Rings was no better as a shortened form thereof. Code of the Samurai  is really neither of these books and shares little more than a common Asian  ancestry. Instead, it reads rather like one of the pre-1600s Western  culture books of proper behavior (for members of  recreation organizations,  think books like The Babees Book and the Book of Courtesey). Instead of  Western Europe, however, this one is set in Tokugawa-era Japan (if I am  remembering my history correctly). The book very clearly addresses the  actual life of a samurai. Thankfully, the book does not heavily focus on  the martial aspects of the samurai's life (though these are touched upon)  nor the esoteric, philosophical ideals that might be expected of a book on  "Bushido." Instead, the examples of this book simply show you the  proper and improper behavior of samurai in a variety of situations as they  were viewed in classical Japan.  Unfortunately, I cannot speak for the  accuracy of the translation because this book includes only the modern  English (and I don't read classical or modern Japanese). The text as a  whole, despite the lack of original manuscript versions, is rendered in an  easy-to-follow style that you can read straight through or only a chapter  at a time, at your leisure.
