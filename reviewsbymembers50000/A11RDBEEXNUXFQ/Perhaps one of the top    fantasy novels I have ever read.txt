 In BLUE MOON RISING, Simon Green masterfully challenges the stereotypes we see in so many fantasy novels, deftly weaving a story that is engaging and action packed without leaving the reader wondering why they bothered. Very  little in this book happens as it should in what might be called a  traditional fantasy novel. Still, Green weaves his tale so well that the  reader is certain the story could not happen any other way. Unfair things  happen to the hero, good things happen to the bad guy, and creatures  usually found as good or bad in other fantasy worlds are really neither in  Green's world. While BLUE MOON RISING simply cannot be classed with high  fantasy novels such as those written by Tolkein, Jordan, Eddings, or  perhaps Goodkind, I believe that if you appreciate these authors or solid  fantasy authors like Elizabeth Moon (who wrote the Paksenarrion trilogy),  you will enjoy this book.
