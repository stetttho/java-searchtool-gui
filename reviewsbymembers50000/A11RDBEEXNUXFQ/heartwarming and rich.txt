 A friend of mine introduced me to this movie and I'm glad she did. I'm not the kind of person who normally watches sappy movies when anyone has a chance of seeing me watch them. I am, however, a closet romantic and I must say I happily watched ANNABELLE'S WISH and unashamedly sniffled with tears in my eyes towards the end.  I think this movie ranks up with some of my all time holiday favorites like "The Year Without a Santa Clause," "The Grinch Who Stole Christmas," and "Small One". In terms of length, it's a little short, certainly designed so for the younger audiences it will attract, but it's the kind of movie you'll pull out of the cabinet time and again during the holiday season simply because it will make you feel good to watch it. Cocoa or warm cider, a blanket, and a few children watching will make your viewing time that much better.
