 This is the first video game I've played with no violence. It even encourages and insists on making sure you are loving to your animals! You play a farmer and keep busy raising crops (different kinds in different seasons), taking care of your animals, attending festivals, and more. You decide how much work you do, I recently had to cut down for myself, I was too busy! This game is addictive, but I did get to a point where I wondered if I had any more goals to strive for, because after awhile feeding and brushing your animals day after day gets mundane. Then I realized I could have a carpenter add on to my house, so I am busy collecting lumber every day. Your farmer can get too tired and even get sick so be careful how much work you do. This game would be very appropriate for children as it teaches responsibility and lets them choose what they want to accomplish, and everyone in the game is nice to you! Good for adults too of course. A peaceful change from high-strung action games.
