 A girl named Janie goes to visit her great aunt Cissie in her big old house, and notices right away that Aunt Cissie is not her usual, cheerful self. Instead she is nervous and gloomy, and it's not long that Janie discovers that Aunt Cissie has been getting threating notes in the mail, like "I AM WATCHING YOU". More harrasments follow, like a break-in  and frequent phone calls. Janie and her aunt wonder about all possible people who could be doing this and Janie helps solve the mystery.  This is a mellow mystery, not really violent at all. I think it is written for children grades 3-6. I was expecting a teen novel when I bought it since I have enjoyed 2 of Carol Beach York's novels for teens.
