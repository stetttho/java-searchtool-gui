 Here is another Kenny Loggins album with many great songs. Did I mention Kenny is my favorite singer? He has so many catchy songs with great messages. On this album, I love "The Art of Letting Go" the most, for the music and the words! I also am  quite fond of "I am not Hiding", "All I Ask", and "Now that I know Love". A very soulful album. Check it out!
