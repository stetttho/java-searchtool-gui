 This is one of my all time favorite movies. It is so uplifting and entertaining. Sarah, the main character starts out the movie living in exotic India with her father. He ends up needing to go to war, so sends Sarah to a boarding school in New York. He tells her she is a little princess, that all girls are. I won't spoil the  great plot for you by giving anymore details to the story, but I will say that I was touched and uplifted by Sarah's great level of character. She is very generous, talented, thoughtful, and she can believe she will be alright, even in cruel circumstances, and she is more than alright! There is a perfect ending to this perfect movie. I would give it more than 5 stars if I could.
