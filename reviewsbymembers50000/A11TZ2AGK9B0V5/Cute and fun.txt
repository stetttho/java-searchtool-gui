 When I first saw my son playing Paper Mario I thought it looked too cutesie for me, but I decided to try it and loved it! I have played it all the way through several times and I am 30 years old, so I would say this game could be enjoyed by any age old enough to read. You play Mario and go around in different areas fighting monsters in different ways, and you gain fighting methods and levels as you go. You also gain new friends that join your team and fight with you, who have different skills. It is fun to decide who to use for which battle according to their skills. You gain star points with each fight (after you reach certain levels this no longer happens with lower monsters, bummer) and then every 100 star points you can level up your hit points, flower points (lets you use special skills) and badge points, which lets you have extra details to your character, and I constantly swapped bagdes around to be ready for certain situations. Basically Mario is trying to save Princess Peach from Bowser, but there are many side adventures that are fun too, like delivering mail, finding star pieces, having Tast. E cook interesting recipies for you, going gambling and favors for Koopa Koot. If you are looking for a game that will keep you entertained, I recommend this one! By the way, there are save files so you don't need a memory card, and you have to save at specific spots in the game.
