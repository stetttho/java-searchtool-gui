 This is the first Vernon Howard book I read and as I was first glancing at it at the store I realized it had answers I had been looking for for a long time and I just had to buy it. The book contains short, paragraph - long stories that illustrate a point of wisdom. As one story points out - "If we could only see it, we are at the mercy of absolutely nothing except our own wrong thinking." Vernon Howard's teachings are mainly about how we are not our thoughts, we are something beyond that and we can experience this through study and practice. As far as this book goes it gives many new ways to look at things and experience life. If you are interested in trying out Vernon Howard I recommend this book or "The Power of your Supermind" as a first read.
