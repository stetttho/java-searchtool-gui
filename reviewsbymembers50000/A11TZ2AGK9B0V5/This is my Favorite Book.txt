 Ira Levin, please write more books like this one! I was deeply affected the first time I read it and am every time I reread it - I will be rereading it for the rest of my life. This book takes place in a futuristic society that I found compelling - "fight" and "hate" are bad words, because the whole earth is at peace - no wars, no hunger, no big decisions, no illness, no pollution, no lonliness... everyone is your friend, sounds ideal, I wouldn't mind living like that for awhile!  The story reads so easily. I loved reading all about the world the main character, Chip, lives in. Everyone's career is chosen for him by the computer running the world, Unicomp (Uni for short). Everyone must report to an advisor on a regular basis, who makes sure everything is alright. Everyone has a "nameber", a name with a number. Chip's is Li with a bunch of numbers. There are only 4 male names, Li, Jesus, Karl and Bob. Only 4 names for females too - Anna, Peace, Mary and Yin. Everyone wears a bracelet with their nameber and must scan at scanners wherever they go. Everyone must report for chemical treatments once a month. Chip's world is far from perfect, though. It is "sick" to like one member (everyone is a member of The Family) more than another, to think about what work you would like to do, to draw pictures of people without bracelets, and doing such things and more will cause a member to be tracked down and recieve a stronger treatment.  Chip becomes aware that his world isn't that perfect and that he has lost a lot of freedom. The plot thickens as he recieves secret notes from other "sick" members who invite him to meet him secretly in the night.  I won't say more except the story and characters are very gripping, all the way to the end... do yourself a favor and read this book, it is a masterpiece.  One final note, why isn't this book in print? And I would love to see a movie!
