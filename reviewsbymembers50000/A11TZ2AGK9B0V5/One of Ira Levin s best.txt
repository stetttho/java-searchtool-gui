 Ira Levin is my all time favorite author and he has written some incredible books. I feel this one is one of his best (second only to This Perfect Day, my all time favorite book)  The Stepford Wives is short and incredibly easy to read, with such an original chilling idea that has become a cult classic, had two movies made out of it (the first one is pretty close to the original story, the second one is pretty far off but worth watching because it is funny).   The book starts off intriguing right at the beginning. The Eberhart family has just moved to Stepford and Joanna Eberhart, a budding photographer, wife and mother, is looking to meet new friends. She is suprised to find that many of the women she meets are dull and all they want to do all day is cook and clean. Suspense builds well in this story as clues show up to why women are so odd in Stepford, and what is really going on at the men's association, a big mansion with a club for men only. Things really get chilling when Joanna's friend Bobbie who is a normal, messy woman with a personality goes away on a weekend with her husband and returns as a woman who loves cleaning all day. I won't say more but do read the book!
