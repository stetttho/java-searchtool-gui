 Ever wonder what it would be like to go back to high school as an adult? That is what Jon Cryer's (also in Pretty in Pink, great movie) character has to do to hide out from some people who are trying to kill him. He changes from a bearded broker in the big city to a clean shaven, t-shirt wearing "kid" in a different town, staying with his cousin and even fooling his aunt (she doesn't know it's him!) There is a nice mix of comedy, romance, and action in this movie.
