 Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore star in this movie as a couple who are very happy with their life and have just moved into a new apartment. Patrick's character is killed early in the movie - but that isn't the last you see of him! He is the ghost the movie is named after. He tries to find out who killed him and then realizes his girlfriend is in great danger. She doesn't believe in the afterlife, so when Patrick recruits a spiritual medium played by Whoopi Goldberg to convince her to listen, it takes some doing. It also takes some doing to keep Whoopi involved, which makes for a funny yet suspenseful movie as the danger of the bad guy gets worse.
