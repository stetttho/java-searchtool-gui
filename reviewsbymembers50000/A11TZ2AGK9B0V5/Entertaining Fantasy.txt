 I checked this book out at the library, intrigued by the cover and the first page was readable. I was so glad I took it home because it was a very good story. The story is told from the point of view of Jereth, a former priest. He runs into Hwyn, a mishapen woman and Trenara, a beautiful woman. They all end up on a quest together to take the Eye of Night where it wants to go, and come across many adventures on the way. There is a little mystery to the story that kept it even more intriguing. Their homeland is interesting and I was amused with the map at the beginning of the book that showed all the directions, North, South, East, and West in the wrong places. They were travelling what would be considered South to us, but they called it North. I can't handle many fantasy books, but this one is very readable. I highly recommend it!
