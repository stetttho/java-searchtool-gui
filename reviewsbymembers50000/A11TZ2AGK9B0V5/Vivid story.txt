 I was attracted to this novel because it takes place in the state I live in, Washington. I was immediately pleased because the story was intriging, a retired surgeon finds out he has cancer and decides to set out on a hunting trip in which he plans to commit suicide, and the story of his life in the present and then his flashbacks to his younger days were well detailed, I felt I was really getting to know the character and I enjoyed rich history of Washington orchards brought out as well.
