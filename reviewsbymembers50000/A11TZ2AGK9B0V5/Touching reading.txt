 I was very touched by the story of the Elephant man, who was very deformed and endured many hardships in his childhood and young adult life because of his appearance. His life becomes bearable though in his end years thanks to the kindness of Dr. Fredrick Treves and many other people. If you haven't heard of or read about the Elephant man yet, I recommend this book, Joseph Merrick's story (the Elephant man) is something you won't forget. The terrors he went through and then how incredibly grateful he was for the simplest pleasures after being rescued by Dr. Treves make me see life through new eyes: it is hard to take things for granted. The book also includes photographs of Joseph.
