 I enjoyed the photos he included of cockatiels in the wild and what their habitat looks like. I have not found this in other cockatiel books. He was informative on how to care for a pet cockatiel and I appreciated that he mainly talked about a seed diet, instead of a pellet diet. I think seeds are the natural diet for cockatiels, not man made pellets!
