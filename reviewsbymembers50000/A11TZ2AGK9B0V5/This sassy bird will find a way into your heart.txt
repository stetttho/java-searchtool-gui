 When I first set down to watch this movie I wasn't sure it would be up my alley, I don't usually like animal stories where you hear the animals talking because, well, it is so [unrealistic]. But you know, parrots really CAN talk, which helped this movie have a great realistic feel to it, even though Paulie turned out to be much more, well, expressive than the average parrot! He is a sassy yet charming bird with an attitude that will have you in side splitting laughter! His story starts out with him living in a dark dreary basement in a cage by himself, and he is discovered by a man who wants to know his story. Paulie won't talk at first, but eventually tells the story of his life, from when he lived happily with his child friend Marie, and how he was taken away from her and then proceeded to try and find her and ended up with different people and adventures. "Paulie" is entertaining throughout with a very nice ending. I bought this movie for my collection since is such a nice family movie.
