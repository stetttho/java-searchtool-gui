 I decided to buy this book so I could have a cockatiel book of my own and to  read something new, and I am glad I did! This book has many unique photos of cockatiels that I haven't seen in other books. Such as a couple of close up shots of a cockatiel in midflight, a cockatiel hanging upside down on a perch, and two pictures of flocks of cockatiels in Australia. Then there are also beautiful pencil drawings throughout the book also. The reading was fresh and interesting too, with facts I haven't found in other books, for example, why cockatiels yawn a lot, the sensory capabilities of cockatiels, what their life is like in the wild (I have been waiting for a book to mention this!) and how to make a play tree for your cockatiel(s). I think this little book has a lot to offer and I highly recommend it to cockatiel fans!
