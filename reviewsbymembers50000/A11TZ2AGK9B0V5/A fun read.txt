 I saw this book at a bookstore and decided to buy it because I loved the cover! I had no idea if I would like it and I do not read Science Fiction regularily even though I love Star Trek. I am so glad I bought it though and I plan to get more of Jeffery Carver's Star Rigger books.  To me, reading this book was an experience like playing an old role playing game called Traveller, meaning it was a fun and exciting adventure in future time in outer space. The book starts out with a rigger (starship pilot) named Renwald Legroeder who is being framed for a crime he did not commit, which involves a mysterious starship that has been missing for 100 years, and space pirates. Legroeder is a human being and there are many humans living on a far away planet named Faber Erdrani (Sp?). There are native people there too and a neat race called the Narseil that the reader gets to know well in the story. Legroeder finds himself in jail waiting for a trial and then suddenly gets released by a lawyer named Harriet Mahoney that wants to help him. From there on the story is an exciting adventure and mystery   with Legroeder needing to find out more about the missing starship Impris to clear his name. This book is very readable, I highly recommend it! I found myself sad when I was done reading, because it was so good and I loved the characters.
