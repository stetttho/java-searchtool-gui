 This is a game you could fall in love with. When I first played it (immediatly after it came out) I was so engrossed and enchanted with it that it was like the real world disappeared and there was just me and the game. This never happened with me with a video game before. The scenery is breathtaking and some of the music scores are beautiful, although I think the music in the first forest dungeon as an adult is absolutely creepy! The dungeons are puzzling at times but not too hard, and the bosses are challenging enough you may have to try them several times, but don't worry you can eventually beat them. The game has a built in save feature so you don't need a memory card and you can save anywhere in the game, don't have to wait for any specific save point, that is real nice. You start out as a 10 year old boy and then after 3 levels you travel through time and become an adult. Hyrule has changed and you need to save the land. You go through many levels and bosses to finally get to Gannon, the ultimate evil here. He is an improvement on the previous Gannon of previous Zelda games(looked like a little pig then!) and fighting him is more challenging and engrossing in this new game. There are other little side adventures thoughout the game to entertain you when you want a break from dungeons and monsters. This is a high quality game fun for kids and adults.
