 If you are like me, open minded to the idea that reincarnation is real but had no real proof, read this book. Shanti Devi was a girl that could remember her past life in full detail like it was yesterday, at the young age of 4. The book tell of how she eventually meets the husband she was married to, and other family members, and is tested to make sure she really was who she says she was. She went back to her last home and knew the whole layout and where she had hidden some money. I was convinced that at least one person has reincarnated after reading this book. Has some interesting information at the end about what Shanti Devi feels she has learned about life and also some quotes in the Bible refering to reincarnation.
