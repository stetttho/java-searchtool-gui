 This game starts out fairly easy and then gets harder- you get a certain amount of continues if all your Trolls die, but then all your progress is gone when the continues are used up. There is no save feature on this game so I have been to the very end only twice and it took time and patience. I would enjoy the game more if I could save my progress and start where I left off. You pick your troll, (each having a special feature, you want to save the swimming troll for swimming levels) and then in each level you run around collecting things, but mainly coloring the area just by walking on it and especially walking all the way around framed areas, the level will not clear until you do this. Beware of dangers like spikes that pop up, deadly colordrops and enemies. You can throw pies (if you have some) at enemies and then eat them, thus getting rid of them. There are many many levels and the theme changes, it is interesting to see the new "worlds".
