 This book is chock full of imagination! It starts out with a timid boy named Bastian stealing a book from a bookstore and hiding away in the school attic to read it- "The Neverending Story". He is swept away into an enchanting world called Fantastica (Yes, it was Fantasia in the movie) following Atreyu to try save Fantastica from The Nothing. Bastian soon finds out this mysterious book includes him in the story! If you are familiar with the movie, this book starts out like it, but has so much more detail included, and the story goes on much longer where the movie ended. In the book, Bastian does not go back home to make wishes in his own world, instead he stays in Fantastica and makes wishes there. I could not get over how original each little idea the author had to include in the story. This book is a good fantasy for children and adults alike.
