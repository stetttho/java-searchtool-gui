 This was a great movie - I loved the plot - they needed a humpback whale to communicate with a probe but the humpbacks are extinct in Kirk and Spock's time so they time travel to the 1980's to get some whales! I love seeing the whole crew of the Enterprise wandering around San Fransisco in the 80's - the makers of this movie came up with some great lines and scenes! It is a challenge to get a couple of whales beamed up to the Enterprise properly! I can't stress enough how well they put this movie together. I think anyone would enjoy this, not just Star Trek fans. When I first saw it I wasn't a fan yet and was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it.
