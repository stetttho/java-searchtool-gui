 This album has the best Kenny Loggins song I have ever heard - "If you Believe".  I bought the album because I heard the song on the radio and already knew I loved it. It turns out the rest of the album is good to listen to also. Anyway, "If you Believe" is one of the catchiest songs I have ever heard and has such a powerful message. "If you believe in me, I will believe in what will be. We want the world you've only dreamed of, the promise of our seasons, give us the future please, that's all really need of you."
