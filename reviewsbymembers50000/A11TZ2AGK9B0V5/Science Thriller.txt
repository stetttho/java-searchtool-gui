 This is a thrilling novel about some scientists in Africa that are using cloning to create subhuman monkeys using bonobos so that their body parts can harvested for the specific human who is matched with the animal, and about a  medical examiner named Jack Stapleton who discovers at the morgue in New York City while working that something strange is going on. He notices during an autopsy that a man had had a liver transplant but for some reason he has trouble finding out where and when and also the man didn't need anti - immunity drugs, in other words the body did not try to reject the liver. Jack digs deep to find the answer and the two plots finally connect. I really liked Jack Stapleton's character, and his co - worker, Laurie Montgomery, and enjoyed them in Contagion and Vector also. I felt I was educated as I read the book, it was very well detailed with scientific and medical information, but not boring, book keeps a good pace. An exciting read.
