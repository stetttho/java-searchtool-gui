 An endearing book about a little bunny that wants to run away, and the mother bunny who wants to run after him, "for you are my little bunny". A sweet tale of a mother's love and a bunny's imagination. When the bunny imagines he becomes a fish to swim away from her, she imagines she will become a fisherman and fish for him. Each idea the bunny comes up with, the mother knows what to become to make sure she gets her bunny back! The story has both black and white illustrations (where the bunnies are talking) and then a 2 page color illustration with each instance of mother getting her bunny in their imagination, such as a delightful picture of Mother bunny in a river with fishing boots; holding a line with a carrot on it to catch little bunny.  This is a wonderful, loving book to read to your child(ren).
