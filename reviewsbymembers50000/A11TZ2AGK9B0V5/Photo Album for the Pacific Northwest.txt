 I bought this book because I live in the Pacific Northwest and I wanted a memento of my area in case I ever move away. There are excellent large photos of areas I have seen with my own eyes, such as Portland Oregon with Mt Hood in the background, the Japanese Gardens in Portland, Oregon beaches, Multnomah Falls and Vista House's view, both along the Columbia River Gorge, an inside picture of Timberline Lodge, Stonehenge, which is a 10 minute drive from my home, the Riverfront park in Spokane and the HUGE Radio Flyer wagon slide that is there, Mt Saint Helens, to name a few. Also there are pictures of places I haven't seen yet that I would like to see, in California, and Vancouver BC and Oregon's Crater Lake that is on the cover as well as in the book. Includes some history and historical photos in the beginning of the book. If you don't live in this area this book may inspire you to visit.
