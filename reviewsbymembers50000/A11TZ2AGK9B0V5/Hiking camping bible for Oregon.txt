 A must have if you live in or close enough (like me) to Oregon to camp there, and you insist that your campground has a hiking trail, like I do! I found a wealth of information on where to camp and hike in my neighboring state, and even though I haven't had time to go camping yet, I have used this to find hiking trails to explore. Many nice, enticing photos throughout the book, and decriptions of the wildlife and scenery at the campgrounds and hikes, all nessesary information about the campgrounds and hikes are given, such as how many tent sites are available (I was surprised to see one campground had only one tent site!) and how long the hiking trails are. If you need a guide for Oregon on camping and/or hiking, I think this is the book you've been looking for.
