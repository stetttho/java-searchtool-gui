 I am not really a horror lover so I was quite disgusted by the villain character, Junior Cain! It becomes clear early in the book that this guy is highly disturbed, and Dean Koontz really put some effort in to show you in great detail the passages of Junior's mind. It was quite awful, I mean just for one instance he was into hideous art, such as paintings of cancer growing. That is a mild example of his character, actually. He was a murderer many times over and still had this idea that all women wanted him, and also that he was a man of great character!  I waded through all of the stuff with Junior with grimaces on my face only because I wanted to see the outcome of the other plot, about a little boy named Bartholomew. He lost his eyes at a young age, but had a very unusual, special talent. This kept my interest. I wish the book had been more about him, but it was more about Junior. I give the book 2 stars for effort and the Bartholomew parts, but Junior kept me giving it 3 stars. He is just too gross for me!
