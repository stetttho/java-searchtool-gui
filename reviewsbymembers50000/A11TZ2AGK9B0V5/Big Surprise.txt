 The Best Laid Plans stands out to me as the best of the Sheldon books I have read so far - he has had many intriging plot ideas in other books, but this one really threw me for a loop and had me quite surprised at what was really going on. He did a good job of fooling me! I won't say too much, don't want to ruin the story for you, but here is a short synopsis of the story - Oliver Russell proposed to Leslie Stewart and backed out of it at the last minute, suddenly marrying someone else. Leslie wants revenge, and Oliver's new father in law wants him to be President of the United States. He gets there with his help. He needs to be careful, he has descreet personal life on the side...hopefully no one will find out. Leslie plots revenge - and ends up buying the Washington Tribune newspaper, where the headlines can say whatever she wants. Things really get interesting when a teen girl dies in a suite of a hotel, and no one is sure who she was with.  Sheldon has a knack of keeping you reading - try him out with this book.
