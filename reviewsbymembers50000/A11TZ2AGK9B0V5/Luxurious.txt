 These Royal Legacy bath towels from [local store] are the most unbelievebly softest towels you could ever dry yourself off with. It is quite the experience, such a treat compared to a "normal" bath towel! They do loose their incredible softness after many washings and become ordinary, but it is worth it to buy for the initial experience and are still worthy as towels later on.
