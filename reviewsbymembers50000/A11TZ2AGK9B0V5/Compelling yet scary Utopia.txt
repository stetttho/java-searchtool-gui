 This book is written for teens, and I as an adult could not put it down once I started it, I mean I sat and read it from beginning to end, no breaks. This is the only book I have ever done that with. I was facinated with the society, where everyone is given volunteer work as a older child and then a career is determined for you by a group of older members (of the society). Jonas is given an unusual assignment: The Giver. It is very secretive and he is not allowed to share his learnings with anyone. I was compelled by this society that tries to make life good for everyone but yet contains such subtle horrors: such as if a twin is born, one must be killed! And then there is what is revealed to Jonas through an old man called the Giver, that Jonas didn't even know about love (amongst other things!) I recommend that if you haven't read this yet, READ IT s it is a quite facinating and different book.
