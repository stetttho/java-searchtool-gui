 Are you a fan of independant movies? Check this one out. This movie takes place in the mountains of Montana and is a new twist on the idea of "Reality TV". Young women find themselves being kidnapped by a retarded man who says he "knaptid" them. By the time the 3rd woman is kidnapped, the story starts. She finds herself hancuffed to a cot in a little log cabin shed with 2 other women, and they are wearing strange collars that shock them if they stray too far and explode if they try to tamper with them. The retarded man explains that they are going to be on a new reality show called "Who Wants to Marry a Mountain Man?" The women obviously want to escape, and I was very interested to see what happened to them as the story progressed. I thought the acting was well done. There is a deleted scene at the end of the DVD and an explanation of why the producer cut it out. There is some adult matter and some violence, so I do not recommend this for young audiences.
