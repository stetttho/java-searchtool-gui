 When I bought "Life on the Other Side", I was eager to read it and discover how wonderful the other side really is. The book was easy to read and exciting, yet when I  was all through with it I was left with a feeling that it was a little too sugar coated to be accurate. As time went by I started realizing that several things she said did not make sense. Of the top of my head, she said when you pass on all the pets you ever had in past lives would be waiting to greet you. This makes no sense at all to me, for I am sure the pets, if they reincarnate would be busy living a new life or what about all the other masters they had before? Also Sylvia Browne says that people will practice their same religion on the other side, in churches, temples, what have you. And they will all get along peacefully. This also makes no sense. Why go to church when you are already in heaven? And let's say this really happens. I would think if people respected other people's religions on the other side, when they incarnated back to Earth, they would carry on their tolerance. For the most part, I do not see people tolerating other's religions!  I don't think there is anything wrong with wanting to know that there really is a peaceful existance on the other side. I just don't think this book really has an acurate answer. Read it and decide for yourself. I do recommend however, "Between Death and Life", by Delores Cannon. It also goes with the theme that we reincarnate and rest between lives, and I think her account is much more plausible.
