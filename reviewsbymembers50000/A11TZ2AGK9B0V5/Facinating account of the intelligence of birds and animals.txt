 I can't tell you how glad I am I found this book at a bookstore. I learned so much about birds, other animals and even insects. Reading this book is the first time I really read about Alex the famous African Grey parrot, who is capable of so many things we consider human, such as counting, identifiying colors, shapes, textures, and can request what he wants with sentence as a human can. Not only African Greys are intellegent, this book discusses and gives amazing stories about so many types of birds, from pet budgies to wild birds.  I learned facts about avian navigation and body language and their songs. Many facts were brought up about wild birds (and pets) that seemed so human I was amazed. I felt I was really getting an intimate look at the world of birds as I read this book. The author also included a chapter called "Are all animals intellegent?". I was very excited to read this as I learned things about gorillas, chimpanzees, dolphins, whales, and even fish, ants and honeybees that amazed me. There is a very nice set of color photographs in the middle of the book, the first one of a rosella grooming a cockatiel being my favorite. If you love animals or have a curiosity about the intellegence of animals, I highly recommend this book!
