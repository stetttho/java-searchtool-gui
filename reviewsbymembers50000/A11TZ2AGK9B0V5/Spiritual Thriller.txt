 In Dragonfly, Kevin Costner's character becomes a widower and soon discovers that even though he does not believe in life after death, his dead wife is trying to reach him. The movie is spooky in parts, but not an evil spooky. The mystery of why his dead wife needed to reach him and seeing his character open his mind in light of events happening to him made this movie intriguing. The ending was absolutely wonderful.
