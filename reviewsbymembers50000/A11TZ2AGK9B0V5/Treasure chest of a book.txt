 I can't believe this book is out of print. Reading it is like opening up a treasure chest and finding one gem after another. Each animal story touched me and opened my eyes and my heart to the world of animals. The stories are short and easy to read, and I found myself having a hard time stopping to take a break sometimes, I kept wanting to hear more stories. A great book to read outloud to your children too, my son was also awed by the stories. I was amazed at how smart and how compassionate animals really are. There are some interesting animal facts included too as side notes. I highly recommend this book!
