 I cannot believe that as a Robin Cook fan I did not read this spectacular book sooner! I actually had it on my bookshelf for awhile and didn't read it  right away because the begining was rather slow for me compared to his other books, but I thought, this is Robin Cook, so it has to be good. Was it ever! As soon as the characters were stranded in a dark, muddy cave somewhere under the sea that they determine is not geologically possible, I was hooked. They walk for awhile in knee deep mud and and a big steel door out of nowhere opens up with a light inside. They cautiously go in and from then on I went along with them experiencing the adventure of a lifetime! I won't spoil the fun by telling you anymore right now about the plot. I thought this was a very imaginative work by Robin Cook that possibly became my new favorite of his. (I am still real fond of the Jack Stapleton books, esp. Chromosome 6 and Vector). I really recommend this book, it is way cool!
