 This must be the most classic storybook of all time. It was my favorite to read to my son at bedtime when he was younger. Margaret Wise Brown tells us in her book of the great green room (where a little rabbit is going to bed), describing first many of the delightful things around the room, and then we hear the little rabbit saying goodnight to the room, the moon, the cow jumping over the moon, and the other things that are in the room. I really like the part where there is a blank page and it says "goodnight nobody" and the next page is "goodnight mush".  If you have a small child, this book is a must for bedtime reading! I was reading this book to my son when he was an infant, so it is never too soon to start. As a toddler, he never tired of hearing "Goodnight Moon" each night.
