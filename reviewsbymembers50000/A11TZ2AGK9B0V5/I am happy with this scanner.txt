 What's great about this scanner: The slim, unbulky size. It doesn't take up a lot of room and I like the sleek silver look of it. Of course looks aren't everything. It is very purposeful for me, I bought it to scan photos onto my computer. I wanted a high resolution but not a high price and this was the one scanner that met my needs. When I put my scanned photos on Webshots for my albums there, they are high resolution (1460 x 1028) which really pleases me. The software that comes with it is easy to use and has some great features, such as making magazine pictures look really nice after you scan them. There is a blurring feature that makes magazine photos look a little better that I have used often.  You can draw on your pictures and my son and I have had some comical fun with this.  This scanner can accept books and other bulky things to scan even though its slim. Since I like to be able to "save" great pictures I see in library books, I appreciate this. In case it helps, I have Windows Me on my computer.
