 For some reason this particular season is set up in such a way that when viewed with our new Memorex DVD player, we cannot turn off the subtitles on many of the episodes! Very annoying! We do not have this problem with any other seasons we own of The Simpsons. Nor any other DVD we own. We tried numerous ways of trying to get those subtitles off and none of them worked.
