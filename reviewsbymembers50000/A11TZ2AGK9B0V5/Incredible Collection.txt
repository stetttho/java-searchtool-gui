 It was pure joy when I discovered that Kenny Loggins, my favorite singer, had this album with some songs I had been crazy about! Kenny, I could of kissed you! First I noticed that he put "Pure Imagination", the incredible song from the movie "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory." The only bad thing is he mixed it with some other songs, I really would of prefered the song by itself. Also included are "Rainbow Connection", I love that song that Kermit the Frog sang in one his movies. And "The Last Unicorn", I love that song and the movie. Return to Pooh Corner, Cody's Song and Love are great songs also. I didn't buy this album for my son, I bought it for me!
