 I remember so clearly playing Zelda for the first time. My brother and I both had Super Nintendos, and he had come home for thanksgiving. I started playing, and could not pull away. The game sucks you in, and does not let you go. Furthermore, it's the sort of game one can play and play and play. So here we are, with perhaps the greatest game series made, ported to the Game Boy. How does it stack up? Benifitting from the GBA's superior graphics (at least compared to the SNES), the visual experience is almost shockingly clear and colorful. There are added touches all over the place, but most importantly, they left a legend alone. This is Zelda to go, just as remembered. I'll be playing for the next few days, flashing back to that wonderful thanksgiving. Thank you Nintendo and Capcom. This is wonderful.
