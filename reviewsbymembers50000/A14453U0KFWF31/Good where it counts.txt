 The first thing that needs to be said about these headphones is that they are really ugly. There can be no denying it. The weird earpieces with the bar atop is just ugly, ugly, ugly. That said, these are easily the most comfortable portables I've worn, a situation largely a product of the very features that make the set ugly. Additionally, the sound is good. I don't feel the sound is as orgasmically supreme as other reviewers suggest, but the sound is very good. If you listen to a lot of Jazz or classical, some senns might serve you better. If you listen to more rock and hip hop, you'll be pleased with the portapros, if only for the comfort, which is truly exceptional. I use them with my iPod, and am well pleased.
