 I actually did not like this game at first, but I'm growing to really like it.  The secret, I think, is in learning to tweek it. After you select a car, you can adjust the breaks, tires, gears, steering, etc for your car. I found that making the steering more sensitive dramatically improved my enjoyment of the game. I went from thinking I had wasted 40 bucks, to a satisfied customer.  The only complaint I have is that you have to navigate through about 20 dialogue boxes before you can actually race. That's a bit much. But otherwise, it's a truly fun ride.
