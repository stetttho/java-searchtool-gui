 I have tree GBA games, and this was the first to make my jaw drop at the awesome potential of the platform. The graphics are stunning, colorful, and fun. The game play is really cool. I like that you learn to do things like dangle. Also, as a person who'd rather play puzzle games than headache inducing shoot-em-ups, I was pleased to see that this game encourages exploration, taking one's time, and thinking, while still keeping gameplay fresh and interesting. That's rare, and worth investing in. I highly reccomend this game to just about anyone. You won't regret buying it.
