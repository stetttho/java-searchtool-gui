 Any user of a wireless internet connection will attest that the loss of wires is very liberating. Though perhaps not to the same extent, wireless peripherals follow this lead. There is a hedonistic thrill to grabbing my keyboard, and putting it wherever I wish whenever, and never feeling the tug of the cord.  Besides that basic pleasure, there is the added delight of using this particular model. Logitech has designed a spectacular set. The keyboard has the most comfortable keys with the most satisfying clicks and clacks of any keyboard I've used. The added buttons are mostly useless, but the buttons for controlling my MP3 Player are almost worth the price alone. I was also pleasantly surprised to find the system working happily on my Mac withouth a hitch. Further, the mouse is comfortable, ergonomic, the best designed I've used. Combined, I am left a happy customer indeed. I would reccomend this to anyone seeking a happy computer using experience. The only hitch is the batteries, but I would contend that in this case, the benefits far outweigh the costs, and indeed, the bateries don't need changing that often. So all in all, a great buy if you're looking for comfort and convenience.
