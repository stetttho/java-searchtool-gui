 So for those of you interested, this is a great crash course in Crossan's material. The information easy to read, and Crossan is, as always, engaging. I strongly encourage you to attend one of Dr. Crossan's lectures if you can. He has this great irish accent, and damn, the man knows what he's talking about. This book gives you a taste of the vast pools of insight Crossan has. Don't be surprised if you go along saying "I never thought of that." To those who denigrate the Jesus Seminar, I would say its purpose is not to destroy christianity, but to voice a generally suppressed opinion. And if Christianity can be destroyed by a bunch of academics who thought it would be nice to find out what everyone agrees on, maybe Christianity isn't worthy of survival. For my part, although my faith was never in trouble, my ability to pursue it through the christian edifice was in doubt, and it was the Jesus Seminar that allowed me to do so. Thank you, Jesus Seminar.
