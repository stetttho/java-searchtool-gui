 This being my fourth PDA, and being myself an unabashed technophile, let me say this is a fine piece of machinery. I have owned a Palm IIIe, a Visor Deluxe, a Palm m105, and now this, but believe me, I get my hands on every model I can. (I'm poorish, you see). In the passing time, I've learned a simple meter for evaluating a piece of digital equipment: It's in the details. If you are new to the PDA world, you want these details. I speak from experience. Like bateries that recharge, instead of disposable alkaline. Such a relief. Saves you money in the long run, plus you can hotsync more often. (Hotsyncing is a huge battery drain on less enlightened cradles).  The backlight hi-res screen is also a delight. Try one. You won't ever go back. The black and whiteness is fine by me. Color still strikes me as gratuitous, too much money for too little gain. If you can't think of a really good reason for one, you don't need it. Seeing a backlit b and w screen will only confirm this. Finally, there is just a lot of fit and finish. You get the feel that this is a solid design statement, whereas even nice Palms like the Tungsten have this feeling like they might just fall apart if you look at it the wrong way. The Clie feels solid and looks great, which doesn't change anything (I've never had a PDA break on me). But it's one of those things that just makes me smile, and is indicative of the overall product. This is a solid buy, more PDA than most people need, well executed, and at a wonderful price. Buy it. p.s. This model works perfectly well with Mac OS X, if you are curious. If you have Palm Desktop 4 installed (and if you're running X, you must), you're all set.
