 When you reach the ending, (which I won't give away), you'll have the feeling of having watched an episode of Law and Order "ripped from the headlines". This feeling comes only upon completion however, which is one of the joys of this book. 80% of the story is an interesting, quirky little tale about life in small town Maine, and then POW, one is walloped with a helping of reality almost painful in its dosage. And once the punch is delivered, there is little recoup time, narative wise. One must digest on one's own time. Garunteed to make you think, and to entertain. I definitely reccomend it.
