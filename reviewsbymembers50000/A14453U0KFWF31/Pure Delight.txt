 Tepper Isn't Going Out provides a wonderful etude on story telling. There is no heavy handed moralizing or point-down-throat-shoving. There is simply a funny woll constructed plot, and some very very funny jabs of wit. You will chuckle out loud, and when you aren't chuckling, you will smile. The story end in satisfaction. Not a challenging story, but why would that ever be a bad thing? This is candy, and candy of the first order. Give it a taste. You'll come back for more.
