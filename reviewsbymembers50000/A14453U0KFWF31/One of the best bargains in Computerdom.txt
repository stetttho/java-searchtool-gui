 Photoshop 7.0 is a beautiful, amazing beast of a program, the sort that few people know all of, but many know parts of. I know some of that fine app, and am in awe of it. Sadly, it is an expensive beast, and I'm no longer at school, so I can't afford it. Enter Elements. On writing about laptops a few years ago, David Pogue enthused that the best thing about a laptop was that, in a thousand glorious ways, it was just like using a desktop. Well, the best thing about Elements is that, in a thousand glorious ways, it's just like its bigger sibling. Of course, some things are missing. This isn't for professionals. Yet even some of the more consumer-designed features, like the quick fix window and the color balance window are quite useful. It's like professional consumer features that are both powerful and easy to use. The best of both worlds: a great Digital Camera counterpart, without excess features, and the excess price. Not a replacement, but a respectable counterpart. At less than [$$], it's a steal.
