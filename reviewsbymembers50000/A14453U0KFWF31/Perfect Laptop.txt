 I remember when the 14" iBook first came out, many in the Mac universe spoke poorly of it. Obviously, it cost more, and while the usual core features had more juice (Hard drive, processor, RAM,) the difference was not overwhelming. The main beef, though, was that the resolution on the 14" iBook is the same as the resolution on the 12" iBook (1024 X 768). The only difference is that, on the 12 incher, those dots are really scrunched in. I've used many of the 12" iBookse I work in IT, especially with Macs, so I've seen it all, and so feel qualified to take a side on this one. The verdict: It's worth it.  I went to apple.com, and and browsed to a 12" iBook with comperable fatures to the one I recently acquired. The price offered was 1350. I got mine for about 1500, which leaves about 150 to account for. Since other factors are basically equal, the difference is the screen. You want that difference. The 14" iBook feels spacious, a real trick for a lap top. The screen's extra size makes the lower half of the laptop bigger as well, so that there really is room for the keyboard, and a large palm rest. The clean lines of the design really bring out the most in the display, which is bright and clear. If you've never used a laptop, the screen feels bigger, simply because you're usually closer to it. Additionally, LCDs have a larger usable area than a CRT of the same size. As I sit here typing this review, I can tell: You feel this screen's size. Size does matter, especially with something like a laptop. If you get a smaller screen, you'll inevitably want a larger screen, but then you'll be stuck with an expensive purchase. So put in the extra cash now. If you have the means, treat yourself to 14" iBook. You'll be glad you did.
