 I haven't bought this book yet, but I'm probably going to. I just wanted to clarify at least one erroneous statement from the previous review. The author states that the vine and the branches and the good shepherd are parables. While both elements are present in the gospel of John, but neither are parables. The Good Samaritan is a parable. It is a story told by Jesus to illustrate a point, usually about the nature of the kingdom of God. "I am the vine, you are the branches", while meaningful, is not a story to illustrate a point. It is an image. It may be a beautiful image, it may be an awful image. But an image it is. Both are instances of a trend of John's, a series of "I am" statements which are largely unique to John, and yes, do tend to exist in place of parables. For the author to assert that John isn't much fodder for the student of parables is actually correct. This is not to say that the gospel of John is of no interest or use, simply that it is of little use for those studying parables. In much the same way, the Declaration of Independence is not of much use to those who wish how to make a casserole. To say that the Declaration of Independence is of little use to those studying casserole is not a mark against the document, but merely to place it in its proper context.  Thank you. That is all.
