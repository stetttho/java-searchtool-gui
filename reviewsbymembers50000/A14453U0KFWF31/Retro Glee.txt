 It's always been a tough call for me as to which Mario game is the best, 2 or 3. Well we can't have 3 just yet, but they've given us 2. Yes, it's more or less the same game, with greatly enhanced graphics and sounds (The players talk-that alone is worth the price). There are only subtle variations. But this is a game so great that there is no need to drastically improve it. I'm just so glad it fits in my pocket. If you're a mario lover (and you know you are), you've got to get this game.
