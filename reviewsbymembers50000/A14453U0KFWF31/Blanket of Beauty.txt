 I have read three books in my life which I acknowledge as life-altering. The first was Breakfast of Champions by Kurt Vonnegut, which told me I wasn't an idiot for seeing some pretty stunning irony in government and the images my schooling had taught me to respect in America. I was never the same. Number two was Rescuing the Bible from the Fundamentalists. If you've ever been deeply troubled by the religious tradition handed down to you, yet unable to escape a spiritual dimension to your life, this is a book to read. I did, and never been the same. Last is Love in the Time of Cholera. I actually tried to start it three times, and couldn't get going. I didn't particularly like One Hundred Years of Solitude, and my hopes were waning. But, I gave it another go, and by the time I finished reading, I felt so utterly consumed by its beauty, that I couldn't sleep, my mind still abuzz. What captured me was the language and the images, and the feeling in my heart, which started small and grew steadily with each passing page to an all encompassing glow, of overwhelming wonderfulness. (I apologize for messy little phrase, but words fail) The last word of the book, when you read it, will set you free to fly. The beauty will wrap you up like a blanket amidst a cold, clever, too smart for its own good literary world. You will breath in it's lush jungle of humanity, and never quite leave it. This is a great book. Read it.
