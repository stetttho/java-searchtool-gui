 The basic design of the G700 is in fact ingenious. When I show the device to onlookers, they gasp at the expansion mechanism of the actual keys. Concession: It is damn cool. Sadly, I must confirm previously addressed grievances, primarily with the space bar, which is every bit as flakey as described. You think there's a trick to making it work better, but there isn't. It's just flakey, which is surprising. The expansion is so exactingly well done, you can hardly believe they would goof such an obvious quibble. One thing I will add in contrast to earlier reports is that it is possible to switch the location of the shift and up arrow keys. True, this is not entirely intuitive, and less than gracefull in usage, it is there. For those of us with Clies, the Stowaway is the way to go, at least until there's a Stowaway XT ported to our platform. It's a shame, because the Belkin really has a lot going for it.
