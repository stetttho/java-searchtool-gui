 I would reccomend this story to anyone, even if it wasn't as well written as it is, simply to be exposed to its odd choice of venue. On your way through this story, you'll encounter magic and escapsitry, Jewish mysticism, the Golden Age of comic books, the Holocaust in Prague, surrealism, WWII in antarctica, and it goes on. Such a story with such far flung interests runs the risk of losing the reader in its sheer bizarre-ness. Chabon's great achievement here is that it all makes perfect sense at the end. On the way, you get sentences to luxuriate in, and drama that is intense, but never overbearing. It's a long one (636 pages), but if you are ready to be swept away to some truly unique locations, and hear a genuinely different story, read this book. It's the sort of book you can luxuriate in.
