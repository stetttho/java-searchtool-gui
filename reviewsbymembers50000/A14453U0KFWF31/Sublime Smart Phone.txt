 The first thing you need to know about the i330 is that it is more svelte than it looks in pictures. This is a slender, beautiful machine, an impression I did not get from the photos I've seen in various places on the net. The second thing you need to know is that if you're a mac user, you're going to need the Missing Sync for Samsung. Search for it on Google. Otherwise, you'll have no Hot Sync, and thus, no Mojo. Also one should note that the connection seems a bit on the slow time during Hot Sync. Perhaps due to some manner of translation? That said, I'd reccomend the phone. A color screen is not essential in life, but it sure is nice. It's hard to put my finger on what the advantage is, but it certainly feels better when in use. And games, of course, are vastly improved. I've used a lot of Palms: a Palm IIIe, a Handspring Visor, a Palm M105 (gift), and a Sony Cli SJ20. All are worthy devices, but the Samsung takes the cake. Smart Phones have come a long way since the VisorPhone, and at this point, there is no good reason to have a sperate palm and cell phone. Putting them together is a natural combination, and termendously useful. I am waiting for my Vision plan to activate, and so cannot yet comment on that aspect of the device, but I would reccomend the i330 even without. It's just a nice phone. It feels light and comfortable in the hand, and the black grips on the side are superb. The only complaint I can register is that this is not a flip-phone design. Of course the overall cooler i500 is. If you've got the cash, that's the way to go. If you don't, this'll do in a pinch.  Final Analysis: Good Stuff.
