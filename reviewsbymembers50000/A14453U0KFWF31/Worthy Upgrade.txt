 I have owned a Sega Game Gear and an Atari Lynx (which was an awesome system, but too big), and the one system I still use is the original Gameboy I got about 8 years. I watched the various reiterations pass by. Gameboy color did not impress me. But I read about the GBA, and decided to upgrade. It's fantastic. I've used many a handheld, and what makes this one the best is its exquisite sense of balance. The display is beautiful, but no backlight, which saves battery power. Bigger screen, but smaller unit. Plays old games, but the new ones are smaller carts. etc. As for this package, Tony Hawk is addictive. Iridion is interesting, but kind of hard. The power pack is a must. The light is potentially useful. The pouch is silly. Overall, a great upgrade.
