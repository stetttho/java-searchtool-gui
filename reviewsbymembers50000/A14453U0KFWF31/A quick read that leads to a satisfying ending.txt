 Let's not mince words. This novel speaks for itself, so I will spare the plot summary, and simply say that this is a fast read with much to consider and delight in. You will be there, right in the story, smiling and laughing. And for your efforts you will be treated to a wonderful ending which avoids any trace of sap. This is no small achievements, and I tip my hat to Nick Hornby. Thank you, sir.
