 Sometimes, a book that toys with the flow of time and with narative threads can be tedious or confusing. In The Corrections, both these tendancies are present, but they feel natural, even vital. That is an accomplishment. Another accomplishment is writing a truly ensemble novel that still has intimacy. The story weaves through the lives of five people in a midwestern family, and never does one seem more important, interesting, or central than the others. We flow from one narative stream to another, and the transitions are as smoth as silk. Perhaps the most rewarding aspect of reading this book was the intamacy I felt with the characters. They were so full of flesh and blood, I almost felt like I was part Lambert, like I married into the family. I found myself, towards the end, saying, "Yeah, that's just like Chip." "Yeah, that's Albert, all right." The family is all messed up, but who's family isn't?  This strong dose of reality present through out reaches its pinacle in the conclusion, which respects the reader enough not to tie up all ends, but which also doesn't feel cut short. The end is truly the end, yet satisfyingly so. All in all, a tremendously entertaining read that grabs you and wraps you into its madness, until you won't want to come out. Buy it.
