 The Master and Margerita is one of the finest novels you've probably never read. I was assigned it in a class on Russian writers in college, and I doubt I've ever devoured an assigned read so hungrily and gleefully. There are simply too many layers in this narrative to do any of them justice in a brief review like this. I will simply say that when the novel has finished, the thinking has just begun. The ideas herein will eat at you, even as they entertain you. You will ask yourself, in a the social distortion of a Stalin-like regime is Satan a hero?
