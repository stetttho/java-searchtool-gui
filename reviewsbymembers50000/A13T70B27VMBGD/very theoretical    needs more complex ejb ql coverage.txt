 This book would be a good one for developers new to EJB. This book is very theoretical, if you are well versed with EJB 1.1 and bought this book with the vision of catching up on EJB 2.0, you'd be dissatisfied with the depth of coverage on the new features, you would also quickly realize that the coverage for any facet of the EJB architecture is for the rookies.  This is certainly not a technical reference book, I came upon this looking for the ejb-ql syntax for nested 'SELECT' statements, though this book has devoted many pages to ejb-ql, it covers only simple queries.  This book does not at all get into the differences in implementation in different EJB containers, so if the examples/syntaxes don't work, don't be surprised. All in all, this is a good book for beginners, to get yourself out of the problems you are facing in your EJB project, you need a more specific and technical book for that particular platform. For WebLogic, I'll strongly suggest BEA WebLogic Server Bible by Joe Zuffoletto et. al.
