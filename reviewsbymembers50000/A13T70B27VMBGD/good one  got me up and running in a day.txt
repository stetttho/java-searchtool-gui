 Well I'm not writing ANT tasks yet, but doing almost everything else with the help of this concise guide... only thing is the order of the chapters is not in the way it should be traversed (in my opinion). Developers accostomed to using Apache products, java freeware can read thru Ch. 1(jumpstart), skim thru Ch. 3(Buildfile), skim thru Ch. 4 (Ant datatypes) and then dive into ch. 7 (core tasks) where the action is... that is what you'd need to refer to constantly as you write your buildfile... save Ch. 5 (User written tasks) for the last... you probably won't need it unless you're one of those who feel guilty about using a freeware without contributing to it.
