 I made a mistake buying this book. It may not be apparent from the cover graphics that the name of this book is 'Learning the (in smaller print) UNIX Operating System' and not just 'Unix operating System' - which I was looking for.  When the book arrived I was disappointed by the small size of the book, nobody told me the book is so thin, and then taking a closer look at the title made it clear. I browsed thru it anyway and I almost bit my nails thinking why did somebody not write this book while I had my first encounter with Unix! This book would have made it so much easier.  This book is not for me, I was looking for more advanced system admin concepts, but after all these I had to give this book a good rating! The book is very well written, very organized and almost completely free of flab (except for why Unix is better for sight and hearing impaired users! Who needs to know that anyway?)  Final word - if you just got an Unix account or are about to get one, get this book, it's worth the money. Please note that it's better to be used as a practical guide and reference rather than as a book that covers the theory behind Unix.
