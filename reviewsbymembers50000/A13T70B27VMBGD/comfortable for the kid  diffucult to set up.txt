 I found this one pretty comfortable for my daughter, who's 21 months, she enjoys even long rides sitting in this, it's easy to fasten the belts and safe enough for kids not to be able to open. I found it difficult to set up, but it may not be right to mark this product down for that, as I haven't seen any other booster with significantly easier set up.
