 There are hundrends if not thousands of articles and tutorials floating around on the net which are written on or around or about UML, some try to cover everything in a shallow manner, some try going deep into a very specialized aspect of one kind of diagrams. As a software architect, people like me need something concise and handy which we can constantly refer to which chalking out different diagrams which are required in software project following RUP methodology, this book serves this purpose in an excellent manner and I am certainly happy using it for the last couple of projects I handled. One thing I must say is that I found the coverage of 'Development Process' (Ch 2) very sketchy and superficial, and most probably it does not even belong in a book so focussed in being used as a reference for a software project. There is only one more thing which I expected from this book. Different UML diagrams are sketched and used in different stages of a project, if only these were overlapped with RUP project phases (inception, elaboration, construction and transition) along with a representative of other documents used in those phases the use of the UML diagrams could have been realized from a better perspective. I would highly recommend the book 'Building J2EE Applications with RUP' (Peter Eeles, Kelli Houston and Wojtek Kozaczynski) for the J2EE practitioners, these two books complement each other very well in the J2EE/RUP world.
