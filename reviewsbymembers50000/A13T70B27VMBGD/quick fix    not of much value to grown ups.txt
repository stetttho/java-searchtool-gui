 This could be a great book for teens/kids... the main problem with this book is oversimplification. The story starts with four characters in constant search for cheese, and the message is that 'be ready to move when the cheese moves', however the author does not recognize that the problem with most is to define 'what' is the 'cheese' in their life, it does not teach you how to set priorities or goals in life, how to define 'cheese' - it just tells you to 'go for it' when the target shifts... and when when it's not shifting enjoy your cheese but be ready for the 'cheese' to move. Nop! That does not give enough insight. The author tries to tell you that your life would change after reading this book, but what he said can be summarized in one well-known statement - 'Change is the only constant thing in life', now, did that change your life? No! then don't expect this book to change your life either. I'm giving it two stars because of the hype the author tried to create... the reunion, I agree if someone tells this story others would say it's a good story but they won't have another serious discussion session over it. The book does not have any long term benefits, if you've proactive enough to define your 'cheese' for you you are beyond the preachings in this book, and if you haven't done that, don't waste your time reading this book, spend some time with/on yourself to define your goals in life.
