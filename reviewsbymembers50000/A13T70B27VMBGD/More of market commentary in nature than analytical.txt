 I am a newbie in the REIT field, I read this book with a view to understand the market better and to understand the basic concepts involved in this field. While I must say I did pick up some basic concepts I don't think I understand the market much better than before. The concepts I did pick up was not being explained in detail by the author but he was using those factors and parameters to explain why market behaved in a particular way during, say, the 1985-1990 period.  Now, this is certainly not the book for the beginner, certainly not the book for somebody who wants to analyze how profitable a REIT would be... the mathematical formulas used in the books might be useful for the ones setting up the REIT, but for others, it's certainly not worth the money.
