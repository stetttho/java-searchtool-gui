 This book is one of the most involving reads I ever had, more so cause this is based on concrete facts and the author clearly gives the sources, mentions that the statements are either quoted in toto from courtroom notes or from the newspapers. The author must be applauded for writing on such a sensitive topic and not trying to sensasionalize one side of the argument or the other.  I wouldn't recommend it as light reading, this should be read with a view to understand what went on in the southern states before and/or after the great emancipation. It was tremendously helpful to me to understand the varying treatment of the slaves in different plantations, frankly I was confused before by the contradictory treatment of this topic in 'Uncle Tom's Cabin' and 'Gone with the wind'
