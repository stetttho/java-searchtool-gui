 This book was sent to me for review, and the review only takes into account the merits (and demerits, though hard to find) of this book. This book is like an end-to-end solution for Java 2 Platform 1.4 exam (CX-310-035). I found this book to be exceptionally well organized with in-depth coverage of exam objectives. Though there are already some books in the market which covers the exam objectives thoroughly, this book does better in comparison due to its extensive use of illustrations, UML diagrams and relevant code examples. What I liked most about this book is that it does not assume anything (even familiarity with object oriented concepts) about the reader; rather it explains the basic OO concepts in a nutshell. This book, in my opinion, can be used for dual purpose; it surely serves its main purpose - preparation for SCJP exam, secondly this book could be used by somebody new to Java to get a nutshell view of important concepts. I would want to specifically mention that the coverage of the Collections Framework and Thread Synchronization are really superb, they have covered it in a wholistic manner rather than what is only included in the exam objectives. And yes, for those of us who did SCJP 1.2 certification, it got the Platform Upgrade Exam covered! I wish they would write cert guides for the Developers exam and Enterprise Architect exam also. I do have what seems like a minor quibble. The exam objectives (Appendix B) sould be placed at a more accessible and handy location, have it in the beginning of the book, and/or have a tear-out page or whatever... readers would not complain if its duplicated in the book.
