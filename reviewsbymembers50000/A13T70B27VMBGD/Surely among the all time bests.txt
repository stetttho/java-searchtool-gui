 This extremely well done movie colorfully depicts the Southern America in all its flavors, slow moving life, white trashes, racism and all. The movie is a pretty faithful reproduction of the original story except for the fact that it's centered much more around the lawsuit in which a young afro-american man, Tom Robinson, is falsely accused by of raping Mayella Ewell. Gregory Peck did a superb job of portraying the silent but forceful lawyer Atticus Finch, and the children, especially Scout was so natural, can't forget her expression of awe at Atticus picking up the gun and killing a rogue dog.  The movie comes to a dramatic finish when the mysterious Boo Radley saves the lives of Jem and Scout from the heinous attack by Mr. Ewell, Mayella's father. The movie elegantly depicts the social values, mutual respect (and the lack of it between 'whites' and the then 'coloreds'), financial and moral struggles of the South of yesterday.
