 Great book for those who really want to put in the effort to distinguish themselves from the herd. Warning for people looking for quick fixes - this is not all that, if you can't devote the effort and time this is not for you; but I don't mind, quick fixes do unfix themselves promptly. Steve also took his time to explain why not to fall for the 'techniques', I loved it. The last but one chapter is a bit unclear, author explains what is 'Synergy' but doesn't really give a clear cut way to create it, but I don't blame him for that, it's a tough job like diagnosing solely by checking pulse, you have to get a feel for it yourself, be open to the idea that that all people, even those who sincerely try, may not reach the topmost level of interdependence, but it certainly helps getting in the right direction. The 'inside out' approach makes absolute sense, this is more than a book. If you try to practice the learnings you can achieve mental peace, or at least can spot what's causing the lack of it.
