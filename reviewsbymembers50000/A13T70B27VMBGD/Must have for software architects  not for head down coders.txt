 I never thought I would be saying anything different from anybody by praising this book, that's why I never got around to writing a review for this book though I have used the concepts of this book in many projects, but recently I came across some very harsh review of this book and found that to be very very misleading, so I basically wanted to straighten things up. First of all, I would not go even near claiming this book would add value to everyone (though I might have made this very mistake had I written this review a year back), this book mainly targets the software architects who are responsible for designing large or fairly large software applications ground up, or who redesigns or enhances an existing system to make it feature rich or performance-enhanced or less unweildy (refactoring more or less). This book is just not the right stuff for head-down coders who want to remain that way.  I am developing software for over 6 years, I'll say for the first three or so years I have played more of the role of a developer that the role of an architect, but then I moved on to architect position and I have found that knowledge of Design patterns has helped me considerably. I'm not saying knowldge of design patterns is the only thing you need to develop a flexible and robust architecture, but it at least ensures you do not make any egregious mistakes in addressing well-known and frequently occuring problems, it provides a baseline, you obviously need to know the innards of the technology you'd finally be using for development to provide a good architecture but you really can't just go ahead and start typing up your code unless it's a miniscule application you are developing. Keeping all these in mind, I would not suggest this book to everyone, though I would love to, I do recognize the fact that not everyone focuses on the same area, different people do specialize in different areas and I respect others' rights to think completely differently than I do, so I'll suggest this to softwear architects, present/would be/wanna bes, those who want to keep out of that area are better off by keeping away from this book, the only suggestion I have for them is that they should not say that this book is worthless just for the fact that it's not been written for them.
