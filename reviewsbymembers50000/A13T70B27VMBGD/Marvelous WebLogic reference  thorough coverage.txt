 This is the best WebLogic book I have read till now. Author clearly states that this is not a beginners' reference, and I liked the book mainly because it is not; this book gets right into the meaty stuff without wasting pages and time on covering stuff that's splattered all over the internet in numerous free tutorials. This book covers WebLogic 8.1, touches upon features specific to WebLogic (not plain old J2EE stuff) and the coverage is pretty deep. For example, coverage of weblogic-tags taglib for JSP development, or the 'APP-INF' magic folder introduced in WL8.1 for application level libraries (oh, this was like a sore thumb in the previous WL releases and still is in J2EE spec) gives insight into advantages one gets using WebLogic over other J2EE platforms (much better than other books wasting pages and time on advantage of using 'a' J2EE platform). One of the features I loved about this book is the interspersed 'Best Practice' guides, you know reading a best practice guide by itself (like Floyd Marinesku's EJB Design Pattern) can sometimes get boring, here the best practices are put in perspective by discussing them in the right context, juxtaposing them with the problem these best practices address, along with code snippets and all, great job! The discussion on WebLogic clusters is the best I have seen till now and the config/architecture suggestions for development and production environments are very useful.
