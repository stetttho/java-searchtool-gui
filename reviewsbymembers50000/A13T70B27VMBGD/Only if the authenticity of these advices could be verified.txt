 I read the book cover to cover and I wish I don't get 'practically' benefitted by these advices. It does contain much of informative tidbits, like which freq you should put the radio on when you, of all people, would have to relieve the sick pilot of a plane.  My question is, are all(and I mean ALL) these scenarios tried and tested? That is how sound is the advice in a life or death situation?
