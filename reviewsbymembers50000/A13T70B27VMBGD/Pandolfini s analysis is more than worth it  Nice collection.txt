 As it is said, there are atmost one/two moves in a chess game that decides the fate of it, this book is a collection of such moves and such moments of the games where one move makes the difference. In many of the games Fischer is lagging pieces, the game suddenly ends while the opponents pieces helplessly watch (and  some cased help by hindering the king move) while the kingdom crumbles down to its knees. I am not a pro, I usually lose against players with rating 2300 and above, many of the moves have been eye openers for me, while in all honesty some of the moves are very predictable. If this book creates a aura of Fischer never losing, I'll strongly suggest 'How to beat Bobby Fischer' in addition to this book.
