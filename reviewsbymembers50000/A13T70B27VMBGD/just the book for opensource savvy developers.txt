 I read thru a number of Struts books in order to understand how a couple of other frameworks like Tiles, Validator and Velocity gel with Struts, in short I wanted a deeper understanding on the framework of frameworks, I was left feeling I am trying an exercise in futility. Gladly and thankfully this book left a quite different impression, it explains the Struts innards really well, marking out the differences between V1.0 and V1.1, building the foundation thru detailed idiot-proof examples, and then gets down to the goodies.  I agree with some other reviewers in that the number/density of examples go down as you get along, and I disagree with them in that that's a bad thing. Remember, unlike many other books where you can decide to read chapters in any order, this book would add most value if chapters are read sequentially from start, they are already logically organized and one builds on another, and once you really go thru the first few chapters understanding them thoroughly, I mean not by only reading them but by writing your own code along with, you would NOT need the idiot-proof examples to grasp the meat of the later chapters, once you got the foundation right you can easily get the feel of it. This is not a 'for idiots' book and I would like to thank the authors for keeping it that way, you have enough information in the book to understand the Struts framework (and then some) pretty well, but you gotta take your hands outta your pockets and write some code! I liked the way Tiles, Validator and Velocity has been explained, keep up the good work Ted!
