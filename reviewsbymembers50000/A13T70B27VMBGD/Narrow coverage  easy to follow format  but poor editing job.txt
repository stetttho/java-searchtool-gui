 This book would be a good book to start with for Struts beginners, but in no case this should be the last. One good thing is that the author takes the reader thru easy-to-follow steps to setup and code for every example/feature. Highlighting changes to a file as it matures thru different stages is a good idea but has not been carried thru in a clean way in this book, this book looks like it has been published in a hurry, some sections has not been updated after a cut&paste, some method signatures are not proper (init in PlugIn), I gather struts-tiles could have been used to beautifully demonstrate the power of Plugins. Struts framework has been the seed for so many different solutions and other frameworks that one would expect atleast some passing mention of tools and solutions based on Struts, nada, there's none here, this book solely focuses on a couple of Struts related classes and the taglibs, one needs to know more in order to weild the full power provided by Struts. I can only suggest this as a quick reference for beginners, nothing more. by the way, if you are using TomCat 5.0.7 and wondering why the application does not work, upgrade TomCat, bug there! I strongly recommend 'Struts in Action' by ted Husted et. al. in addition to/ instead of this book.
