 An interesting story of three children and their exploits in the backdrop of 1930's Alabama. It keeps you riveted though it does not have the suspense, violence and corporate mumbo-jumbo of nowadays fast novels portraying big city life. This book is very soothing read, will keep you smiling to yourself and will talk to the evergreen child in yourself, you'll be happy you read it.
