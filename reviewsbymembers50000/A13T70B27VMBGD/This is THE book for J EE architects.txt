 Get this right, this is NOT a 50-50 mix of J2EE development process and RUP, this is not for the ones doing BPR (Business Process Redesign) and book does not try to position itself as the ultimate book for RUP (I'm glad it doesn't).  This book let's you focus on only a small subset of RUP, a subset which is really relevant for developing the architecture of a J2EE application, it let's you use RUP as a tool (that's the whole point of RUP, it's a tool, not a goal in itself) to deliver your final deliverable, the software architecture document with other supporting documents. If you are a J2EE Architect or a senior developer planning to make the move towards architect roles, this is the book for you, keep the 'J2EE Patterns' book (Deepak Alur, Dan Malks, John Crupi) by your side, and you're ready to go!
