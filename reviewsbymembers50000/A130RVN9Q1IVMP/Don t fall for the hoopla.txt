 Maybe if you can get your "subject" to stop laughing at you.  Maybe if you can get over the cheesey wording and stop laughing yourself.  Maybe, just maybe, this might work.  Until I see someone use this book live on me or someone I know, I shall cling to my doubts about the effectiveness of the teachings in this book.  If you really, really desire to read it..maybe you should check it out at your library and save the money.
