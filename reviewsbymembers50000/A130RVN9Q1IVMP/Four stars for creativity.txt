 I still haven't figured out whether I liked this book or not.  Probably because this book literally is one of the few books that truly does have everything in it!  Sci-fi, time travel, romance, sex, fairy tales, mystery, even Disney.  Okay, there's no Western. This book would have something you are sure to enjoy, which part of the book that may be for you, I don't know.  Because the main character, Beauty, travels and lives in so many different places and times, with so many different people, it's like it's almsot several books in one. And the whole time you wonder, just what is happening.  As you start to figure one portion of it out, a whole other portion opens up and sets more questions spinning. I don't want to say much what goes on in the story because 1) there is way to much to explain and 2) Finally!!  A book that is neither predictable or boring!  A book that keeps you wondering, guessing, speculating what is coming next and what has already happened.  Like I said, I'm not sure if I truly liked the book or not as far as reccomendation, but for sure creativity alone, the author deserves four stars!
