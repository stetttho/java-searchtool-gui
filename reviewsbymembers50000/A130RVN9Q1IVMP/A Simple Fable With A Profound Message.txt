 When I finished reading my library's copy of this book (checked out based off some little tidbit I read off the internet) I immediately returned and bought 3 copies of it so I can give it away.  I have already reread it several times which is a very rare thing for me to do with a book.  It's about one man's encounter with what he is supposed to do with his life, the spiritual disciplines behind the search and the ever presence of God's hand in our life.  I suppose anyone can take the story which ever way they want...it just deeply affected me.  I plan on giving this away over and over again.
