 Bjork should have gotten best actress over Julia Roberts, hands down. Anyone who sees this film should agree.  It's a poignant, almost documentary like film, about a factory worker who is going blind.  To escape the problems of life, she tends to daydream.  Fascinated with musicals, the main character often drifts into dreaming that her life is a musical.  This is the only fault of the movie, I think.  You can barely understand Bjork when she goes off into these fortunately very limited musical segments.  However strange these moments might be, they are easily sideswiped by the rest of the movie and its drama.  It's touches deep into the corners of your heart.  Beautiful and enchantingly haunting are almost the best words to describe it.  Keep an open mind when you watch it due to those weird musical segments, but it's soo worth it.  It's about time someone made a movie that was meant to  motivate your emotions rather than stifle them.  (PS: I am not a Bjork fan in the least so to have me saying she deserved best actress is actually astounding.)
