 For a time travel fan, it is a must read.  However, many of the fun things about time travel are avoided by the author in this story.  He writes away explanations against paradoxes, as if to take away the worry of really writing intelligently about that aspect of time travel. The characters are varied and interesting, but fall short on any sort of connection or empathy with them.  I'd agree with an earlier review that rarely do you really feel he has put you back in time in early Jerusalem. The twist on the crucifixtion is interesting, although again, he puts the charcacters exactly into the time frame that avoids having to address many aspects of Jesus and sticks with what is just easier to explain. Also, a couple things in the book felt like he was going to go somewhere with it potentially thought provoking, and basically just dropped it. It was worth a first time through, but definitely not one I'm going to keep on my shelves for a later read.
