 He's done it again.  If you loved The Alchemist, rush out to your bookstore (don't even wait to buy it online and wait for shipment) and immediately buy this book! I don't know which I like better.  Other reviewers can tell you what it's about, but frankly, with this author's books, you're better not knowing and just falling in love with reading it.  A perfect book for reading when things are crazy, life isn't as expected, or even when life is perfect.  It's a soul searching novel, asking you to delve deep into changing the situation to create happiness around you.
