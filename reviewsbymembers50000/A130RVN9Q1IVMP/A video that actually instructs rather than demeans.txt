 Finally!  A work out DVD that contains a leader who actually guides you through the work out without making you feel like (a) a clutz (b) the need to become anorexic (c) like you wasted your money on watching a moron on tv.  It's a great work out without having to leave your room!  It's no cardio workout, that's for sure. I've known some friends who were disappointed by that.  It's strength and toning.  A perfect adjunct to someone who has only been doing cardio. They provide many different ways of doing each of the moves as well.  More complex ways, simpler ways.  They have both an advanced and basic workout, as well as information on the basics of pilates too.  Don't be fooled by the yellow Dummies box, this is actually a very good DVD and if you're just getting started in Pilates, I'd highly reccomend it. (The four star rating is only because like the other reviewers say, it'd be nice if you could have an option to leave out the instructions each time, but they're not really that bothersome and I just get to work doing the move while she's still explaining it.)
