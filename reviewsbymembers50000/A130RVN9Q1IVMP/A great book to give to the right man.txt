 I read this book based off a reccomendation of a friend who buys it for all her guy friends.  I'll tell you, as a female, it is great to hear the views Eldredge has.  Men are not created by God to be weak kneed individuals, who exchange passion for femininity.  However, I do think he draws too many results that are geared towards men who are more outdoorsy or sports like.  I'm not sure the introverted bookworm may find this book that life altering.  I did give the book to my boyfriend after reading it because I could see it applying perfectly to his life.  For the man that longs to be courageous and on adventure and feels 'stuck' being the nice guy, Eldredge encourages him that the former is what God is searching for.  As Lewis put, and Eldredge perfectly quoted, God...and thus by example men shouldn't be safe, but GOOD.  A great read to motivate a man to be the man he really is or wants to be.  Let's go on adventure together!
