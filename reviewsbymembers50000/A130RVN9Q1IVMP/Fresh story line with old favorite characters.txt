 As for Jonathan Kellerman, his Alex Delaware novels are always the ones I prefer.  Lately, however, I kept noticing a simliar theme.  Delaware seems to get caught, the bad guy spills the beans and the table fortunately turns.  Not so in this book.  So kudos for creative new endings. Also, the thing that I loved about this book, was the insight into Milo Sturgis, his past and his mind.  No more just a sidekick, providing a little gun power when needed, Sturgis stands alone as Kellerman provides real emotional material to this assistant character. The mystery and story line, of course, are Kellerman's usual goodness, but personally, I liked the look into Milo's life and the uncertainty going on in Alex's life.  Makes me more interested in the next novel coming out than I have ever been before!
