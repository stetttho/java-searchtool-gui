 I was thumbing thru TV channels when I happened upon a moving scene in the TV show 'Alias'.  I don't watch the show really but I found myself mesmerized and glued to the screen to watch the whole of the scene playing before me.  What really captured me was the music playing in the background...one of the most beautiful songs I have ever heard.  As soon as it was done I jumped on the internet, found out the song was "Slumber My Darling" by Yo Yo Ma and Allison Krauss and that it was on this CD.  The most beautiful song in the world is now a part of my musical collection.  Fortunately, there are so many other wonderful songs on it as well..and James Taylor too!  Who would have ever thought the boob tube could open me up to a whole new style of music I had never really listened to before!
