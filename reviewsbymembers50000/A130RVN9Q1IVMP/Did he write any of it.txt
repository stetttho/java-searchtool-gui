 I have never seen a book with soo many quotes from other authors.  Every page it seems contains a few different excerpts from someone else's material.  Rather than be a unique or new information on the subject of human desires vs. God's, this was more of a collection of many people's insights without a true steady focus staying on one approach.  My eyes tended to skim and skip over the quotes as more of a distraction than insight and as a result I was often rereading and disappointed.  The overall content and message is ironically desirable, however the author's clarity is lacking somewhat.
