 I work in a Christian bookstore and held off buying this book for the longest time.  First off, it's small.  It looks kind of dinky and more like a nice little feel good gift book.  Plus, I hate buying things just because everyone else is. But as our sales informed me we were selling around 700 of them a month, I finally at least took a peek at one that was sitting on hold in customer service for a church bible study.  Within just a couple minutes, I could understand why this book is captivating so many people.  I can understand why its message is spreading like wildfire and I can understand why Jabez's prayer can change lives.  More importantly, after buying and reading the book (which is still a quick, but wonderfully in depth read) I am glad so many people are buying it.  For if we all learn to pray like this, what abundance our lives shall have!  *The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because I so enjoyed reading it I wish it were much much longer although it didn't need to be to get its message across*
