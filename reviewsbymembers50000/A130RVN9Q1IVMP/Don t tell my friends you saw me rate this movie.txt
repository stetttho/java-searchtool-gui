 I secretly rate this in my top twenty movies.  I'm too old too fall in love with the Dawson's Creek boy, so no, I don't like it because of him.  Sure, it's a bit of your typical sports movie, but it's a bit off edge as well.  It's funny as hell.  The characters are completely amusing and the southern hick accents top the charts.  I may live in Nebraska, but I am not a football fan at all, yet this football movie is great for any movie fan.   Believe me, you'll smile a lot, laugh a ton and sometimes wonder just what is going on.  Enough, I better get off before someone I know sees me writing this good review about a movie most critics didn't like.
