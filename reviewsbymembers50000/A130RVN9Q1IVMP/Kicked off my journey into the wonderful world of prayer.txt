 Over the course of many Young Life training sessions, I and several others, were guided through this book by the author, Hope MacDonald.  It contains invaluable insights and steps in order to develop a deepening prayer life.  I have read it several times as it's a wonderfully easy read and it constantly keeps me in check.  She presents prayer as not only possible, but powerful.  What an encouraging book!
