 It was an obscure book by an author I may have heard of.  I just saw him name on a Christian fiction list and figured what the heck.  This book, however, should be given to every Christian.  Based of the book of Acts and events in the book of Galatians, Edwards has created a book of fiction based on events so real that I was brought to tears to read of Paul's persecution, worried over the churches in Galatia, grinned at the always loveable Peter, but more importantly was inspired to search these books of the Bible more closely and deeper than I ever have before. I am truly amazed at the  men God used to spread his gospel so long ago.  Edwards did a fantastic job of keeping his story in line with Bible and inspires all readers to search beyond the fiction for the truth!
