 If you've been a long time Enya fan, you shouldn't be disappointed by this one.  But if you're not really an Enya fan, and hated 'Sail Away', you still should give this one a shot.  And if you're looking at this album because you liked the song from Sweet November, you definitely need to get this album.  It's the most relaxing CD I have ever owned.  I use to it study by.  I play it while I'm taking a bubble bath.  Heck, I put headphones on and listen to it while I'm falling asleep.  I have only owned this CD about two weeks, but I have probably listened to it on average 2-3 times a day!  FANTASTIC!  One of the all around best CD's I have bought in a looooong time.
