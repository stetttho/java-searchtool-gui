 Struggling with diets, weightloss and working out constantly can be a battle.  For the Christian dieter however, we are told to present all our requests before God.  How or why would God care about that kind of prayer?  I always felt it selfish, but knew I couldn't succeed even I didn't turn that part of my life over to Him as well.  This book provides not only a daily devotion that can be applied to many areas, not just limited to dieting, but also provides earnest prayers that you can use for a basis of your own to turn selfish desires into a godly will.  Not only will this book help you keep the desire and focus of not giving up on your weight loss program, whatever it may be, but it focuses your need on God and his importance over our struggle with weight.
