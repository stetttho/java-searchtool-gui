 Although A.I. is based off this book, it should be noted it's loosely based.  The short stories in this book that are on the supertoy theme are only a very small portion of the book.  They do not lend any insight, (as many other book which movies are based off of do), to what was going on in the movie or provide any answers to the Kubrick/Speilberg turn of events in the movie that made you wonder what was really going on in their heads.  This book may in fact be an excellent book, but I only bought it for the basis of being the basis for the movie and was sorely disappointed.  If only I had known it provided nothing much to A.I. except a very loose plot for the beginning of it and some names. I know this isn't a glowing review, but I only wish I had known it didn't give me that information before I had bought it and perhaps I'll prevent this book from being bought by a reader who can't appreciate it.
