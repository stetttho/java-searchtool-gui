 This isn't your typical American film.  And being Australian, thank God it's not.  There's no suspense building music interludes, no smooth special effects.  Instead, this movie forces itself into your mind based off sound acting and direction.  The different angles of camera shots, the jumpy nature of the film, all of it takes away from the stereo typical Hollywood drippings that clutter most films today.  Frances O'Connor well deserved the awards that she won for this movie.  It deserves its two thumbs up from Siskel and Ebert.  It's different than what somewhat drunk on Hollywood would expect, so it may not be for everyone.  But for anyone who finally wants to see good acting and a plot that keeps you guessing...it's worth the watching.
