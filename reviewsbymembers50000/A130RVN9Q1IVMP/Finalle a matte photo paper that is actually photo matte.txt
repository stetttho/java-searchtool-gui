 I have bought several other "quality" matte photo papers that are nothing more but a sheeny paper, stopping short of glossy.  Or else just a heavier paper, but not photo like at all.  This HP premium PLUS photo paper provides QUALITY matte photos.  Like the real thing, only immediate at your own home rather than the store.  I used the HP 7550 photo printer and print pictures that are top of the line photo quality.  I will never use another paper again for photos.  It's definitely worth the extra cost.
