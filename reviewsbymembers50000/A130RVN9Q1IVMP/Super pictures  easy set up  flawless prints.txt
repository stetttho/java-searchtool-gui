 I bought this printer, refurbished, after a lot of hemming back and forth between several other HP models.  The photo quality is wonderful, but I will admit, I use the premium plus quality paper.  If you want the quality prints, you need to use quality paper.  It prints a bit slow, (the only reason for four stars), but not excessively so.  I imagine it has to be set that slow in order to get the wonderful photo quality pictures I have been printing.  As far as the ink content that comes with the printer, I have printed out 20 8 x10's and still have yet to run out.  This printer is relatively quiet compared to a lot of printers I have heard.  It does take up a bit of desk space though, so if you're trying to squeeze a lot into a little space, this may not be the printer for you.  The set up was easy, printing pictures five minutes out of the box.  I haven't used the print from card feature yet, but it's nice to see it takes all types.  As a result, I haven't utilized the LCD screen.  But those two features are not what I bought this printer for.  One thing I have found, the picture quality is best when printed thru the HP software.  I tried printing thru Corel photo and colors weren't quite right.  When I switched to the software that came with the printer, not only was I astounded by the quality, I found the software program very easy to use and a nice photo set up.  I will still use the other software for any altering of pictures, but use the HP software for actual printing.  A great printer for a great price!
