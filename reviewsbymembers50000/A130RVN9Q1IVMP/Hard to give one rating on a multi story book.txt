 You've read it in the other reviews. 9 stories in all.  Some better than others, but each interesting in it's own right.  Although some endings dont turn out exactly as you wanted them to, Ruth Rendell does an excellent job of pulling you in, eager to read on.  My favorite story was "High Mysterious Union", sort of a weird Stepford wives kind of feel to it.  In all her stories, you have no idea where she is going with it and as a result, each story is kept fresh, the reader alert.  No predictably to rely on.  This was the first time for me reading this author, and I'd like to read some of her novels.  The short stories were just tease and honestly, I didn't know it was a book of short stories when I picked it up, or else I wouldn't have.  However, I wasn't disappointed and rather enjoyed them all.
