 This novel is almost a few stories within one story.  The present of a daughter dealing with her frustrating mother, raised in a different country and lifestyle, getting old and losing her memory.  The past of their growing up together.  The distant past of her mother growing up in a very different culture.  It makes you want to sit down and ask your mom: just what didn't you tell me about who you were before I knew you?  If you get the chance, get this book and listen to an unabridged version:  I don't remember who does the reading of the women, but the Chinese accents of the mother and auntie add so much to the tale.  It's a well written story that weaves back and forth flawlessly, seamlessly and effortlessly.  Your mind doesn't have to stop with each transition. Considerably better than the Joy Luck Club!
