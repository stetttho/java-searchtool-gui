 For some reason, most people don't know too much or have never heard about this Disney movie.  And I don't quite understand why, since it rates in some of my TOP Disney movies. First off, it carries a cast of today's well known actors in some of their earliest roles ever.  Kurt Russell as a kid (singing, dancing and playing a musical instrument at that!).  Goldie "Jeanne" Hawn as a bit part.  Not to mention Leslie Ann Warren, before she started playing loopy characters.  Buddy Ebsen, John Davidson (very pre-Hollywood Squares). Walter Brennan.  The story is about a musically talented family in which Grandpa organizes the family band to play at the democratic convention.  But his grandaughter Alice's love interest, Joe Carder, a Republican, convinces the family of which most are Republican to head out to the Dakotas (at that point still just one state).  The movie revolves gently around the politics of the Grover Cleveland re-election campaign against Benjamin Harrison with a focus on the comedy, the love quarrels and a ton of kids having fun.  The climactic end takes place at the Republican primary if I remember correctly, where jsut about everything goes haywaire and unexpected.  (Even as it did at the real election at that time.) It's nice getting the history lesson in without even realizing it!  The songs are upbeat and memorable, aside from one lousy Leslie Ann Warren song early on, and are still fun to sing and dance along with many years later.  My VHS of this movie has just about gone caput, so I'm very pleased that the DVD version is coming out.
