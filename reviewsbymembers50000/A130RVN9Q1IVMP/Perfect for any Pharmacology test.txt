 I used this book for review for my senior year pharmacology class as well as my Part II National Boards for Dentistry.  It is amazingly wonderful!  The book is filled with charts listing simliar drugs, side effects, modes of actions, etc.  It doesn't get lost in the details that you don't really need to know for your tests, but gives you all the important things that a professor or a national board may ask. A definite must have study tool for any pharmacology test!
