 I had picked up this book specifically because it had time travel involved and I'm a time travel nut.  In this particular book, the main character, Connie, "travels" to the future, the year 2137 supposedly.  Of course, since she is in a mental institution, there is a bit of the theme: Is she crazy or is it real?  The writing was well done, the character development was fantastic.  The time travel was left wanting.  This is a great drama story, a good woven tale.  I feel a bit jilted as the author left the ending too open ended, as if just to create a forever left argument over her schizophrenia or time travel.  That felt a bit too contrived.  A good open ending can let you argue one way or the other based upon your reading.  This book's open ending was too open...and no good basis could be derived for either telling.  A great read, a disappointing end.  I wouldn't have even normally left this review for a 3 star book, but with all these 5 star ratings which led to me buy it, I felt the whole spectrum needed to be represented.
