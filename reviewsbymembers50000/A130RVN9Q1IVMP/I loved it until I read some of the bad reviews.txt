 I am a time travel fan, so I picked up this book based on that aspect of it alone.  And maybe that's why I really enjoyed it!  Some reviewers rate Nicole, the main character, as a whiny uncaring person.  Okay, maybe she is, but she is a well developed and well written character.  You can easily slip into how she's feeling and reacting to all the situations.  In the course of the book, she gets sucked back to ancient Rome.  The authors have done a fabulous job of bringing ancient Rome to life!  Sure, the gal may have thrown her brain out the window, not remembering history and being not too cautious with local food, but SHE WAS JUST SUCKED BACK INTO TIME!  I think that gives her a little reasoning to not be reacting completely logically or level headed. So, in other words, if you like time travel, more specifically enjoy reading about time culture shock, this is a fantastic book to read.  If you like well developed characters, read this book, I knew I was going to like it before she went back to Rome by the character development alone. MORE IMPORTANTLY, dont let the reviewers that whine about the main character ruin it for you.  I was able to get lost in the story until I checked to see what people had to see about it. A fantastic collaboration and a nice addition to the historical time travel fiction!
