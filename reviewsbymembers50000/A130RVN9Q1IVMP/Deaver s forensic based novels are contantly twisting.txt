 I hated the movie the Bone Collector because I thought the ending was contrived and really nonessential.  However, I may want to read the book and see how it was really led to.  Coffin Dancer is now one of many "Lincoln Rhyme" novels I have read and I couldn't put it down.  Deaver constantly is twisting the plot and story around so you can never tell what is going to happen.  The forensic work done in the story is fascinating and I'm finally grateful for an author who doesn't write predictably.
