 Being brand new to the sport of golfing, I saw this book and figured it'd be a perfect read.  A woman's take on learning a man dominated sport.  However, this author seems to mistake stupidity for humor.  I'm not sure if she was just trying to get laughs in the book about her over the top ignorance, or was genuinely that much of a space cadet.  In any case, the humor fell short (aside from a couple chuckles).  And as for a novice experience, most novices don't get the chance to waltz around the country (for that matter, the globe) in order to try out golf pro lessons from all over.  And fortunately, if we do get some good lessons in, we don't act like complete morons in the process. The side story of a blossoming romance, also leaves the reader to think the author must be in a state of idioacy as she is head over heels falling for someone who will spend a ton of money specifically not to have them seen together in public.  Doesn't any one find this a bad judgement call?  In any case, I finished the book basically to see if she ever lost the flighty ditz persona, but nope, it didn't happen.  I actually reccomend no guys read this book in hopes you don't think all new women golfers are like Jessica Maxwell.
