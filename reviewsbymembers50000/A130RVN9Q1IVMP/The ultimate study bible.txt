 This bible is finally everything I have been looking for in a study bible.  It has all the versions I was interested in comparing and is more than just the New Testament.  At the Christian bookstores near my house, this bible runs almost twice the cost of what Amazon.com carries it for, so even if you're paying for shipping, this is a great deal!  Open anywhere in the book and find all four translations looking back at you so you can easily compare line to line, verse to verse.  Also included, being a study bible, are notes and references that lead you elsewhere to learn more about what you just read.  This is a must have for anyone delving further into their studies and having some limited room on their bookshelf!!
