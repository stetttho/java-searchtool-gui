 Many people have sent folks back into old Rome, but Rebecca East changes it up sending her main character Miranda, back to Pompeii before its destruction.  Set in a city made famous for its ruins, you can't help but be captivated by having it come to life!  I will agree with some of the reviews that some better editing could have been done as some paragraphs are repetitions of paragraphers earlier said in the book, however it only minially detracts from what is otherwise a great story of historical fiction. A modern day fairy tale!
