 If you read the first one, the Silas diary, you don't even need to read a review to want to read the second one.  But if you're still unsure, you have nothing to fear!  Once again, the new testament comes to life through Paul's journey.  The action, the passion, the love these first missionarie had for the world are fictionalized in these diaries and presented in such an awesome first hand view, you have to sit back in awe.  I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 star only because the first book made me cry.  This one didn't, although it was still moving.
