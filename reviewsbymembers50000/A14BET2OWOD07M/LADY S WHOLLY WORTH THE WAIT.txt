 Scroll through to the DSM review, "Classic, Classy, Soulful Woman, etc." :    TIME STANDS STILL Quite.   I shall attempt no interminable diatribe (as I am irrevocably wont to do) on the world, and what it has been like having to wait nearly a decade for this voice.  I likewise have nothing of consequence to say about her new music, nothing that will do it justice.  You may look for the chroniclers to do that more elegantly in the coming months.   What I can say is that fluidity, a kind of fluidity has returned.  Movement.  She could never really leave.  That pale, importunate voice bears a tinge of permanence.  But LOVERS ROCK is something very like the first time; she's come back.  So the sky is back to shimmering blue, the best of the wind is his subtlety, elusive, carrying the ever-changing face of clouds.  Solitude is once again bearable; intimacy is once again made easy.  And a satiated silence is a welcome after clamouring for her to speak again.  After all this wait, time stands still...and she moves me.  She is SADE.
