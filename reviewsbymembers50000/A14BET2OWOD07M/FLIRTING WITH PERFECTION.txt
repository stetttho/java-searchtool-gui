 It is difficult to pin-point exactly Kurt Elling's strenghts: Is it his impeccable, diamond-cut vocal clarity? Is it his intimate knowledge and preternatural intuition for the lyric? Or is it the lithe, irrespressible flexibility of his baritone voice? Fount of improvisitional fluidity?   Within any one cut from this new production, shimmering glimpses of all of the above appear, alternating and overlapping with the flash and rapidity of lightning--or, more commonly, all at once. These are not mutually exclusive. These are qualities which define the scope of Kurt Elling's talent. TWILIGHT is ushered from the softer side of his ability, both in vocal presentation and in its arrangements (due, in large part, to his accomplice in perfection's pursuit, Laurence Hobgood).  He can still display that uncommon agility of his phrasing and diction, but it is almost an illusion of opposites; his usual vocal strength like steel draped in velvet, or sound as oak yet long and sustained like a supple reed and leaf of an orchid. The first track, "Moonlight Serenade," best indicates this mark, and what direction the playlist takes.  Best yet is the invigourating improvisational license the production takes without seeming to meander and scatter all about the boards, as in Sondheim's, "Not while I'm Around." It is a credit to the arrangements that while the sound remains fresh, it manages to also have the polished sound of a full orchestra's backing.  This is jazz from its purest ore, but burnished to glistening lustre. There is a gem of number delivered, unheralded in the jacket and liner notes, with breath-takingly hushed extravagance--"en Francais!" Perhaps this offering will finally capture Elling's elusive Grammy win. If so, how perfectly ironic it should be:  The almost whisper-like subtlety of this recording capturing the ebullient acclaim of the Academy and his peers.   My but how perfectly he flirts.
