 I agree with Sir Kingsley that nothing will ever replace FOWLER'S, though many have tried (Merriam Webster is a respected, wholly American enterprise).  The beloved M.E.U. remains the standard, to be sure, but Amis's offereing is more an exercise in side-splitting sardonic humor about  the common mistakes in English usage than the prosaic utility of its  revered predecessor.  Some of the funniest examples are the most useful,  the most erudite being the most interesting.  But I do not agree, as some  of its critics maintain, that this is only meant for the people of Britain.   Sir Kingsley is a thorough-going defender of "Americanisms."  I  recommend you obtain this volume for your work desk, but also for your  favorite reading place.  And be prepared to laugh out loud!
