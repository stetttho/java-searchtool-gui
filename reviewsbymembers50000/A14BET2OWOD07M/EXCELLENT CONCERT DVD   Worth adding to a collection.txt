 In comparing the VHS version of this title to the DVD issue, I must say that the result of publishing this exciting concert footage in digital format has rid the production of the sole blemish on which I remarked on the VHS review:  The brightness of the stage lighting and its flooding the lens, et al. The problem has been wholly removed in the transfer to DVD! This is a concert that will not tire its audience, regardless of how many times it is played.  Its staying power is that it is an excellent concert production.  First, there is the larger playlist which is the initial attraction.  The Juan Carlos Calderon Medley and the "Up-Tempo Medley" do not appear on the Compact Disc soundtrack (ref. amazon.com review for CD of this title). Then there is the incomparable artist himself, performing at his absolute best.  The talented and expert musicians have become something of a pillar and true hallmark of his concert tours.  Yet it is LM's constant communication with his audience, whether demonstrated in the midst of a favourite song's interpretation, or with his easy charm in speaking to the adoring fans in the various sections of the venue, that makes watching him such a completed pleasure.  It is about familiarity, and the illusion of intimacy.  One almost feels that one is in the company of an admired and trusted friend.  He has grandly accompanied us in our most private, innumerable moments.  It seems right now, after all, to accompany him as he takes the stage.   A further guilty pleasure of this particular publication is that one is able to pause undistortedly the few scenes that show an elated Mariah Carey in the front rows happily singing along with the songs, and offering her applause to her man of that time.  If I may be permitted this petulance and trite remark on this, it was sweet to see.  And it may be added that this practice of their's was then mutual.  His presence likewise was reported on regarding several of her concert dates, one of which I was in attendance and witnessed first-hand.  In the redoubtable world of pop music and superstars, this was an unexpected, almost innocent pleasure.   The serious collectors among us, present company included, will not quickly pass on this production.  Indeed, the beneficent gods of marketing at WEA Latin have correctly anticipated our incessant clamourings for this artist and have presented both the DVD and VHS issues of this title in collectors' boxes.  Now our list of demands, ever on the fringes of grievance, has been reduced thusly to:      a)  a SERIOUS anthology--with personal liner notes          [e. g. JUST FOR THE RECORD, B. Streisand]      b)  an exhaustive, exclusively Mariachi production, perhaps          as a "double-live concert" publication--too long in           coming      c)  an English-language-only production--anything...surprise          us
