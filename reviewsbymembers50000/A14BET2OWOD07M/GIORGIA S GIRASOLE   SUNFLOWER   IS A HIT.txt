 If you do not know who Giorgia is, go to Pavarotti, the cd he recorded live as "Pavarotti and Friends 2(London Records)," the one from Modena, on which Bryan Adams is the featured artist, among others.  Giorgia  is the Italian singer who performs a haunting, moving tribute to Freddie  Mercury by singing his "Who Wants to Live Forever?" Listen to  that performance.  If you are not immediately moved, stirred even to  emotion, then you are not fully awake in this life! Bottom line?   ANYTHING by Giorgia is good, but GIRASOLE, is amazing, a delight,  empassioned, and nothing like what you would expect as a listener who  speaks no Italian.  Get this CD and get ready to jam, jump up and dance,  and wish you could understand that language!  Happy listening!
