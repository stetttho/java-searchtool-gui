 I first read this book in the summer of 1975, and it was the first Clavell book I had ever touched. I have bought several others on the strength of my appreciation for Shogun alone, though they have almost all earned similar  kudos.  The story is incredibly detailed; the threads and points of view  disparate but handled with fantastic finesse and attention to interlocking  them into each other; and the ending a surprise (to me at least), but with  a feeling of massive inexorability about it that provides fulfillment and  complete closure.  If you're looking for good, absorbing, exciting, and  entertaining literature with which you can settle down for several hours,  and are willing to have your eyes opened by one of the best introductions  I've ever encountered to a truly non-Western culture, please give this book  a try.
