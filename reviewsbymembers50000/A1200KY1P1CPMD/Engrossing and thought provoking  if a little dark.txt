 Gibson has been hailed as a major force in the cyberpunk movement, andto some extent I must agree. This story is set in what could be ourfuture -- and not so far off, at that -- and the picture painted is really quite bleak. If you've seen the motion picture 'Bladerunner,' you'll find familiar the dark mood and casual acceptance of advanced technology used for mundane things. Like most of his other works, I find Neuromancer to be gripping but a little disturbing and depressing. This is serious reading, not something I'd recommend for filling a sunny idle afternoon.  Warning: I'd give this book a 'PG' rating because of the disturbing themes, language, and some sexual situations.
