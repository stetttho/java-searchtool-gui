 Book 3 of The Seventh Sword [conclusion]                                                     The final book in this series, 'Destiny' isn't as easily read on its own as the first and middle books ('The Reluctant  Swordsman' and 'The Soming of Wisdom'). However, this is that rare thing: a  trilogy conclusion that really concludes the story. It's an happy ending,  no fear -- and it leaves you feeling good and fulfilled, so there's no need  for Duncan to write more. (It *could* be done, of course, as McCaffrey did  with 'Nerilka's Story,' but it isn't a foregone conclusion that it will be  -- or even should be.) Excellent reading; a real page-turner.                                                      This one's rated 'G' by me.
