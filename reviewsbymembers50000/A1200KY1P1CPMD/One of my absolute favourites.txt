 How to say it without gushing?  This story is simply outstanding.  The character portrayals, and development, are excellent; the societal predictions absolutely, frighteningly, believable. Better by far than "Alas, Babylon", in addition to being terrific SF this counts as  the best 'end of the world' story I've ever read.  I've read it so many  times the original copy wore out.
