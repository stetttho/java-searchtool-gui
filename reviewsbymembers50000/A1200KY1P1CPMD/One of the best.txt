 Alexei Panshin's 'Anthony Villiers Adventures' are among the most treasured books on my shelves. They look at the world in a wacky way that is nevertheless perfectly reasonable.  This one, the second in the series  (which regrettably never got beyond the third volume), is as excellent as  the other two.  If you can find a copy in your local public library, you  should check it out.  If you can find a copy for sale, you should  definitely buy it -- unless fun reading isn't your cup of tea.
