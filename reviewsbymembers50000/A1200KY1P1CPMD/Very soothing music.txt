 I have a stack of about a dozen CDs to which I listen while driving, and while I try to go through them in sequence, listening to each in turn until I'm bored with it, I keep coming back to this one, frequently taking it out  of order. There's just something about it that makes the frustrations and  irritations of driving easier to handle.  There's one track in particular  to which I listen repeatedly if I'm feeling down; it invariably makes me  feel better.  Probably not the most glowing of reviews, but I'll let my  rating of 4 count instead of the prose.
