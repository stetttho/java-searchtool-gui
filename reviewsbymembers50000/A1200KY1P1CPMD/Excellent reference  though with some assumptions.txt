 I bought this book because I needed to learn about anti-spam measures using sendmail features the 1st edition didn't cover.  While the book wasn't as detailed in those areas as I'd like, it certainly provided me  with enough info to accomplish what I needed to do, and has been an  excellent reference for basic sendmail questions I've had since.  It *has*  to be a pretty good book if it helped someone with essentially no sendmail  experience at all set up anti-spam stuff!
