 Book 1 of The Apprentice Adept                                                     I can't really explain why I keep coming back to this book; it really isn't particularly great.  Good, yes, but not great. Perhaps it's  because Anthony manages to mix two distinct technological and magical  milieux in a single story, or because one of the principal characters is an  unicorn. I'm not sure, but I still like it.  The culture on Proton is  pretty bizarre, but understandable and funny once you accept the basic  tenets.  Anthony certainly does have a way with puns and  paradoxes. Warning: Though this book contains nothing explicit, some of  the themes are definitely adult in nature. I'd give this a 'PG' rating.
