 This has been one of my favourites ever since my sister gave it to me on my 11th birthday and introduced me to Thurber's delightful sideways view of the world. Like 'Rocky and Bullwinkle,' it's ostensibly intended for  younger audiences but a joy full of gentle humour for adults as well.                                                      Rated 'G' for 'great fun!'
