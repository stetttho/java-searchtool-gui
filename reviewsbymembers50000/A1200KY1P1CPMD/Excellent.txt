 There's really no other way to put it: This book is just plain fun. I should have been so lucky as to have had such experiences when I was at University. Elves, magic, librarians, bullies, and an irrepressiblly  good-natured college student make for an highly enjoyable romp through  might-have-been. (Or perhaps "might-be" if there's any justice in  the world.) There are at least two sequels in the 'Mythology' universe,  'Mythology Abroad,' and (I think) 'Higher Mythology.' I highly recommend  this title, 'Mythology 101,' for light reading when you need something  cheery and humourous.                                                      Definitely rated 'G.'
