 Gerritsen has a knack for using technical jargon and explaining it soon enough and in such a way that the reader feels informed rather than ignorant and irritated. Her familiarity with aspects of the medical profession is very obvious, and she makes the reader feel like an insider, too. 'Harvest' is a fairly standard mystery novel set in an unusual environment, and well-written -- I had trouble putting it down. The predicament of the heroine at the denouement is truly horrifying. I give 'Harvest' 4 out of 5 stars (not 5 because parts are a wee bit too predictable) and rate it 'PG.'
