 I finally found a copy of David Brin's [fairly new] novel _Kiln People_ in paperback, in an airport shop. I had been looking forward to it ever since he told me about it a couple of years ago. As I expected, it was an engrossing read and well worth the wait. The social, moral, and ethical issues were laid out in Brin's typically masterful style. The only thing that kept this book from being a clear 100% winner for me was the swerve into metaphysics near the end -- but that's just me. A very thought-provoking and entertaining book; highly recommended and with a PG rating.
