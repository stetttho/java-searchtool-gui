 Book 1 of The Adventures of Conrad Stargard  Yet another displacement story, and the first of a moderately long series, 'The Cross-Time Engineer' is very plausible and is told first-person by the protagonist. Frankowski has done a very good job (IMHO) of depicting the attitudes and prejudices of an educated young man from the end of the XXth century. More, his work instilled in me a lot of respect for the Polish people, and a tiny yearning to learn Polish. Once you accept the basic premise of someone being cast back in time, your suspension of disbelief won't be disturbed by the hero pulling fantastical solutions out of his hat. He suffers discomfort (and comfort!) and gets confused and makes mistakes like everyone else. Each book in this series can stand on its own, though it becomes more and more difficult toward the end.   I'd give this a 'G' rating despite the frequent (but non-explicit) sexual references. They're treated tastefully enough for younger readers, I think, although the book wouldn't suffer if there were fewer of them. (MHO.)
