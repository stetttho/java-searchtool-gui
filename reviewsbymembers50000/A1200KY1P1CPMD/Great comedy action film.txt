 This is an excellent film.  I'm not sure whether it's primarily a comedy or an action picture; there's plenty of both.  There's enough going on to induce video-game-English-syndrome, in which you tensely twist your body  this way and that as you watch. :-)  Chan and Tucker work well together and  seem to enjoy doing so, which helps. I forget whether I first saw this in  the theatre or on video, but I think highly enough of it that I bought it.   Your mileage may vary, but you'll probably enjoy it quite a lot -- I  recommend at least checking it out at the rental store.
