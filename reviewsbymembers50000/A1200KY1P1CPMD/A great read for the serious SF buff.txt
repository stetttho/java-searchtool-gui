 In 'Earth,' Brin manages to project one possible future based upon the ecological and sociopolitical problems facing us at the end of the twentieth century. I think some of his predicted technological advances --  including the one key to the entire book -- are on shaky scientific ground,  but it's a good thought-provoking book if you can suspend disbelief. And  who knows? Maybe it's not so shaky as I believe. Your forehead should be  furrowed when you finish reading it.  Warning: I consider this to be a  'PG' rated book. Not because of any sexual situations (what there are of  such are handled tastefully and obliquely), but because I think some of the  sociopolitical predictions and depictions could be a little disturbing.
