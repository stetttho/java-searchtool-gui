 I waited a long time before deciding to to buy and read this book.  Heinlein was the author of the first SF I ever read; I didn't read anything by Panshin until twenty years later.  However, I like them both, in  different ways and for different reasons.  While I cannot say I agree with  all of the observations, criticisms, and conclusions Panshin has made about  Heinlein -- I don't -- "Heinlein in Dimension" *did* make me  think a bit more about the Heinlein I've read. Seeing how Panshin viewed  him and his work has made me consider my own opinions on the matter. If  you're looking for an RAH cheerleading book, this isn't it.  If you're  looking for a completely objective and unbiased book about Heinlein and his  work, I don't think this is it either.  If, however, you're familiar with  Heinlein (even a fan), are looking for someone *trying* to be objective  about the subject, and can read it with the continual remembrance that  you're reading someone's *opinion*, then you might find "Heinlein in  Dimension" worthwhile -- in viewpoint-stretching ways if not as pure  analysis.
