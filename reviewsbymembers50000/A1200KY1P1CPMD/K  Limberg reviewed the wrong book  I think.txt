 Just a note of clarification: I suspect that that K. Limberg was thinking  of a different book when writing the last review.  There are at least two  books that might have prompted it: one is essentially a copy of the source  code ('Apache Server Commentary'), and the other is a copy of the  documentation on the Web site (I have a copy, but can't remember the  title).  I can assure you that 'Apache Server Unleashed' is neither of  these; it contains hundreds of pages of technical custom-written text that  appear nowhere else.  I know, because I wrote a bunch of it. :-) BTW, the  5-star rating I've given is because I have to give *some* rating, and to  offset the single star from what I sincerely believe is a mistaken review.
