 I was offered the opportunity to read a galley of this book before it went into print, and I can say without reservation that I was not disappointed. There are several concurrent plots (pun intended), and the third-person narration shifts from one to the next very smoothly. There's an Andromeda Strain quality of inexorability and gathering velocity as more pieces of the puzzle fall into place for the reader, leading to a not entirely predictable climax. As with so many things, there is no one clear solution to the moral and ethical questions posed by the book, and the ending leaves some tempting teasers lying about for the reader to sieze and worry at if so inclined. It is clearly a story of how one set of (fictional) people reacted to the dilemmas, and I found it difficult not to keep asking myself, 'How would I have reacted?' The necessary explanations of the highly-technical processes and jargon peculiar to genetic research were on the whole handled very well; there was no sense of being 'talked down to' although I think some of the explanations could have been a bit clearer than they were. On the whole, I found the topic intriguing, the treatment thought-provoking, and the style and presentation very good. I give GermLine four stars out of five, and a rating of PG due to some of the fairly graphic descriptions.
