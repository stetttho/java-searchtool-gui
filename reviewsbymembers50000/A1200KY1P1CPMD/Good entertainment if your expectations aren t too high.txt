 This is the only one of Hubbard's works that I've read in its entirety. Some of the phrasing is a little odd, I get a sense that Hubbard was fumbling a bit as he tried to tell the story, and a few of the scientific  issues I find somewhat suspect, but it's still a good read though quite  long. In some ways it's like a moderately good mystery: you can see as each  major crux is reached that you had the necessary information to deduce it.  I think this is best read in installments; you're likely to get severe  mental indigestion if you try to read it without any breaks.                                                      Definitely a 'G' rating. Not only  are there no sexual situations, but even the violence inherent in genocide  is treated distantly and with no gory particulars.
