 Even if director Ron Howard directs nothing but dogs for the rest of his career, he made himself a place in history with this film.  (He has also clearly made the jump from one side of the camera [The Music Man, Happy  Days, Andy Griffith, ...] to the other -- no mean feat.)  The  cinematography is superb, the acting outstanding, and the story incredibly  intense and moving.  (The liftoff scene always chokes me up, for instance.)   This film sends a visceral message of why the outreach into space must not  be abandoned.  And don't miss the alleged uncredited cameo appearance of  Jim Lovell, the actual Apollo 13 mission commander, as the skipper of the  recovery ship Iwo Jima. If you believe in the space programme, this can be  a real uplifting tear-jerker; if you don't support the exploration of  space, it does an excellent job of depicting the passion and commitment of  those who do.  A must-see.
