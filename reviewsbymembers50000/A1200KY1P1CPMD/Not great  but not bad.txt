 I read this on the recommendation of a publisher acquaintance (no, he didn't publish this one. :-) who, like me, likes SF.  While the action kept me turning the pages, and the details kept things interesting, I would have liked more character development and plot twists.  There's just a little  too much predictability about the Big Picture here.  But for an afternoon's  read, this is quite enjoyable.
