 Another sword-and-sorcery transference novel. Our hero, fresh out of a non-war in Southeast Asia, gets co-opted into an otherworld quest for the most fabulous object in the universe -- which has been stolen by the  nogoodniks, of course. When he wrote this, Heinlein merged some of the  aspects of his juvenile books (in which the goals are clear-cut and there  are few grey areas), with those of some of his later works, which feature  more moral dilemmas and a lot of attention paid to the Barnyard Dance.                                                      Warning: I think Heinlein  was just beginning to head down his 'free-love' path when he wrote this  book, so I'd give this a 'PG' rating.
