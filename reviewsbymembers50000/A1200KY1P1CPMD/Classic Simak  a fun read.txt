 Simak has written a lot of books and stories about the presence of the supernatural in mundane situations, but I can't recall one that does it so well -- nor so whole-heartedly -- as 'Reservation.' Ghosts, time travel,  goblins, frie, dragons, politics, aliens, Neanderthals -- all intermix  here on an University campus. This is another one of those books that draws  you in and makes you feel welcome and part of the action. While not  necessarily faithful to legend and myth, it's still grand tale.                                                      Good for all ages; I'd say it's  rated 'G.'
