 I'm not sure why I picked up this book; it was either in an airport shop or while shopping for groceries. :-) Regardless of my reasons at the time, this was my first experience with Gerritsen, who is now definitely on my list of authors to watch.  This is a very gripping story, and well worth the read.  I give it 5.0 stars for the writing and drama, and 4.75 stars for the science fiction.  (There are a couple of issues I found the tiniest bit unacceptable.)  I'd rate this 'PG' because of some of the graphic descriptions, but otherwise 'G' for 'Great.'
