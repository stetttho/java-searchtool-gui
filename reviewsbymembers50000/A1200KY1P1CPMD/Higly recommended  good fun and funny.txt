 Book 2 of the chronicles of Hobart Floyt and Alacrity Fitzhugh                                                     While you could read this book by itself, it really needs the background of the predecessor volume, 'Requiem  for a Ruler of Worlds,' in order to shine its brightest. The companions in  misfortune that were introduced in Requiem continue their adventures  through dens of techno-cannibals, lairs of scum and villainy, abject  poverty, fabulous wealth, battles with clone librarians, negociations with  juvenile gangs, and intoxicated funerals for varnished aliens. Every bit as  good as Requiem.                                                     Like  the previous book in the series ('Requiem for a Ruler of Worlds'), I rate  this one 'G.' I consider the content of this                                                    book to be suitable reading for all ages.
