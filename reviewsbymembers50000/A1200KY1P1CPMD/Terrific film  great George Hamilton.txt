 George Hamilton buckles a comedic swash like no other.  The impressive talent with which he plays his various roles in this film -- and the way he makes fun of his own good looks -- pushes this up to the 5-star level for  me. If you've ever seen the original Zorro film, this parody is nothing  short of hilarious.
