 Book 3 of the chronicles of Hobart Floyt and Alacrity Fitzhugh                                                     The third and final novel in the Hobart Floyt and Alacrity Fitzhugh series, following 'Requiem for a Ruler  of Worlds' and 'Jinx on a Terran Inheritance.' It continues the chronicle  of the madcap adventures of this odd couple, in the same fast-paced,  free-wheeling, and thoroughly enjoyable style as the first two. It, too,  can stand on its own -- but is more enjoyable if one is steeped in the  wonder and hilarious hysteria of the preceding titles. I consider it a  significant tragedy that Brian Daley died of cancer in 1996 before he could  continue the stories (if such was indeed his intention). Requiescat en  pace, mon ami.                                                      'G'-rated according to me. I consider the content of this book to be  suitable reading for all ages.
