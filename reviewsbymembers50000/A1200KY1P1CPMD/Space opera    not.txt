 Good SF from an actor is not what I expected.  I picked up the book in an airport just for old times' sake, and was more than pleasantly surprised.  The technology is believable, the situations and conflicts well-described, the flow from scene to scene is smooth, scene changes don't leave you  teetering and feeling dissatisfied, and the character development is quite  good.  While Shatner's Tek novels clearly show the influence of his mentor  (Ron Goulart), Doohan has outdone him in establishing a unique 'voice.'   Stirling's expertise at depicting elements of conflict meshes  indistinguishably. If you're an SF reader, and/or a Trekkie, this book is  outstanding and well worth it.  It stands well alone, so you needn't get  the next in the series to achieve a sense of closure.
