 Book 1 of The Seventh Sword                                                     While the formula is now become traditional (man from our world transported to a different universe), this story is an absolute delight to  read. The prose is very descriptive and evocative without being flowery or  tedious (a very difficult tightrope to walk), the characters quickly  develop depth and personalities, and it is very, very easy to suspend  disbelief and immerse yourself in the story. The ending prepares you for  the next book without really being a cliff-hanger. Sword and sorcery, sort  of -- with a twist. Does Clarke's Law explain everything? You decide..                                                      I'd rate this 'G.'
