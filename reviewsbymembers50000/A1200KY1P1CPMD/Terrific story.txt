 One of the archetypal computer hacker stories, amazingly durable considering the advances in the industry in the years since it was written. Also one of the earliest books of which I know dealing with artificial  intelligence and social responsibility. A good, fun read for adults, but  not one I'd suggest trying to "whip off" in an afternoon. Read it  slowly and carefully.                                                      Warning: I think I have to rate this 'PG' due to mild sexual situations,  language, and thematic content.
