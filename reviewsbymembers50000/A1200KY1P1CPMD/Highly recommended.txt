 Book 1 of the chronicles of Hobart Floyt and Alacrity Fitzhugh                                                     Absolutely hilarious. Daley describes a fairly distant future in which I wouldn't mind                                                     living, complete with aliens, ray-guns,  Galactic gypsies, flying bicycles, starships,                                                     automatic taxidermy machines, villains, heroes, and  True Love. The main characters                                                     are a mousy little bureaucrat from isolationist Earth and a chaotic  and flamboyant ABS                                                     (Able-Bodied Starman). Just good fun; very hard to put down. One of my  absolute                                                    favourites when  I want a laugh.                                                     Rated  'G'; I consider the content of this book to be suitable reading for all  ages.
