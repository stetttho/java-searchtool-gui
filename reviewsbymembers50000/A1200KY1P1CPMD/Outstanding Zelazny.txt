 This is not what I'd call 'light reading.'  It needs to be approached with a willingness to be thoughtful, ponder events, and retain lots of elements in memory as you read.  If you try to read it too quickly, you're probably  going to have to read it at least once more to pick up the bits you missed  -- and it's well worth a second read, or a third, or ..., even if you took  your time. This is Science Fiction, not space opera, and it focusses on  personal and societal response to change imposed from without, rather than  the razzle-dazzle glitz of Clarke's Law technology. (Of course, I'm a big  Zelazny fan.. :-)
