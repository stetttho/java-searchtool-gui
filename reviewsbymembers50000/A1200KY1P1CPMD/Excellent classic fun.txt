 Although it deviates (!) from Verne's story, this film is a classic. James Mason does his usual outstanding acting -- for once as a good guy rather than a villain -- and there's a good bit of humour, not least provided by Pat Boone as one of Mason's students. Suspend disbelief for an afternoon and watch this light romp. Rated 'G' for sure.
