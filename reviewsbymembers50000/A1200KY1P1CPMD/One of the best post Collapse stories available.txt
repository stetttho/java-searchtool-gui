 This is a classic end-of-the-world novel. The plot develops with rigourous precision and inexorable realism; there's nothing Brin depicts that would be unreasonable should a global A-B-C war actually engulf the world  to-morrow. Scary in its plausibility, and heartening because of its  hopefulness, this is a wonderful book.                                                      Warning: I'd call this a 'PG-13' book, primarily because  of some of the violence.
