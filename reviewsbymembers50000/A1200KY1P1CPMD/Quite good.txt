 Book 2 of 'Incarnations of Immortality ' This was the first book of this series that I read, and I picked it up primarily because I liked the cover art and was familiar with the author. It seems I like Anthony's work less  and less with each new title he writes -- I find his characters' thoughts  too dialogue-ish, overbearing, and belabouring of the obvious -- but I  still enjoy this title a lot despite a couple of logical  inconsistencies. Warning: Though this book contains nothing explicit,  some of the themes are definitely adult in nature. I'd give this a 'PG'  rating.
