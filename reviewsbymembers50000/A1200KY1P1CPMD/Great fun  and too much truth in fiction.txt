 I first heard about this film from a co-worker, several years after it came out, and didn't actually get to see it until I encountered it in a video rental store (wonder of wonders!).  Some years later I had the  opportunity to meet Mike Jittlov and his mother, and they're just great  people.  The film itself is terrific!  This is definitely a cult classic,  with Web sites and a newsgroup dedicated to it; it would have been a  box-office hit, and a best-selling video, if Hollywood politics hadn't  caused it to be pulled from theatres bare days after its release.  Now it's  hard to find in any medium except unauthorised low-quality videotape  copies, although 1600 laser discs were pressed and sometimes show up at  auctions.  If you can find this film, get it and watch it.  Twice. And then  step through it to see all the hidden sight-gags and messages.  And then  contemplate: This film was made using the technology of the early Eighties,  and mostly by hand; what could Jittlov do now with access to the current  state of the animation art?
