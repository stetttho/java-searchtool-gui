 I picked this up (or it was loaned to me) because I was tickled by the title. It's a very entertaining story about a technologically advanced traveller's visit to a fairly primitive world, narrated by one of the  primitives. It's an hilarious treatment of Clarke's Law in action, and a  colossal pun near the end will delight long-time SF readers enormously.                                                      This is definitely a  'G'-rated title in my book.
