 Standins and doubles for politicians and celebrities are nothing new. Usually, though, their duties are pretty simple and short-lived, and it's what they do for a living. This is an interesting story told first-person  about a situation in which nothing is normal and none of the usual  conditions apply. Heinlein takes the opportunity to insert some sly  governmental criticism. Nothing about the story is really inevitable, but  it appears that way when looking back on it.                                                      Definitely a 'G' rating for this.
