 The action sequences in this film are outstanding, as you might expect; I  have yet to see a Jackie Chan film that disappointed me in that respect.  However, other aspects of this film *did* disappoint me.  The flow was  choppy, a lot of the dialogue was delivered woodenly, in many scenes people  stood about in somewhat unnatural poses, and the two female characters were  barely more than window dressing, with mediocre lines poorly delivered.  I  don't know if this is the first film Ser Chan has directed, but IMHO he  needs to work on it some more.  There's a lot of potential here.  There was  much less humour in this picture than in the other Jackie Chan films I've  seen, and I definitely missed that humour.  Even with its flaws, I give  this four stars, and think it's worth at least renting if not owning (I own  it, if that's any indication :-).  It's a good film; enjoy it -- but be  aware that (IMHO) there are even better Jackie Chan films out there.
