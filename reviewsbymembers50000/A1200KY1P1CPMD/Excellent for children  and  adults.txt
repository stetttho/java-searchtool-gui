 I'd heard about the furor over whether the Harry Potter books were suitable for children, and so I welcomed the opportunity to read it when the lady sitting next to me on an airplane let me borrow it for the flight.   (Fortunately it's light reading and I'm a fast reader.)  Our conclusions  were the same: it certainly *is* suitable for children, and adults as well.   It's fun, light, and describes the activities of a schoolboy trying to be  good (probably harder than most real schoolboys).  Personally, I saw no  hint of any of the darker aspects I've heard ascribed to it; I rather  suspect the ascribers hadn't read it, but were jerking their knees over  'hot-button' words like 'magic' and 'sorcery.'  I wouldn't hesitate to  recommend this book to *anyone*, of any age.
