 What if you were a top athlete and volleyball player.. What if your girlfriend was being experimented upon by a nerdy psychology student.. hey, hang on! No, she's been kidnaped by other dragons! *Other* dragons? Yes,  suddenly you're a dragon: big, strong, able to fly, with a craving for gold  and a reputation for being.. well, slow. The Dark Powers are closing in,  and you'll need all the help you can get, especially from Carolinus of the  Tinkling Water, to get out of this one..  Excellent fun, setting the  stage for a number of books which followed 'Dragon's success.  'G'  rating; good reading for all ages.
