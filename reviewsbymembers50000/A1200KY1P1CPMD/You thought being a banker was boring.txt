 A collection of chronologically-ordered stories from the life of a single de Camp character, Willie Newbury, banker and unwilling focus of occult forces. This reads like a cross between 'Ripley's Believe It or Not' and O  Henry, as perhaps edited by Rube Goldberg. Quite a lot of fun.                                                      Rated 'G.' Suitable for all ages.  Some of the humour is a little sophisticated, but that doesn't detract from  the fun, IMHO.
