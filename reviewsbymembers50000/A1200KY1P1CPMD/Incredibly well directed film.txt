 This film is definitely on my Top Ten list.  Not only is it entertaining in itself, but it is an outstanding example of the director's craft.  It's full of little touches, such as the spoon rack behind Neo's head just  before the spoon-bending sequence, or the repeated visual effect of the  matrix code (such as in the rain on the car windows and the soap on the  office window).  I've seen the film at least half a dozen times, and I pick  up something new each time.. it's a gem on multiple levels.  It's a bit  dark, though nowhere near as dark as BladeRunner or 12 Monkeys.  Well worth  seeing at least once.
