 Everything about this film is simply great.  The acting -- of all roles -- is excellent, the scenery terrific, the directing outstanding. I bought this film as soon as I was able to find it for sale, and I can't count the  number of times I've seen it.  It's a light fantasy, with great comedic  scenes; just right for those times when you want to sit down and laugh and  be entertained. See the film; you'll probably buy it.
