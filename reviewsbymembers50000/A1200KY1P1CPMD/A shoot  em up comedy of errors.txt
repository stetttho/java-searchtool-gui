 This is in my Top Ten video list, up near the top. Arnold Schwartzenegger surely has come a long way from the no-forehead strong-man of "Hercules in New York"!  With good direction -- and Cameron is  among the best -- he can reveal his excellent acting skills.  Jamie Lee  Curtis and Tom Arnold play their roles with their usual excellence, as  well.  And Charlton Heston makes a brief but intense appearance, in one of  his few roles wearing trousers.  Part of the comedy is situational,  involving the interaction of the different elements of which *you*, the  viewer, are aware -- and part of it is actual humourous dialogue and  interaction between the characters.  This is an excellent film to accompany  a pizza with friends (yours, not the pizza's).
