 When I bought this book, I had only a smattering of JavaScript awareness.  I purchased it primarily so that I could understand what the JavaScript I saw in Web page sources was doing; for that purpose, this book was quite  adequate.  Even though the ...for Dummies books aren't intended to be read  serially from front to back, I found doing so a big help in getting the  most I could out of this book.  Since I got out of it what I wanted, my  main complaint is the description and use of non-standard HTML elements  (such as the 'layer' tag) without noting their non-standardness, and  failing to tag documents using advanced (i.e., HTML 4) features with the  appropriate DOCTYPE tag.  This can lead to documents that don't comply with  the HTML specifications.
