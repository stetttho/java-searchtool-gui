 Book 2 of The Seventh Sword                                                     This book picks up where 'The Reluctant Swordsman' leaves off. It can stand on its own for fun reading, because the style remains the same,  but the series really should be read in sequence to get the full effect --  it's an epic, not a collection of semi-related vignettes. Whatever.. If you  read 'Reluctant' first, you won't need an invitation to read 'Wisdom. '                                                     I'd give this a 'G'  rating.
