 MacLean really does this story up brown.  All of the characters come to life and are eminently believable.  The information that alarms them should certainly alarm us (if true, and I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if  it were).  Tension builds steadily and quite satisfactorily until the  denouement.  The main character's unshakeable integrity and implacability  had me cheering for him every step of the way.  Get a bag of pretzels, a  good reading light, and read this book!
