 Book 1 of the 'Well World' series                                                     This story could be set in the far future -- or a parallel one. I think Chalker wrote this as a stand-alone story, but it has grown  several sequels (like warts) that might be viewed as detracting from this  one. Taken on its own merits, though, 'Midnight at the Well of Souls' is a  fun tale with a novel explanation for the existence of Existence.                                                      Warning: Though this book  contains nothing explicit, some of the themes are definitely adult in  nature. I'd give this a 'PG' rating.
