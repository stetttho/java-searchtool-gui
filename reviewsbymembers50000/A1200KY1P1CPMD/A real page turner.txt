 A fun and gripping story about global politics and the "war between the sexes," 'A World Between' does an excellent job of showing how fanaticism can warp perception and thus alter reality. When the peaceful world of Pacifica is subjected to 'missions' from the rabid Femocrats of  Earth and the male-dominated Transcendental Scientists, both intent upon  converting Pacifica to their own viewpoints, it's a real challenge to the  citizens and the government. Public opinion is moulded through the media,  and Pacifica prides itself on being the most media-savvy and sophisticated  world in the human Galaxy. Only now the Pacificans' own 'First Amendment'  type laws are being used against them..  Frequently graphic, occasionally  disturbing, and always enjoyable.                                                      Warning: This book contains some explicit passages that are  definitely adult in nature. Despite my immense liking for it, I have to  rate this title 'R' because of the language and sexual explicitness.
