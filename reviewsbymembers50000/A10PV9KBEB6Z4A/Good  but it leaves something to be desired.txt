 I am a confessed Stabbing Westward fanatic, so beware that I may be a little biased in my rating. They are one of the best bands of my generation, and I was heartbroken when I learned of their dissolution. Biased aside, I would say that this album represents an adequte sampling of SW's music. My main gripe is the wasted space of four tracks from the "Ungod" release, which really wasn't that popular compared to "Wither, Blister, Burn, and Peel" and "Darkest Days". I think the tracks featured from "Ungod" should have been minimal in number to allow for the experienced, more talented side of SW to show through (for example, cutting two "Ungod" tracks to feature an additional track from both "W,B,B,P" and "Darkest Days"). Also, I think SW had more than the 14 "hits" featured here. When buying a greatest-hits-like release, I expect more than the usual 10-15 tracks on the album (see Aerosmith's "O Yeah!" compilation for an example). In addition, due to label conflicts, nothing from the latest, self-title release appears on this album. For such a die-hard fan as myself, this is a disappointment, though I do recognize reasoning behind it. Wouldn't it be great if record labels could just learn to share?? All in all, this album is a great INTRODUCTION to Stabbing Westward's music. Even though I own all of their albums, I still purchased this CD and listen to it frequently. However, I think I would have been more satisfied making my own copy of "Essential Stabbing Westward."
