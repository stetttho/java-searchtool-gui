 For the price, these unique clip-on watches meet the grade. I use mine as a keychain so that I always know what time it is when I go out.  My clip-on held up after several interested people dropped it (on pavement, tile, and gravel) while oogling at it. Wear and tear on these items is basically limited to replacing the battery and keeping the screw that holds the wings on tightened. It's as simple as that. These items stand the test of time--no pun intended.
