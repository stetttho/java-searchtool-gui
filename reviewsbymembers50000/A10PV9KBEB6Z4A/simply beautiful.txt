 Chet Raymo certainly has a way with words. Couple that with detailed diagrams and pictures of the sky, and you have a wonderful book for anyone remotely interested in the heavens. This book has a poetic nature about it, but it is by no means written on an unattainable level--even for younger readers. This book covers all of the astronomical basics (birth/death of stars, the colors of stars and what that means about heat intensity, planets, comets, galaxies, and universes). It also offers eyes-on experience with diagrams and instructions for night viewing of the sky. The book concludes with a moving chapter about how the universe will end, citing a letter from Einstein and telling the story as if it were a fairytale. Not only is the book enthrallingly beautiful on the inside, but it is equally beautiful on the outside cover (the picture here on Amazon.com just does not do it justice). For a stargazer who is just beginning to search the sky or a seasoned watcher who simply loves celestial beauty, this book will leave the reader satisfied and inspired.
