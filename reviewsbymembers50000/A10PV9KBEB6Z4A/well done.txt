 If you are serious about playing Diablo II, you cannot miss out on the expansion pack. Two new characters--Druid and Assassin--as well as a whole new act to defeat. Added items and a (much) larger stash are bonuses as well! This reviewer would be lost without her Assassin, and I think Act V is one of the best acts in the game. It's a great place to level (with interesting/fun quests) and find unique/rare items--what better way to build up your character before taking on Baal? Again, I cannot stress how much this expansion adds to the enjoyment of the game. Once you play with the expansion, you'll never go back to regular Diablo II again. I promise.
