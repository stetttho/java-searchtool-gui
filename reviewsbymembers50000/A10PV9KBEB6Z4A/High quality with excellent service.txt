 I fell in love with Mondera when I received this item in the mail. Not only did they give me free shipping, but it was free, extremely quick shipping. I ordered the ring on a Wednesday night; it was here Thursday afternoon. Also, being almost Christmastime, they included candy canes and a Christmas card. This is a very professional, friendly company who takes great care in their customer service.  As for the item itself, I was again impressed. The ring is absolutely beautiful--probably the most beautiful sterling silver piece I have ever seen. I showed it to someone else, and she had to ask me what kind of metal it was made of--it looks too high quality to be sterling silver. The ring is also very heavy and thick--sure to last a lot longer than many of the other sterling silver rings made by competitors. It comes in its own jewelry box (not bag, like with other places) to ensure safe keeping.  Mondera went above and beyond my expectations all around. The packing, the shipping, and the item were all exceptional. I will definitely be a repeat buyer. Thanks so much, Mondera!
