 This cuff is a high-quality piece. It's thick enough to be sturdy but thin enough to allow some flexibility of the metal (to size it as desired) without damaging the bracelet. The word "HOPE" is noticeable yet does not over-power the simplistic beauty of this piece. I am really satisfied with this item, and I would recommend it to anyone thinking of purchasing a sterling cuff like this.
