 As it has been said in previous reviews, do not buy this album if you are expecting another Mer de Noms. The music, sounds, and writing voice on this album differ from Mer de Noms greatly, which will leave most people who are seeking a repeat of the first album disappointed. Perhaps this change is due to the absence of Paz? Perhaps not. I think A Perfect Circle will be one of those bands that is forever changing and testing new horizons of music. This album is merely a reflection of that. While Thirteenth Step sounds little like their first success, it is quite good in its own right. I personally think it blows Mer de Noms away. Maynard (the singer) is there in typical Maynard fashion, but he also challenges himself. I hear him doing things on this album I've rarely heard from him before (ex: where did he get that incredible vocal range?). Where Mer de Noms had almost an oriental feel, this album flows in a very surreal manner. The song "Pet" talks about "the boogymen are coming" and "Lullaby" is just that, beginning with the words "go back to sleep." "Gravity" is perhaps the closest song on here that is true to Mer de Noms fashion. There are two tracks here that are pseudo-songs, and by that I mean they are not what traditionally gets air play and have little vocals: "Crimes" and the aforementioned "Lullaby." I have heard several fans of Failure complain about the cover of "The Nurse Who Loved Me." Not having heard the original, I cannot cast a vote either way. I can say, though, that I enjoy listening to this track. It sounds drastically different from anything else on this album, but it is almost like a welcome distraction. I must disagree with the reviewer who said it sounds like Tool's album Lateralus. I believe Maynard adamantly tries to keep Tool's sound different from A Perfect Circle's sound. There wouldn't be much sense in marketing the same style under two different band names. Naturally, since both bands share the same singer/songwriter, there will be some similarities, but there are not enough here to say Thirteenth Step sounds like Lateralus. I got bored with Lateralus after a couple of listens. If you've heard one track on there, you've heard nearly all of them. There is very little variation between songs. Thirteenth Step, however, has a great deal of variation in its music. I've had the album on repeat since buying it the afternoon it came out, and I have yet to tire of it. Individual breakdown of the track listing: 1) The Package: *** (three stars out of five) 2) Weak and Powerless: ***** 3) The Noose: ***** 4) Blue: ***** (though it took awhile to grow on me) 5) Vanishing: **** 6) A Stranger: **** 7) The Outsider: **** 8) Crimes: ** (perhaps the worst song on here, in my opinion) 9) The Nurse Who Loved Me: *** 10) Pet: ***** (tied for best with "Gravity") 11) Lullaby: *** 12) Gravity: *****
