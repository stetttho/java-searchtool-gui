 This collection, stiffly narrated by Peter Davison (Doctor #5) compiles interviews with author Terry Nation and designer Ray Cusick to reveal how the Daleks were created.  Also in the mix are some on-air promos, clips  from the first Dalek stories, and the only remaining episodes of "Evil  of the Daleks" and "The Dalek Masterplan."  These are  especially entertaining.  But one could have wished for a more thorough  exploration of "DalekMania," the wave of popularity the metal  monsters enjoyed, as well as information on the two Dalek feature films  starring Peter Cushing.  On the whole, however, an invaluable additon to  any "WHO" fan's library.
