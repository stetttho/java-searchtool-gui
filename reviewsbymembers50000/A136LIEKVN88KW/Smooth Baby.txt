 "AfterGlow" is a fabulous collection of big-band classics, with a couple of originals thrown in for good measure.  From the rolling piano intro of "I Know What I Got," which soon bursts forth into a  glorious blaze of horns, you know this is going to be a special album.  And  indeed it is.  The Doctor's gravelly voice is a perfect compliment to Tommy  LiPuma's smooth arrangements, which sound both authentic to the period and  nicely up-to-date.  Highlights include the opening number, "Gee Baby,  Ain't I Good to You," "I'm Just a Lucky So & So" and  "There Must Be A Better World Somewhere," a Dr John tune  originally recorded by BB King.  Oddly enough, his take on "Blue  Skies" falls flat, and the album seems to trail off rather than make a  definitive final statement.  That said, however, "Afterglow" is  an album I always pull out when I need that distingue ambience.
