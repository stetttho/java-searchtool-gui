 The DVD box describes this film as "infamous" and that's as good an adjective as any.  I can only imagine the martini-soaked Hollywood power lunches that bred this thing.  "Hey, The Pirates of Penzance is doing major business on Broadway - let's do a spoof with most of the songs thrown out, and lots of scantily-clad teenage antics thrown in!  Maybe we can get a Baskin-Robbins ice cream tie-in!"  Whatever the rationale, "The Pirate Movie" ended up being one of the most deliriously enjoyable guilty pleasures of my childhood. Even at age 10 I knew it was trash, but I loved every moment. Now that it's on DVD, I find myself skipping the interminable love songs but relishing the shameless camp humor and nearly credible renditions of Gilbert & Sullivan's hits.  Kristy McNichol is, indeed, adorable, and I'm sorry she didn't make more films.  "Tell him, Harry!"  Christopher Atkins was obviously cast for his resemblace to Rex Smith (Frederic on Broadway).  He is endearingly dimwitted in the role, and displays his tanned, toned physique to maximum effect.  Ted Hamilton is a hilariously lecherous Pirate King, and Bill Kerr is a credible Major General.  The jokes swerve from the sophomoric to the inspired, and the throw-away gags usually work the best.  For instance, at one point the Pirate King pretends to twirl his non-existant moustache, then looks confused when the imaginary 'stache makes a squeaky sound effect.  As stupid as it is, it's hard to dislike because the entire cast seems to be having so much fun.  So switch off your brain and enjoy "The Pirate Movie."  You might not respect yourself in the morning, but you'll have a great time nonetheless.
