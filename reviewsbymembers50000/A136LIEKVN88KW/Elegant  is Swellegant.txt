 The Doctor's take on the Ellington songbook is as unexpected as it is inspired.  Dr. John puts his unique stamp on old favorites like "It Don't Mean a Thing" and "Do Nothin' Till You Hear From Me,"  while rarities "Wrong Side of the Railroad Tracks" and "I'm  Gonna Go Fishin'" manage to sound completely new in his "Pure  Fonk-i-Fied" versions.  His take on "Mood Indigo" has become  my personal favorite version of this well-worn classic, with his trademark  piano beautifully underscoring the melody, and his rollicking version of  "Don't Get Around Much Anymore" is both fresh and very funny.  I  have only two quibbles with this album.  First, most of the selections are  a bit over-long:  most are over 5 and several over 6 minutes long.  This  gives the album a pace that is a bit too leisurely for its own good.   Second, the latter half of the album is given over to instrumentals:  while  the musicianship is top-notch as always, these should have been  interspersed instead of placed all at the end (but that's why they invented  CD shuffle-play).  There is also a rare lapse into cheese with a lame  version of "Perdido."  However, most of this album works  gorgeously and will please fans of both THE DOC and THE DUKE.
