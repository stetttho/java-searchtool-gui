 Here it is, the "karaoke" version of "The Rocky Horror Picture Show."  This is just the music tracks from the movie, with background vocals only.  Now you too can sing the roles of Frank, Brad,  Janet, Riff Raff, or any and all of your favorite characters from the  movie.  This CD is great for anyone wanting a fun party novelty, or  die-hard fans who want to listen REALLY closely to those cool arrangements.   And, as a bonus, the CD has 2 tracks not available on the Soundtrack  ("Once in a While" and "Planet Schmanet") plus extra  verses in "Frankenstein Place" and "Sword of Damocles"  that were cut from the movie.
