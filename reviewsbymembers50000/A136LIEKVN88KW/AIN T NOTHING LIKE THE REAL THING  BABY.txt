 This is the definitive account of the late-night phenomenon, recording in 1981.  These two discs feature the entire film, music and dialoge, with "participation" including a lot of very funny, and very caustic  remarks from the audience.  One especially interesting thing about this CD  is that it features the original mixes of the songs, which no longer appear  on any circulating print or video of the movie.  Noticeable differences are  heard in "Frankenstein Place," "Time Warp," "Sweet  Transvestite" and "Floor Show."
