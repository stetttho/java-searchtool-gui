 In 1990, as a naive young music fan, I read a rave review of a live album by the intriguingly-named Marianne Faithfull.  Curiosity piqued, I picked up "Blazing Away" at my local record shop.  What followed was  intense - an hour of dark, moody music, sometime wistful, sometimes  vicious, sung in a husky alto that seemed to define the term  "chanteuse" to a college freshman with only the vaguest notion of  what that meant.  I became an immediate fan, and though I discovered her  studio albums were fantastic, nothing matches the raw emotion poured forth  in the suitably sombre, acoustics of St. Anne's Cathederal.  The album  wanders a bit in the second half, and though others on this site have raved  about "Times Square," I feel the studio version is vastly  superior.  However, the incredible live renditions of "Guilt,"  "As Tears Go By," "The Ballad of Lucy Jordan," and  "Broken English" are without equal.  It's also a pleasure to hear  her versions of John Lennon's "Working Class Hero" and Tom Waits'  "Strange Weather."  However, my personal favorite track is the  harrowing "Sister Morphine," which benefits from a masterful  arrangement.  And how delicious, after the blisteringly obscene rant  "Why'd Ya Do It?," to hear dear Marianne sigh, "Ah, I feel  better now."  Ten years on, still a delightful album, best enjoyed in  the dark.
