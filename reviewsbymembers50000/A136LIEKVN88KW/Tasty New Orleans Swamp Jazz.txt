 Dr. John is in rare form on this live disc, recorded with the Donald Harrison Band at NYC's legendary Birdland.  Some of these songs are straight-forward blues numbers, while others are Mardi Gras chants given a  jazz workout.  Taking a break from the piano bench, the good Doctor plays  guitar and growls out voodoo mumbo-jumbo while the rhythm section keeps the  pulse pounding.  This is easily Dr. John's best album since "Goin'  Back to New Orleans" (and that's saying something, since he's released  4 or 5 good records since then).  Outstanding tracks include the gambler's  tale, "Shave 'Em Dry," and "Jac-A-Mo-Fi-Na-Hay," which  takes a phrase from his classic "Iko Iko" and reworks it into a  whole new song.  This album is a stellar combination of deep, swampy funk  and tight jazz ensemble playing.  And you can't go wrong with an album that  contains the following lyric:  "I'm only 38 / My woman's 93 / My  friends all think I'm crazy / But the will's made out to me!"  Highly  recommended.
