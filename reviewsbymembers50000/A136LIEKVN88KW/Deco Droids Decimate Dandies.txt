 This must be one of the all-time best "Doctor Who"s, an "and then there were none" mystery set on a giant mining vehicle far in the future.  A handful of humans must fight for their lives when  their robot servants turn homicidal - but who is behind the robot  revolution?  The acting is top-notch, the script excellent, the model-work  very good.  The production design must take the highest honors, with sleek  art-deco androids that are as menacing as they are beautiful, and rich,  lazy, droid-dependent humans in face-paint and silken robes.  Tom Baker's  Doctor is as witty and compelling as ever, and the lovely Leela is  amusingly savage.  Essential who-ing.
