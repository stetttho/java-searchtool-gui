 I have had "The Godfather" on my shelf for about a year now but only just got around to reading it. I must say I was not prepared with the force with which Mario Puzo's storytelling leapt off the page and grabbed me. I have seen the film, of course - everyone should - but the book contains the details, sub-plots and first-person perspectives that no film can match. Puzo's narrative voice is cool but forceful, and full of dry irony. It's compulsively readable, I literally had to force myself to put it down!  Highly recommended.  However, I do want to warn readers away from the over-priced New American Library version - the trade paperback in a red foil cover with "The Original Classic" at the top. This edition is littered with typos, many of them errors that a simple spell-checking program would have caught. It's very distracting and annoying. Penguin should be ashamed to peddle such shoddy merchandise.  Get the mass-market paperback instead; the black cover is more sinister, anyway.
