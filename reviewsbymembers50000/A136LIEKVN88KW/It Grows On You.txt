 Fortunately, a little Tinactin clears it right up.  Seriously though, when this album came out in 1995, I was extremely disappointed.  After the irresistable hooks and dark, lush production of "Angel Dust"  (1992), this album seemed harsh and unmelodic.  The production is spare and  stripped-down, the songs short and thrashy with weird jazz flourishes  thrown in.  I put it on my shelf, and consoled myself with their previous  releases.  But something happened along the way - the tunes started going  through my head.  Though not as sonically rich as their other records, the  in-your-face sound lets the tight arrangements and rock-solid playing shine  through.  Though this album is by no means perfect, and contains several  tracks too abrasive to be enjoyable (maybe not for a thrash/punk fan),  there are some outstanding songs here.  Witness the apocalyptic  "Ricochet," the hell-jazz "Star AD," or the mournful  country ballad "Take This Bottle."  There's the spooky, hypnotic  title track, the psychotic "What a Day," and the sinister but  mellow "Evidence," which proves that Mike Patton has one of the  most uniquely gorgeous voices in rock.  Best of all, however, is the  grandiose "Just a Man," which closes the album in a blaze of  strings and gospel harmonies.  If this had been their last album, which at  the time appeared likely, this last song would have been a fitting epitaph.   As it is, "King" is a brief return to the band's punk roots  before their true swan song, the brilliant "Album of the Year."   But that's another review.
