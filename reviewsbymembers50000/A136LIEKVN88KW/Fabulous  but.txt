 Why haven't they included the wonderful "Little Bird" clip, in which Annie is upstaged by a legion of impersonators in all her different outfits through the years?  Seems like a bizarre, pointless omission. Other than that, this is a fantastic collection of top-notch music videos.  Gorgeous costumes and photography and provocative concepts abound.  Did I mention, the songs are wonderful too?
