 This is "The Rocky Horror Show" from its 1974 Los Angeles production starring Tim Curry.  Staged at a Los Angeles night club, the Roxy, this version of the show was a huge hit and was supposed to promote  the upcoming film.  The recording (by Mamas & Papas producer Lou Adler)  is a bit too glossy for some tastes, and some of the Californians brought  in to replace the original cast don't seem quite at home in this  oh-so-British venue.  But on the whole, this record is still glamorously  sleazy.  Tim Curry's belted renditions of "Sweet Transvestite"  and "Charles Atlas Song" equal or surpass the film versions, and  Meat Loaf is on hand to play not only rocker Eddie but his stuffy uncle,  Dr. Scott. This album has the distinction of being the most complete  edition of the score, lacking only the "Science Fiction" reprise  which is reprinted in the liner notes anyway.  The interior photo montage  is also  quite a treat.
