 Well, Ziggy's back, sounding better than ever.  The disc sounds really crisp and full-bodied, so kudos on that.  The 2nd disc is full of rarities, none too revelatory, but including the well-loved "Velvet Goldmine" and alternate versions some Ziggy tracks.   The really nice thing about this disc is the lovely booklet, full of excellent photos and a fawning but informative essay, a timeline, and quotes from famous Ziggy acolytes.  The only disappointing thing is the complete lack of lyrics.   Still, it's a very handsome edition of this classic album.  And its nice to listen to the album and not to have to rush to the CD player before the bonus tracks begin.   So gimme your hands!
