 Here it is - cheap and cheesy - the original ROCKY HORROR SHOW.  Starring Tim Curry, Little Nell, Pat Quinn and author/songwriter Richard O'Brien.  The recording is garage-band crude and the singing more enthusiastic than  accomplished.  So why is this, in some ways, the definitive ROCKY?  Because  it's rawer, crazier, and and just plain more fun than any version that came  after.  This is ROCKY when it was an impromptu labor of love, staged in a  dusty old theatre for $1.98.  You can just hear the relish with which the  actors (including a pre-AB FAB Chris Malcolm) jump into their roles. The  gusto with which the band attacks the songs make the polished movie  versions seem tame.  Very enjoyable, and highly reccomended.
