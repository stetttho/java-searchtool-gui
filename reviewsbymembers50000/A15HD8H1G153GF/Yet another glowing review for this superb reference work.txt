 I concur with all the positive things that others have written here regarding this book. It truly is the definitive resource of its kind, la crema y nata as they say in Spanish. Simply put, your search for the answer to a Spanish grammatical question may not begin here, but it will end here.  The copious examples culled from various written sources are outstanding. If you're reading the original text of, say, a novel by Garcia Marquez or Vargas Llosa, and you come across a bit of sentence structure that is unfamiliar, the chances are pretty good that you'll find that very sentence among the examples in this reference book. In other words, you might get not only an explanation of the grammar principle that's confusing you, but also an English translation of the passage you're reading.  In addition, the book's use of numbers to subdivide chapters makes looking up things a pleasure. This volume is remarkably user-friendly for its size, scope and subject matter. As one reviewer wrote, you really can consult this book as a reference and end up reading entire chapters.  So in summary, add my voice to the chorus of praise for "A New Reference Grammar of Modern Spanish." Buy it used if you can, but it's still a bargain even at the list price.
