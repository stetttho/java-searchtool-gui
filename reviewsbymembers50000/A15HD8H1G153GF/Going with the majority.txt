 I feel compelled to write and say that I differ from the opinion held by SnailSix. I have read both "The Dante Club" and "The DaVinci Code", and each was a bona fide page-turner for me. Like one of the other reviewers, I too was inspired to find out more about Lowell, Longfellow and Holmes, as well as some of the minor  characters mentioned in "The Dante Club". I also pulled out my old copy of Dante's famous poem and compared Longfellow's translation to the one I had. Pearl further ingratiated himself to me by having Holmes goad his colleagues with the last lines of Tennyson's "Ulysses", which happens to be my dad's favorite part of his favorite poem.  Much has been made about Dan Brown's distortion of the facts in an attempt to convince readers his version of history is authentic. Pearl does no such thing in "The Dante Club"; in fact, he states unequivocally that the book is a work of fiction. And I found it to be absolutely delightful fiction, a fabulous and not-all-that-farfetched tale. Pearl's subject matter is also far less controversial than Brown's.   I checked out a copy of "The Dante Club" from my local library because after reading some reviews, I wasn't sure I'd want to buy it. Now, I definitely want to add it to my personal library. The copy I read had a wonderful introduction written by another author. I mention this because it's not often that an introduction makes a lasting impression, but this one did for me. It presented a fitting prelude to Pearl's prose, and, more importantly, it heightened the realism of the subsequent fictional events. Brown's and Pearl's respective novels inflamed my curiosity and stimulated my intellect, which is what good books often do for readers. At the end of "The Dante Club", however, I felt satisfied rather than subverted.
