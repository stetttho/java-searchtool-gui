 Compared with some of the other books in my Spanish reference collection, this one is not absolutely indispensable, hence the four-star rating. It does have a lot going for it, though, and the previous two reviewers mentioned some of those useful features. For one thing, the book is highly readable and easy to follow. Also, the sample sentences provide excellent context for each idiomatic expression. And the format of the book is almost identical to that of a bilingual dictionary, allowing the reader to look up idioms by language. All expressions are translated between the two languages, but some idioms are listed in only one language or the other.   As a supplement to this book -- and to have a measure of comparison -- I bought "The Big Red Book of Spanish Verbs" by Peter Weibel. Besides claiming to have 12,000 idioms, "Big Red" is a little more recent and is part of the outstanding Spanish reference lineup from publisher McGraw Hill. I have yet to find a be-all and end-all bilingual reference book of Spanish and English idioms. You can definitely choose worse than "2001"; you can choose better by going with Weibel' book, but "2001" is a pretty close second -- for me, anyway. Savaiano's most comprehensive entry in the field (he's written other similar books) has generally met most of my expectations.
