 Believe me, I really wanted to give this book five stars. It is five-star quality in almost every respect. The only reason I didn't is, IMO, it gives unduly short shrift to Spanish. And of the handful or so Spanish words that are included, at least three are characteristic of Spain. It seems to me the author missed a great opportunity to introduce readers to the multifaceted Spanish of Latin America. I for one would have loved to see the word "carteluo" in there, since I have yet to find a satisfactory definition/description anywhere else. Yet try as I might to identify other shortcomings, that is the only criticism I have of this book.  Moore somehow manages to make up for all the deserving words that didn't make it. He shows particular deference to German and French, and I absolutely reveled in his selections from the lengua franca of the Deutschelanders. Surely my auto insurer wouldn't mind being introduced to a geisterfahrer or two. And the  mental images conjured up by the words schadenfreude and korinthenkacker are the cure for a bad day. I also enjoyed the introduction, where readers are treated to a glimpse of the Finnish concept of sisu. The selection of Yiddish words is admirable as well, and I wouldn't be surprised if Reader's Digest   ever asked to reprint it as a vocab builder.  The smiles, laughter and sheer enjoyment I get from reading this book make me forget I paid for it. I have used it as a reference book, a momentary diversion, and an extended read when I need something lighthearted. I think it nicely complements Ostler's scholarly, but no less entertaining, tome "Empires of the Word". Don't miss that one if you like "In Other Words". And Mr. Moore, if you read this review and ever plan a second edition of this book, may I suggest you consider including the Japanese word "mokusatsu." I've read that the inherent ambiguity in that word might have played a key role in the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
