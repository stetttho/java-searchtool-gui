 Other reviewers rightfully acknowledge the superb flying footage, including the launching from a B-29 bomb bay of the X-1 rocket plane destined to break the sound barrier, but I would like to point out that this film highlights a young and beautiful Janet Leigh (only 22 or so at the time the film was made) as no other from her early career -- the sexy energy she projects through her character manages to steal every scene! Though the plot is preposterous, the film is nevertheless most enjoyable. The beauty of the aerial ballet between the two protagonists as they play hide-and-seek among the clouds is cinematic love-making at its most subtle and slyly humorous -- so much so that it seems to have escaped the notice of other reviewers. To see the hero (Wayne) utterly nonplussed by the dynamic and self-assured heroine (Leigh) playing the archetypal socialist egalitarian wonder girl is pure pleasure! The closest thing in film to this cross-cultural romantic situation (at the height of the Cold War no less!) is the one depicted between Fred Astaire and Cyd Charisse in the later comic musical 'Silk Stockings.' Save for the recent forgettable 'thirties futurist serial-inspired flop with that Lara Croft actress, Hollywood has never produced a film with a woman military pilot as the heroine. For this it took Howard Hughes. In 1950 however one must suppose that it was necessary for cultural reasons to ignore the recent phenomenon of unsung American WAC pilots having ferried fighters and bombers from Canada to Great Britain (suffering losses along the way) by depicting the heroine (Leigh) as a passionately anti-capitalist Russion patriot who (naturally) falls for (or appears to fall for) the strong, silent American male archetype (Wayne). After fifty years this aviation romance is still loads of fun!
