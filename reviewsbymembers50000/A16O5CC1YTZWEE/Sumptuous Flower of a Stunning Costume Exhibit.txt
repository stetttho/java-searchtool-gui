 Illustrating a modest but very memorable exhibition by the Costume Institute of NYC's Metropolitan Museum in the spring of 2005, this title represents its sumptuous late-bloom - a very aesthetically pleasing catalogue. About twenty-five beautifully dressed be-wigged mannequins - posed to illustrate scenes from the famous 1782 novel 'Les Liasons dangereuses' - are arranged in conversational groups among the furnishings of the French period rooms at the Met. The exquisite final flowering of late 18th c. French costume before the Revolution are shown in all their charming elegance of textile & embroidery. The photographs of the exhibition mannequins, including many details, are interspersed with colour reproductions of period paintings that tend to illustrate & augment the exhibition. The book would make a superb gift, a fine coffee table ornament, & its worth every penny of its 30 dollar list price but it's a steal at any sort of a remainder discount for those with a love of the 'Enlightened' period when France was the world's arbiter of taste in science and culture (if not commerce) when the ex-army officer Chaderlos de Laclos wrote his unexcelled epistolary novel - a novel that no less than four late 20th c. film directors have attempted to capture on screen & each time without success and which many consider the finest French novel before Proust. There are a few other titles that may be considered in the same category - 'The Elegant Art' 1983 LA Mus of Art, the Williamsburg Costume catalog of 1986, and the exceptional catalog published ten years ago by the Kyoto Costume Institute - The only fault I can find with 'Dangerous Liaisons' is the lack of technical detail - just how were those minute pleats tucked and stitched anyway?
