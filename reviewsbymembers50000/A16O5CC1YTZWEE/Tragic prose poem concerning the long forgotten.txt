 A love story told so dispassionately it is as if it the events described were witnessed by some extraterrestrial species. A beautiful, tragic, succinct, but potent tale of the voyage, settlement, and eventual demise of the first French mission to Vietnam by Dominican nuns & friars circa 1787-1797. Forgotten by the world as the Terror overcomes the French government and Church, the last two survivors, a nun and a monk, make their way into the rainy forests of the hinterlands to take shelter among an obscure tribe of Montagnards. Forgetting all the superficial cultural baggage they have acquired in their past life, they cling desperately to one another, fall into 'sin,' and eventually die of unknown tropical diseases. The pair are remembered only by the locals, who erect a wooden cross in their memory, which fifty some years later is discovered and destroyed by an incredulous band of French explorers unwilling not to have been the 'first'. A touching and memorable little fable about the transitory and illusory nature of Western culture and religion in an alien tropic land.
