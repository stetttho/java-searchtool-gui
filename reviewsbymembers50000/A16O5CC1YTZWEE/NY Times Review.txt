 Herbert Muschamp, the NY Times architectural critic, has written an interesting article about Benjamin and his Paris project which appears in the Arts & Leisure section on January 16, 2000. While not strictly  speaking a book review it nevertheless offers some observations as to the  cultural importance of Benjamin's chef d'oevre. Another book on the Arcades  Project is  Susan Buck-Morss's 'The Dialectics of Seeing' (MIT 1989, 1991,  1997).
