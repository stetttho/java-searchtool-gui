 What the initial reviewer fails to mention is the authors' fascinating premise -- that the predominant mid-Atlantic (read Pennsylvania) thrust of frontier expansion has at its roots the mingled culture of the southern Lenape Indians (aka Delaware) and the Savo-Karelian forest Finns who were encouraged to settle in the remote regions of western Sweden on the Norwegian border & who were no longer wanted with the rise of iron production making the Finns ideal candidates for New World colonisation. Their prior experience trading with the alien Rus'ian and Lapp peoples, their adaptation to forested frontier conditions including slash & burn agriculture, log building technology based on mastery of the felling ax, their early use & manufacture of the rifle as a hunting tool, their unconcern for environmental destruction, their readiness to incorporate useful new plant, animal, & survival knowlege & skills from other peoples, and their remarkable hardiness made them the core culture in the Philadelphia region upon which the bulk of subsequent immigrant populations, especially Celtic (Scots-Irish), Swiss, & German, were to learn the skills & knowlege necessary to move westward beyond the Alleghenies & southwestward along the Great Valley into Virginia, the Carolinas, & Georgia. The authors make a strong case for their hypothesis & compare it to earlier work by others. A fine & fascinating study of the roots of frontier American culture. The only weakness in my opinion is its insufficient analysis of the native American contribution to early mid-Atlantic colonial culture. Especially helpful would have been more information on log notching variations throughout the frontier on the order of the unparalleled study by Sigurd Erixon in 'Folk Liv' 1938 & on Finnish/Swedish vs. German rifle technology in the colonial period. Apart from this perhaps minor failing it constitutes a well-reasoned (if not fully substantiated) argument which will doubtless produce controversy & consternation (& perhaps even scorn) among cultural anthropologists specializing in American colonial history -- especially amongst those possessing Celtic and/or Germannic ancestry!!!
