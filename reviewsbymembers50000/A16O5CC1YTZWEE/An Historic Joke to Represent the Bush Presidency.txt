 Don't waste more than a dollar on this abomination. The American director and writer are the real villains in this flop, not the British officers. A great opportunity to make a Rev War battle flick that outdid the modest British-produced 'Revolution' and the flawed but spectacular 'Gettysburg' was lost by hackneyed reversion to Hollywood cliche, presumably to appeal to every segment of the woefully ignorant American family audience. Plot, character, behavior, score, costume design, art direction, etc. are almost all wrong. The Continental and Brit infantry extras (mostly re-enactors) do a decent job in the battle scenes which are otherwise ruined by absurdly incorrect artillery. Even the sets are wrong, being highly sanitized representations of very primitive Carolina living conditions. The infamous Tarleton and his British Legion are clothed not in their distinctive green jackets but in something better suited to a comic operetta. Too many failings in fact, dialogue, lifestyle, behavior, costume, arms, etc. to allow any but the ignorant to suspend disbelief. A mockery was made of American/British military history and cynically clothed in jingo-istic flag-waving - a fitting film to represent the hypocritical mis-representations and false 'patriotism' of the Bush administration. A reputable cast wasted on a bit of Hollywood trash - just listen to the listless delivery of Chris Cooper who must have lost all faith in the project. Even the hats are mis-cocked and worn incorrectly - just take a gander at the quasi-Napoleonic monstrosity the actor playing the French officer is made to wear!
