 The most droll of romances yet from a great storyteller. Nothing seems lacking, nothing seems excessive in plot or  characterization. The subtle refinement of the dialogue leaves one smiling with delight. The craft of this piece of art, the beauty of the Rhone valley (slowly being spoiled with industry), the sunswept fields, the wind, and that, acts on the heart like the last drops of a fine wine on the palate. I somewhat doubt that anyone much under forty can fully appreciate the bittersweet qualities of this tale, but for those who have lived enough to have found themselves solitary at an age when stoic resignation is considered a virtue, and dedication to career is seen as a cure, the universality of Magali's cri de couer is full of poignant charm. As so often before Rohmer emphasizes the contingency of romantic attachment while creating two of the most appealing and deserving heroines. The fact that they are the most mature women he has yet depicted suggests that, like Magali's vintage, he feels that one can't really appreciate life until it's been allowed time to ripen.
