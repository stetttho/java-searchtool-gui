 I first read this book in 1964 when I was fifteen & never forgot its description of the battle which one squadron of B-24s (flying so low that at least one plane returned with corn stalks stuck in its rear wheel well) fought at machine gun range with a Nazi armored flak train traveling in the same direction as the overtaking bombers -- to Ploesti. A mix-up caused three groups to approach the target simultaneously from three different directions at three different altitudes, stunning the German flak commander with what he thought was incredible American air tactics. I re-read it fifteen years ago & would like to read it again but find it is almost impossible to find at a reasonable price in its original edition -- so many libraries have ditched it due to wear or lack of interest. A great shame because it is one of the best accounts of a bombing mission I have ever read. My own dad was a teenage engine mechanic (fresh out of Aviation H.S. in NYC) of a B-29 -- 'Bengal Lancer' -- in India and on Tinian Island in the Pacific.
