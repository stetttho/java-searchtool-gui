 A tour de force for wunderkind Reese Witherspoon -- who proves herself capable of portraying a runaway  semi-literate white trash kid from the wrong side  of the tracks (modern urban Little Red Riding Hood) -- she murders a man (Kiefer Sutherland)-- or thinks she has -- who gives her a lift  on the freeway only to assault her -- a terrific supporting cast including Dan Hedaya (the investigating cop), Amanda Plummer  (drug-addict prostitute Mom) & Brooke Shields  (self-righteous & deluded bourgeoise wife of the rapist/murderer victim 'Wolf' Sutherland) The legal system naturally supports the  wheelchair-bound victim of social standing  while condemning the youthful perpetrator --   Stands next to Election & Pleasantville  as among Witherspoon's best -- but by far the most powerful performance despite  the director's mis-step in the off-key  final seconds --   Well worth ten bucks for Witherspoon fans -- a great antidote for those cuted-out by her Alicia Silverstone imitation in  'Legally Blonde' -- Highly recommended --
