 Chambers confuses the ideals of communism with the practices of Lenin during the consolidation of the revolution and the internal holocaust of Stalin -- As usual conservatives simplify the complexities of an intellectual philosophy based on socialist ideals seduced by a Soviet propaganda machine that exceeded in its scope even that of Goebbels -- Chambers largely ignores the phenomenon of an American Nazi movement fomented by 'ends justifies means' rationalizations by such notable Americans as FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, Sen. Joe McCarthy, & retired Gen. Dwight Eisenhower, who betrayed his most trusted aide, Gen. Marshall, in his quest for the 1952 Republican Presidential nomination. The chief reason Chambers is promoted by the representatives of the capitalist class & their minions is the threat socialist ideas pose to vested interests in opposition to the natural rights of man expressed by Tom Paine.
