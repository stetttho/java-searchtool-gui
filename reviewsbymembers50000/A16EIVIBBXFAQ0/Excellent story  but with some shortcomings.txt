 Golden has taken an old tradition - the haunting of a man by a ghost - and given it a bit of a spin in his latest oferring.  Michael Dansky seems to have a close-to-perfect life - great job, good friends, a beautiful and intelligent wife.  However, it all falls apart once he becomes haunted, and it's up to him to put things back together.  What made this stand out a little is that Michael's haunting also endangers his wife, upping the ante for him to correct things.  The story is hurt by a couple of problems.  First, the characters of Michael and Jillian seem a little too perfect.  He smiles whenever he looks at her, they apparently never have arguments, their sex life is perfect, their friends and coworkers all love and admire them - maybe these couples really exist, but they don't make for sympathetic characters.  Secondly, there is a great deal of action in the novel, often at the expense of character development or the use of Golden's writing skills.  It's like the author was told to package everything under a certain number of pages, and the writing suffers.  Golden has written a lot of teen novels, and this often feels like one.  The story and plotting are excellent, but there's little use of literary devices or sections that depend more on literary skill than on action taking place.  It's still a good book, but not on the level of his previous effort (The Boys are Back in Town).  A fast read, but don't go into it with high expectations.
