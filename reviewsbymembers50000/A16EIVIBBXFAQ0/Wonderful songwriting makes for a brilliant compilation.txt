 It's difficult to say much that hasn't been said before, and likely said better, by many other reviewers.  So I guess I'll just add another voice to those who have mentioned the beauty of the songs in this compilation, and their timelessness.  While a certain track about a ship is the one that my parents played endlessly while I was growing up, my personal favorite track is "If you could read my mind," which I believe is one of the most beautiful and sad songs ever written.  Lyrics that touch the heart, sung over spare but perfectly used guitar, ultimately building to an almost heartbreaking finale.  I've always thought, as a Canadian, that Lightfoot was one of our more underappreciated musical contributors.  So it's gratifying to read so many wonderful reviews of his work on here, from those who appreciate his artistry.
