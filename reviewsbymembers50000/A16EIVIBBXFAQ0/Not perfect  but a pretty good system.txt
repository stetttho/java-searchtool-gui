 Shandler's Forecaster is just about as close as you're gonna' get to a tried-and-true system when it comes to fantasy projections.  Each year brings some major gaffes, but the same is true of any system, whether it's Prospectus' PECOTA numbers or the homemade systems many of us have tried.  As a previous reviewer stated, this book is best used in conjunction with other systems.  I believe that using it with BP, other books, and your own common sense is the best route to go.  I don't think there's any system that can guarantee results, but this book can certainly help you towards that.   As for some of the bad calls they made last year, it's tough for me to criticize them too much.  If someone has the time, a longer-term study on their predictions and results would be interesting.  Anecdotally, however, I can say that they've done a pretty good job over the past several seasons.  I don't always agree with their methods, and I've been surprised at some of their calls, but I don't think any system is going to be even close to perfect.  I'd recommend this to anyone participating in a fantasy league, since it's as good a tool as you'll find for your draft.  It's gotten better over the years with its explanation of methodology and the essays they include, and it's a good purchase at a reasonable price.
