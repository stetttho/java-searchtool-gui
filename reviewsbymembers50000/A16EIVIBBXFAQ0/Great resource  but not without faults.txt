 I'd really echo what the first reviewer wrote, that this is a valuable book hurt by some poor editing.  And since this publication is meant to be a complete and authoritative source for college football, those mistakes detract from its overall value.  The capsule looks at each program are great.  Not only can you look back at scores and performance from past years, but the leaders for each team are a useful resource.  It's fun to look at certain schools, to see how their fortunes have risen and fallen over long periods of time.  The historical polls are also enjoyable to look at, for much the same reason, seeing which teams have stuck around near the top for long periods of time, while others come and go.  The essays are also interesting, although I would have liked a few more of them.  I don't think they need to give a comprehensive history of the college game (those already exist), but examining certain trends or particular eras/teams would have been a nice addition.  This book really does fill a niche for the sports fan, and even with some errors this book is well worth the price.  However, I think that any great reference work should be completely authoritative, and that's where this one falls short.  A great book, but one whose next edition should really be a 5-star effort.
