 Oral histories of sports seem to be pretty popular right now, and this is a good addition to that canon.  For fans who watched a lot of ball in the '70s, this should be especially enjoyable.  What's interesting about Ballew's book is that he didn't focus on the decade's biggest stars.  Several of the interviewees were outstanding players - Vida Blue, Tommy John, Bob Boone - but there's not a Hall of Famer among the bunch, and lesser names like Fred Patek and Don Money are given an equally large share of time.  This approach is great, as it gives us perspectives from several angles, not just from dominant players.  Highly recommended, a good book to leaf through while watching an early season game.
