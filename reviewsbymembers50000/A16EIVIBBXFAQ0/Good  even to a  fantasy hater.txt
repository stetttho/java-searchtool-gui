 Usually, just the lame covers of fantasy novels keep my from even picking them up.  However, since this is "the" classic of the fantasy genre (sorry, Harry Potter fans), I figured I'd better read it before I could criticize it.  It turned out to be an excellent trilogy, well-written with some timeless messages. I wouldn't go so far as [...] to compare it to the Bible (anotehr good piece of fiction?), and I wouldn't call it the greatest novel ever written - I don't think it compares with Moby Dick or a few other classics.  However, I think that all of my fellow critics of the whole fantasy genre should try reading this.  I know very few people who actively dislike Tolkein, but I know many who have never picked up anything he's written.  An excellent pick if you're going to read any fantasy.  I get the feeling it's all downhill from here.
