 For the past decade, I've wondered when a show would come along to match Homicide: LOTS.  With The Wire, HBO has not matched HLOTS, but has, in my opinion, surpassed it.  I'm not sure who's responsible for the casting, but I've never seen a show where everyone seems to fit their role so perfectly.  The writing is brilliant, and it's incredibly refreshing to watch a show that never takes the easy way out.  Unbelievably great television.
