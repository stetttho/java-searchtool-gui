 Year after year, this remains a publication that football fans need to keep on their coffee tables, and this year's version is no exception.  Almost everything you could want is included - team rosters, records, and coaching bios, a week-by-week recap of the 2004 season, comprehensive stats from last year, past standings from 1920-present, all-time team vs. team results, recaps of all Super Bowl and Pro Bowl games, and all-time records from the regular season, playoffs and Pro Bowl.  This year's publication also includes a new fantasy section, with projections given for players at the offensive slots.    One of the more useful and interesting aspects of this book is a section titled, "Inside the Numbers."  This is where a fan can find information about what players have the most TDs, yards, etc. over the past 2,3, and 4 seasons.  It's where you can learn that Torry Holt has 700 yards more receiving than TO over the past 4 seasons, but has reached the end zone 19 fewer times.  It also includes great esoteric information like a list of the coldest games in NFL history, or team records in games decided by a field goal or less over the past 35 seasons.  And for some of the league's superstars, there is a breakdown of their career performance against each team.  If there's one item that's obviously lacking, it's a register of all current players and their career stats.  However, including that info would turn an already 784-page long book into something much longer, and there are existing publications that provide those stats.  If you're someone who spends their Sundays in the fall and early winter settled on your couch with a remote control at the go, this is one you should own.  It's a fantastic reference source for the season, and it costs less than $12.  Again, this is an essential purchase, one I can't recommend highly enough.
