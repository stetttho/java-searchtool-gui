 Given that the Bill James and Baseball Prospectus annuals seem to cover almost anything you could need for the upcoming season, I wasn't sure what to expect with this effort from the guys at the great THT site.  What makes this one stand out from the others, in my opinion, is the number and quality of articles, both with regard to the 2005 season and to other baseball-related issues.  While the BP annual always has essays, their number doesn't approach what is included in the THT annual.  In their recap of 2005, there are short essays covering each divisional race, a postseason review, and an excellent "Ten Things I learned this Year" essay from Dave Studeman, who manages to bridge the gap betweeen "traditional" and "stathead" approaches to the game as well as anyone I've read.  Steve Treder's examination of the 2005 season stands out, as do a couple of articles on the business side of baseball by Brian Borawski and Maury Brown.    I admit to being a little surprised at the number of research articles dedicated to batted balls (there are 5 of them), but after reading them I can understand why all of them were included.  The analysis section also includes several other interesting articles, including a good look at the value of baserunning.  And I would be remiss, of course, not to mention that this publication includes some excellent and well-presented stats in the book's second half.  It's simply that the articles are so good and plentiful that they overshadow the numbers.  This is an outstanding work, one that has quickly earned a place on my bookshelf behind copies of James' old abstracts and a growing pile of BP annuals.  I'd be surprised to see a better baseball publication for 2006, as the THT guys have just done a great job of culling many items of interest together in a single book.  This is a must-purchase, one worth much more than its low price.
