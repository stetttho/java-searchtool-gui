 Anytime you read a thriller, you need to have a willing suspension of disbelief.  In his latest effort, however, Siegel provides a chain of unlikely, almost impossible, events that make it difficult to believe anything like this could happen.  The story is pretty straightforward - A couple goes to Colombia to adopt a baby, only to be taken hostage.  To free his wife and new child, our hero must smuggle drugs back into the U.S.  Of course, complications ensue, and he must fight to find a way to save his family and himself.  To that end, it's an effective story, one that anyone with a child can relate to.  The reason I don't think this rates 4-5 stars is that, as I said earlier, the events that take place simply become too unbelievable to have any credence.  It's unfortunate, because I believe this could have been a great book if Siegel had chosen to focus less on trying to shock us with plot twists, and more on the efforts of a desperate man trying to save his family.  Ultimately, the book becomes predictable, and it's easy to guess the outcome.  Siegel is a fine writer, and I don't question his ability to keep the pages turning.  However, I think he needs to worry less about twists (just like in Derailed) and focus on his strength, which is in building tension.  He's written 3 good books to this point, but I think he can get better.
