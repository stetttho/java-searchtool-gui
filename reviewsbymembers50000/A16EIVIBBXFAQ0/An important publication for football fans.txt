 This year's Register is similar to those have come before it, making it an excellent publication to keep with you on Sunday afternoons.  Every player likely to play in the NFL this season is included, along with comprehensive career stats, biographical information, transactions in which they were involved, and any career highlights they may have.  The same goes for coaches, whose careers stats are also included.  For this year's expected crop of rookies, college stats are included.  There is no analysis, only statistics, which is to be expected from the Register.  What makes this publication so valuable is that, even with many stats available on the Internet, this is still the fastest and easiest way to find what you're looking for when it comes to football statistics.  Along with the 2005 NFL Record and Fact Book, this is a book that football fans should have readily available during the NFL season.
