 Take some excellent, renowmed writers, have them write a collection of stories for kids, and this is what you get.  An eclectic, fun, sometimes creepy mix of tales that those of all ages are likely to enjoy.  While writers like Nick Hornby and Neil Gaiman contribute, the best effort comes from Kelly Link, in his tale titled, "Monster."  Although written for children, this is one of the funniest short stories I've read in quite some time - funny, scary, straightforward in its telling - and it's the highlight of an outstanding collection.  The only thing that keeps me from giving this 5 stars is the fact that there are a couple of weak stories that hurt the overall collection.  Still, I'd highly recommend this for readers of any age.  You might not like every story, but I guarantee that there will be several that catch your fancy.
