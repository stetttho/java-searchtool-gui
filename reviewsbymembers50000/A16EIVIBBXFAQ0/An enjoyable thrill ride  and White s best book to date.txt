 Although Alan Gregory makes appearances, this book is really about our unnamed narrator, a wealthy, middle-aged, adventure-loving guy who has come face-to-face with his own mortality.  After watching a friend end up in a vegetative state, and suffering a near-fatal fall himself, our hero is questioning whether he'd want to live at anything less than his full capacity.  It's at this point when he is introduced to a shadowy group, one that will end your life for you when you reach an agreed-upon level of injury and/or illness.  When our narrator is diagnosed with a chronic condition, one that will eventually prove fatal, he begins to regret his decision.  Soon, he's forced to try calling off the dogs while trying to evade them, all the while also trying to make amends and arrangements with those in his life.  The author manages to examine a difficult subject - the quality of life debate - without ever becoming preachy or judgmental.  The lead character is believable, just a normal guy instead of a Superman who always manages to repel the bad guys.  There's plenty of action, but the characters never become secondary to the events that transpire.  This is a great thriller, one full of both action and intelligence.  White has picked a great premise, and his execution is almost flawless.  While the ending may be a little too neat, it doesn't really detract from what is an excellent effort.  One of the best thrillers I've read in a while, and I'd highly recommend this title.
