 For anyone who has read previous books in this series, the general outline will seem very familiar.  Dave gets involved in some trouble, sticks his nose where he probably shouldn't (usually involving a wealthy and important person), and uses his pitbull-like instincts to avoid letting go until he has resolved the problem.  The tale this time revolves around the almost-half-century long disappearance of a young prostitute named Ida, who had been befriended by Dave and his brother, Jimmie.  When the young woman's name is spoken by a dying man, the past is brought into the present, and Dave and Jimmie are soon on the hunt for Ida.  Of course, this being a Robicheaux book, they inevitably encounter all sorts of baddies while doing so, including the wealthy Chalon family, at least one of whom may have been involved.  As always, Robicheaux's writing is almost lyrical, and he can describe many of the same physical details he's covered in other novels without boring the reader.  Clete Purcell also appears, spicing things up with his brutal violence and strange wisdom.  And just to surprise us, Burke also throws in a very unexpected romantic involvement for Dave.  Burke is one of our best contemporary novelists, and this is another piece of proof towards that.  Anyone who has enjoyed past works from this series should like this one.
