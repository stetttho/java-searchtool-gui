 While the title may be misleading - Perry doesn't really explain how good teams become great - this is still an interesting read for both casual and serious fans.  It's a good look at the assumptions made about winning teams, and one that allows the reader to draw their own conclusions.  The chapters are divided into topics like "the slugger" and "the closer," pieces that are assumed should be combined to make a great team.  Perry then takes a closer look at what each of these items has contributed to teams that have made the playoffs over the past 25 years.  There is very little in the way of heady mathematical formulas, and Perry isn't trying to push his own beliefs.  Like the reader, he simply seems curious to know the role each of these items has played.  If there's a problem with the book, it's that there seems to be very little correlation between the items examined, and the actual art of winning.  In most cases, good teams do tend to do the things we expect, but it doesn't always come across in impressive numbers.  It might be unfair to say that there's not enough correlation - perhaps it's better to say that there isn't what I would say is overwhelming evidence, at least in most cases.  There's some mathematical significance to many of the numbers, but little that will blow away the reader.  Despite this fact, the book is still one that I'd recommend.  Perry writes with a good wit, but without the condesencion that sometimes creeps into efforts by the BP gang.  He obviously has a good sense of humor, and it works well in combination with his equally obvious knowledge of baseball.  He occasionally goes off onto tangents about particular players, like Pedro Guerrero or Cesar Cedeno, and these make for some of the best parts of this book.  If you're looking for answers, you're not likely to find them all here.  However, if you want something interesting, and something that will make you think, this is a good read.
