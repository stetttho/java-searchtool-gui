 Dan Diamond and his staff have again done an outstanding job of preparing a preview guide that ranks among the best in any pro sport. For the hockey fan, this isn't an optional purchase, but one you must have.   The statistical information for active players and prospects is unrivaled in any print resource. And while much of this information can now be found online (at the Internet Hockey Database, a great resource), there's nothing like having this handy reference on your desk or coffee table to grab up during a game, or while you're having a conversation about a player.   I've bought this book for years, and I still love going over the lists of all-time leaders, or looking at a list of guys who scored 50 goals in a season and reminiscing about those times. For hockey trivia addicts, this book is like a great fix, with list after list, and recaps from every season preceeding 2005.   There are a couple of items I'd love to see added to this annual, but it's hard to quibble about so great a resource. This should find a home on the desk or coffee table of every NHL fan out there
