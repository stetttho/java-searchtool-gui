 Not being a fan of Buster Olney's writing while at the NYT, or now at ESPN, I didn't have great expectations of this book.  However, this is a surprisingly insightful look at the Yankee dynasty, delivered in an interesting format.  Interspersing action from Game 7 of the 2001 World Series with a look at the members of the Yankees' organizations - not only the players, but also Steinbrenner, Cashman, Gene Michael, etc. - Olney examines the building of the dynasty, and how it finally came apart.  I think all baseball fans, regardless of whether they love or hate the Yankees, should enjoy this one.  Simply put, it's a good baseball book, and Olney does a terrific job.
