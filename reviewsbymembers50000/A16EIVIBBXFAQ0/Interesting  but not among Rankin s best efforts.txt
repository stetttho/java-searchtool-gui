 Readers of Rankin's Inspector Rebus series will recognize the hero of this novel, George Reeve, as a later nemesis of Rebus.  And while Reeve makes for an interesting character, this early effort from Rankin (originally written under a pseudonym) isn't on the level of his later work.  When former SAS Reeve hears that his freelance journalist brother has committed suicide while investigating a story in California, Reeve flies to America to retrieve the body.  It's not long before he questions whether his brother's death was truly a suicide, and he's soon delving into the story on which his brother was working.  As expected, he soon becomes a target of those who don't appreciate his digging.  It's difficult to judge this one without comparing it to the outstanding Rebus series, against which it suffers.  The characters aren't as well-developed, so the natural ease with which Rebus and his associates talk and act doesn't exist to the same degree in this novel.  Reeve makes a decent hero, although it will be hard for some to reconcile this behavior with his later terrorizing of Rebus.  Overall, a decent read, and one worth your time.  It's interesting to see how Rankin writes then as compared to now, and it's a fairly compelling story.
