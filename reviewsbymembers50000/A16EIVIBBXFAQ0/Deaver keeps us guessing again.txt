 Weaving together a tight but elaborate plot, along with a bag full of twists and turns, Deaver has fashioned another highly entertaining Lincoln Rhyme novel.  This time around, the plot focuses on a young girl named Geneva Settle, on whose life an attempt at murder is made.  Lincoln quickly surmises that the attempt has something to do with what Geneva may know, but it's up to Rhyme, Sachs et al to figure out exactly what that means.  What seperates Deaver from many thriller writers is that he presents his characters as more than one-dimensional representations of good and evil.  As always, Rhyme is at times a jerk, besides being a brilliant investigator.  And while the person chasing Geneva is obviously bad, a great deal of time is spent on filling out his character, instead of just showing him as an evil monster.  I'd be shocked if anyone could figure out every twist that happens in this book, since there are a number of them.  It's a credit to Deaver that he can pull these tricks without losing the reader, or without cheapening his book.  As with the whole Lincoln Rhyme series, I'd highly recommend this one.
