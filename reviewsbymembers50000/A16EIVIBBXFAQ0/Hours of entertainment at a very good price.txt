 We got this for our daughter's recent first birthday, and it has already proven its worth.  She enjoys pressing the objects that make noise (phone, toilet, etc.), then laughing at her accomplishments.  She will also use the house as a place for playing with other toys.  The assembly required is extremely minimal - just a few screws - and while there are many stickers to put on before the house is complete, it's certainly not difficult or time-consuming.  The product seems durable, at least what I've seen of it to this point.  While I don't know how enjoyable this would be for an older child, I certainly think it's an excellent choice as a first dollhouse for a younger child.  And with the relatively low price, it's not going to be too painful if your little one doesn't enjoy it as much as you'd like.
