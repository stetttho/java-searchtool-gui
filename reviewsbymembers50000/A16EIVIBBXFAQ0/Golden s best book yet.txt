 Chris Golden has written a number of page-turners for teens, and with this book he has finally done the same for adults.  The premise is an interesting one.  While back in his hometown for a high school reunion, Will James mentions Mike, a friend who he's yet to see at the gathering.  When another friend chastises him for joking about Mike, who apparently died in their senior year of high school, it begins a chain reaction of events that causes Will's memories to begin changing.  As Will's memories continue to change - and never for the better - he's forced to revisit a dark area of his own past, if he's to have any chance to correct everything that is now going wrong.  The prose, as usual with Golden, can be clunky at times.  I think this is a remnant of all those years of writing teen fiction, but it can be somewhat frustrating at times.  Fortunately, the story is more than good enough to overcome these shortcomings, and Golden does a great job of letting events unfold at a proper pace.  It's refreshing to read a horror/suspense book that doesn't simply recycle a plot we've seen a thousand times.  Golden has fashioned a winner, the best book he's written to date.  It's not classic lit, but it's definitely an excellent read.
