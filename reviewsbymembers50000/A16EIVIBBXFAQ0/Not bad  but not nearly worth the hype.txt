 Having read so many positive reviews about this "literary page-turner," I was really looking forward to an exciting and fast-paced read.  However, my belief upon finishing is that, while the writing is definitely literary, this is hardly a page-turner.  Instead, it's just an average novel, one that I wouldn't consider a necessary read.  While the mystery surrounds a relic called the Stela of Paser, the book is really more of an examination of its protagonist, Walter Rothschild.  I know this has been compared by some to the Da Vinci Code, and that's unfair.  Dan Brown wrote a great book, but one that was simply a page-turner based on the mystery, with his characters really secondary in the story.  With this novel, Bondurant really focuses on his characters, with the events serving more as a backdrop.  Bondurant is certainly a good writer, but the story simply gets bogged down in parts.  I don't expect non-stop action, but it just felt like much more could have happened, and I believe that some of the focus on Rothschild could have been shifted to covering the novel's action.  Again, this certainly isn't a bad book, and I think Bondurant is a good writer.  However, I really feel that anyone going in hoping for a true page-turning literary thriller will be disappointed.
