 While Ebert's annual collection of reviews make for an enjoyable read, this second collection of "great" movies, like the first, is an essential for the movie fan.  One of the reasons I enjoy Ebert's film criticism is that he's open to finding something good in movies from all genres, never showing the bias that I see from too many critics.  That range shows in his choices here, which run from classics like "The Grapes of Wrath" to brilliant works of anime like "Grave of the Fireflies."  I've always thought of Ebert as the "common man" among movie critics, and this book furthers that reputation.  Each entry is given 3-4 pages of discussion, and a picture is also included from each film.  More than just a review, these entries explain what makes each film "great" in Ebert's view.  While I might not agree with every selection, it's difficult to argue with his reasoning for their inclusion.  For all films, he looks beyond the obvious reasons for greatness, focusing on cinematography in individual scenes, music selection, and other items that are often overlooked by those of us who have only seen the film once.  I get the feeling Ebert has hundreds more of such films on his list, so I'll forward to the next collection.  With excellent writing and strong arguments, I'd highly recommend this volume for any movie fan.
