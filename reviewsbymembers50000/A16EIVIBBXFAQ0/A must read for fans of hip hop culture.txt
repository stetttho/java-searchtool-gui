 While 50 Cent's name in the title of this book may draw some interest, it's the characters of the generation that preceeded 50 that make this such an essential piece of cultural lit for those interested in the relationship between hustling and hip-hop.  A summary of the book's plot seems redundant.  What makes this book stand out are the hustlers themselves - Fat Cat Nichols, Supreme, Prince, and several others.  Brown presents their lives and misdeeds without passing judgment on them, allowing the reader to interpret the possible motives behind why they do what they do.  The book also provides an interesting look at the early days of Queens hip-hop, including the lack of money being made by the artists involved at the time (the talk of Jay Mizell being so heavily in debt at the time of his death brings the point across pretty clearly).  For fans of contemporary hip-hop, there's plenty about the rivalry between Ja and 50, and Brown does a good job of exposing what should seem to be a lack of true street cred.  Nobody in this book, outside of a few Queens narcotic cops, comes across in a very good light.  Brown pulls no punches, as the facts tell the story.  Recommended for any fan of hip-hop culture, especially to those unfamiliar with much of what's covered in this book.
