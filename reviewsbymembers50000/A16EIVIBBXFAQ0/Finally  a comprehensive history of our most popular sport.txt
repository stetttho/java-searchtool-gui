 Considering the popularity of pro football in this country, the historical literature on the game has really been lacking, especially when compared to the thousands of works on baseball.  Finally, McCambridge has crafted what should prove as the definitive history of the game, one that any fan of football should enjoy.  Although it's a 500-page book, the author's style makes this a pretty brisk read.  While full of details, the book isn't overwhelmed by them, always giving the reader an excellent view of the big picture, and of the role that each person and event plays.  It's clear that the author admires many of the people he talks about, but he still manages to present both praise and criticism, never letting his work become hagiographic.  His treatment of the AFL-NFL relationship during the years before their merger is the best I've seen.  This is truly a book that's just been waiting to be written.  Thankfully, McCambridge has done great justice to a subject ripe for examination.  I think this should be necessary reading for anyone who considers themselves a serious fan.
