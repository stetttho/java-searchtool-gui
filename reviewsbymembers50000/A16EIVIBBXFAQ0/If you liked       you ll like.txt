 The new edition has some added features like projected career totals and injury projections, but the meat of it is similar to what appeared in 2004.  For stats junkies who just want the numbers, it's a great book.  For those who prefer Prospectus and their comments (for better or, often, worse), this may be a disappointment because of its lack of commentary on players.  There is some discussion of items like the career projections and injury projections, but no essays that make his Abstracts or other books like Win Shares so popular.  I'd definitely consider this a must for 2005 - a concise, easy to use guide to the essential stats that can be kept on your coffee table all season - but I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who doesn't share an obsession with stats.
