 I'd read the review for this months ago in Kirkus, and my first thought was, "How is Hornby going to pull off a book around such an odd topic?"  Well, I should have known better than to worry, as Hornby pulls it off with humor and great flair.  As you probably already know, the plot involves 4 people who meet while preparing to jump to their deaths from a famous suicide spot.  Instead of doing so, they band together to form one of the strangest support group/families you'll ever read about.  I think many who read this one will feel bad about laughing out loud at certain passages, given the darkness of the subject.  However, the ability to make us do that, to be able to laugh at topics like death and suicide, is what makes Hornby a great writer.  Even in deadly serious situations, he's able to inject his wit and make us take things just a little bit lighter.  I've been waiting for this one, and it was well worth the wait.  Not only do I feel like my expectations and anxieties were met, but that they were easily surpassed.  I can't recommend this one highly enough.  With all the poor fiction that gets released every week, it's such a great feeling when a gem like this one comes along.
