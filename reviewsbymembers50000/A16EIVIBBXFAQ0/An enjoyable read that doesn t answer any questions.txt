 While I enjoyed this quick and easy effort from Araton, it left me with one question at the end - "What exactly was the author trying to prove in writing this?"    The title would indicate that we should expect a treatise covering several topics: the decline of basketball fundamentals in America, the fall of the U.S. as a basketball empire, the MTV-ization of the game, and a few others that would all contribute to proving what the title claims.  Instead, this is a disjointed effort, part lecture, part memoir, and part history lesson.  Personally, I think that this would have worked better as a simple memoir of Araton's time spent covering the game.  He could have told more of the interesting personal stories that he interjects here, especially considering how long he's been around the game.  This is a book that becomes repititious, and that might have been avoided had he included more about his interactions with players, coaches, etc.  He could have talked about how he believes the game has declined here, but it wouldn't have had to be the centerpiece of his book.  I believe that a great book about the decline of basketball here in the U.S. needs to be written, but I don't think this is it.  This doesn't dig nearly deep enough into the underlying causes of the decline, and the format is so scattershot as to keep the reader guessing exactly what might be the point of certain parts of the book.  Again, this is an enjoyable and fast read, but I was expecting something more.
