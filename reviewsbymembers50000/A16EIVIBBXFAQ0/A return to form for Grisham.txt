 As someone who hasn't enjoyed Grisham's writing since the late '90s, I really didn't have high expectations for this book.  I don't think any of us read his novels looking for any kind of enlightment, but instead we only want an intelligent, fun ride.  To that end, The Broker is a success.  Unlike some of his more recent books, this one sticks to his old formula - a sympathetic character, intrigue, and a "chase" leading into a good ending.  The only thing that drags the book down is that Backman's time in Italy reads at times like a pastoral novel.  I'm all for character development, but we learn more at times about the country than about Backman.  I still look back on early efforts like A Time to Kill and The Firm as being Grisham's best.  This doesn't reach that level, but it's certainly a welcome improvement from recent material.
