 Like the reviewer before me said, this is a book that starts out like it's going to be a top-drawer thriller.  The 2 lead characters, while typically beautiful and superintelligent, still manage to be interesting, and the pace is kept up well.  Where the book runs into trouble is when the author, speaking through his characters, begins to philosophize on the subject of religion.  I'm not detracting from his views, but this isn't exactly what I look for in a thriller.  I want action, some twists, some interesting characters, and an intelligent and logical plot.  What I don't want it is a treatise, which is what this book becomes in its second half.  Even with these faults, it's certainly not a bad read.  I was a little let down because of the expectations I had, but it's still better than much of what's out there in the thriller field.
