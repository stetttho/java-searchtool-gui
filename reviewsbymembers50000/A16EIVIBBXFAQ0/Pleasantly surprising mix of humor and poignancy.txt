 Having read so many mixed reviews of this show, I wasn't sure exactly what to expect.  After watching the first season, I now feel that this now-cancelled show is better than 99% of the shows on non-cable channels.  Ellen Muth, who really was an unknown coming into this series, does a terrific job as George, a slacker who remains unmotivated even after becoming undead.  While her character initially comes across as abrasive and somewhat annoying, she eventually shows a softer underbelly, especially with regards to the mother and sister she mostly disliked while alive.  Mandy Patinkin is his usual self, someone who many will like while others will hate.  His Rube is the leader of this group of the undead, and Patinkin gives his character an everyman quality that I found endearing.  Of the other supporting cast, Cynthia Stevenson stands out as George's still-grieving mom who also has a difficult younger daughter with whom to deal.  I felt that Rebecca Gayheart was the weak link among the cast, but she thankfully left during the season.  The stories are pretty simple, dealing with the taking of souls.  However, these tales are used to take a look at the life of George and the members of her group.  Happy and sad, funny and depressing, but always entertaining.  I'm shocked that anyone could find this show as unappealing as some do.  I'd recommend it to any fan of quality television, both for its originality and its compelling characters.
