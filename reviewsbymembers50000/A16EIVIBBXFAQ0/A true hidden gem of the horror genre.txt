 Considering the lack of reviews and plain packaging for this novel, it's not surprising that it's been overlooked by so many readers.  However, I would suggest that any fan of horror novels give it a chance, because it's one of the best works to appear in that genre over the past several years.  Taking the "evil comes to a small town" premise and twisting it in a wonderful way, Thomas manages to avoid put a terrific spin on the story.  The evil at the basis of this story is never given its own face, remaining an unknown entity.  And what truly lifts this book above so much else out there is the manner in which Thomas uses the entity of evil to examine the bad things that lurk inside everyone.  This is a true treat for any horror fan, and Thomas is definitely an author to watch.  This story grips you from its horrible beginning and keeps you guessing until the end.  There's very little in the way of cardboard characterizition, and the novel's hero isn't infallible himself.  Highly recommended, and I can't say enough about this one.
