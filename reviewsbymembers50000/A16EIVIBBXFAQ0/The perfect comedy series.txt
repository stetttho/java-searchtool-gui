 Not to echo other reviewers too much, but this is probably the best comedy series to ever grace television.  Ricky Gervais came up with a good idea, and he executed it as brilliantly as anyone ever has with a TV show.  The subject matter is often intentionally benign and boring, providing a perfect backdrop for the show's humor.  Gervais is undoubtedly the backbone of the show, but everyone is outstanding in their supporting roles - so outstanding, in fact, that it's difficult to pick anyone who stands out above others.  Although this show only lasted for 2 series, I can't say I'm disappointed with its length.  Brilliance should be appreciated, even if it doesn't last for 6 seasons.  I'd rather it went out and top, than to have it stick around and lose its edge.
