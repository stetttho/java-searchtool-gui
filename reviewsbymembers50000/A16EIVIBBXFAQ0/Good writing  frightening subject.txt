 This is a well-written, seriously scary book that will likely have many readers cringing when they read about the problems alcohol led to for Zailckas.  As someone with a young daughter, I found it to be both a cautionary tale and an engrossing memoir.  For anyone who has an alcoholic or binge drinker in their family, you'll be able to relate on some level.  For me, it was interesting to hear about the experience from the perspective of a young woman.  The author writes lucidly and poetically about her past, showing the effects of her lifestyle without ever trying to invoke pity for anything that happened to her in the past.  It makes one wonder how common her story, or at least certain elements of it, are to many young women.    Although the material is often heavy and depressing, this one will keep your attention.  A terrific and frightening account.
