 Gladwell's latest is a breezy, enjoyable read that unfortunately left me wondering about the whole point of the book.    The discussions of the way we intuit, or thin-slice things, can be fascinating.  However, he makes it clear at other times that this can be a poor approach.  I've got no problem with contradiction, but a little further explanation would have been nice.  This felt like a book that could have been much longer, and one that could have gone deeper, instead of providing plenty of light, anecdotal incidents to prove a point.  While it's one that you'll probably enjoy, it just doesn't leave you with much in the end.
