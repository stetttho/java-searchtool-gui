 It's two years later, but Theodore Johnson (aka Armpit) still spends his time.  The difference now is that he's getting paid for it, and this position with a landscaping company is one of the "small steps" Armpit is trying to take in order to change his life for the better.  While Armpit does all he can to avoid trouble, it inevitably finds him in the form of his former Camp Green Lake buddy X-Ray, who has come up with a moneymaking scheme involving concert tickets to see teen sensation Kaira Deleon.  Not suprisingly, things don't turn out the way Armpit expects, and his whole life is thrown into turmoil.  Armpit makes for a sympathetic hero, and Sachar does a terrific job of teaching the moral lessons involved with his "small steps," without ever sounding preachy.  While Stanley and Zero would seem more obvious candidates for a second novel, it turns out that an unexplored character like Armpit actually has a lot to reveal.  The story moves quickly, and this will likely be a one-sitting read for many people.  It's difficult to match a classic like Holes, but this is a more-than-worthy followup to such a great novel.  It won't match the first, but I believe that fans of Holes will enjoy this read.
