 I'll admit to being skeptical about this book, given that the first was so great.  My feeling was that it could only go downhill, and that it would tarnish my memories of Meggie, Dustfinger, and the rest of the group.  Funke has proven my worries unfounded with Inkspell, a book that starts off somewhat slowly but picks up its momentum greatly in the second half.  While there are still some unanswered questions, and some points of logic that don't seem to add up, this is a book that should entertain all those who loved the first.  While I don't put this on the level of Inkheart, it's nonetheless an outstanding piece of fiction.
