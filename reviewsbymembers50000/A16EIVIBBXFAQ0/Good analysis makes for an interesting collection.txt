 Given the title, one might think that this is a book where Neyer spends 250 pages criticizing boneheaded decisions, but it's not.  Instead, Neyer takes the time to examine about 50 blunders, taking the time to analyze each decision instead of simply pointing fingers at those making the blunder.  While the first blunder examined took place in 1917, this book is heavily weighted towards modern times.  Only 15 take place before 1960, and almost half take place after 1970.  Each incident is given about 4-7 pages of analysis, and many of the entries include side stories that Neyer includes in the margins.  Many of the entries will be very familiar to baseball fans - the selling of the Babe, the trade of Roger Maris, and the Bagwell-Andersen deal.  There are, however, many that aren't nearly so famous, like Tom Runnells' decision to shift Tim Wallach across the diamond, or the Pirates' benching of Kiki Cuyler during a stretch run.  It's a good mix that Neyer has created.  Along with the regular entries, there are several "interludes" to break things up, including a couple about bad trades, and a funny entry about managers who never should have been in that position.  Neyer is, in my opinion, the most improved baseball writer over the past several years.  He's always been a brilliant baseball mind, but now he seems to have found his touch as a writer.  This book is enjoyable not only because of the cases he chooses to discuss, but also because of his style.  There's plenty of analysis, some good humor, and little in the way of ridiculing or finger-pointing, which would have been easy to do in such a book.  An excellent book, and it's tough to beat the price.  I'd recommend it for any baseball fan, even if not everything in here is new to you.
