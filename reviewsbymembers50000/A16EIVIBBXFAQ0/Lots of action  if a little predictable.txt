 Okay, so you can guess the ending to this one after reading the first chapter.  So it's to Pearson's credit that he's able to craft an enjoyable, fast-paced read despite the fact that you know what the ultimate outcome is going to be.  The action at times can seem pretty unbelievable, but that can be forgiven in a thriller.  The characters of Roland Larson and Hope Stevens are both well-crafted, and Pearson does a good job of bringing romance into the story without it becoming overly sappy.  Pearson is a pro, and it shows again in this one.  Recommended for anyone who likes a good thriller.
