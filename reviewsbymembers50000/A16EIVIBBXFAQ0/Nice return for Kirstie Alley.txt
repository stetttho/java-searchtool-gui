 This is a much stronger show than I would have expected, given what I didn't see as a very strong premise.  But with great writing, an excellent cast, and Kirstie Alley anchoring the show with still-strong comedic instincts, this has turned out to be one of TV's better comedies.  A strong supporting cast really helps this show, with Rachael Harris and Bryan Callen both providing excellent foils for Alley.  Kelly Preston has a small but funny recurring role, and their are some hilarious guest turns - I especially enjoyed Kevin Nealon's turn as a Specter-esque producer, and Bill Smitrovich as an emotional suitor to Alley.  The first episode is the weakest of the bunch, but that's likely because it had to be used to set up the rest of the season and to introduce the players.  After that, the show quickly begins to arc sharply upward, and there are some truly hilarious and memorable scenes in each episode.  It would have been nice to have more than 7 episodes, but I have to credit HBO with never trying to squeeze too much out of a show.  If you like Kirstie Alley, and if you're a fan of other semi-reality comedies like Curb, you're sure to enjoy this show.  A great first season, and a show well worth watching.
