 If you were to break down the likelihood of all the events that take place in this novel, you'd probably realize the chances of everything happening in this way are just about null.  However, I don't read Finder's novels because of their realism - he's a great escapist writer, and this novel is no exception.  I won't rehash the story, but suffice to say that it's tightly told, with little space wasted despite the fact that this one is somehwhat lengthy.  Nick Stratton is a sympathetic and believable protagonist, and most of the characters are fleshed out well by Finder.  His writing is, as usual, crisp, and he doesn't waste time on events unimportant to the story.  For anyone looking for a quick, exciting read that goes beyond a typical thriller, this one is a good choice.  It's not his best effort, but this is definitely another winner from Finder.
