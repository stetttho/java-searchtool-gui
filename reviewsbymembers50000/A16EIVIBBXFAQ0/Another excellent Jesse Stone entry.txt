 While this series will likely never rival Spenser in popularity, Robert Parker deserves credit for crafting yet another great story featuring Jesse Stone.  I'll leave the plot regurgitation to others, and I'll say only that the pacing of the novel is, as usual, excellent.  The bad guys are sufficiently unlikable without becoming caricatures, and Jesse's friends and coworkers provide him a good foil.  As with other entries in this series, this one is about Jesse himself as much as it as about the crime and investigation.  He's now gone without drink for almost a year, and he continues to attempt a reconciliation with his ex-wife, Jenn.  Jesse's struggles are presented simply, and Parker never becomes preachy or makes Stone out to be some kind of martyr or model of perfect behavior.  Although the book is almost 300 pages long, my guess is that most Parker fans will finish it in a day.  The writing is clear and crisp, with little extraneous description, and the characters speak like real people, rarely going into long, eloquent explanations of a subject.  Parker has always been a master at presenting realistic dialogue, and that's on display here.  This is a series that seems to be getting better with every book, and I'd highly recommend this to fans of Jesse Stone or Parker's other series.  It's a quick, enjoyable read from one of our great contemporary authors.
