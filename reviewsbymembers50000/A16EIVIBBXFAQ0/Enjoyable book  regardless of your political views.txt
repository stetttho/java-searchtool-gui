 I read this book mainly because I like country music, and because I was interested in knowing a little bit about some of the artists' views beyond what we hear in a 4-minute song.    I know that some reviewers have complained about what they perceive as Willman's left-leaning stance, and I'd have to agree with them that he's not completely objective.  A little too much time is spent on the plight of the Dixie Chicks, for whom I feel bad, but whose story probably could have been shortened in an attempt to include more viewpoints.  At the same time, though, Willman does not criticize one side while leaving the other alone.  Several artists speak freely and articulately, from both sides of the spectrum - Steve Earle, Toby Keith, and Ronnie Dunn might not be having dinner together anytime soon, but it was fascinating to hear each of their perspectives.  And for anyone who believes country musicians to be less than intelligent as a whole, this book will likely open some eyes.  The level of political awareness among many of the artists, particularly Keith and Dunn, will surprise many.  One item that I really enjoyed was the discussion of the fued between Toby Keith and the Dixie Chicks.  It was interesting to read Keith's comments about the Chicks' insults, and I got the feeling that he was insulted more about their criticism of his musical talent than any political views he might have.  He's obviously a proud artist, and it seems like he was genuinely taken somewhat aback.  This is a great book, one that held me so much that I wished Willman had included another 50 pages.  For any fan of country music, or just those interested in the politics of that music.
