 While I've always enjoyed Premiere, I really feel like this magazine has become better than ever at what it does.  From early previews to comprehensive movie and DVD reviews, Premiere offers coverage that I just don't find in other reasonably priced magazines (I make that price distinction because Empire, a fantastic movie mag, is much more expensive).  The cover is almost always eye-catching - even if it's the annoying Dukes of Hazzard trio like on this month's issue - and I like both the layout and format.  They've expanded their DVD coverage, which is important for anyone who collects films, and they preview movies in detail before anyone else.  Thankfully, they've moved away from their original practice of not grading films, which I often found annoying.  Admittedly, some of their columns have grown stale (Libby), but their features on films and/or stars are still insightful and without fluff.  The photos are always sharp and relevant, and while there's no lack of advertising, it doesn't occur to the point of annoyance like with Vanity Fair and others.  Along with Empire, this is one I think every film fan should read on a regular basis.  A great magazine at a great price - there's little not to like.
