 Whenever I see the ratings for this brilliant but ignored show, all I can do is wonder why so many people choose not to watch such a great series.  Hopefully, many of them will purchase this DVD to see what they've been missing.  Jason Bateman has made an incredible comeback from obscurity to serve as the anchor of the show, just as he anchors the Bluth family.  The cast around him is uniformly excellent - Will Arnett and David Cross are my favorites, but it's hard to go wrong with choosing any of the supporting cast.  The writing is sharp throughout the season, with the show never losing its dry, ironic touch.  I didn't expect that Fox or any other network could come up with such a great show, one that matches some cable efforts.  I'd recommend this DVD collection both for current fans, and for those interested in catching on to something great.
