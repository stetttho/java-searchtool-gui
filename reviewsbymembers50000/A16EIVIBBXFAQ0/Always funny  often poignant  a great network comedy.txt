 From the first episode in this collection, it's obvious that the writers of this show had created something special.  The mix of outrageous cutaways, great acting, and heartwarming or sad storylines lift this above so many other sitcoms.  The casting of the main characters is excellent.  Zach Braff may have been unproven at the time, but he has proven to be a great choice, and I doubt any Scrubs fans were surprised by his recent film success in Garden State.  Donald Faison and Sarah Chalke both give their characters great texture, and Neil Flynn has a number of scene-stealing moments playing the Janitor.  However, the person who stands out most in this first season is the horribly underrated John McGinley, who plays Dr. Cox with a manic energy that has somehow gone unnoticed for 5 years.  While there are times you might despise him, he's also easy to sympathize with, and his character is responsible for many of the show's great moments.  There are several standout episodes, with very few weak ones.  The episodes, "My Mentor" and "My Super Ego" stand out, since they inject some seriousness into the usual comedy.  The development of the Cox-J.D. relationship is enjoyable to watch, as is the development of the supporting cast.  There are very few great shows on network TV, and this is one of them.  While it has never garnered the ratings of lesser shows, I can't recommend it enough.
