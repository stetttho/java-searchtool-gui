 When Playmakers first aired on ESPN, I was skeptical enough that I refused to watch the show, and I was glad it eventually got cancelled.  After having watched the series on DVD, however, I see that my beliefs about it were not only wrong, but unfounded.  While the acting isn't on a level with some other cable shows, it's good enough to make most of the characters believable.  I enjoyed the fact that they're all fallible, that they have problems and insecurities away from the playing field.  I also think it's interesting that some here have criticized the show for only showing the "dark" side of the game.  First, it likely wouldn't be a very entertaining show if it was all sunshine, with the team winning and every player acting the perfect citizen.  Secondly, I don't think it shows the "dark" side so much as the "real" side of pro sports.  Considering that several NFL players have tested positive for steroids and that Ricky Williams and Koren Robinson are both having suspensions placed upon them for drug use, I don't think the show is any darker than reality.  A good show, even for non-football fans.
