 Leanne Womack has always had a wonderful country voice, but I've thought that her material didn't always fit her skills.  With this album, she has definitely moved up a notch thanks to good songwriting and song selection.  There are a couple of standout tracks, specifically the title track and, "I May Hate Myself in the Morning," a fantastic piece of country that doesn't sound much like current country radio.  The album has a couple of dull tracks, but is for the most part consistently excellent.  One thing I'd like to see is Womack writing more of her songs.  I know she cowriters one or two of the tracks on this album, but I'd really like to hear more of her own "voice" in her work.  But as far as singing someone else's words, she does it very well this time around.
