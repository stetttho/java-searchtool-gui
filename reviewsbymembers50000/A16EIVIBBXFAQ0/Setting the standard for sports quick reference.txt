 While there's little in the way of original research, that's not the purpose of this book.  It aims only to be a recap of the year in sports, as well as a historical reference, both of which it does well.  The Olympic coverage is excellent, as is the recap of the 2004 baseball season.  One thing ESPN does exceptionally well is baseball, and that shows in this book.  The only negative to this item is that it plays too much on the ESPN brand - things like Sportscenter Top 10 lists are cute, but I'd rather just have the facts.  Still, I'd recommend this as something for sports fans to keep on their bookshelves.  Sure, you can find most of the info online if you know where to look, but it's nice to have convenient access all in one place.
