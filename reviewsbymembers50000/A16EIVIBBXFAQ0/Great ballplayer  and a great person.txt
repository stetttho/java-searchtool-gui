 If you're looking for an exhaustive biography of Gehrig, one of the best to ever grace a diamond, look no further.  Eig has written a wonderful book that gives great insight into not only Gehrig the player, but also Gehrig the man.  It's obvious from the discussion of his upbringing that Gehrig was not a "typical" Yankee star, one who would enjoy the bright lights and fame.  As a child, and continuing into his adult life, he was a shy, modest person who wanted only to work hard and do his best.  His relationship, or lack thereof, with fellow superstar Babe Ruth, is given a lot of coverage, and is one of the more interesting aspects of the book.  Given Gehrig's background and social anxieties, it's not really surprising that he and Ruth (along with other teammates) never seemed to mesh.  While the coverage given to his seasons with the Yankees is comprehensive, it's the anecdotes and off-the-field stuff that really add to the existing knowledge we have of Gehrig.  And even when we know towards the end of the book exactly what's going to happen, Eig still manages to present the onset of his illness and eventual death dramatically, without simply playing on emotions.  I was surprised to learn that his ALS had begun its onset in '38, and not a year later when he was forced to call it quits.  Eig presents Gehrig well, without romanticizing him or turning his book into a hagiography.  While I think any baseball fan will love this book, I don't think being a fan of the sport is a prerequisite to enjoyment.  This is a great biography of a genuinely good man, one who always seemed unsure about being in the spotlight.  Highly recommended.
