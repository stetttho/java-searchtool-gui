 The first season would have been terrible, if not for the fact that Jamie Foxx had an obvious talent that was just looking for the right material.  The writing is pretty weak, and the supporting cast lacks any kind of cohesiveness, but Foxx rescues the show with his comedy.    For most of the series' run, Jamie Foxx was miles ahead of the rest of the cast, and this first season is an example of that.  There are some pretty funny moments, almost all of which come from Foxx.  Great timing, good comedic mannerisms, and the willingness to make a fool of himself if it means a better laugh.  Not an essential purchase by any means, but it's fun to look back and see the development of a very funny man.
