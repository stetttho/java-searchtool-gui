 While Iles' books always make for a good read, he may have written his best yet with this one.  Iles manages to pull off a task with which many male writers have problems - writing from the point of view of a woman, in this case Cat Ferry, a vulnerable and likable character.  While she's likable, she's also very human in her thoughts and actions, not a superwoman like too many fictional characters.  While the plot includes a serial killer in New Orleans, the book is really about Cat's past and her attempt to get past those events.  Of course, this past eventually ties in somewhat to the present, but Cat is really the focus, far more than the murders.  There's plenty of action and mystery, and Iles keeps the reader hanging for most of the book.  Thrillers are a dime a dozen, but excellent ones like this are far more rare.  An excellent novel, one that will have most readers rushing to get to the end.
