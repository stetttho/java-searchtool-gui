 Having a daughter who despised her infant seat, I was really worried about whatever choice we were going to make for the toddler seat.  After reading several reviews on Amazon and other sites, I decided on a Triumph, and we couldn't be happier.  The loosening of the straps is a little more difficult than with many infant seats, but it simply takes getting used to.  Really, it comes down to pressing a knob while pulling the strap, the same as with many seats.  The straps fit snugly without pressing into my daughter too much, and there is plenty of padding to provide a comfortable ride.  I'd recommend this seat (or any in the Triumph series) to as a reasonably priced, comfortable, and safe ride for baby.
