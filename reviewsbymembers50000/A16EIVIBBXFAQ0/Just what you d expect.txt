 If you're looking for a quick, handy reference guide to current players, this is a pretty good source.  Included are the regular season and postseason stats for anyone who appeared in the majors in 2004.  Don't expect to see advanced stats like VORP or EqERA, but there are items like lefty-righty batting and pitching breakdowns.  For a traditional stats publication, TSN has done a decent job.  If you need something with more Sabermetric info, I'd suggest waiting for Prospectus, or using the BP site.
