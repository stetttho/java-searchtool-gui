 Like the reviewer before me, I won't bother with rehashing the plot.  Suffice to say that our hero is a cop working a tough case.  What seperates this from so many police procedurals is Parker's writing, and his ability to present characters as multidimensional.  Robbie Brownlaw presents one face to the world, but Parker lets the reader know - without being obvious or heavy-handed - just how complex a person he is, and he makes it seem like everyone has those complexities even if they're not always noticed.  There were 2 facets to this novel that I think could have really harmed the book in the hands of a lesser writer.  The first is the manner in which Robbie's ability manifests itself, which I believe would have been beaten to death by many authors.  The second is the subplot involving Robbie and Gina's marital troubles.  I've read many police procedurals where the personal relationships seem created for nothing more than filling pages, but this isn't one of them.  For one thing, their discussions and problems are about as believable as any I've ever read in a novel.  Secondly, the problems with Gina are the perfect vehicle for Robbie to use in his own self-examination, which adds greatly to his appeal and that of the book.  Parker has already won a couple of Edgar awards, and it's easy to see why when you read this one.  Great story and a terrific writer, probably the best book I've read so far this year.
