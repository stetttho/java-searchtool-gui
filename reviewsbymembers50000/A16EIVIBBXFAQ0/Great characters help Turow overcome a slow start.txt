 Although the legal manuverings and constant action have been hallmarks of Turow's writing for years, it's always been the characters and storytelling that have lifted his books above those of lesser writers.  With Ordinary Heroes, it is those elements that help save a book that could easily have been no more than, well, ordinary.  As much I like Turow, I really had to force myself to keep reading during the first part of this book.  Moving away from his normal legal thriller masterpieces where he can show his expertise of the law, into the field of military duty, there are definitely some early shortcomings.  While his legal writing has always carried the touch of authenticity, he just doesn't possess the same type of knowledge when it comes to military action.  Thus, much of the action and dialogue early on seems stilted and a little dull.  It's the narrator's father who finally helps lift this one from the doldrums, providing both an interesting perspective and a complicated character.  The narrator himself becomes more interesting as the story continues, too, as he's forced to deal with what he finds when he unravels his father's past.    It's difficult to really sum up this book, as it's about more than just a guy discovering his father's hidden past.  Although it might disappoint some of Turow's faithful readers, I think anyone giving it a chance will realize that it's another excellent piece of work from a master.
