 If you have any interest in following baseball beyond each team's 25-man roster, then this is an essential publication.  Covering 30 prospects for each major league team (for a total of 900), this is about as comprehensive a look you're going to find at prospects.  Baseball America has a well-earned reputation as the best place to find minor league, college, and high school baseball information, and that expertise is evident in the book.  Each team has their prospects graded, and a look at each team's most recent amateur draft is included.  The list of the top 100 prospects is also enjoyable - or not, depending on how many players from your team are included on that list.  Unless you're a team that can afford to sign several high-priced free agents each year, player development is critical to future success.  And if you're a fan who has a serious interest in your team, then it's an area to which you likely pay a great deal of attention.  But while other publications touch occasionally or briefly on team's top minor-league prospects, no other mainstream publication does as good a job of giving a serious and deep look at your organization's prospects.  I'd recommend buying this one every year, as it's one of the best general looks at an organization's prospects.  Along with John Sickels' prospects book (available on his website), this is a necessary purchase for serious fans.
