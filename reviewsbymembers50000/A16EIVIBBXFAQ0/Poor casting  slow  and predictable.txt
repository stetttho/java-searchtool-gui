 Given its premise, it sounds like this should have been a really good movie.  Unfortunately, that's not the way it plays out.  First, the casting is poor.  As the pilot and main character, Dennis Quaid's all-American, average guy persona just doesn't work.  Giovanni Ribisi comes close to over-the-top acting, and the other characters - especially those played by Hugh Laurie and Tyrese - are completely one-dimensional stock characters whose actions can be easily predicted.  There's very little in the way of action, with most of the time spent on trite dialogue or needless shots of the desert and the plane.  When events start to unfold, their outcome can be guessed well in advance.  And while I don't have a problem with being able to guess the movie's ultimate outcome, a little bit of suspense would have helped.  Finally, the "updates" on the characters that are shown during the credits may be the corniest thing I've seen in a movie this year.  We really could have done without that touch.  I'd recommend avoiding this one, even if you're looking for a light and mindless film.  It just doesn't work on any level, and it was a real disappointment.
