 Too many times with "nonfiction," the author will fill their work with "imagined" conversations or conjecture about what may have happened.  What makes this latest work from Harr so compelling is that there is little of this to be found, and Harr allows the story to unfold without trying desperately to make it read like a novel.  The story is pretty straightforward, and obviously deals with the discovery of a long-lost Caravaggio painting.  And while the mystery of the painting is interesting, what makes the book better is the portrayal of the characters - not only those involved in the search and discovery, but also Caravaggio himself.  While Harr makes no attempt at a biography, the bits and pieces he provides of the artist's life and death are fascinating, and will likely lead some to learn more through another work.  It's refreshing to read a piece of popular nonfiction that doesn't reach beyond itself in an effort to become a thriller.  Harr lets the story tell itself, without much embellishment, and the story is a good one.
