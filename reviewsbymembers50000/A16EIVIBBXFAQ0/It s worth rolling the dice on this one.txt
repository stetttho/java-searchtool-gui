 Easily the best in the Tony Valentine series, this is one worth discovering even for those who haven't read the previous series titles.  This time around, Valentine is hired to figure out how Ricky Smith (the Mr. Lucky of the title) is turning everything he touches to gold.  Valentine is a rarity among protagonists, an older gentleman who manages to hold his own pretty well, while still managing to seem human and vulnerable.  Too many characters in such novels seem to possess almost superhuman abilities, but Valentine is a fallible hero.  The other characters aren't flushed out as well as Tony, but they're still interesting.  The action is paced well, scenes of physical altercations interspersed nicely with thought and discussion.  One minor complaint I have is that the dialogue sometimes seems stilted, but it doesn't detract from enjoyment of the novel.    I'd recommend this for anyone who likes a fast-paced read with some mystery thrown in the mix.  It's a truly enjoyable book with an excellent lead character.  And you really can't beat that price!
