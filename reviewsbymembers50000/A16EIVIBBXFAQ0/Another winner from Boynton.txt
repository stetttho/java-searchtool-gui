 Sandra Boynton has, for many years, written books that my child and many others I know hold as their favorites.  With this latest, spun from Philadelphia Chickens, she's created another one that both parents and children will love.  Featuring a bunch of hippos playing on the beach, the song is an homage to our belly buttons.  Knowing the fascination that so many kids have with their navel, this one is sure to please.  The hippo illustrations are exactly what you'd expect from Boynton, and the rhymes are silly fun.  And anyone who reads this one will especially enjoy the hippo baby who can only say, "Bee-bo," when referring to their belly button.  Boynton seems to have an amazing understanding and perception of exactly what young children will enjoy in a board book.  This is another winner, to add to an already extensive list of impressive works.
