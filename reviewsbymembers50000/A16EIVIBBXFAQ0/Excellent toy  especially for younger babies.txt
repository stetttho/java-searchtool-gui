 This is a great activity center, albeit one that some babies may grow bored of quicker than others.  The toys attached to the center are simple, but useful in teaching motor skills like pushing, pulling, etc.  At about 4-5 months, we could place our daughter in it, and she'd entertain herself while we cooked and cleaned.  Now that she's closer to 7 months, she becomes dissatisfied or bored with this toy more quickly.  She will use it in short bursts, but not for lengthy periods of time as in the past.  Even with that caveat, I'd recommend this product.  Even if you child doesn't use it heavily for more than a few months, it's more than worth the price.
