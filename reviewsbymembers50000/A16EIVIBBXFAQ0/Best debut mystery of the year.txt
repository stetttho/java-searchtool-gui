 There's certainly no shortage of "drunk P.I." novels, yet somehow Bruen has created a completely compelling work.  As a former member of an elite Irish police force, Jack Galway now whiles away his time nursing drinks in a pub.  Despite his fall from grace, Jack is still known as a man with a skill for finding things.  Enter the beautiful older woman (one of many cliches this book gets away with) with the missing daughter, and Jack's back in action.  Inevitably, he has encounters with all sorts of seedy types, leading to a resolution that may not satisfy some readers. The story may not be original, but Bruen's writing more than makes up for it.  A great read for fans of the P.I. novel, especially those who appreciate strong writing.  Unfortunately, this book will likely be overlooked in favor of others, but for anyone interested it's definitely worth the time.
