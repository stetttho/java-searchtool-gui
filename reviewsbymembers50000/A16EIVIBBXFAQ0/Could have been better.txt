 First off, I will give this film credit for not being a typical "gorefest" horror film, but one that instead leaves much to the imagination of the viewer.  The 2 young women playing the sisters both do an excellent job, and the hands-off direction allows the story to tell itself.  The reason why I didn't feel this is a great film is that the "surprise" elements of the film simply weren't surprising.  Maybe it comes from watching so many films, but it was pretty easy to see how all things would tie together at the film's end.  And for a film like this, being able to see through so much was a disappointment.  I'd still recommend this film, but I don't think it's as terrific as many others feel.
