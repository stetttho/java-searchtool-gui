 Although publishers often push novels with terms like, "It will grip you from page 1," it's rare that a book actually follows through on such a promise.  This first novel from Richard Hawke is one that does, and the momentum never wavers throughout the whole book.  The plot has been summarized in other reviews by those who probably tell it better than I could.  What I would stress instead is that this book possesses that rare combination - witty, brilliant writing, a believable character we can actually care about, and a story that doesn't let go.  Usually, especially with thrillers, it's one or the other.    I've read plenty of books from more "established" writers in the past year, and I don't think any of them can touch this debut from Hawke.  Here's hoping this is just the first in a series featuring Fritz Malone, and that the others are half as good.
