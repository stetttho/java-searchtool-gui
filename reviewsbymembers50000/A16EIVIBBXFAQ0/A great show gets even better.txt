 The second season starts with a classic cop show scenario - McNulty, now working for the marine unit, pulls a young girl's body out of the water.  From there, another season of perfection unfolds.  It's not fair to give spoilers in these reviews, but suffice to say that the show moves once again with its unhurried pace, building towards some kind of resolution.  And who knew that they could make the tribulations of a bunch of stevedores seem so interesting?  Once again, Dominic West anchors possibly the best cast on TV, with continued great work from Idris Elba and the rest of the group.  Season two also brings the welcome return of Michael Williams as Omar, who I think we were all sad to see leave during the first season.  The writing is whip smart, and all of the varied directors do an excellent job.  It's a credit to the show that it always manages to keep the same feel despite input from so many different directors.  West and Williams both provide audio commentaries, but this set isn't about the extras - it's about the show.      If there was any doubt about this show's lasting power, it should be erased with the second season.  It's truly one of the best shows to ever grace television.
