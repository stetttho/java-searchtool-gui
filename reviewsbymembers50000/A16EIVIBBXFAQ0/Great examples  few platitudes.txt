 It's difficult to evaluate a book like this so shortly after reading it, since it doesn't give you time to actually apply the insights the author is pushing.  However, it's clear that Buckingham has written another excellent management guide, one that cuts through the frivolity to provide actual answers.  What I liked about this one is that it doesn't use generalities, or vague concepts that are open to various interpretations.  As usual, Buckingham gets right to the heart of the matter, in terms that will help managers (and others) apply the lessons he presents.  I'm always skeptical of these types of management books, as there are so many that are poorly written and completely useless.  This is neither of those - instead, it's a useful, practical guide that should help many people both in an out of the workplace.
