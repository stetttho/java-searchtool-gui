 Trimmming away all the conjecture and speculation that is found in too many biographies, Morris has written a wonderfully straightforward and lucid biography of one of music's most important figures.  Given the relatively short length for a biography (barely 250 pages), I was concerned that completeness might be lacking.  However, Morris manages to cover all the major points - Beethoven's problems with alcohol, his deafness, the methods behind his genius, his problems with women - without giving the impression that he's rushing us through the book.  There are more comprehensive bios of Beethoven out there, but this is a great starting point, and a terrific addition to the study of an important figure.
