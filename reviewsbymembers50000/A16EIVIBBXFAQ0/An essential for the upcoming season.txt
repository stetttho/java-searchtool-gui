 The guys at BP have proven that they're the best resource for original, informative, stat-based methods of looking at baseball.  What they've done again this year is to pack that knowledge into an excellent publication, one that should be an essential purchase for any fan.  For those who have read previous editions, the layout and content will be familiar, but nonetheless interesting and useful.  Personally, I find the team essays and articles to be the most interesting parts of the book.  That's not to take away from the stats, which help to separate this book from many others, but the group does a great job on the team pages of including a great amount of detail in a relatively small space.  And the casual fan, unfamiliar with terms like VORP and PECOTA, will likely find this book an eye-opener, one that shows a completely different approach to the game than do so many others.  For fantasy players, this is a great resource, complaints about its publication date not withstanding.  However, beyond its fantasy value, it's a great book to have around for the season.  The amount of material packed in these pages is incredible, and the price is amazingly low.  I'd suggest making room for this one on your coffee table, and keeping it there all season long.  It should serve of great value as both an excellent read, and a great reference source for the 2005 season.
