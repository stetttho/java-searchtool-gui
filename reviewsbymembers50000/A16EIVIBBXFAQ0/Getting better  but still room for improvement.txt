 While this book still suffers from some deficiencies, I think the authors deserve credit for trying to bring football fans to the point of thinking about the game a little differently.  They'll never be able to match what BP has done for baseball fans, simply because football doesn't have the depth of stats found in baseball, but they're getting better.  One thing I like about this year's edition is that their player comments seem to have a little more thought put into them than in year's past.  In previous editions, they've felt like a hurried add-on to the stats, but they seem more able to stand on their own this time around.  A continuing problem is the seeming lack of an editor, or even someone to make sure that player names are spelled correctly.  Really, this is something that shouldn't happen, given that the whole point of your book is to judge these players.  It happens on the cover, and it happens several times throughout the book.  There are also a number of obvious grammatical errors that should have been caught.  They don't take away from the points made by the writers, but they certainly don't help the publication seem very professional.  This isn't something I would think of only for the fantasy fan.  I'd consider this important also for those fans looking to learn a little more about certain players, as well as serving as a quick reference resource during the upcoming season.  And for fantasy fans, I hope this year's projections at certain positions are better than last year - as an example, Jeff Garcia was ranked near the top of the QB listings last season, and we all know how close he actually came to that!  It's always tough to predict performance, but here's hoping they do it this time, considering it's a big part of why this book exists.
