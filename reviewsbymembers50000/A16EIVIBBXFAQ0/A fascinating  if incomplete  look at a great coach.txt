 Considering the oustanding work Halberstam had done with The Teammates and Summer of '49, I was highly anticipating this release since first hearing of it months ago.  And while it turned out be enjoyable, I just feel like there's so much more that could have been explored or explained.  The first part of the book dealing with Bill's dad, Steve, was the part that I found the most interesting.  I knew that he's always been considered a superior scout, but it was great to see how he got to that point.  Same goes for Bill's entry into the coaching ranks, and the preparation he did even before then to make himself into the great coach he would eventually become.  Where the book fails, in my opinion, is in its exploration of relationships.  It talks somewhat of the Parcells-Belichick relationship, but there seems to be a lot left unspoken.  Same with that of Parcells and Kraft, or Belichick and his current coaches, or even guys like Weis and Crennel who only recently left.  Halberstam has given what I believe is a look at only one slice of Belichick's life, and there still seems to be room for a more complete look at this great coach.  I'd like to hear more first-person comments from other coaches, former coworkers, and current or former players.    I definitely recommend this book, both for the look at Belichick and because Halberstam is a pleasure to read.  However, don't expect to learn much about the coach himself, as that will likely be left for another book.
