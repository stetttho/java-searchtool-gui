 Although this book has been around for a few years now, its information is still more practical, useful and relevant than any of the diet fad books that have come and gone in the interim.  This is not a book that promises to help anyone lose weight or tone their abs.  Instead, it's a no-nonsense guide to the food we eat, one that examines caloric intake, fats, etc., without laying on the platitudes found in many such guides.  I think it's interesting that Willett discusses the importance of avoiding trans fats, an essential point that the rest of the nutrition world seems finally to have caught up with.    To me, the discussion of the traditional "food pyramid" and its faults is one of the best things I've ever read in a nutrition guide.  We're brought up pretty blindly about these recommendations, and I'm sure it's an eye-opener for many people to see how we may have been misled in some areas.  If you're looking for sound and reasonable advice about your diet, this is easily the best book around.  You might not drop 10 pounds in 2 weeks, but it can have a definite positive impact on long-term health.
