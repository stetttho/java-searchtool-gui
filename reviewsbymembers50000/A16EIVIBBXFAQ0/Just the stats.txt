 If you're looking for Bill James' insightful and humorous player evaluations and comments, hold on to your money.  However, if you're looking for the most comprehensive and nicely packaged stats for the upcoming season, then this is a good purchase at a low price.  The heart of this book is the same as it's been for the past couple of years. Lots of player stats presented in an easy-to-read format, managerial tendencies, projections for 2006, career and injury projections, and a glossary of statistical terms for the uninitiated.  You won't find any discussion or essays, which I'm sure we'd all love to see more of from James.  And if you're not used to dealing with statistics, I'd probably recommend reading some of his other titles to accompany this, as they tend to give better explanations of what the stats mean, and how/why they were developed.  Another reviewer mentioned that most of these stats are available for free, and that's true.  But most of us, I think, would rather have a book we can just grab off the coffee table and flip open, instead of pulling out our laptops and heading to the BP or Baseball Reference sites.  As with past editions of this book, I'd recommend it to all baseball statheads or those who are looking for a handy reference for 2006.  Along with the Baseball Prospectus annual, which will likely be out in February, I'd consider this an essential purcahse.
