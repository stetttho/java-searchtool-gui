 I've always thought that managing, in general, is a skill much overrated by many baseball fans.  My personal bias aside, though, this is an interesting book both in terms of the game, and in terms of the look inside the mind of a man considered one of the great managers of our generation.  This book will not impress the casual fan, or anyone reading it simply because they've like Bissinger's past work.  There's a ton of detail about baseball that might cause many to tune out, but it's worth sticking with.  Larussa is obviously an intelligent man, and that comes across in his discussions on several topics.  He also possesses an obvious love for the game, which many fans will appreciate.  There's a reason why Larussa has won several managerial awards, beyond the fact that he's managed a number of talent-laden teams.  He understands the game, and he strikes a good balance between the science of baseball and managerial intuition.  He wants to win at almost any cost, but he also cares about his players and organization.  Love or hate him - and there are many in both camps - Larussa is a fascinating baseball character.  This should prove of interest to any fan of Larussa, the Cards, or baseball in general.
