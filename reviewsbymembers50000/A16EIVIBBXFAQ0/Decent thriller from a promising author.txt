 Young author Britton uses a, "What if the enemy is one of us?" scenario in a somewhat typical, but still enjoyable thriller.  And while my 4-star rating may be a little generous, it's still a pretty impressive debut.  The story is pretty simple.  Ryan Kealey, a 33-year-old retired former Special Forces op, is drawn back into the national security game when a suspected terrorist is revealed to be a former officer once under Kealey's command.  From there, it's typical cat-and-mouse stuff, with a couple of love interest storylines thrown in for good measure.  While not on the level of Tom Clancy's military thrillers, this is a nice debut from Britton.  Kealey is a believable hero, even if he seems a little Jack Bauer-ish at times with the threats of torture and unbridled use of violent means.  Anyone who likes a fast-moving story, and one that doesn't necessarily command you to be constantly figuring things out, should enjoy this one.  Hopefully, Britton's next novel will iron out some of the problems evident in this one, and he'll be able to tell a story in fewer pages.  Overall, a good debut effort.  Recommended for fans of the genre.
