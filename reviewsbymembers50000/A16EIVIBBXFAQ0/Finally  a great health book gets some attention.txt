 This book was originally released in 2002, but seems to have been lost among the fuss over Atkins, South Beach, etc.  Hopefully, releasing an updated version and promoting it in media outlets will convince more people to make use of what is surely the best book about healthy eating habits to be published over the past several years.  This is not a book that promises to help anyone lose weight or tone their abs. Instead, it's a no-nonsense guide to the food we eat, one that examines caloric intake, fats, etc., without laying on the platitudes found in many such guides. For years, Wllett has been emphasizing the importance of avoiding trans fats, an essential point that the rest of the nutrition world seems finally to have caught up with.   If you're looking for sound and reasonable advice about your diet, this is easily the best book around. You might not drop 10 pounds in 2 weeks, but it can have a definite positive impact on long-term health.
