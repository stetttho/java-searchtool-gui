 What prevents me from giving this 5 stars is the fact that the toys, I believe, hang too high for most babies to kick while on their back.  When our daughter was 3-4 months old, she loved laying on her back, kicking at the items hanging from the set, and watching the balls spin while listening to the music.  Unfortunately, she had to make many attempts before getting a hit.  Once a child is able to sit up comfortably, this toy becomes much more useful and effective.  Our girl now can hit the toys and watch the colors spin, while also pulling at the balls.  Even though she's able to move around and explore, this toy can still keep her attention for several minutes at a time.  I doubt she'd play with it for more than 10-15 minutes in a row, but I'm also not sure that I want a baby spending more than that much time staring at anything.  One other negative - This product doesn't store easily, as it's rather tall.  A minor quibble, but one that might be important if space is a consideration.
