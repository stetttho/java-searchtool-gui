 The premise of this books seems to be an incredible one - spending your childhood at a place that sums up decadence, the Playboy mansion.  While Saginor gives the reader plenty to talk about, I really think she pulls some punches when it comes to her relationship with her father.  The stories are just what most of us would picture, mostly dealing with drink, drugs and sex.  And while none of it probably should surprise us, given the setting, it's still jarring to read what kind of behavior the author is subjected to as a child.  Her early sexual activity with both men and women isn't surprising, either, but it's heartbreaking.  Like an earlier review mentioned, I think the author goes easy on her dad, a man who pretty much abandoned her to be raised by the motley collection of Playmates and hangers-on.  At the same time, given his own behaviors, maybe that was for the best.  An interesting book, but a sad one.  It might not surprise anyone, but it still makes for a good read.
