 The plot here - a pulse sent through cell phones that turns civilizaton on its head - has already been explained pretty thoroughly, so I'll skip that.  What I will say instead is that this is one of King's more crisp and spare efforts, and it's more reminiscent of his better works than of his throwaway efforts.  The relatively short length of the novel (as compared to some of his others) is nice, since there's little in the way of useless detail or empty character development.  The main group of "survivors" are an interesting bunch, for whom it's easy to feel sympathy.  As in other King novels, there's a child who's outrageously intelligent, and this can be rather annoying, but as a group they're a good bunch.  The story itself is completely unbelievable, but I like the fact that King didn't bother using much in the way of "junk science" to explain what happened.  He's a horror writer, and I appreciate that he doesn't try to play Asimov in his explanations.  The first couple of chapters are about as gruesome as anything King has written, but this eventually turns into a story that's much really about humanity.  And while it may not be the best book he's ever written, this is certainly a worthy addition to King's impressive catalog.
