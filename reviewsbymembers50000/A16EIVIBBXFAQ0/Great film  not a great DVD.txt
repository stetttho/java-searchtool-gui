 Anything I might say about the film will be redundant, considering the length and abundance of reviews already written here.  The only reason I didn't give it a "5 star" review is that the DVD is lacking in extras that anyone who loves this film would want. I can't say about enough about John Sayles or the cast, especially the horribly underappreciated Chris Cooper in the lead role.  I only wish that the DVD included commentary from both director and cast.  Still, it's worth owning, and worth watching many times.
