 More than just an underdog-achieves-greatness story, this book is a revealing look at the elements that went into that incredible victory in Lake Placid.  Little is glossed over, and both Herb Brooks and several players are examined in detail.  Brooks is not portrayed as a saint, but his genius in creating a team and a system to win gold shines through.  The Russians are not treated as a bunch of villains, but instead are shown to be just as human as the American boys.  The political climate of the time obviously made the victory that much sweeter, and Coffey does an excellent job of setting the victory against that backdrop.  As a hockey fan, it's difficult to think of a greater moment than watching the players and crowd go crazy as those final seconds ticked away - for many of us, it still gives us chills 25 years later.  This book does a wonderful job of honoring one of the great moments in American sports history.
