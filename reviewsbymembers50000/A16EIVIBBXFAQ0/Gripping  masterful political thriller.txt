 Although Mitch Rapp doesn't make an appearance, readers will recognize many of the characters from that series.  Instead, congressman Michael O'Rourke takes center stage in a story involving assassinations of several key politicos in an effort to end corruption in American politics.  What struck me about this novel is how Flynn has taken an interesting idea, created likable and complex characters, and paced the story perfectly.  For a first novel, this is an absolutely amazing feat.  It's difficult to imagine any fan of political thrillers not enjoying this effort.  Since Term Limits, Flynn has written, I believe, six more novels.  And while I've enjoyed all of his books, I really believe that this, his first, may still be his best.  Highly recommended for any fan of the genre.
