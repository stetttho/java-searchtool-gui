 It takes some nerve to write a biography of Ruth, given that there are already 20+ books in which he's the main focus.  However, Montville has done more than find a niche in a crowded field - he has written what should be remembered as one of the best, most comprehensive, and authoritative biographies of baseball's biggest legend.  From the beginning, Montville makes it clear that he's not going to fall into the trap of speculating about Babe's early days, a trap into which too many biographers tend to fall.  The opening chapter deals with his time before the famous years he spent at St. Mary's in a creative but no-nonsense manner that sets the tone for the rest of the book.  As he did in his biography of Ted Williams, Montville has done exhaustive research to find voices from Ruth's day, in an effort to create a full picture of that era.  He freely discusses past efforts at chronicling Ruth, praising especially Creamer's book, the one to which I would compare this effort.  He knows he's not breaking a lot of new ground, and he has obviously done his work about what has already been written.  The book is comprehensive without being boring or overlong, and even those already knowledgable about Ruth's outsized life will likely still learn something.  Montville's writing is crisp, and the pages move very quickly for a biography.  This is an oustanding biography worthy of its subject, one that will be enjoyed by even those who aren't normally fans of baseball.  Ruth was much bigger than the game, and I think this book will appeal to more than just diehard fans.  Montville is now batting a perfect 2-for-2 when it comes to chronicling the biggest names in the game.
