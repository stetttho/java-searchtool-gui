 While not what I'd consider an essential purchase, this is a pretty useful to have around if you want to look back at 2004.  They've culled items that are better covered in other publications, which does make this a more economical purchase than buying several other books.  The team information and coverage of the minors isn't nearly as good as the Baseball America almanac, but suffices nevertheless.  The records included are fleshed out more in the TSN Record Book, and both the Bill James annual and Baseball Prospectus provide greater coverage of 2004 individual stats.  Again, though, the coverage here is decent.  If you only purchase one guide for the season, I'd recommend the Major League Baseball Fact Book, which should be shipping soon.  It provides an excellent review of the previous season, along with giving more detailed historical coverage of each team.  TSN publishes that one, too, which I think is interesting given the great overlap among the two.  Still, the TSN guide is a pretty good book.
