 Given the fact that Lindsay's first Dexter effort stood out not only for being great, but also for being very unique, I expected a dropoff in this sophomore effort.  And while it may not quite measure up to the first, it's nonetheless an excellent and fun read.  This time around, Dexter is forced to do a lot of biding his time.  His nemesis, Sergeant Doakes, has taken his suspicion of Dexter to another level, going so far as to trail our poor serial killer around during his non-working hours.  But while that eliminates some of Dexter's activities, it also provides the book with some great humor.  Because of Doakes' suspicions, Dexter is forced to make himself look more "normal" by spending additional time with girlfriend Rita and her children.  The funniest parts of this novel come in seeing Dexter's efforts to seem like an average guy, and the feelings he has about playing this part.  Dexter is eventually freed from these chains because of one Dr. Danco, a gentleman who seems to share with Dexter some traits, notably the ability to kill well.  Dexter is drawn into the case by his sister Deborah, and his involvement becomes more intense when Deborah's new boyfriend arises as a possible victim for Danco.  Danco's exploits are quite horrendous, making Dexter's look downright normal by comparison, and there are actually some pretty squeamish moments when the Doctor's victims are found.  I don't think it's fair to say that this second book is any less funny, dark, or enjoyable than the first.  I guess it's just difficult to follow such an excellent first novel with an equally outstanding effort, if only because the originality is no longer there.  Regardless, I believe that anyone who enjoyed Lindsay's first will do the same this time around.  Definitely one of the best works of fiction I've read so far this year, this is one I'd recommend highly.
