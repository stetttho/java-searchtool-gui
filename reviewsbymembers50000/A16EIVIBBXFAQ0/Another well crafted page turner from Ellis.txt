 With John Grisham having seemingly taken a downhill turn, I believe that David Ellis is now the best contemporary author of legal fiction.  With his latest, a story told from ending to beginning, he solidifies this reputation.  Unlike Ellis's earlier work, the story here is really secondary to the writing method.  The book begins with the stopping of a terrorist action, and the suicide of a woman, Allison Pagone, allegedly involved in the plot.  From there, the story moves backward in time, as the reader tries to figure out exactly what has happened, and why.  Initially, I really thought little would be revealed from the past that would have much of an impact on the book's beginning.  I thought most of it would be filler, just a device to allow Ellis to pull off a tricky piece of writing.  However, what we learn as the story goes backwards in time changes much of our perception about we've already read, and many readers will probably find themselves flipping back to re-read certain sections.    I think many authors could write a book in this format, from the present through the past.  To Ellis's great credit, though, he does so while creating an excellent mystery, one that will have many scratching their heads until book's end.  I'd recommend any of Ellis's books, all of which have been great, and this one is no exception.
