 I don't believe that Hilary Clinton is a saint, but I don't think she's quite the devil that Klein portrays her as in this book.  For those who have read other anti-Hilary books, or who read the columns of many leading conservatives in the media, most of this will seem repetitive.  And I think there's still a good book - and a more balanced one - waiting to be written about Ms Clinton.  As with most of these books, your political viewpoint will undoubtedly affect your enjoyment of the book.  The left won't want to hear any of the valid criticisms, a fact that's already been proven by all the one-star reviews on here by people who probably haven't even read the dust jacket, much less the book itself.  If you lean towards the right, or if you're just a Hilary-hater in general, you'll likely enjoy reading about her supposed evil, scheming ways.  Klein's writing is good, even if some of what he writes seems unbelievable.  He tends to reach at times, but without that reaching this book wouldn't have generated such controversry.  This is just another average entry in a crowded field of books about political leaders, one not much better or worse than most of what is already out there.
