 I was skeptical of this product, given that the Diaper Genie is the much more well-known system.  However, the Neat system has turned out to be one of the best purchases we've made.  The system is simple - pull open the lid, stuff the diaper down, and close the lid.  The pail capacity is large, meaning the bag won't need constant removal.  When you need to remove the bag, the removal process is simple.  Same goes for the refills, which are very easy to install.  There's a slight odor when you have the lid open, but it's minimal.  A diaper disposal system is an absolute necessity, and this is a good choice.  An excellent product at a great price - I'd recommend this to anyone.
