 I got this book expecting to read a 200-page treatise on the reigh of Bud Selig, only to find that the current commish doesn't enter the book until halfway through.  The first half of the book is spent on the history of the commisioner's role in baseball, beginning with Landis and covering the 8 men who came before Bud.  Not that there's anything inherently wrong with recapping history pre-Selig, but I found it overly long, and much of it was a rehashing of information I already knew.  The book does pick up when Selig enters the picture.  Zimbalist is very complimentary towards Selig the person, even when he doesn't agree with Selig the commissioner.  He doesn't ridicule him for him mistakes, or ignore them.  He goes into very detailed coverage about several Selig issues, like revenue sharing, a luxury tax, CBA negotiation, and others.  Overall, I thought it was a pretty fair and well-balanced portrait.  Finally, one problem I had with this book is that it doesn't flow well.  It read at times like something I'd expect from Zimbalist as an economist, and not enough like something I'd expect from him as a writer.  It's not poorly written, it's just that it never grips the reader like the best baseball writing does.  Of course, this might be a somewhat unfair assessment given the topic.  Overall, I'd recommend this book for anyone interested in learning more about Selig.  Scattered at times but still interesting, and relatively short at less than 220 pages.
