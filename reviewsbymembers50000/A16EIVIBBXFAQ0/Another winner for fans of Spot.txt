 Following his proven formula, Hill has created another fun book that kids who love Spot are certain to enjoy.  In this one, Spot spends his time finding who's in certain places - at the door, in the laundry basket, in the playhouse, etc.  For each case, there is a flap that your child can lift to view the character in each location, and the accompanying text is appropriately short to keep the focus on the illustrations and flaps.  If your child has enjoyed previous Spot lift-the-flap books, then there's no reason to think it will be any different with this title.  I'd recommend this one, along with other Spot titles, to any parent whose child enjoys flap books.
