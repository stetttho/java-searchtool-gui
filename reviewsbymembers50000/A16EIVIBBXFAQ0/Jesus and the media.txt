 The Pates have taken an interesting look at how God, Jesus, and Christianity are portrayed in our current pop culture.  More than simply a Christian rallying cry to the portrayal of religion in books like The Da Vinci Code, this is a fairly objective examination, backed up with sound research.  Movies like Lord of the Rings are discussed, as is the Gospel of Thomas, the James Ossuary, and others.  The Pates never fall into the trap of simply disputing something because it doesn't fit their beliefs, always looking for evidence, a science/religion marriage that is used very effectively.  I'm not offended at all by items like The Da Vinci Code (which I couldn't put down), and I was a little annoyed at all the books written to refute what was nothing more than a simple piece of entertainment.  So this book was a welcome one, and it's the best of its kind that I've read.  I'd recommend it, especially to those confused or bothered by the media's portrayal of religion.
