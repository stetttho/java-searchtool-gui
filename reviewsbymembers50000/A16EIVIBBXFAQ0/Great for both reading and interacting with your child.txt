 With short and simple text to go with very cute illustrations of a child, this is an excellent book to read to your young child.  We have an 11-month old, and we've had this book for about 3 months.  What makes it so much fun is that the book can be used not only as a reading tool, but the words allow you to physically interact with your child.  When I talk about her "top side," she'll give me her head to rub, and laugh when I do so.  Same with her bottom side - and with the "inside," she'll even open her mouth so I can stick my finger inside.  I find that great books for really young children are difficult to find, so this has been a real treat.  I'd recommend it highly.
