 While a weak ending hurts somewhat the overall impression one might get from this book, it's still a thought-provoking (and brief!) read.  After awakening from a coma, Martin Harris discovers that he has been "replaced" by someone else with his name, and that nobody from his former life recognizes or acknowledges him.  Martin spends the novel doing 2 things - trying to prove to others who he really is, and questioning his own existence.  While he may not be breaking any new ground, Van Cauweleart definitely makes the reader think about the value and meaning of memories and self-awareness.  A great book, one that would likely be worthy of 5 stars if not for the poor finish.
