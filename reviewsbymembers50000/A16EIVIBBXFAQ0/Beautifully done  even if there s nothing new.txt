 Photographically, this is a gorgeous film.  The shots of the animals are intimate, there's little glossing over their hard and often difficult lives, and the message of enduring through hardships is one that we can all afford to be reminded of at times.  Watching what these creatures go through to bear children and help them survive really puts our own efforts into perspective.  If you've ever watched a National Geographic or Discovery Channel feature on penguins, or if you're ever read a book about their life cycle, then you're unlikely to learn anything from watching this film.  In effect, it's a well-done nature special that could just as easily have been made for any nature channel. However, that's okay, given that this film seems to be appealing to such a wide audience, hopefully making many aware of these amazing animals.  And because the film is so lushly done, it's certainly a treat for the eyes.    Not the best documentary film I've ever seen, but certainly one worth watching.
