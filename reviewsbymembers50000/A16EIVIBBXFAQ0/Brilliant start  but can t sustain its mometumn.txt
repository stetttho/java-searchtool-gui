 The premise is brilliant.  A man falls into an affair, gets found out and blackmailed, and can't do anything about it without ruining multiple families.  Unfortunately, while the first half of the book succeeds in keeping the pages turning, problems in the second half ultimately bring the book down to the level of an ordinary thriller.  As a previous reviewer stated, there are a number of improbabilities that hurt this book.  While I know you have to suspend your disbelief to enjoy almost any thriller, Siegel asks too much of this, as too many unlikely events occur, and pieces fall too conveniently into place.  It also doesn't help that we can see a twist coming shortly after getting into the novel - this could be forgiven, if only it was handled better.  As a cautionary tale against cheating on our wives, this one definitely succeeds.  However, it's disappointing that there was such a letdown as the book went on, especially given its brilliant start.  I'd still recommend reading it, especially given the dearth of truly good thrillers, but I don't think it measures up to his first novel.  Nonetheless, I'm still looking forward to the release of Detour next month.
