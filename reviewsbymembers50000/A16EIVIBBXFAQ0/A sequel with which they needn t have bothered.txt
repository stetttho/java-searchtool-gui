 The first of the Ocean's films was an excellent movie, one that combined a cool caper with a cast of stars who worked well together.  However, having such a cast doesn't mean that you can simply throw them into a film that is written and directly poorly, and expect to see good results.  For all the originality of the first, the storyline here seems incredibly forced.  It's like the writers were sitting around, looking for an excuse to make this film, and couldn't come up with anything beyond a vague echo of the first film.   The acting is fine, although the characters played by Clooney and Julia Roberts come off as annoying, more than anything else.  While Clooney's sauve manner worked in the first film, it doesn't seem to be on display much this time around.  The lesser characters, especially those played by Matt Damon and Casey Affleck, have some funny moments, but not nearly enough to save the film.  So while I wouldn't consider this a terrible film, it's definitely not a worthy successor to the first.  Given the cast and director, this one was a disappointment.
