 While it may not break a lot of new ground, this is a movie that, at the very least, makes the viewer think more than do the majority of horror films.  For that alone, it deserves credit.  An earlier reviewer mentioned, "The Usual Suspects," and I think that's a somewhat apt one to use.  This film has no lack of possibilities as to who could be the "Jigsaw Killer," and it really does keep you guessing until the end.  There are a number of violent scenes that I wouldn't recommend for anyone who may be squeamish, but the movie doesn't get by simply on its horror.  As for the ending, it's definitely interesting.  Personally, I didn't see it coming, and I was pleasantly surprised.  Overall, this is a good film, one that I'd recommend even to those who aren't always enamored of horror.
