 The arguments that Bradsher introduces will not be new or original to many readers.  However, I'll give him credit for at least making people aware of the history and development of the SUV.  I thought the most interesting aspect of the book was its examination of how the auto industry sees SUV buyers.  As one of them, I wouldn't agree with their characterizations completely, but I guess that should be expected.  As for the perception of SUV drivers acting like maniacs cutting others off and tailgating, I have two questions - did this not exist before SUVs?  And do drivers of smaller cars not do the same? I'm all for safety, which is why I'd never buy any horrible American-built SUV.  And while I'm not a paranoid ultra-rightist, I have to agree that the media's presentation of SUVs as killing machines is a little off.  Of course they're more dangerous than a car - look at the size of them.   Bradsher raises some good points, but a more fair and balanced treatment would have been appreciated.
