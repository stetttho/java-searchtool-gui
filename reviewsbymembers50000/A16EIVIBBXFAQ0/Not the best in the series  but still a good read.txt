 Sustaining momentum in a series is always difficult, and a little strain shows in this sixth Tres Navarre novel.  Thankfully, while Tres' act might wear somewhat thin, his girlfriend Maia Lee is around to pick up the slack.  The premise involves the shooting of cop Ana Deleon, and its relation to a cold case from almost 20 years before.  Ralph Arguello, Ana's husband and Tres' friend, is an obvious and likely suspect, so it's up to Tres to help keep him free and to prove his innocence.  Given that the case also ties into the White family, San Antonio's largest crime family, Tres must also keep Ralph from their grasp.  While Tres' behavior might seem somewhat old hat to those who have read the other books in the series, Maia emerges as a character equal to Tres.  Her actions, both physical and otherwise, help the book through some weak spots.  Hopefully, this will keep the series going strong for a while.  As I said in the title, this certainly isn't the best effort of the series - I'd put it somewhere in the middle.  But I still think Tres, Maia, and the others have room to grow, and I think the series can sustain itself for a few more novels.  Riordan is one of our most undervalued contemporary crime/p.i. writers, and it would be great to see this series grow in popularity.
