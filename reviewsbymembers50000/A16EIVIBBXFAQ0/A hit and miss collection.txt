 In this collection, Scheft has gathered some of his best material, along with adding some new jokes, to create a collection that has some ups to go along with too many downs.  Too many of the jokes just fall flat (you can almost hear the little drum kick after some of them), and some of them already feel dated.  There are some great lines, but they're unfortunately too few.    Scheft, a former writer for David Letterman, now writes what I consider to be one of the weaker elements of SI - a humor column that isn't often funny.  I don't doubt that Scheft is funny, especially given the fact that Larry David sings his praises.  However, that humor just doesn't come through in this book, and much of it can seem monotonous.  I think this may have worked better if the book was shorter, given that they could have been more selective about choosing material.  Or perhaps they should have waited longer, until Scheft had enough quality jokes to justify the length of the book.  This is a fun book to flip through for a few minutes, but certainly not an essential read.
