 In his debut, apparently the first of a series, Twelve Hawks has created some fairly compelling characters living their lives in a world where most of civilization is ignorant of what's really going on.  And while it's not worth the months-long hype that went on before its release, it's still a good read.  The different types of people - travelers, harlequins, members of the Brethren - are interesting, and the story itself is simple but enjoyable.  And I'm hoping that the momentum of this book can carry into a second effort.  However, for all of its good qualities, this book is somewhat of a mess.  First off, there are simply too many repetitive sections - for example, how many times do we need to be reminded of the Harlequins' bravery, or of the fact that the Brethren really like order in their lives?  And further, there are some glaring editing errors, including a scene in which the wrong brother's name is given.  I can forgive some small points, but using the wrong name?  I know this isn't really the fault of the author, but shouldn't the editors have done a better job considering how hard they've been pushing this title?  I'd still recommend this one, but I'm really hoping for a tighter effort in the second book of this series.
