 Using interviews with numerous church and public leaders, as well as church members, Shiflett attempts to find out why the country has been moving in recent years towards a much more conservative Christianity than we'd known in the past.  These interviews are very telling, and it's a great way to get a more "first-person" perspective.  When Shiflett injects his view, his opinions are obviously biased (although, to his credit, he doesn't try to pretend towards objectivity), so the interview format works well in balancing the book.  No church really comes off badly in this work, and the Baptists are the ones who are most surprising, coming off very well, especially given the portrayal the more left-leaning media often gives of them.  My biggest complaint about the book is that there's really no new ground broken.  Shiflett makes his points well, but this is stuff we've all heard before.  A more minor complaint would be the fact that, as the PW review mentions, there are some poor editing errors in the book - not just words, but getting names of people wrong.  Really, this is something that should have been caught.  While Shiflett makes his points clearly, it's unlikely that this books is likely to change many minds one way or the other.  Your existing religious beliefs are likely to be the greatest influencing factor in how you feel about this book.  As a middle-of-the-road type, I think he's done a pretty good job of getting a handle on a tough subject.
