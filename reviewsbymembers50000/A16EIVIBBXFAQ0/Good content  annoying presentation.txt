 While the questions and answers provided in this book are entertaining, the overall work is hurt by too many attempts at humor that simply get in the way of our enjoyment.  The array of questions is pretty thorough given the book's size, and there are some genuinely funny answers.  However, when the authors try too hard at humor, the book suffers.  Too many times it seems forced, especially during the sections that are supposed to cover dialogue between the authors.  All the talk about their proclivities towards acting like frat boys also grows stale quickly.  What saves this book is that the questions they ask are easily relatable, as I'm sure we've all wondered about many of them.  Finally, a note about the battle over "padded" postings that seems to be raging here.  If you look through the first several pages of reviews, you'll notice several from a "J.Andrews," mostly titled "Good Times."  It does make me wonder about the validity of some of these reviews.
