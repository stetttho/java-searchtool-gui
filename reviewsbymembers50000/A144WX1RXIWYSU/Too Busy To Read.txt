 This is a great book if you like to read but you never feel you have the time.  These stories can each be read in a matter of minutes.  This was a textbook for my creative non-fiction class and I think there are some great examples of the creative non-fiction format.  The only downside I would say is that most of the stories are of a serious nature, so while the stories are short, I wouldn't call it 'light' reading.
