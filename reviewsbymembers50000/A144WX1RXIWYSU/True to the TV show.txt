 I bought this game for my mother who lives in a long term care facility.  The senior citizens play this game at least once a week, if not more frequenty.  They love it.  There are a ton of question cards which is nice if you plan to play a game a lot.  The only thing I personally don't like about it is that unlike Trivial Pursuit (which lasts forever) this trivia game doesn't last long enough for my tastes.  Still, the question cards are even good for long car rides.  This is a good buy for fans of the show and trivia buffs.
