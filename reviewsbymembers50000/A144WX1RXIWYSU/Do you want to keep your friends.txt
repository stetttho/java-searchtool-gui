 I do not own this game, but I recently played it at a friend's house.  Before you think about playing this, you must ask yourself, "How sensitive are my friends?"  As in the TV show, you vote people off the game.  Unlike the TV show, you usually would be playing the game with those closest to you.  I know someone who voted against themselves every time because they didn't want to hurt anyone's feelings.  Aside from the voting issue, while the game was novel and exciting at first, it quickly got boring.  Some of the trivia questions are outrageously hard for the average person.  (Which I guess merits some educational value.)  There are a lot of pieces and cards and rules to this game, and it took three people reading the instructions to figure out what to do.  On a positive note, if you absolutely loved the show, and your friends aren't so sensitive, you might enjoy this game the first time you play it.  This game is a novelty.  I doubt many people will play  it more than one time.
