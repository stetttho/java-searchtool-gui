 I like Cameron Diaz.  She's pretty funny, and she has been in a lot of movies that I like.  Same with Selma Blair and Christina Applegate.  Do not be misled.  This is not a gender issue - it is an equal-opportunity flop.  I would agree with most of the other critics that say this is the worst movie ever. It's in my top ten worst ones at least.  So what was so bad?  The script, the predictable plot, the stereotypical characters - you name it.  Buy something else!  Anything else!
