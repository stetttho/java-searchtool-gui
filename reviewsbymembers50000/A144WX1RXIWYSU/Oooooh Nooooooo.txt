 The child who got this toy wanted nothing to do with Mozart after plugging in the Mary Cartridge.  I like Mary Poppins, but this is only one song (Supercalifragalistic) and not as much noticeable variety as the Mozart cartridge.  Your child may love it but I guarantee you won't enjoy it for long - it gets really annoying after about 10 minutes.  I was disappointed.
