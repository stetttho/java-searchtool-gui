 I bought this for my friend's 2 1/2 year old daughter.  I also bought the Mary Poppins cartridge.  She wanted nothing to do with Mozart after she heard Mary Poppins.  I had high expectations that this would be the best gift ever, but after about 10 minutes, she moved on to playing the drums on an upside down tinkertoy case.  What you need to know about this toy:  Do not expect to be able to turn down the volume with the switch - my friend's daughter discovered the switch within 10 minutes and it was on 'loud' from then on.  Also - I am a huge Mary Poppins fan, but I found the Mary Cartridge to be annoying.  Stick with Mozart or some of the other offerings if you buy this.
