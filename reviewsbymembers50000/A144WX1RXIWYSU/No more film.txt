 I just got my Olymbpus D460 from Amazon two days ago and I started playing with it last night.  I struggled a little with loading the batteries and all of the menu options, but once I got everything set up and working, everything was great.  If you haven't yet used a digital camera, you're going to love it.  It is great seeing the pictures right away and being able to delete the bad shots.  As far as this specific camera goes, you can't beat the price for the features.  I did a lot of comparison shopping - reading reviews, etc & I am convinced this is a great deal.  I especially like the option where it will take 4 pictures in a row very fast.  I got great action shots of my cats fighting that I would have never been able to take with a regular camera.  A word of advice that I heard from a techie friend:  Go out and buy the NiMH rechargeable batteries and recharge those before you get your camera.  Apparently the rechargeable batteries lose their power even when they are not being used (i.e.  in your camera bag), but the lithium batteries don't.  You should save the lithium batteries as backups in case you are stuck with dead rechargeables.
