 How to review china?  Chances are, if you are considering ordering this, you already own this pattern or you are buying it for someone else who does.  I buy some Portmerion dishes for my stepmother nearly every year and I was so excited to find them available on Amazon.  I was a little nervous about shipping china because I normally buy them in person, however, they were well packaged.  Amazon had a $25 off deal on Kitchen items - so the price was quite good as this china is rarely discounted.  The bowls themselves are a good size - not too big or too small - and medium shallow-ness.  All in all - a great purchase for me.
