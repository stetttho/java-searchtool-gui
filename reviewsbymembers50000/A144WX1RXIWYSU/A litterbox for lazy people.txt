 I admit it, I am not the best cat-mom there is.  I have been known to not clean my cats' litter box for a week.  My husband and I are lucky in that neither of our two cats are very picky and they tolerate my laziness.  The littermate was a gift to us from my parents.  Great, I thought - I won't ever have to change it.  Wrong.  There is now no room for laziness.  If I don't empty the tray it will simply overflow and make a huge mess.  So if I walk past the litterbox now, there is no way to ignore it.  Never mind what people tell you about two cats and the motor and whatnot, I have two cats, and this box works ok BUT I have to change it MORE often now than when I just had a big regular box.  I suppose my cats are worth it.  Changing the tray is a big pain... I've learned to keep my mouth closed and my eyes shut.  Yes, folks, there is nothing like litter in the eye or the mouth from the tray popping out.  The number one convenience to this box is that if you don't scoop every day, you know the cats aren't suffering for it.
