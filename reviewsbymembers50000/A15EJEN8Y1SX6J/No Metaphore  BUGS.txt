 This was a great sci-fi movie. I had a movie party at my apartment and has one pretentious fellow instantly start raving about what a great metaphor the movie was for the failures of democracy and the evils of communism.  Needless to say we pummeled him with popcorn because theirs nothing deep  about this film even though the novel it was based on was a political  satire. The movie has big mean bugs and big explosions and that's what you  rent it for. People who say it's a bad movie are just being dumb for  renting it because they're looking for a plot in a rockem' sockem' robot  movie.
