 I dumped almost 3 grand into my home theater system and the last piece was a sub woofer. if i had a cheeper system this would have been a good  addition. Unfortuanatly, running in concert with my very nice speakers, the  bass was out of sinc and stood out. the bass just sounded muffled and out  of place. I am currently not using it, becuase the bass sounds better  comming out ht ethe subs on the side and front channles.
