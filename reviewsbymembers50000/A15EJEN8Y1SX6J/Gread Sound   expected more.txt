 First of all let me say the soind quality from this reciever blew my mind.  I watched Jurasic Park with DTS and it made my cat hide in a cabinet! (she  used to never react to the TV)  however, the user on screen display user  interface is very unfreindly - the remote is terrible, i expected to  replace all my remotes once i got my reciever, but it cannot control my  Dig. Cable, and it is clunky with my proscan DVD - i.e it won't turn it off  and the play button is the FF - so i just have another (4th ) remote in my  pile now.  lastly - it cannot convert an analog video signal to digital s  video - so if you connect the reciever to your TV via an s video cabel -  all your devices must go into the revicer over s video - my digital cabel  only has a coax output - so i have to make everything else use it's coax  output - which is very dissapointing. It actually took me a while to figure  this out - and i returned my reciever and got a new one thinking it was  broken.  i'm willing to live with it - i'm going to see if i can get my a  new cable box that has an s video output.
