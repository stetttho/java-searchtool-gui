 This movie caught me off gaurd, it was much funnier than i thought it would be. I was rolling on the floor the first time i watched it. I did watch it a second time an dit lost a lot of punch, the humor relise on thing happening that are very unexpected, (most of which are dream sequences that become predictable i.e "oh i bet he's dreaming again") I'm kind of upset i now own it, you may be better off renting it.  All in all a great party movie, the cut parts are pretty lame, and cut for good reason, the unrated parts are mostly closeups of women's breasts....
