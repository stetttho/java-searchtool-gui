 This was a great move - it drags on a bit in some places, I wished it had more funny moment. The entire scene with what's here name - the chick from the cosby show - was pointless and was only put in to make th emovie longer and get her a part in it. (there is a coorolation between why John Cusack can't be happy and keeps changing girls but still) otherwise, a movie with such great moments of humor and wisdom - the DVD is worth getting just for some of the cut scenes where we learn that men get older and lose interest in foreplay and women get older it's all they want - so the perfect match is a 40yo woman and a 14 yo boy...
