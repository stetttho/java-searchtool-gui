 I have been waiting quite a while for mp3 players to reach a point where they could do what i wanted. They finally can. This product blew me away. A few plesant suprises, like it's built in batery charger, was unexpected. I have been looking for an MP3 player, a second hard drive for my pc, a way of quickly transfering data from my home to my work without waiting for cd's to burn. Done, it does it all. Every album i own was on my pc, not their all in my hand, and i have room left for twice as many! another unexpected suprise was it's size, the picture is misleading i thought it would be large, it's smaller than a tape player walkman.
