 Ok - i'm going to hold back on saying over and over again that this is the best movie to come out of the '90s and will have a cult following the likes clockerwork orange has only seen - and take this chance to comment on the  fact that this DVD is on 2 discs one full of features - this is the first  DVD i got to use my angle button (even though the second angle was behind  the scenes shots) i love the fact that i have all my little DVD's and the  thins big honkin fight club cd on top.
