 The novel, Breakfast of champions, was one of my favorite novels by kurt  v. and i was excitied to watch the movie for the first time. One thought,  however, that kept going though my mind while watching the movie was: I  wonder what people think of this movie if they didn't read the book? This  movie is almost the missing illustrations that should have gone with the  book. YOU MUST READ THE BOOK FIRST in order to understand anything about  this movie. The charecters were done perfectly - and the quick brilliant  one liners are too easily missed if your not ready for them. The book is  brilliant, and can change your outlook on life - one of the rare books that  can keep you entertained with stunning humor and brilliant philosophy. The  movie left me satified and in a great reflective mood, but worried about  all the hapless viewers who didn't do their homework. Any bad reviews you  may read are by people who didn't read the book.
