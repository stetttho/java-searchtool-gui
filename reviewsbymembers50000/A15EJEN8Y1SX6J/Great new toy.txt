 I'm reasonably happy with my new cb but I have to admit I wasn't prepared for the installation. I'm not a car guy and I was expecting a cigarette lighter power supply. I needed up having to use alligator clips to connect  the bare wire sticking out the back to the accessory panel in my 98 Honda's  fuse assembly. This is a fine radio but was more of an installation hassle  than I thought. If you have the gusto to mess with your cars electrical  system then go for it. Otherwise it can be plugged into your cigarette  lighter (not an option for me because of my radar detector) regardless it  means a trip to pep boys to finish it up. It also requires you to screw  holes in your dash, which most people won't do. I keep loose next to my  seat.
