 A warning for those of you about to buy this DVD box set. First, Jurrasic Park is a fantatic move, they use every inch of 5.1 encoding; i have a state of the art sound system it was bliss. Now, first you should know the "hour of cut footage" is 100% on the lost world CD not Jurrasic Park. the lost worl in my opinion was a very week movie. Almost like they were standing around with a bunch of Dino robots and extra film and they said "why not" So the lost worl cut footage was just as bad as the movie.  I wish they released it on DVD without Lost world, but still - worthy of my DVD collection. Cheers.
