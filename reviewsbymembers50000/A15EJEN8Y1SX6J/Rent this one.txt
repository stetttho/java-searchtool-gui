 I took a risk and bought this movie without ever seeing it thinking it would be a reliable laugh. Unfortunatly, while it was very funny, the humor was focused on suprising sight gags, and after you see it once it loses its  charm. Also, if they rated the unrated vserion it would be R, it is  extremmly tame, people i watched it with only noticed a few deleted scenes,  and the outtakes are short and pointless. ah well.
