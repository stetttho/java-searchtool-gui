 I'm giving this five stars on the criteria i bought it on - the digital remastering of the sound was very well done. The picture is crisp - no flaws noticible on the DVD, the migration of rthe sound to 5.1 was great (the scene where Bobby Joe is being dragged through the wood is so great on my new THX system) A cullt class - the tin container it comes in looms over my DVD Collection - the insert the put in is one of the funniest things in my apartment where they describe the family orientation of the movie.
