 I am sony's beiggest critic. I bought the PS2 and have been very dissapointed so far. I played Kessen, EverGrace, and TimeSplitters, was getting very worried that i wasted a lot of cash on a new DVD player. Devil May Cry Made me feel much better. The graphics really amazed me, The fight scenes were a lot of fun.  The charecter you play also kind of out guns the bad guys at least in the begiining, so you get a lot of chances to run into a room thats crowded full of monsters and just lay waste! The charecter has great personality, and a whole button on the controller is dedicated to taunting the enemy.  4 start instead of five for the audio. Some of the monsters talk and you can't follow becuase it's not clear. And again my major diapointment with ps2 is the the sound is in STEREO!? i bought the ps2 becuase i thought it would utilise my DTS system, it would be so much better if the sound used my rear speakers when something was behind me....
