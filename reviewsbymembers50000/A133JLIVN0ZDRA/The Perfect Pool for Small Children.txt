 We struggled with inflatable pools...they kept popping.  This pool is awesome.  My boys, ages 2 & 4 love this pool.  It is so durable.  We pack it away during the winter, & then drag it out, wash it off, & it's ready to go for the summer!  It's so awesome with lots of great features that other pools don't have like:  the sprinkler, the slide, cupholders, & a good drain plug.  It is very shallow, so your small children can get in & out on their own, with supervision of course.  We bought this pool at $59...it is a MUST BUY at $10.  I would call your local Toys R Us rather than buying it online, however, the shipping on this is very expensive because it is so bulky.  We strapped it to the top of our mini-van & brought it home...albeit very slowly.  Go Little Tikes!
