 Both of my young sons love this toy.  It was in my youngest son's crib, (it comes with the straps to do that) & now they just carry it around, & play with it.  It is very easy to manipulate, & has many great effects.  It also has a lullaby mode for small children.  It is very easy to turn on & off.  The only drawback is that it eats batteries a bit excessively, & if you don't have fresh batteries in it, sometimes if too many buttons get pushed it will make this awful shreeking sound.  It has actually scared my kids.  Just make sure you have fresh batteries around all the time, (get rechargeables!) & your children should have plenty of fun with this educational toy.
