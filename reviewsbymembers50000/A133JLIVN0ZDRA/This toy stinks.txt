 Yes, it looks cute, but you haven't experienced the screaming of two little boys who want so desperately to play with this toy, but it keeps falling over every time they play with it.  Yes, the legs fold up so easily, & it will just fall forward.  The legss are too hard for a young child to manipulate, & get it to stand up again, so it becomes a real headache for the parent.  I would highly recommend going with a different tool-bench type toy.  This one's no fun!
