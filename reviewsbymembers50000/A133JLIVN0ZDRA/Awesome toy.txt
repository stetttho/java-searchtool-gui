 I got this for my youngest son on his first birthday.  It is by far his favorite thing to play with.  He rides on it, pushes it, hides things in the seat compartment, & even sits on it to watch TV.  The sound effects are really neat, & he gets a big kick out of them.  Also, has flashing lights on the front.  My oldest son (3 yrs.) also loves this toy.  They have a great time with this one.
