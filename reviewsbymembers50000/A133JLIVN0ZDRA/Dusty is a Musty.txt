 I have 2 sons ages 4 & 2, & they both love this toy.  It was actually a gift for my 2 year old last Christmas, but the 4 year old hardly lets him play with it.  They can saw the board, & it makes saw sounds.  It says really cute things, & they both giggle.  This is a wonderful toy, & a perfect gift for the little builder you know aged 1-6.
