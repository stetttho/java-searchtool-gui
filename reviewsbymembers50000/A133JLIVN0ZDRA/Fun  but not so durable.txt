 My first son received this trike for his second birthday.  The first thing we noticed was that the handle on the rear of the trike that lets the parents push it was becoming more flexible, making the trike harder to control.  Otherwise, both of my children have enjoyed this trike, & we have experienced no other problems with it.  We have since removed the push bar, & my second son, who is now 2 enjoys scooting along on it.  My older son has moved up to a radio flyer...you know the kind we had when we were little...That's the best!  All in all, this one is a fine starter to let your child learn to pedal on.
