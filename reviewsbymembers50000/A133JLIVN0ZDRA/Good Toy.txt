 My 2 year old got this for his first Christmas when he was 1 month old.  The lights & music are very entertaining & lively for a young child, & as they get older, the toy grows with them with 3 different settings for different modes of play.  Now it has been passed down to my 5 month old.  He loves it too!  A must-have!
