 I bought this chair after the birth of my second child (when he was about 6 mos. old).  My mother had given me a hand-me-down when I had my oldest, & it was getting pretty scary.  This chair has been great.  He can recline to drink his bottle, & then when it's time, I sit him up, click his tray in place, & it's feeding time.  Sits in my dining room chair well (doesn't rock & roll).  The only drawback that I can find is that sometimes when he is ready to get up, he can push the tray off himself.  As long as you keep your child strapped in, you should be fine.  I would highly reccomend this product!
