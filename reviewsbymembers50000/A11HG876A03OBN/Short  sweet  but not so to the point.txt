 I believe that this book could be classified as one of those stories that you are glad you took the time to read after you finish it, but getting to that final stage of completion is more of a task than it may seem. Surprisingly, this is one of the few short stories (90 some pages) that I have ever read, that seemed to droan on for a good half of the time.  Never the less, there were some profound moments in the story in which I felt I had been given some truly great moments in literature.  My only qualm was that it needed to be about half (or cut it down by a fair 20 pgs) so the reader would not loose so much interest.  Do remember though, it is only 90 pages long, so it is not one of the more monotonous scripts out there.
