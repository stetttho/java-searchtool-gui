 Though gameboy advanced has become "all the rage" across the world, I see this as just an advertisement hype that nintendo has created. Frankly, I see this game system as a glorified gameboy colored.  The screen is not self-lit,(a feature I was GREATLY hoping would be included on this council) there are no dramatic new changes as far as the buttons go,(except for the R & L buttons, which is an improvement) and frankly I feel that nintendo was just looking for something to put out onto the market to appease fanatics.   Granted, I DO think that there are some pretty nifty improvements on this system.  For instance, for gameboy or gameboy color games, you can extend the screen (which IS about .5 times bigger than the old screens) to the full size of advanced.  The other feature is when Game Cube finally *DOES* arive on the market, you can hook up your gameboy advanced to it, and play some games that are available only on game cube. Basically, I think that you should wait anywyere from 6-12 months to buy this, when the price has dropped significantly from 150-ish to perhaps 100 or less.
