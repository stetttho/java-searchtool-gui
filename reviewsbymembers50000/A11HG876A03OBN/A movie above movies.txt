 Although the company that produced this was not the **BIG NAME** Disney that we have all come to know and love, I firmly believe that this movie blew all the little 'fairy tales' done by Disney away.   Being a Christian, I have longed to see a decent movie that had the Biblical background I have learned to charish. (no offence to the Christian movies, they do the best they can with their funding)  Though the story was a bit twisted from what the Bible taught, (ex: In real life, Moses was forced to leave Egypt for fear of Pharoah's wrath taking his life;; not begged by the King of Egypt to stay) you are able to get a prime example of how big God really is. This movie made me laugh with joy, as there is a serious lacking of wholesome and --Christian-- movies out there today. Godbless!~!
