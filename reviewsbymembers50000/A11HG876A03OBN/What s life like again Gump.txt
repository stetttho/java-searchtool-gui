 As one of Tom Hank's greatest achivements in the movie-making industry, Forest Gump is a movie that can be appreciated by people from nearly every age group--which is something few movies are able to accomplish-- It is hard to say with any specifics what happens in this movie as it would spoil a wonderfully written plot. The one thing that I do think a review is able to say without giving to much away is how the movie created a sence of far a person can really go in life--especially those who start out with an immediate disadvantage in comparison to the general populace.
