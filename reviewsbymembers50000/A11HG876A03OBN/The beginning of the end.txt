 A dramatically written series that has touched millions world wide, the Left Behind saga is a story that tries (and in my opinion, accomplishes) to set up the Biblical version of the End Times, which is largly found in relevations.  The characters in this book all come from very diverse backgrounds, but are brought together through the power of God, to try to live as a community of fugitives.  By reading this book, you almost feel as if you are experiencing the characters' pain, so great is the writing here.  This, hands down, is the best End Times series I have ever read, and perhaps the best Christian Series as well.  Your faith with God will be nothing but stregnthened by this book, and I implore you to give it a chance!!!
