 I can safely say that this is one of the top three of any Christian series that I have ever read.  After thinking about what I was to write here, I realized that saying anything about these books would probally ruin one or more of the many climaxes throughout all three of these books (yes!  I did say one **OR MORE** --does a little jig), which I would feel horribly guilty about.  The only thing that made me question where the author of this book was coming from was that the books really didn't flow like a series should--but I didn't find this so horrible that I should give it one less star.  One word of advice: Don't read ANY of these books unless you have time to read all of them, because you *will* become hooked!
