 Ok, as if the origional Grease was not enough, now we have a brand new generation of John Travoltia wannabees.  Now, if you shuffel aside the 'little' details, (such as no new plot, acting that shames even the cast of Delta Force **shivers**, and the lack of new designing on jackets) you find yourself with a corny plot that you are just SOMEHOW fixated to.   Beware, unless you have great self-disipline, you will be sucked into this movie--and completely regrett it afterwards!
