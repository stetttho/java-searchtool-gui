 This is probally going to be one of the last expansions packs for The Sims, simply because Maxis will soon (after the Sims Online, and Hot Date) be comeing out with The Sims 2.  Why are they doing this, you may be asking?  Every new expansion pack you add onto your computer is like another game, and eats up a ton and 1/2 of memory for those who don't have up-to-date computers.  This means that with Hot Date, the expansion packs will amount up to 4 regular games-- and many computers cannot handel that.  Speaking of which, just a reminder.  You must have The Sims, Living Large, and House Party for this expansion pack to work. Maxis had planned on giving the option of having sims visit other sims houses, but they found this would interfere with the game's progress on another household, which makes that dream an impossibility.  Instead, Maxis has a new option available:  Visiting Downtown.  Here you can rendezvous with a friend, or even hook up with a random computer sim.  You can buy dinners, clothes, (NEW PAJAMAS!) and do various 'special' events with your sim.  This has the promise of being the ULTIMATE ADD ON!
