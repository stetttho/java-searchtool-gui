 This is a heart-wrenching story about a young boy life, and the sad events that take place in it.  The 'sad events' are what the young boy's life consists of, and it is very hard not to cry at several different points while reading this novel.  Be warned, there is no 'saddest point' in the book, as hard as you may look for one.  When all the morbidity of this book is put aside, you are left with an incredibally well written book--and from a child's perspective no less!  Unless you are an ultra-weepy person, I highly recommend this book. **for those of you who may be interested to know, or were just uncertain, this is a true story.  Nothing in this book was madeup, and in fact, the only thing that has been changed is some of the character's names.
