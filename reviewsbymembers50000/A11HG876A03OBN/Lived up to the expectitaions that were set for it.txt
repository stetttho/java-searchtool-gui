 This is the sequal of the first book in The Diary Series, Diary of a teenage girl.  As you very well know, sequals to any origional book (or movie for that matter) have much to live up to.  The second in a series must either meet, or exceed, the job done on the book/movie that came before it.  I honestly find that this book has gone beyond the expectitations that were set for it. I feel that *teenage girl*'s main purpose was for the reader to get to know the characters.  Without giving away the entire plot, in this book some very intense things begin to unfold.  I HIGHLY recomend this book for any young adult reader (not limited to girls), and can almost promise you that you will gain a significant amount of insight into everyday problems that teenagers are forced to deal with.
