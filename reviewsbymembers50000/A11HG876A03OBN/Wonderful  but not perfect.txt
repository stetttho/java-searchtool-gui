 If you ask any person who has owned mulptial Bibles, you will find that many of those people will have the same thing in common.  They find that the footnotes are annoying, or did not fullfill their purpose.  One of the greatest tributes that this Bible has to offer is that there are random little 'in debth' looks into different passages.  I've found these useful in that they give you an example of how deep you can really go into the Bible. One innacuracy I have found in this Bible is the translation.  In several parts, I feel the urge to pick up my Hebrew Bible, and make the translation myself, just to double check.  There have been many cases where I was fairly certain that a passage in a specific secion said one thing, when it clearly said something different.  As one of the main purposes of the Bible is to extract a feeling of what is morally sound, you want as close a translation to the real thing as possible.  Like I said though, this only comes up in a select few parts, so don't feel that you need to rush out and get another Bible to check it's translation^_^  Another note that people may or may not realize is that one of the authors of the Left Behind series (my memory fails me as to what his name is at this current moment) helped write those little side notations, which is another plus. For a student (teen-college), I highly recomeend this Bible, and think that it is probally one of the best out there for that age group.  For those who may be older or younger, you should check out the differnt types of Bibles that the NIV version has to offer--ex: devotional, single's, womans, mens, childrens ect... Godbless 'ya! (I know he will:)
