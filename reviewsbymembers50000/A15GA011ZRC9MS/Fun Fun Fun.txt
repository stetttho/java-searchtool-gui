 Zoo Tycoon is simply in one word FUN! I am a huge fan of sim building types of games but Zoo Tycoon is different. It is a wonderful concept of a game. I mean who doesn't love a good Zoo? I have personally recreated the Audobon Zoo in New Orleans among other custom zoos. This game runs smoothly even on my dad's slow Compaq system and runs absolutely amazing on my machine. I know that it might not be a crazy First Person Shooter game with a ton of gore, but watch out when your tigers escape and munch on your visitors. Quite simply put, this game is fun and will entertain for hour after hour for people of all ages. Trust me, I got my dad and my girlfriends mother to attempt the game and they were both hooked on the game for a couple of months. I readdicted my father with the Dinosaur Digs expansion pack and we still play. I have created one particular zoo that I am extremely proud of that is very glamorous and have possibly sold the idea to a major city in our fine USA. I have to keep that top secret as far as where it is...sorry. Anyway go out and buy the game, give it a shot, you will not be disappointed.
