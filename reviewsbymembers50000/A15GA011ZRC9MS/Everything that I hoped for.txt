 Sims 2 is absolutely everything that I was hoping for and even a little more! I have been a huge sims fan ever since the first Sims was released and have kept up with all of the expansion packs and counsel titles and finally here it is, Sims 2 and I can honestly say that I am not the least bit disappointed what-so-ever!!! I spent all last night and today working on one of my families and have created the best house of my simming career so far. I am truly amazed at the possibilities in this title.  For all of you tht liked the original series, go out and pick up Sims 2. There is no way at all that you will be disappointed. Get the game!
