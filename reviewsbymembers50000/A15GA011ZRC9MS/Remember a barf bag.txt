 I have been a huge RCT fan for years simply because I love the strategy type games like RCT, Sim City, Zoo Tycoon, etc...So here's what I thought of this incredible game.  First off, one would think that building a theme park would have limitations. In the case of RollerCoaster Tycoon 3, you simply could not be more wrong.Think of this game as somewhere along the lines of Civilization, but cute like Mario, however You must be logical, like a game of Myst. Also the 3-D graphics are a treat, I know that this has been done before in Sim Theme Park, but RCT3 completely puts that to shame, you truely will be quite surprised of how enjoyable it really is to see your creation in action at a close up perspective and to see the look on your patrons faces as they ride your wildest of coasters. RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 has a lil' something for everyone in the family. For the freak in you, go ahead and "forget" to put brakes on a coaster and watch as it rolls into madness, scaring the bejesus out of the riders, or you can always let your imagination go and build the largest and best theme park of your wildest dreams. Of course if you are feeling wily you could always go ahead and be a mean mean person and pop some little childrens balloon just so you can laugh at them as the weep and beg their parents for another! The management of the theme park can be a job of its own if you like, as one can go as deep as they want into micromanagement and run the park like a real life employee or owner would at a Six Flags. This game is so much fun that I feel everyone who likes strategy-simulation games like myself will certainly get endless hours of enjoyment out of it.
