 I picked up HL2 yesterday and have put in around 6-7 hours so far. This game is absolutely amazing in every way except for the load times. The Graphics are STUNNING, Gameplay is EXCELLENT (for me at least) I only have a 1.5 P4 768RAM TI4600 graphics card and have not had even one lag in the entire game as of yet. I went with the recommended settings and even those are at the highest levels! Currently I am stuck in a hard situation however I refuse to cheat or use guides. I have waited for this game for so incredibly long, I want to savor everything, including getting stuck for a bit.  I personally can not say enough about this game, and definately feel that it will set a new standard for PC games to come. I only rated the overall a 4 because of loading time, however my processor isn't exactly top notch anymore;) P.S. The only time I have ever used the internet in this game was during installation, after varification of serial number and setup, I havn't had to use the internet at all to play.
