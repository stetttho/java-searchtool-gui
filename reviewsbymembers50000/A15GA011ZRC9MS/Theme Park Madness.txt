 I will try to make this short and sweet. Roller Coaster Tycoon is one of the funnest sim build 'em up games out there. In the tradition of Sim City, RTC follows the same concept except to build your very own theme park with everyone's favorite ride...the rollercoaster!!! Along with other types of carnival rides and many different scenarios to play, RTC is guaranteed to offer many hours of strong entertainment as well as a ton of fun!! If you do decide to purchase RTC, I strongly recommend to pick up the Loopy Landscapes/Corkscrew Follies combo expansion pack. This expansion adds about 20 new scenarios and many new exciting coasters which really do make an excellent and exciting theme park. I highly recommend that anyone in which this concept of building a theme park intrigues, to at least pick up the original game. I guarantee that it won't take long before you decide to get the expansion packs.
