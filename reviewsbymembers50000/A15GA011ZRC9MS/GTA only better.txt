 Simpson's Hit and Run is honestly the single most fun game that I have played in years. With the GTA type setup it has what plenty of peoply are obviously looking for since GTA sold like it was going out of style. Hit and Run is VERY FUN, it's funny, and it allow you to experience Springfield in a way that Simpsons fans like me have always wanted to. The game even includes some special famous Simpsons locations like Kamp Krusty!!! Also by the end of the game you will have had a chance to walk in all of your favorite characters shoes.  Simpsons Hit and Run is by far a must buy. I strongly give this game a 10 oout of 10 stars in my book.  PS don't worry the game is not like Road Rage at all!(haha)
