 I personslly have the extreme series and what can I say other than it's the best card I have ever had. That was an upgrade from the Sound Blaster Live which is also an excellent card. My dad got a little jealous when i got my audigy 2 card so he went out and picked up the Audigy zs card and then hooked up his smaller Boston Accoustic speakers that he had for rear surround sound in his den and all I can really say is WOW. I have never heard a computer sound so great in my entire life. He made me so jealous that I am going to hook up my rear Bose Speakers and get another two pair, one more set for the rear channel on my computer and another set to replace the rears on my home stereo! All of the Creative line for sound cards is great. If you don't want to spend much, get the Sound Blaster Live card, if you want to spend a medium amount get the Audigy 1 ZS series, and if you want the best, then get the Platinum Ex card. I can guarantee that none of them will disappoint.
