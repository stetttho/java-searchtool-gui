 I picked up Hot Persuit 2 about a month ago and finally just beat all the courses with gold medals today. This game is extremely fun and very very addicting. I am making this review short and sweet. The graphics are a strong 5 stars control is a great 5 stars (varying with different cars) and overall fun simply can not be rated on a 5 star scale! I have to admit that I have not found many games that can keep my interest and actually make me want to play all day and night long, however Hot Persuit 2 has accomplished that very task and has done it very well. I recommend that absolutely anyone who likes racing games to pick this one up. Even if you aren't that big of a fan of racing games (and I admit that I am not the biggest fan of racers mysels)to buy this game! There is an excellent selection of exotic vehicles as well as plenty of things to unlock, and even the cop missions are a blast! That's all I have to say other than this. BUY THIS GAME< YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT !
