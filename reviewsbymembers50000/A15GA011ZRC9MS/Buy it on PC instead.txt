 I am a huge Sims fan and could not wait for the title to be released console version even though I had some doubts. I should have listened to those doubts. Maybe the game would have been totally great for me if I hadn't already been totally spoiled by playing Sims with all the expansion packs for the past few years on PC which is absolutely way too cool for school.
