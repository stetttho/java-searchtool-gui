 First of all I love the Star Wras Fighter series games, especially the games for Game Cube and for PC. I also own a PS2, however for some strange reason, they just don't seem as fun on it. Anyway, back to the review. Clone Wars is an extraordinary fighter flight sim game. Along with some on foot battles and absolutely amazing flight fighting, this particular game completely blows my mind, with it's amazing graphics, it's perfection on controls and lack of any lag whatsoever, this game is by far my favorite game in the series. I also own Rogue Leader and still love that game, but so far Clone Wars just simply delivers about an ounce more overall fun in gameplay that Rogue Leader was lacking, and believe me, Rogue Leader dosn't lack a whole lot. I highly recommend Clone Wars to anyone who is a fan of the Star Wars games. For those of you who have been sceptical to try out the Star Wars series games, I think that this is the one to buy. It, like the other games also has a number of different diffaculty levels for those who are a little shy to try the Jedi and harder difaculty settings, but it is quite simply one of the funnest flight shooter games that I have ever played. Along with a wide variety of vehicles to use in gameplay, (including a walking vehicle which is very cool), this game is just totally fun. I guess I'm babbling so I wil quit now, however buy the game, it's sooo worth it. Trust me, hours of fun!!! I mean my girlfriend even likes it!!! That says a LOT!!!
