 I will keep this short and sweet. I absolutely need this game in my Medal of Honor arsenal. It has been way too long. I have resorted to starting up a new mission about a week ago on the older MOH when I say this I mean Allied assault + the two expansions, I swear that it is the only way to get enough MOH at one time because I can play for two hours at a time easily. That doesn't sound like much but I am also playing the Call of Duty-United Offensive expansion pack and have also been deep into Doom 3 (about 2 or 3 levels remaining), Painkiller, and Far Cry (also about 1 or 2 levels remaining),I am also greatly into the Age of Mythology series and the C&C Generals series, so I am truly doing whatever I can to get by until Pacific Assault gets released and like always with the MOH series I am sure that this will also be a great investment in both dollars and time taken from my life.
