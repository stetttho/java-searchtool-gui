 Return to Castle Wolfenstein is simply the best first person shooter that I have ever played. I remember thinking the same thing when I first played Half-Life, then again with Medal of Honor but Wolfenstein truely delivers every aspect of an excellent FPS. This game has excellent graphics, great control, an awesome story line, excellent AI, very cool cut-scenes, and awesome weapons!!! What more could you ask for? Another thing that I like in Wolfenstein a little more than Medal of Honor is that Wolfenstein has plenty of blood and the dead bodies don't disappear as soon as they die. I know that this isn't really a big deal but I think that it adds a bit to the game. On top of all of these bonuses for the single player game, the multiplayer version is also very cool! Running on the Quake III engine, the online game is absolutely great and will keep you coming back for more and more.  I highly recommend this game to anyone who appreciates first person shooters. This is a great game and should become a classic in the years to come. Personally, I can't wait for an expansion game or a sequal to come out. Buy the game!!! You won't regret it.
