 I have been a huge fan of sim type games for literally yeras. I mean I have loved these type of games since the very first sim city on Super Nintendo. I picked up the first Zoo Tycoon on it's release date and loved every aspect of the game. Knowing, pretty much what I was getting into before I even played it, this game absolutely did not disappoint.   I also picked up Dinosaur digs on release date and got everything that I expected out of it. Although a bit smaller than I had hoped. This did not surprise me however because I have bought many expansions and many of them have been smaller than necessary.  Marine Mania is as good as expansion packs can get. Not only does the expansion pack include Marine Mania, but it also includes Dinosaur Digs, which kind of made me upset me because I just purchased it a couple of months ago. Anyways, I don't care too much for reviews that ramble on, but Marine mania is well worth the purchase, because not only do you get the one expansion, you get a full two expansion packs. So for those of you whoo liked the first Zoo Tycoon and have not picked up Dinosaur Digs yet (or even have picked it up) I suggest that you buy this expansion, it is seriously much fun. Pick it up and enjoy!
