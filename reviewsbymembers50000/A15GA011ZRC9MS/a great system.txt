 Gamecube is totally a great system. Personally I guess that I can see that PS2 is a little better in the graphics area, but not a whole lot. I like that Gamecube loads incredibly fast and that they have some of the best games out there like Mario, Mario Kart, and Metroid and Starfox. If you have a PS2 or Xbox, already, I suggest that you pick up a gamecube, I mean the price is right and it's a fabulous system! I personally can say that I play mine just as much as I play my PS2.
