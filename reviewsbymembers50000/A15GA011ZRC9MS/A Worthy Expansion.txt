 Finally an expansion pack that is worthy of The Sims (the greatest game of all time). Vacation brings life back into The Sims in a huge way!!! I couldn't even estimate the amount of hours that my girlfriend and I have spent playing The Sims over the past couple of years. I have to admit that I was somewhat disappointed in Hot Date simply because I think that I was expecting more than it actually delivered. Vacation, however brings all of the expansions together and makes the game more fun than ever before!!! I absolutely love taking the family "out of town" for the weekend. The new objects also make for incredible building opportunities or simple add-ons.  Obviously I am a fan of The Sims and do have all of the expansions for the game. The special thing about Vacation is that it opens up such a wide variety of activities for your sims. I personally like the snowboarding and snowball fights, where my girlfriend can go metal detecting for days (in Sims time). The cloning options are also practically endless for all of the people who like to create their own objects. All in all I think that Vacation is the best expansion since Livin' Large. Of all of the pros to this particular expansion, I have personally found only one con, and that is the load time. I have noticed that since I installed Vacation, my game loads considerably slower than it had before. For this reason alone, I gave the game four satrs instead of five. I highly recommend this expansion to anyone who likes The Sims.
