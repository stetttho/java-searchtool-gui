 I have been playing Mafia for about two weeks now and I have to say that I am still completely in love with it. Like everyone else says, the graphics are absolutely amazing! The storyline and plot are very cool. I like how the game progresses throught the era, allowing surroundings and vehicles to age with the times. I also am a fan of GTA3 however I have it for PS2 so I guess I can not compare system speeds to that. As far as this particular game goes, I have had absolutely no problem with it for slowing down during gameplay. I have a P4 1.3GH, 768mb RAM, and 128mb ge-force4, so I suspect those are the reasons that it runs so smoothly. I absolutely can see how slower systems may not act as well, afterall there is a lot going in the game.   I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes the GTA type game...Plenty of murder, shooting, robbery, and pure straight up gangsters. Buy this game. You'll love it!
