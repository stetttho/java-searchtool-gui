 I just picked up Battlefront this afternoon and all I really have to say is WOW! This is the Star Wars game that I truly have been waiting for. Some people have been comparing this game to Dynasty Warriors saying that all it is, is a slash and hack game. I guess that actually intrigued me because the Dynasty Warriors series is one of my favorites of all time, and I also have a sneaky suspician that whoever would make such allogations might just not be very good at video games. I personally have yet to find many similarities at all between the two titles. But, Hey, each to their own, Right? Lucus (George Lucus) has done more than a good enough job with this particular title. True enough, I am a fan of The Clone Wars game as well as Knights of the Old Republic, where Battlefront is definately more like a Clone Wars style game than Knights of the Old Republic, this game delivers a fun factor that seemed to have practically disappear from the video game world these days. The graphic artwork is pleasing to the eyes, and of course the missions are excellent. I mean who doesn't like to destroy an AT-AT or other large Walking machinery. Yes folks you get all of this and on top of that you get a very wide selection of memorable vehicles to ride in. You can not play the game as Luke or Darth, but you can play as practically any of your other favorite types of character including Chewy!!!  If you have enjoyed any of the Star Wars games in the past or are just looking for something new to fancy your enjoyment, then Star Wars Battlefronts is the game for you!  I mean look at the ratings! of course there have to be a few people who feel the need to TRASH Star Wars at every given chance, but do you really believe that these "trashers" have even played the game or do you feel like me and think that they trash it simply because it's Lucus' work?  Buy or rent the game, YOU WILL ENJOY IT!! :)
