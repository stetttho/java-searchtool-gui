 Okay, So I picked this up and I love it. It's completely backward generational so you can play almost any GameBoy game on your Game Cube at home on you larder than 3x3 inch screen. What more could you ask for? Well, I can name one, if you want to link up and use the tingle features in Zelda: The Wind Waker, or unlock things in Metroid Prime or Splinter cell or any other Game Cube game you love you still need a GameBoy Advance or SP(Get the SP it's much better). How ever if you have the SP and The GameBoy Player it's like having two SP's because you can link them up for multi-player fun on games like, NBA, Four Swords, Pokemon or any other game that can be linked. You can also use the GBA and the GBP to link up and transfer data from game liks Zelda Oracle of the Ages, and Oracle of the Seasons, or any other link able games. If you're really wanting to buy a 2nd or third GameBoy Advance/SP for the sole purpose of linking, transfering, and multi-player fun then get this little ditty..
