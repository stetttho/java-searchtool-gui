 I have been an avid Nero fan for a few years now. Nero 6 Ultra is by far the absolute best Nero to date. There are tons of new add ons included, my personal favorite is the Nero media player. I currently use it as my default. I also like the HUGE list of compatable DVD Burners that are supported. I have yet to find a single complaint for Nero 6 Ultra edition. If you are in need of a new burning program. Nero 6 Ultra is the software to get! HANDS DOWN!!!!!
