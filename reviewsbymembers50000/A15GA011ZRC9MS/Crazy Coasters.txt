 What can I really say other than FUN FUN FUN!!!! Roller Coaster Tycoon Corkscrew Follies and Loopy Landscapes are just what the doctor ordered when it comes to RCT!!! I absolutely can not think of any downfalls to either of the expansion packs. I have spent many a nights playing these games and still I have not gotten tired of them. Corkscrew Follies offers a wide variety of new coaster types as well as new carnival rides. There are also many new shops to choose from such as my personal favorite the seafood stand that looks like an octopus! This review will be short and sweet but I simply want it to be direct to the point and that is if you own the original Roller Coaster Tycoon then Corkscrew Follies is a must have!!! Definately worthy of 5 stars!
