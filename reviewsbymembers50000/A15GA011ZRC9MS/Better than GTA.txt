 Better than Gta??? Well I guess that is a very hard toss up. The point is however, that The Simpsons Hit and Run is absolutely one of the funnest games that I have ever played...PERIOD. I admit that I am a huge fan of The Simpsons cartoon, and this game brings every aspect of the cartoon to the game, including all the characters that we all have grown to love, crazy outfits that you'll recognize, and even Flaming Moe's!  The Simpsons Hit and Run is absolute pure entertainment at it's finest! I highly recommend buying this game, you won't regret it!
