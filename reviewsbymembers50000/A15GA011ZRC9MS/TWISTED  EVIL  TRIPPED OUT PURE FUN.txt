 American McGee's Alice is one of the most unique games that I have ever played. Well worthy of 5 stars and even beyond that, you will find that Alice is quite simply one of the finest made, most unique, and overall one of the most fun of any games of it's type. The game plays great on my Dad's Compaq, 128MB Ram 16MB Voodooo3, 700MB Celeron machine, but SCREAMS on my Dell ,768MB RAM, 64MB GF3 1.3GH P4 Machine. Enough of that though. If you are looking for something a little different than the normal shoot em' up game, than this is one worth picking up. Alice comes packed with plenty of twisted characters, following in the tradition of the original Alice in Wonderland, this is a lovely view at how we all really hope that Wonderland should look like. I will close with this. BUY THIS GAME!!! You will not be disappointed in the slightest, unless you are totally borring with absolutely no sense of fun in your life at all!
