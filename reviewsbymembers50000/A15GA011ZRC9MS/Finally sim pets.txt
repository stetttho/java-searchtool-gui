 I will try to make this short and sweet. The Sims world has changed my life as far as video gaming goes. I have been an avid simmer since the first installment. I have made the sims communities such as thesimsresource.com a huge part of my internet time and overall life. After thousands of downloads for the game and learning to create my own skins(people) and objects for the game it is safe to say that I have literally spen a few hundred hours to say the absolute least on the Sims games. Finally an installment where the sims can have their very own pets! The pig is ok but it is about time for this to happen. With over 125 new objects and 5 new careers, The Sims Unleashed is a must buy for any Simmer out there. I highly recomment purchasing this game and guarantee that this is one of the finest installments yet.
