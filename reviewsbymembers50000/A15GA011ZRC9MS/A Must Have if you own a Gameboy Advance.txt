 What can I say other than this little contraption has brought my GBA games back to life as well as the pocketbook back to the store for more GBA games! I have to admit that I was pondering selling my GBA simply for the fact that I just didn't care for the tiny screen. I didn't like that idea because I have to admit that GBA has some wonderful games. I mean GBA is totally great for traveling or something, but I seldom travel. The Gamecube player has brought the GBA back to life! It's like having another console in the house. I highly recommend buying one! Maybe even over the GBA itself!
