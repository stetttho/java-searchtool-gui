 I have read other reviews on this game and all I have to say is that this is no ordinary first person shooter. This game has gone the distance with graphics, AI, and has an incredible story line to follow which in some way is uncommon in a FPS. I mean Wolfenstein and Medal of Honor are both excellent games, I just use these two particular games as examples because anyone who loves FPS gaming have most likely played thes games. I have completed the game two times now and am considering playing a third time after I finish the other current games that I am playing ( Die Hard, C&C Renegade, Red Faction, Operation Flashpoint, and Neverwinter Nights ). I recently invested in a new Ge-Force 4 128mbTI4600 video card and all I can say is that the graphics on SOF 2 are nothing short of amazing. Another plus to this game is the realistic violence. I know that many parents do not care for this type of thing and the game does include a violence lock with password for younger players. For us older gamers, I think that we appreciate a nice gory game where it so properly belongs. I try to not make my reviews too long so in closing, I will say that this game is one in a long time to really excite me and keep me playing for hours on end. It is not too easy even on the easy setting, so it should be a challeng to finish even for a constant FPS player. Get this game. You will not be dissapointed.
