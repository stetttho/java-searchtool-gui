 The Sims Bustin' Out is an excellent game although I was sceptic at first due to the fact that I am a very loyal to the Sims games on PC. This particular title is very fun and has quite a bit to offer.  If you like the Sims titles and chain of games, I recommend that you try it out, I highly doubt you'll be dissappointed. Happy Simming!!!
