 Cate Archer is back in a huge way!!!! NOLF2 is absolutely AMAZING!!! The graphics are absolutely incredible, even the actual game, not just the cut scenes. The storyline is once again very in depth as well as comical. I will make this short and sweet. With a new barage of weapons and gadgets to tinker around with. NOLF2 will most definately rank up to Game of the Year again. I am not exagerating. It really is that good. I have ALL of the new FPS(First Person Shooters) and this is by far my favorite. Don't get me wrong, I mean games like SOF2 are great, but most FPS are pretty close to the same story. NOLF2 not only keeps you interested with the unique arsenal of weaponry and gadgets, but the storyline is still "Austin Powers" like, with machine gunning. This is a must buy for any serious FPS gamer!!!!  I have a 1.3GH P4 with 768MB RAM, and GeForce4 128MB TI4600 which most likely has a lot to do with how well my particular game performs. However, the requirements are nowhere near that, which means that almost anyone with a decent system should easily get good results with NOLF2. BUY IT!!!!!! IT IS SOOOOO WORTH IT!!!!
