 I absolutelt loved Allied Assault so I also was extremely excited to hear about Spearhead. I agree with everyone else who says that the game is too short but can you honestly say that this expansion or basically extra missions which is about what the expansion pack amounts to were not extremely FUN! Personally I found some of the missions to be the best of the entire allied assault game period, for example the stage where you blow the bridge up. I mean sure the game is pretty short, but it's not pathetic or anything. I personally am extremely satisfied with Spearhead and feel that I got my money's worth. I also love to play online as well and have not noticed any lag issues that some of you speak of. I do run a cable modem, but is that not what you were referring to? I have no lag what so ever. The new multiplayer missions are the bomb! I highly recommend this game to anyone who loved MOHAA. I personally give the game 5 stars. However I can see where some people may have been disappointed with the length of the game. The bare minimum that this game would ever deserve is 3 1/2 stars, and that would have to be from someone who really doesn't care for MOH. Plain and simple, for me at least, Medal of Honor Allied Assault with Spearhead Expansion is my personal favorite game PERIOD. The only other expansion pack that could change my mind in the upcoming near future would have to be the Wolfenstein expansion, time will tell, I do hope that there is a little more to that however.
