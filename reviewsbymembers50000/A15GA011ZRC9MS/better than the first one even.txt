 For all of you gamers out there who loved Smuggler's Run as much as I did, you are in for a treat. Rockstar did it again with an all new adventure that will keep you on the edge of your seat as well as cursing the levels that require playing numerous tims to pass, only to fel like a god when you do accomplish that task. Smuggler's Run 2 Hostile Territory is just that. Hostile Territory sums this game up to a T. The police, border control, and armed services are even more hardcore than on the original Smuggler's Run so for those of you who had gotten frustrated by the first Smuggler's Run because of the security than maybe this game isn't for you. However...For the rest of you, I highly recommend getting SR2, You WON'T regret it. I PROMISE!!!!!
