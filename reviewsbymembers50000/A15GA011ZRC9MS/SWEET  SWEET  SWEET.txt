 Mario Kart DD is absolutely awesome! I have to admit that I was a little hesitant about liking two riders for each kart. After only about a minute or less I was absolutely hooked on Mario Kart AGAIN! DD is in my opinion the best kart since SMK on the SNES. I have been a huge Kart fan my entire life since they came out. Double Dash is so incredibly fun that any fan of the other Kart games should simply go out and buy this game! It really is that good! Don't bother renting it first, JUST BUY IT!!!! It's sooo worth it!
