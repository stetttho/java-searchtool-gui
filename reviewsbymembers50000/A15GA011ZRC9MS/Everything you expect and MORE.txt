 I bought the trilogy the day it came out simply because it belongs in my movie library. As everyone knows this is Star Wars so there isn't really a whole lot to say other than Star Wars has NEVER looked or sounded so extremely wonderful. I absolutely love listening to it on my surround sound stereo. I have already recieved one complaint from an old bitty down the way from my house. I also have to add before I forget, the fourth disc with the bonus footage is wonderful. I love to see documentaries when it comes to Star Wars. Superb Job again George Lucus!
