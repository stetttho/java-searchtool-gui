 The only word that really comes to mind after playing this game all night long is WOW!!! Finally, after a couple of years of mastering SSX Tricky, I get my hands on this absolutely perfect new addition to the SSX series. I have to admit that I thought that I would be able to step up to this game and be tearing it up just as hard as I do on Tricky, however I was put in my place very quickly. Although your skills at Tricky will help out at the start of playing this game, you will also find that there is still much to learn. I look forward to mastering this masterpiece.  I gave SSX 3 5 Stars for the absolutely breathtaking graphics, the awesome layout of the mountain, and overall gameplay and fun factors. SSX 3 will serve for many upon many hours of enjoyment for the SSX fan in all of us! I highly recommend purchasing this game if you are a fan of the series, or just need a new game that is sure NOT TO DISAPPOINT!
