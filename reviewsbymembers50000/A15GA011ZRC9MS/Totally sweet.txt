 I remember when this game first came out on the original NES, I rented it and had a sleepover with 3 friends. The funny thing was that there was a huge waiting line to rent the game and we waited like a month before we got to rent it. When we finally got it, the game had a red ribbon on it and was shaped wierd. It only took us turning on the NES to realize that we had gotten a Japanese version of the game! Who cared though! From that night on, I realized that a revolution in the Mario games was born. I was in 4th grade at the time.  I truly can not express how happy that I am that I can play this graphically redone masterpiece again on my own television(game boy player for my Cube). I love this game and recommend it to everyone!
