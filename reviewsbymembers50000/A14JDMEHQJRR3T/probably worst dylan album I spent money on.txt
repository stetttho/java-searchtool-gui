 There are some great lyrics on Silvio,  and Ninety Miles an Hour and Rank Strangers to Me are very cool... but there is no cohesion to the album.  Feels like Dylan was trying to make a few bucks by getting popular backup musicians.  I got rid of it promptly.  Much better bet is Infidels (my favorite) or Oh Mercy.
