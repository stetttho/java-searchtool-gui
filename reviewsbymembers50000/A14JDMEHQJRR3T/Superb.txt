 I've owned this set for several months now and love it.  The compositions are great and based on my sampling of other interpretations (Gould and Uchida especially), I find Eschenbach's perfomance the best.  The overall impression I get is that Eschenbach had deep respect and love for the pieces and tried to play them as Mozart would have liked.  The recording is very good (not excellent - as it was done several years ago) but the essays in the booklet are some of the worst I've come across in a classical CD.  (I got little useful information from them and felt they were poorly written)  I wouldn't let that deter you from buying this great set - the performances get my highest recommendation.
