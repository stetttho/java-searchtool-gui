 I have had three copies of the complete Sonatas by Mozart.  One by Christoph Eschenbach, one by Walter Klein and now the latest by Glenn Gould.   I have to admit I am a fan of Glenn Gould (can you say Goldberg Variations are incredible kids?... I new you could).  Well I've donated my Klein version to a charity, still love the Eschenbach version, but the Gould version...   sometimes he's a tad too fast for my taste, but he has the ability more than any other musician to put me in a hypnotic transe state where my *breathing* is affected.  If that isn't the mark of a great musician I don't know what is.  Gould has stated many times he didn't like a lot of Mozart's later works (I'm not a fan of Opera, so I can understand parts of his argument), but Gould was a bit of a nutcase... so I don't know how much credence I'll put in those words.  Whether he likes them or not, I find his playing effects me deeply.  Yeah, Gould is known for Bach, but don't let that sway you.  This is a very *personal* interpretation by Gould.   (If you want an interpretation close to Mozart's intention, I think the Eschenbach is the better collection)  If you are open to hearing how one musician can put his character in a piece... this is the one to go with... Great stuff!
