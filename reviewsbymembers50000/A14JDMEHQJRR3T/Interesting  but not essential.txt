 The guitar playing is often amazingly fast, but I can't help but feel this is a vehicle for Yngwie to improvise.  Some of the moments it clicks, but most I hunger for better compositions.  Yngwie deserves a lot of credit for the work, but I just think he needs to work on the compositions some more. I think this is one of Yngwie's best work, but as a "classical piece", it is just not essential listening.
