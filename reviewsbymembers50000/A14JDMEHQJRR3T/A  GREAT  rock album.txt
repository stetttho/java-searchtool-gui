 ok, i came to Zep late so I didn't have the comparison syndrome that so many others have.  As a purely solo debut is how I'd like to treat this, and it is one of my favorite albums.  Why only 4 stars then?  I find I don't listen to it that often.  My favorite track on here is "Like I've Never Been Gone".  Oh yeah, Robbie Blunt is an incredible guitarist with the misfortune of having to impress Zepplin fans.
