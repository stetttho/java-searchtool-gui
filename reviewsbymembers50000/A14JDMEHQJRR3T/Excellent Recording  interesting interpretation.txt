 I found the recording and the tone of the guitar superb.  Some of the interpretions I found exceptional, others I've heard better from Barrueco's "300 Years of Guitar" CD.  Having said that, I found the  musicianship top rate.  I wish the CD also contained the Suite Populaire  Bresillienne, but it is a good collection nontheless.  This is a very  difficult CD to find, but I think it is worth the search.
