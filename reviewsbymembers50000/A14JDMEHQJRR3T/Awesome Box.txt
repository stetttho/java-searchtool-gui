 First of all, the packaging is better than any boxed set I've ever owned or seen.  Rhino deserves a lot of credit for making a package that any consumer would appreciate (wake up other record companies, this is how you add value to prereleased "product").  The writeup, graphics, photographs and sound quality are superb!      Now for the songs:  I like the emphasis on Lowell for Discs 1,2 and 4 - which I think is a good move.  Some of the non Lowell penned songs are great as well (I was knocked out by "Day at the Dog Races" and "All that You Dream").  I must admit some of the others may never grow on me ("Gringo") - but this is also true of some of the later Lowell stuff "Jazz Stuff in 10").  Disc four is great, its interesting to hear how some of the songs developed, and there are some great tracks I've never heard before.      Disc three has the slickest studio sound (Richie Hayward's drums sound superb) and may take the longest to grow on me.  Although I think they should have taken more cuts from "Let it Roll" (a superb album proving that the band can still make great music), the tracks are quite nice (ie. "Borderline Blues").  I have no problem with the rotating lead singers (this was always a hallmark of the band), but I fear the other discs may make a case that the songwriting peak of the band may have passed.  However, I don't think these musicians have passed their peak in terms of performers.  My biggest criticism of disc three is that Paul Barrere sings most of the songs, and although he's good, I think Craig and Shaun brought something to the table that he doesn't.        I saw Little Feat support the "Let it Roll" album, which remains the best concert I've ever seen and I'm glad they're still making music.  If I could've changed anything in this box, I would've substituted some tracks with those from "Let It Roll" and "Waiting for Columbus".  Other than that, this is one heck of a collection.
