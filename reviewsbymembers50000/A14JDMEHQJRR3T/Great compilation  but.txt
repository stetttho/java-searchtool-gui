 First of all, the music is superb (if you like old Christian music).  Second of all, the sound quality is as good as it gets for this type of music (1920-era 78s mastered to CD) (Yazoo does a great job as always removing most unwanted noise)  My only complaint is the packaging:  while I appreciate the quotations from some of the songs, I was hoping for more information about the date of the recordings.  Lets face it, one thing we're paying for in a recording like this is the rarity of the music - and it would be nice to know some more about the artists.  I give the music and recording five stars but the packaging three stars.
