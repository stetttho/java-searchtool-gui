 Finally, a great metal tribute to a great metal band that's not full of about 30 unheard-of or washed-up rockers who all collaberate to make a bunch of wasted songs. This CD has heart, and is a fitting tribute to Black Sabbath. Of course, no covers of Sabbath's songs could come close to the originals, but that's not the fault of the bands on this CD. Black Sabbath was simply one of the greatest bands of all time. However, these bands churn out rocking efforts that definitely make this CD worth buying. The best tracks are Children Of The Grave by White Zombie, Paranoid by Megadeth, Supernaut by 1,000 Homo DJ's w/Al Jourgensen, Iron Man by Ozzy Osbourne w/Therapy?, The Wizard by Bullring Brummies, and Black Sabbath by Type O Negative. The surprise on this CD is Bullring Brummies cover of "The Wizard." This song has long been one of my favorite Sabbath songs, and Bullring Brummies does it justice. It's fun to listen to, and is a great track. White Zombie's "Children of the Grave" is another absolute standout, as White Zombie and Black Sabbath are very similar bands, and if anyone's capable of making a great Sabbath cover, it's White Zombie, and if Rob Zombie ever covers another Sabbath song, I'll be sure to check that out! Overall, a great CD that I strongly recommend to fans of metal or Black Sabbath.
