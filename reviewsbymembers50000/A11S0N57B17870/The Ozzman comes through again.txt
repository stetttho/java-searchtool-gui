 In my opinion, this is the best Ozzfest CD in recent years. With 16 tracks and over an hour of today's best hard music and heavy metal bands including Slipknot, Disturbed, Linkin Park and astounding newcomers such as The Union Underground and Drowning Pool, you can't go wrong. And let's not forget the almighty godfathers of metal, Black Sabbath, performing one of my favorite Sabbath tunes, "The Wizard." Most tracks on this CD are outstanding, especially "Bodies" by Drowning Pool, "Fear" by Disturbed, and my personal favorite song on this album, "South Texas Deathride" by The Union Underground. The Union keeps the version true to the studio cut while at the same time performing with raw energy that only a live performance can provide.  Even if you haven't heard of some of the bands on this CD, if you are a fan of hard music and heavy metal, you can't go wrong buying it. The only thing I can find wrong with this CD (besides the presence of Marilyn Manson) is the fact that the tracks go in order from the end of the show to the beginning of the show...it's strange having the CD opened by the headliners, Black Sabbath, and closed by an opening band, American Head Charge. But, if you can look past that minor point, you'll see quite possibly the best heavy live performance in recent years.
