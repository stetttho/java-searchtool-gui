 An old friend of mine gave me this CD a long time ago, along with some others including CD's by Pearl Jam, Jimi Hendrix, P.O.T.U.S.A., Bush, and Silverchair. The only ones I ever listened to were Bush's "Sixteen Stone" and Hendrix's "The Ultimate Experience." I considered "One Hot Minute" to be a throwaway disc...until now. I found the disc in a drawer near my computer, and remembering that it did have two good songs, "Aeroplane" and "My Friends," I placed it into my CD player and was amazed to find one of the best Chili Peppers albums I'd ever heard! Maybe not quite as good as "Blood Sugar Sex Magik," but still an absolutely kickin' CD, "One Hot Minute" alternates between slow, melodic songs, funky groovin' songs, and hard-edged songs. All songs on this CD are great, I've discovered it's one of those CD's you can listen to without having to skip a track. The very best songs include "Aeroplane," "My Friends," "Coffee Shop," "Deep Kick," "Falling Into Grace," and "Transcending." Flea's little song, "Pea," is also an intriguing bit of music, though filled with more expletives than I'd like. Overall, the album is just a great experience. Although you have to let it grow on you for a while, give this CD a chance if you haven't already. I waited about 3 years to give it a decent chance, and wish I would have discovered this masterpiece a long, long time ago. Recommended.
