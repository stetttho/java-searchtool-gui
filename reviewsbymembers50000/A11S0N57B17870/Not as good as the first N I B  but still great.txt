 No, this CD isn't quite as good as Nativity In Black I, but it comes pretty close. There are some truly great covers on this CD, including "Sweet Leaf" by Godsmack, "Behind The Wall Of Sleep" by Static-X, "Electric Funeral" by Pantera, "Never Say Die" by Megadeth, "Hand Of Doom" by Slayer, and "N.I.B." by Primus and Ozzy. The rest of the songs are decent, with hed(pe)'s version of "Sabbra Cadabra" on the lower end of the list. I just can't get into the funky hip hop groove of the song, but at least it's not a total disgrace. However, the one disgrace to this CD is Busta Rhyme's version of "Iron Man." Busta Rhymes DOES NOT belong on this CD, and if they had brought in another metal band to do a good cover of "Iron Man" instead of Busta Rhymes, it would have been so much better. The CD possibly could have been just as good as the first N.I.B., but Busta Rhymes pollutes this CD. However, I still recommend this CD to anyone who's a big fan of metal or of Black Sabbath, just do yourself a favor and skip over Busta Rhyme's track. Some of these songs fall short of Black Sabbath's originals, but for the most part, it's a great effort.
