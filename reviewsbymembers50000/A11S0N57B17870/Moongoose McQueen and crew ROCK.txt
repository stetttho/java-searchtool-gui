 With the return of Iron Maiden, Rob Halford, and now FOZZY'S U.S. debut, Heavy Metal has made a huge comeback. Fozzy truly is the greatest band you've never heard! Chris Jericho--er, Moongoose McQueen's band can rock like nothing else I've ever heard! For such an underrated band, Fozzy can turn out some of the hardest metal hits with the catchiest grooves that I've ever heard. It's hard to pick favorites from this CD, but I will tell you that of all the tracks, which contain some covers, the ones I personally think stand out the most are "Stand Up And Shout," "Eat The Rich," "Live Wire," and a cover of Ozzy Osbourne's "Over The Mountain." But every track excels.  Definitely pick this one up. If you're a fan of metal, heavy metal, or speed metal, this is sure not to disappoint. Moongoose has got a great voice, K.K. LaFlame excels on the drums, Duke LaRue and the Kid absolutely smoke on guitar, and Shawn Pawpp builds a wall of destruction with his bass. Heck, if you're a WWF fan, check out "Chris Jericho's favorite band" and you'll probably like what you hear! Definitely recommended.
