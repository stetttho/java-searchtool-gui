 Although "Snap Your Fingers, Snap Your Neck" from Prong's album "Cleansing" remains my favorite Prong song, "Rude Awakening" is consistently better. "Cleansing" had some awesome songs and was an awesome CD, but Prong outdid themselves with this one. It's too bad they broke up before they could record a follow-up to this one. The songs are phenomenal. The opener, "Controller," is one of the best songs on the CD, and the lyrics, "You just got burned by the Controller" are repeated in wicked fashion with guitar licks placed effectively between them. "Face Value" is a very industrial song, opening with a heavy drum beat that sounds more like a factory at work, before the painful guitar groove sets in. "Mansruin" is a feriociously fast song that can hold its own with any hardcore band. "Slicing" is just that, slicing straight to the core with heavy guitar and an fast, even beat that will knock you out. Other standouts include "Avenue of the Finest," "Unfortunately," and the closer, "Proud Division." Well, they're all great songs, so you can't go wrong with any of them. Prong's heaviest album, I would recommend this to fans of heavy metal or industrial metal, or to those who enjoy fast, hard, pure rock. Simply awesome.
