 I couldn't resist writing a review for this album, as I'd only seen one on this page, and one giving it only three stars (I give this 4 stars)! I realize that this album, along with Fly on the Wall, are considered AC/DC's "Lost Albums" or "Weakest Works" and things like that for some reason (and in all truth, Fly on the Wall probably is...but that's not to say it isn't great) but this is one of the first AC/DC albums I've ever bought, and I loved it straight from the start, and still do (I've got all of their albums!).  I don't know what hard rock fans couldn't like about this album. Tracks like "Heatseeker," "Meanstreak," (which is my favorite from this album) "This Means War," and "That's The Way I Wanna Rock N Roll" really light it up. Sure, it's no Back in Black, but I think it certainly measures up with "The Razors Edge," another multi-platinum album, and the one which only came a couple of years after this one. If you doubted this album before, give it a chance, man!
