 A MASTERPIECE! That's the quickest, most efficient way I can sum up Mick Foleys' book.  I have read it all the way through three times already, and have gotten to the point where I don't even keep a bookmark in it anymore,  I just open it up and start enjoying it.  Absolutely my favorite book to  read when there's nothing to do.  Foley's stories are downright hilarious,  and they are written with such a style that makes it enjoyable to the  utmost extent!  Hilarious anecdotes, metaphors, one-liners, and "Al  Snow" jokes are peppered about the book and make it so enjoyable to  read.  I'll never forget the story of Jake "The Snake" Robert's  "potent potpurri" in the hotel room, or the ribs that Foley and  Steve Austin pulled on Dallas Page that made him so mad he erupted in a  naked, cookie-tossing outrage! Foley really goes in-depth here, as well.  I feel like I know the man...I feel like I've known him for years, and I'm  only 18! His tales are brutal, heart-warming, sickening, laughable,  horrifying, and touching, and he interweaves them with the greatest of  ease.  This book made me appreciate Mick Foley for who his is, and not just  for the characters he portrays.   Mick, if you ever happen upon this  review, I would like to thank you from the bottom of my heart for writing  this book and bringing me endless joy.  This book is like a gift that keeps  on giving; I could read it a thousand times over and it would still be a  pleasure.  Just thinking about the time spent writing this book to provide  readers with sheer pleasure makes me appreciate Mick more than any author  in the world.  Thanks, Mick. - John
