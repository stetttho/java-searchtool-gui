 I'm 18, and I've always liked Three Dog Night. Well, to be honest, I've always liked three of their songs: "Joy To The World," "One is the Loneliest Number," and "Mama Told Me Not To Come." I  soon found out that these weren't the only great songs they sang. After  getting word that Three Dog Night was coming to our fairly small town, I  immediately made plans to go see them, and I'm glad I did. While I must  admit that the best times of the concert came when they sang the  aforementioned three songs, I was introduced to a whole lot of other songs,  and decided to stay after the show to buy a CD. I decided upon their  "Greatest Hits" CD so I could get the best of all the worlds.  Then out comes Three Dog Night to sign autographs! I had them sign the  booklet of my new CD, and exchanged words and handshakes with them before  departing for home with one of my friends. Ever since I played that CD in  my car on the way home, I've become hooked. They've got great, catchy songs  like "Family of Man," "Shambala," "Old Fashioned  Love Song," "Black and White,"...it goes on. There isn't one  song on this CD that I don't enjoy listening to, as I can just press  "play," kick back, and let the CD run itself out. It's great, and  I recommend it to anyone who may be thinking about buying it. If you're a  fan of mellow rock or good ol' rock & roll, you will love this CD,  guaranteed!
