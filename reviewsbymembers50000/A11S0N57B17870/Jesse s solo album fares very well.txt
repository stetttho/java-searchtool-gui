 Jackyl's frontman does a great job on his solo project.  The best cuts include "Mainline," "Losing My Mind, "Satisfied, "I Gotcha," and "Higher."  As good as the album is,  however, it just doesn't stand up against his work in Jackyl.  Jesse just  seems to have more fun when he's with Jeff, Tom, Jimmy & Chris. It's a  very good album, however, and I do recommend it to any Jackyl fan, and to  anyone who loves good ol' fashioned rock.
