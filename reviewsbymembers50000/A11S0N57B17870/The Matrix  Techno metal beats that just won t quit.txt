 What an utterly amazing CD!  Although I've still been robbed of the opportunity to see the movie, I was told that it had killer tunes. I check it out, and sure enough, it does. My personal favorites are  "Spybreak!," "Clubbed To Death," "Wake Up,"  and the underrated song, "Mindfields" by Prodigy. Definitely a  must-have for fans of heavy metal, techno, or both, as the CD is filled  with heavy metal techno songs that are unique and downright amazing. Worth  the money.
