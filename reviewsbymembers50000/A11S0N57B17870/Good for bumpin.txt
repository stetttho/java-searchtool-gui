 I must admit, I felt guilty about liking this CD when I first heard it. As an avid lover of rock and hater of rap, I wasn't sure if Kid Rock was going to cut it. But after listening to it a couple of times, I quickly realized  that this guy is awesome! Kid Rock has since become one of my favorite  performers. This CD has everything to keep both rockers and rappers happy,  not to mention that it sounds great in a sound system!  Heavy bass tunes  really light this album up. A definite recommendation. Kid Rock rules.
