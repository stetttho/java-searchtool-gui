 Ace is back and he told you so! This compilation CD featuring songs from Ace's after-KISS band, "Frehley's Comet," is a very underrated CD that many people have yet to listen to. Hard rock fans have grown to  appreciate it, but I recommend it to anyone who is a fan of any incarnation  of rock. Ace soars on "Trouble Walkin'," "Rock  Soldiers," (my personal favorite) and ALL of the live tracks,  especially "Shock Me" and "Cold Gin." Ace shows why he  is one of the 5 greatest guitarists of all time, up there with Angus Young,  Jimi Hendrix, Santana, and Kirk Hammet. Just buy this CD and he'll prove it  to you, too.
