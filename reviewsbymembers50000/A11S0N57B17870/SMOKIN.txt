 I'm a loyal Kiss fan who loves all lineups of Kiss, even when they were stuck with Vinnie Vincent and Mark St. John. But Ace Frehley will always be known as "Kiss's guitarist," and for good reason. This was really  the only solo Kiss album I cared to buy at first, mainly for the song  "New York Groove." I didn't expect the rest of the album to be  this great! "Rip It Out" makes you wanna get up and jam, and be  careful when you listen to "Speedin' Back To My Baby" in the car,  'cuz you might get a lead foot! Definitely far superior to Paul's solo  effort and even a little better than Gene's, (still haven't heard Peter's  yet!) this album is definitely worth the money to any Kiss fan or any fan  of good hard rock.  -- John
