 I had never listened to any of 3 Doors Down's music before one of my friends offered to let me borrow it, saying it was a great CD filled with hard, yet somehow mellow, rock. I took him up on his offer, and I'm glad I  did! 3 Doors Down is a truly great "hard rock band." They're not  heavy metal or rap/rock or grunge, but they do a teriffic job with hard  rock. Although much of today's hard, heavy, fast, downright dizzying music  is truly great, this CD is a pleasant departure from  it. Sometimes you  just want to mellow out, and while this CD is anything but mellow, it's  great to listen to something that can come off as spectacular without  relying on repetitive, bass-heavy rap/rock riffs. The music speaks for  itself on this one; I suggest it to any fan of hard rock or anyone who is  being pounded into submission by the rest of today's furious music and  wants to take a break from it while still enjoying good, solid rock.
