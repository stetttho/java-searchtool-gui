 I'm going to keep this short and sweet and say that in my opinion, Mario Puzo's "The Godfather" is the greatest fictional work of all time. I've always been a person who likes to read, but I almost never found myself getting into the "classics" of American literature that every schoolteacher makes you read in the 11th and 12th grades. This book, however, grasped me and pulled me in, entwined itself around me and did not let go until I was finished with it. A definite 5-star classic that surpasses even the greatness of the original Godfather movie in nearly every way.
