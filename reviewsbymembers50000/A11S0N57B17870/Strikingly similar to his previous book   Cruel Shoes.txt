 Steve Martin. My favorite comedian. I must admit that when I bought this book, I was looking for straight-up comedic laughs as only Steve Martin can deliver. What I got was not what I expected, but still was very intriguing.  This book is a short read, true, suited for maybe a book to read while  travelling (just not while you're driving) or just trying to pass  time. First off, it might not be what you expect. For those of you who  have read Steve's 1979 book "Cruel Shoes," this is the same type  of humor. Mainly quirky little things that might make you say,  "hmm?" Some of it is rather bizarre, as some people have  complained, but I don't think that merits a complaint at all. The book is a  pleasant read, especially for those with more complex minds who enjoy a  more "mature" laugh rather than low-class, low-brow bathroom  humor. If you are this kind of person, or if you are a fan of Steve  Martin's work, I recommend you buy it.
