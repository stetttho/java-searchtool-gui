 One of my favorite CD's, and definitely a strong candidate for the one CD I would take with me if I had to live on a desert island. I can't tell you the specifically good tracks or the specifically bad tracks (well, there  are no bad tracks) because, in my opinion, every single one is worth  listening to. I suppose if you twisted my arm and forced me to tell you  what my favorite tracks are, I would have to say "Hells Bells,"  "Back In Black," and "Rock & Roll Ain't Noise  Pollution." A definite must-have for any fan of hard rock! For anyone  just getting into rock music and wanting to know which albums to listen to,  DEFINITELY pick this one up. Pay any price they want, just buy it, it will  be worth it. In Angus We Trust!
