 Contrary to what a lot of people say about this album, I believe "Live At Last" is a prime slab of Sabbath's best work. I found it at a bargain basement type store, and it was by far the best CD they've ever have had there.  Although the album doesn't have such great pieces of work such as "Iron Man," "N.I.B.," "Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath" and "Electric Funeral," It makes up for it with rarely-heard-live Sabbath songs such as "Cornucopia," "Wicked World" and the jam of "Into the Void" and "Supernaut" which comes after it, as well as the short, medieval-sounding instrumental "Embryo" which opens "Children of the Grave." Truly great stuff. Overall, I think this album is one of the best Sabbath albums out there, and should be placed as one of the famous "first six Black Sabbath albums" as the 7th. If you can find it, it's definitely worth whatever price you have to pay! Recommended!
