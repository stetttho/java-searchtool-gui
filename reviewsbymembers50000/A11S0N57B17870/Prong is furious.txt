 I'll be honest with you...I discovered Prong through ECW; more specifically, Justin Credible's theme music, "Snap Your Fingers, Snap Your Neck." But that doesn't matter, because regardless of how I discovered them, Prong is a furious band with thick riffs that border on the hardcore. And that's just how I like my music. Every track excels here, but there are definitely some standouts. The obvious choice for best track on this CD is "Snap Your Fingers..." and it's still my personal favorite song on this CD. However, this whole CD is mind blowing. Standouts include: "Cut-Rate," which has a furious opening reminiscent of Pantera, which does not let up. Towards the end of the song, we are treated with a killer groove that hammers you into the ground. "Whose Fist Is This Anyway," which has got an absolutely killer riff to it. It's that kind of song that makes you want to get up and scream. "Sublime," which is not as hard as the other songs, but which has a catchy guitar groove and some awesome drums. I'd recommend this CD to any fan of hard rock and heavy metal with some industrial on the side. Prong is probably the greatest band that never hit it big.
