 Uncle Kracker can do it all. Not a Kid Rock wannabe, but rather a man who is similar to Kid Rock who contributes to the mellower side of the rap/rock genre without sounding like he's a desperate rip-off trying to follow the  latest trend. Great tracks include "Yeah Yeah Yeah," "What  Ch'you Lookin' At," "Heaven," "Who's Your Uncle,"  and my personal favorite, "Follow Me." The whole thing is just a  great listening experience. If you have any doubts about Uncle Kracker's  ability or his legitimacy, I hope I've put them to rest. Go buy this CD!  All fans of rap/rock should love it, especially if you're tired of the  furious pounding beats that can sometimes numb your senses. It's a great  departure from the heaviest of rap/rock, as it's mellower than the rest  without hurting the genre's credibility. I say it's worth the money.
