 As a longtime fan of Alice Cooper (well, as longtime as an 18-year-old can be) I've strived to listen to as many Alice Cooper CD's and tracks as I could, but I must admit I was a bit "Pessi-Mystic" about this album at first, putting off buying it week after week. It wasn't until I read the great reviews here that I decided to buy it, and I am far from sorry that I did. There's not much I can say about this CD that hasn't already been said, so I'll just have to say it again! Alice has a profound message in this album, commenting on the horrors the world is facing in this day in age. It really makes you think. Though Alice's trademark humorous air about his music is gone from this album, it's made up by the hard-edged lyrics and the concrete, hard-as-a-rock music. Yes, as well as the lyrics being some of Alice's best work in years, the MUSIC is some of the best I've heard in a long time. Alice employed former Kiss drummer, Eric Singer, to sit at the drums for this album, and it paid off. Singer is one of the best in the business, and along with Bob Marlette and executive producer Bob Ezrin, Cooper has turned out a CD that is some of the best work he's ever done. Although this CD will probably barely make a dent in the sales chart, and will unfortunately be looked over with all the new sludge spewing forth, true Alice fans and true metal fans will remain faithful to the cause. And if you're not sure whether you're an Alice fan or not, buy this CD, and you will be a convert. Then be sure to check out some of Alice's older stuff, as well. This CD is definitely recommended, as it is one of the greatest pieces of music I've heard in a long time.
