 Having just purchased Ozzfest 2001, I decided to take a little trip back 4 years to Ozzfest '97. This CD has some of the greatest metal bands around, many of whom were only low-budget upstart bands at the time of this recording. I remember buying this CD simply for Ozzy Osbourne being on it, singing the awesome "Perry Mason," and not even knowing who the other bands were. But having matured and discovered more hard music bands out there, I can say that I definitely appreciate this CD more than I did 4 years ago. With great acts such as Coal Chamber, Powerman 5000, Biohazard and Slayer, any fan of heavy music will enjoy this. It may only be 10 songs, but they're 10 of the greatest live metal tracks of the late 90's!
