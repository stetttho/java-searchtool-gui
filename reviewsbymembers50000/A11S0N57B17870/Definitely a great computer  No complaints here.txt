 Of the four computers I've owned so far, this computer is by far the greatest and most satisfying. I have not had a single problem with it other than some minor bugs that are to be expected. It's a very fast machine, capable of supporting the most modern and awesome software & games. It plays DVD's excellently, and the CD-RW drive is superfast. With more than enough RAM to handle all this, it's the perfect computer to buy right now. Heck, even the keyboard is extraordinarily comfortable to use! I'm not a big fan of Windows XP, however. The computer did come pre-installed with a lot of stuff I never intended on using, so I got rid of a good 4GB of files the first day I got it. However, other than that, it's a wonderful machine, and is very affordable for how top-notch it is.
