 This album is absolutely amazing.  It truly does put "Hooray for Boobies," which is a great CD, to shame.  Beware, trendy MTV-watchers, as this CD will probably not appeal to those who simply ride the wave of  trends going on.  "The Bad Touch" is a great song, but don't buy  this album expecting every Bloodhound Gang song to sound like it.  Just as  good (if not better) than "One Fierce Beer Coaster," this album  boasts such great cuts as "We Are The Knuckleheads," "Legend  In My Spare Time," "Mama Say," "One Way," and  "You're Pretty When I'm Drunk."  If you consider yourself a true  Bloodhound Gang fan, or are a newbie who is open to all forms of music and  not expecting a poppy MTV album, buy it.  Go!
