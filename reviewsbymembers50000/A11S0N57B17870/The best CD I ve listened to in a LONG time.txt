 That's right, this is the best CD I've heard in a VERY long time. Plus, I got it from the "used" section of a music store, so that makes it doubly awesome! But why anyone would want to sell this CD for a measly 4 or 5 dollars is beyond me. The grooves here are infectious to say the least, even if none of them are original. And that doesn't even matter. This is a great Iced Earth CD, all covers or not, because as Shaffer wrote in the liner notes, they've "Iced Earthed" these songs, taking them out on their own personal spin. The riff of "Cities on Flame" sounds ten times deadlier than the original, the incredibly distorted guitars add a punch to several of the classic songs, and Matt's vocals are just astounding. He can sound like Paul Stanley, Bruce Dickinson, Rob Halford, or just like himself. The bottom line is that any pure metalhead will rock out to this CD. If you've put off buying it because it's a CD full of covers, I suggest you re-think your position!
