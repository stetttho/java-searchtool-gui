 For those of you who have never heard any cuts from the live video "No Bull" by AC/DC, this is the single for you! It really showcases just how great AC/DC is live. Featuring two of the best songs off  of "Ballbreaker," both the title track and "Hard As a  Rock" performed live off of "No Bull", plus one of AC/DC's  newest and best songs "Stiff Upper Lip," this import single is  definitely worth the price for any AC/DC fan.  A must have, as it's  virtually impossible to find any CD-quality tracks from "No  Bull." Go for it!
