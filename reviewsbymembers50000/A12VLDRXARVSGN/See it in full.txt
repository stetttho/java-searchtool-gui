 Although the version released for America is an almost seamless abbreviation, the full miniseries provides many rich details true to the book.  Learn how eleven-year-old Thomas became able to climb mountains... why the music is so spooky when he begins exploring the French villa in the dark with a candle in his hand... what makes him so reluctant to bond with his father... and just when that Kafkaesque "spider," Gregor Laemmle, set out out to get him.  The vicissitudes he visits upon little Thomas give the boy emotional agonies that you will never suspect if all you've seen is the "region 1" product.   Come on, America, declare your independence from manipulative marketeers, insist on a region-free DVD player, and experience what the whole world is enjoying!
