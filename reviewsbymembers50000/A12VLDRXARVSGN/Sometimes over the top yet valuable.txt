 Fussell's ability to gainsay any grove of academe that is less than Ivy-League comes from his teaching at one, no doubt. As in "Class," I think that he shows too little sympathy for children of the lower or middle classes who sincerely wish to "improve themselves" but whose curious eyes are bigger than their wallets; and to the schools that are open to them. Self-improvement projects are one characteristic of the American middle class, at least traditionally, that it is only cruel to ridicule in principle, and there just isn't room enough in Harvard et al. to accommodate everyone.  Aside from this quibble, however, I'm all with the admiring commentators.  Particularly telling is the chapter on BAD engineering, in that this output is eventually identifiable.  While the BADness of a hat or a piece of music may be thought entirely a question of taste, some things need to WORK: a bridge that collapses into the water or an airplane that falls out of the air all by itself is an undoubted failure.  Then comes an interesting QED, perhaps more implied than explicit: the uncanny resemblance between the producers and promoters of BAD engineering and those of BAD things-that-people-say-are-relative.  Maybe they aren't so relative, after all.
