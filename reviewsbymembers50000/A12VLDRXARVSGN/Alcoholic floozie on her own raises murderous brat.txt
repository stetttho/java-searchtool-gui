 So what's new?   I'm reminded of a friend's description of an article he had read: zoologists observed a herd of elephants whose alpha male had died. The young male elephants failed to mature properly, becoming wantonly destructive, and the adult females could not control them. Only when a new alpha male joined the herd was order restored.  If this glitteringly surreal but naturalistic and nihilistic film shows any truth, it is that humans are no different in this respect.  It seems an unlikely moral to come from a reputedly feminist director, but there we are.  10-year-old Phillip appears to be a sympathetic character at first: very intelligent, thoughtful, adventurous, devoted to his mother, making the best of a bad situation.  But gradually he is revealed to be totally self-centered and amoral, with an oversized Oedipus complex, a morbid imagination, a keen nose for the worst of company, and of course no manners at all.  Some would say he needs a shrink.  It is more obvious that he needs a dad, although anyone stepping into that role does so in peril of his life, as Pedro discovers.  The last scenes are represented as an affluent but utterly sterile existence: mother and son sun themselves on air mattresses in rich husband/dad's backyward swimming pool, conversing as they slowly drift apart in the water.  But at least everyone's still alive.
