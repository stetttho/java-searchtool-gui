 The first book which I bought to try to learn Perl was a needlessly high hurdle to jump: Programming Perl, by Larry Wall (the inventor of the language).  While I wouldn't go so far as to regret the purchase, Wall  seems more interested in demonstrating whatever cute, obscure trick jumps  into his mind at the moment, than in giving the reader a systematic  grounding in the language. It isn't what one new to Perl needs-- especially  being, as it is, a language with so many inelegancies and side-effects.    Then I bought and studied this book by Till, whose patient pedagogy  allowed me to find my feet.  I think, in fact, that Till is too humble.  If  one really sat at the computer and concentrated on the book for several  hours a day, as he plans, one could learn what he teaches in no more than  seven days.  In my experience, it is also practical as a reference later,  within the scope of the basic topics covered.  Of course it is not  exhaustive; but holding that against it is about like criticizing Euclid  for not discussing calculus. Now I can go back to Wall's book with some  hope of appreciating what he says this time.
