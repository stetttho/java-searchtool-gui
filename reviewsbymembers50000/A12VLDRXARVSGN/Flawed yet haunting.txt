 TamA has already given us a tantalizing synopsis of this movie's intriguing scenario.  It takes place primarily in France rather than Germany, yet the Nazi occupiers are everywhere, and we are not allowed to forget for a moment their heartless menace to anyone daring to operate an underground resistance movement. Paranoia would not be too strong a term for the mood induced.  I like this film despite many seeming improbabilities in the plot.  Stories so intricate and subtle often require many viewings to connect all the dots.  Here I dearly want to explain why (as happens again and again) a character must do something the hard way rather than the easy and obvious way.  It's always painful to see excellent filmmaking lavished on a foundation of sand.  This movie has piqued my interest enough to want to read the novel on which it is based, if only to answer such questions. If the answers are good, I'll gladly raise my vote to 5 stars.  If not, I'm afraid I'm too generous with 4.  But now for the many attractions. The masterful Klaus Maria Brandauer brings his experience in "Burning Secret" to bear for another role as an urbane, complex, psychologically scarred villain opposite a sensitive, solemn, very intelligent hero only 11 or 12 years old (in this case, Thomas Sangster).  Both stars are mesmerizing, as are several other actors.  The cinematography is gorgeous throughout, exteriors and sumptuous interiors. The buildup of tension erupts in several breathtaking action scenes.  And the composer of the dreamy, melancholy score deserves an Oscar.  A CD should be released just so we can enjoy the music.  For fans like me of cinematic atmosphere, this film provides it in spades.  If only I could be confident that the whole is more the sum of its parts.
