 In this book, the author takes us through the meanings of the various dimensions. She explains the First Dimension as a line, the Second Dimension as a square, polygon, etc, the Third Dimension as objects and materialism, the Fourth Dimension as radiations flowing in all directions and interacting with one another. Also included in this dimension are the radiations of Wisdom and Love. Finally in the Fifth Dimension she explains to be the opposite of the Fourth Dimension, where instead of radiations flowing in every direction we have inter-penetration, where worlds can dwell one within the other. The Fifth Dimension is to be ruled by the use of mind-power. She explains that each dimension to be of higher level of vibration and how the Earth is slowly raising its level of vibration and transmuting itself to attain oneness with God. Back in 1940, she prophesies the future of Man's evolution - the future of government into a world government & the union of various religions, the future of health-care and the future of education. She also explains how science through the development of free electricity will free the world and through etheric photography will stimulate the mind into higher activity.  All these activities predicted here will be the dawning of `The Golden Age'.
