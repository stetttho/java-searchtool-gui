 I was completely blown away by the wisdom in this book, and how easily I was able to recognize and validate many of the learnings and teachings of Jesus. It was truly relieving to find out that Jesus was an ordinary man like us, who had to find his way to Godhood. It definitely tells me that his words `everything I can do, you can do too and more' ring true.  Having lived in India for a substantial period of time, an interesting point that stood out for me was that an American priest properly captured the very essence of Indian caste-culture. Assuming that the author did not live in India at all, it is entirely incredible for him to have captured it to such detail 100 years ago. On traveling to India, Jesus learns the art of healing, and studies the Vedic texts. He travels to Nepal and the Himalayas where he learns the Buddhist doctrine. In Tibet, the ancient manuscripts are revealed to him. In Persia, he explains the concept of good and evil, and how evil is man's own creation. In Egypt, Jesus is taken in as a student of Heliopolis and goes through the seven tests and receives the seven degrees. A real eye opener, as to what has been missing from the Bible all these years. It's a book that help us connect the dots as to direction of life on this Earth. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone seeking the Truth, along with Linda Goodman's Star Signs. Other books that can help one validate these Truths are books by Dr. Paul Brunton & Vera Stanley Alder. One will need to get these books, read, practice the teachings & re-read the books again, till one makes it their own.
