 In this book the author Dr. Paul Brunton, explains the 'trance' like state attained by various people in Egypt, while making references to India. He provides a glimpse of the mystic rites that used to take place in Ancient Egypt for people who had the desire and strength to become initiates in those times. Those of you who have read Rudolph Steiner's book 'The Gospel of St. John' in the chapter 'The Raising of Lazarus' will be able to link the explanation provided there with the explanation of Jesus's message that these rites are no longer required to become one with God. An excellent book........my quest continues.
