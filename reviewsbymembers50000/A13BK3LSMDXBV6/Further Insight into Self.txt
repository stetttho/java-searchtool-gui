 It would be appropriate to point out that one needs to read and apply the teachings of Paul Brunton's earlier book `The Secret Path' before one can fully appreciate this book. Paul Brunton attempts to bring the eastern methods of attaining oneness with God to the western world using techniques that are appropriate in this day and age. The eastern methods of renouncing materialism and other worldly temptations are no longer practical in this day and age. The author expands on the teachings provided in the book 'The Secret Path', which I feel would be greatly helpful to the beginner. He devotes individual chapters that give greater detail to the analysis of physical self, emotional self and intellectual self. He also provides additional techniques to help the meditative process that were missing (for a reason) in his earlier book. Though I have read various books, the bible, books by Rudolph Steiner, books about Edgar Cayce's readings, and come across the term `I AM', this was the first book that actually gave me an explanation that made sense to me.The chapter `The Overself in Action' is a chapter that I hold especially dear to my heart. It describes the gradual changes that one will experience, some of which I can attest to. It brings new meaning to many of Jesus's words in the bible.
