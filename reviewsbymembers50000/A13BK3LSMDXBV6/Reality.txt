 The book `Discover Yourself' is an elaboration of the previous truths that the author has presented to us. He starts of by explaining God and the beginning of religion. Further on, he gives new light to the prayer `Our Father' that Jesus taught. He also provides wonderful insights to the Sermon on the Mount, by Jesus. He calls them `The Seven Beatitudes' which I think is aptly named. He again touches on the subject of Yoga and meditation and how to attain it. This is explained extremely well in his two earlier books `The Secret Path' and `The Quest of the Overself'. The author also compares the differences between monks & hermits who flee the world into forests and monasteries versus those who try to find God while facing the material world. Not only is the latter method preferable and realistic, it also builds for stronger self-control and self-discipline. Three chapters are devoted to the `Bhagavad-Gita', the Hindus gospel. I find his explanations of the Gita to be very much in line with the teachings of Jesus. Interestingly, the author also warns about the attainment of spiritual powers like healing and performing miracles, which are manifestations of a lower plane. I was initially shocked, since that has been my aspiration. I realize differently now. The final chapters discuss `The Gospel according to St. John' which is very enlightening. In `The Mystery of Jesus' chapter, I find some conflict with the `The Aquarian Gospel of Jesus the Christ' by Levi. In conclusion, another great book by Brunton.
