 In this book the author is trying to answer the following four questions: What are we?, Why do we exist?, Is there a purpose in Life? & If so, what is it and what should we do about it? The author takes the reader through a step by step piecing of a large puzzle, explaining the concept of L-Fields, taken from the work of Dr. Burr & Dr. Ravitz. He explains how the L-fields mould, organize and control living matter into their various forms, while the L-fields are themselves non-material. He explains how the L-fields can help plug the hole that the `Theory of Evolution' brings about. He next discusses the concept of thought transmission/`T-fields' and the experiments conducted by the Soviets between sender and receiver. Many of these experiments can be found in more detail in the book `Psychic Discoveries' by Sheila Ostrander & Lynn Schroeder, another book I strongly recommend. While he explains how the `L-fields' can be proven scientifically, and repeated time and again, the experiments to prove `T-fields' in a repeated manner fail, since it depends on the attitude of the scientist conducting the experiment. In chapters 6 through 10, the author takes us through his interpretation of how L-fields, T-fields, the readings of Edgar Cayce, and the ancient beliefs of Karma and Reincarnation all tie in together to answer the four questions above. I agree with the author's interpretations.
