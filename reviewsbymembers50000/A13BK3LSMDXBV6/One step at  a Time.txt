 In this book Dr. Paul Brunton invites us to define ourselves in our quest for the Overself. He asks the question 'Who am I?'. He then outlines three stages of meditation: self-analysis, breathing & mental quiet. He continues to describe the peace and serenity that we will achieve once we have completed these 3 steps and have awakened to our Overself. An excellent book that I read almost everyday just before my meditation.
