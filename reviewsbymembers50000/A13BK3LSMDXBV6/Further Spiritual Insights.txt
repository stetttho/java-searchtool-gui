 This is an extremely confusing book for one who has not spent anytime studying and practicing spiritual doctrines. I myself found the various topics especially the `The Sun Rays' & `The Hierarchy' to be extremely hard to understand and grasp initially. I would suggest to readers to read her first book `Finding of the Third Eye' and Paul Brunton's books in the order listed `Search in Secret India', `The Secret Path', `Search in Secret Egypt' & `The Quest of the Overself'. Then put his teachings into practice before reading this book. The author splits the book up into two parts - `Review of Spiritual Science' & `Review of Material Science'. The explanation provides one who has studied spiritual matters a sigh of relief and an understanding as to why spiritualism and science are at an impasse with one another, with each failing to recognize the importance of the others work. She also explains surely but slowly how science is starting to validate the `Wisdom of the Ages'. `The Initiations of Man' chapter give us an understanding of the various Initiations into illumination. Reading this chapter all of us will be able to relate to a particular stage that we are at, and where we are heading. `The Initiations of the World' chapter provides us with a deeper understanding of evolution and God's `Plan for Creation'. She explains how the mineral kingdom is worked upon by the plant kingdom, which is in-turn worked on by the animal kingdom, in turn worked upon by man. Each inflicts `Pain' on the other by using them, thereby transmuting them into higher vibration. She also touches briefly the evolution of the various races and their purposes in `Plan for Creation' with focus on the Atlanteans, the Indians, the Chinese, the Japanese the Aryan-race and the Jews.
