 Many of you who have read her book are reading this review. She has put forth many Spiritual Truths condensed in a single book. Many who have found `love of work' can attest to the truth of her words that money follows automatically. Many who have found good health can attest to her strict diet that she proposes. With knowledge of Astrology, Numerology and Lexigrams presented to us, I would suggest to many readers to start to put into practice these teachings. Thus, you will be able to attest to her words once again. For those of you who haven't got her `Purple Plates', I urge you to try them out as well. Burns, cuts and headaches tend to disappear very quickly when used. Of her explanation of Karma, I used to always wonder why, if God is Love and He loved his children equally why would he harm some and glorify others. I realize now that Man has brought all his sins upon himself and has to pay for them through Karma and reincarnation. Lastly, the list of books provided by Linda is of valuable assistance to the strong of heart. I would suggest getting the book `Four Arguments for the Elimination of Television'. Then unplug your TV and you will have more time to yourself. Then get the book `The Game of Life and How to Play It' by Florence Shinn and put it into practice. Other books that have proved extremely enjoyable are `Secrets of the Soil' & `Secret Life of Plants' by Peter Tompkins and other Joseph Goodavage books.
