 This DVD comes highly recommended.  When this set from Pioneer was first released in 1987 on VHS and laserdisc, Pioneer combined excerpts from five of its greatest complete opera telecasts at the time: DON CARLO, UN BALLO IN MASCHERA, TANNHAUSER, LA BOHEME, LUCIA DI LAMMERMOOR with the BARTERED BRIDE Overture from the 1983 Met Gala.  All of these telecasts offered rich, classic and committed interpretations from such stars as Sutherland, Pavarotti, Freni, Domingo, Carreras, Marton, and Stratas.  I promise you that you will want to buy most of these operas complete on DVD when you see these extensive excerpts.  The added bonus is a set of six, short intermission features that were on the 1983 Gala, tracing the history of the Met in eras from "The Inaugural Season" thru "Bing and Beyond" --a fascinating look at the MET's history, using prints, photographs, sound recordings, newsreels and interviews. The DVD is titled "Volume One" but there has never been a Volume Two, which is a shame since Pioneer has such a rich library of telecasts from which to select.       Particularly for someone who is just learning about opera and wants a quality introduction, with the finest singers of there time, this DVD is a must-have.
