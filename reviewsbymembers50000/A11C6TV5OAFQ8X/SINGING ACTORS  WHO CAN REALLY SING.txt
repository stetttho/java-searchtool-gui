 The reason to purchase this DVD of Romeo et Juliette by Gounod is the wonderful, expressive singing of Roberto Alagna and Leontina Vaduva. Not only do they sound great, they LOOK great and act their parts sincerely and movingly.  The final scene of this opera with the two doomed and dying lovers desperately reaching out for one last unobtainable kiss could "make the stones weep" in this Covent Garden performance, taped in 1994.  The production is somewhat sparse but traditional, with beautiful costumes and atmosphere.  Supporting singers Francois Le Roux and Robert Lloyd do a fine job, but the focus of this performance is the two lovers and Alagna and Vaduva convince you with their voices and their demeanor that they are exactly that: young and in love. Two of the many vocal highlights are Alagna's aria, "Ah, leve-toi soleil" and the ensemble that ends Act Three.  Anytime the two lovers are onstage, there is operatic magic (all too rare these days). Alagna combines French style with Italian bravura and Vaduva has a voice with sweetness and vulnerablity which seems to grow in size for the dramatic and often cut Poison Aria.      This DVD comes highly recommended to lovers of great singing which too often, in present times, is cast aside for singers who "look and act the part".  What a treat to have both!!!!
