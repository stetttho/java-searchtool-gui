 When this production premiered in 1992 in Chicago, many comparisons were made between it and the Metropolitan Opera Zeffirelli production.  In my opinion Mr. Hockney's production comes up second to Zeffirelli's, however it has many merits and many of them are emphasized on this beautifully reproduced DVD.  Visually, because of the intense greens, blues and reds, the DVD is a knockout.  Your television will never have looked better.  Hockney goes for a less realistic, more story-book quality in his sets and costumes which is appropriate, since Turandot is a fairy-tale of sorts.  The colors and detail are far superior to the Laserdisc edition with less "video noise" in the backgrounds and more clarity of definition and detail.      Vocally, Eva Marton is not in as fresh voice as she was in the 1987 telecast from the Met or the 1992 Chicago premier.  However, her performance vocally and dramatically is so intense and powerful that occasional vocal lapses scarcely seem to matter.  Michael Sylvester does not have the vocal allure or richness of a Domingo or a Pavarotti, but he sings solidly and with a secure ending to "Nessun Dorma".  Kevin Langan is wonderful and moving as Timur with make-up that certainly hides his true age.  The vocal stand-out of this performance is Lucia Mazzaria.  She sounds in many spots like a young Freni, with total mastery of color and style.  Her two arias in Act III are worthy of many repeat viewings. The chorus is acceptable and for the most part accurate, but somewhat lacking in darkness and richness of color in the Italian "La Scala" style.  David Runnicles' conducting is appealing if not revealing.  This video is highly recommended but when the Met version is released you will want to own it as well for it's lavish and far more realistic sets and costumes from the always unbeatable Franco Zeffirelli.
