 This video, originally released in 1984 on Laserdisc and scheduled for DVD release on Aug. 21, 2001 is a must-have for any serious opera collector. Where, today, could you find a cast of this calibre: Freni, Domingo, Bumbry, Quilico, Ghiaurov and Furlanetto, conducted by James Levine? The sets are austere yet atmospheric and the costumes are beautiful and of the correct period -- a quality rarely seen in today's opera houses. The performance from March 1983 finds all the singers in fine voice. Freni, Domingo (even with a crack or two), Ghiaurov and Furlanetto are not to be faulted. Miss Bumbry's tendency to sharp slightly and in some instances distance herself from the music (you can see the technical gears working) and Mr. Quilico's blustery manner are small flaws that once gotten used to, seem to fade into the background of this generally outstanding document. Mr. Levine'a authoritative, stylish and energetic conducting coaxes an exciting performance out of the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra and David Stivender's chorus. This is a live performance so sometimes a microphone may pick up a violin or a soprano or tenor chorister's voice a little too accurately, but again -- that is a small price to pay for this calibre of performance. This DVD is heartily recommended and will hold it's place for a long time to come as THE video DON CARLO to have. Also, the DVD quality of this performance is to be looked forward to because of the flawed pressings on the Pioneer Laserdics when they were originally released. Bravo, Pioneer for making this DON CARLO availabale, finally, on DVD!
