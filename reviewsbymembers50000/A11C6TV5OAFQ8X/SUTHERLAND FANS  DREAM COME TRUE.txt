 Opera lovers who consider themselves fans of Joan Sutherland's art will want to run out and buy this DVD as soon as possible. These performances (roughly 14 in all) are taken from Bell Telephone Hour telecasts from 1961 (eight months BEFORE her Metropolitan Opera debut)through 1968 and capture Miss Sutherland in her absolute prime. All are in color except for two: HAMLET and OTELLO in 1961. The picture quality is somewhat grainy, especially in the earlier color excerpts, but VAI has vastly improved the sound quality over their recently released VHS tapes of this material, especially the NORMA excerpt which was painfully distorted. Picture quality is the only reason to give this DVD less than a 5-star rating. Musically, it should be given a 10-star rating!... This is Sutherland at her greatest, vocally, with many of her signature roles represented: Lucia, Puritani, Sonnambula, Traviata and Lakme with a bit of more rare repertoire thrown in, such as Ernani, Tosca and Crispino E La Comare. Trills, roulades, arpeggios, staccatos and high notes are all brilliantly and flawlessly executed and the Lucia Mad Scene is the closest performance in prime vocal quality to her Met debut that we will ever hear (or see). The 1968 appearances in duet, quartet and sextet allow us to see Sutherland performing with the likes of Tito Gobbi, Nicolai Gedda and Jerome Hines as an extra bonus. This DVD's 102 minutes fly by. You will want this release from VAI as a reminder of what great singing was like back in the 60's. VAI is to be applauded for continuing to release DVD's of televised performances of great artists in their prime. One can only hope many more such releases are planned.
