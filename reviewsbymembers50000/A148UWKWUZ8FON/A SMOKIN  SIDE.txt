 With two phenoms as front men and a swingin' rhythm section, this CD is a must have! Bill Liston is burnin' and one of the most creative tenor players around. Andy Martin has always been one of my favorite improvisers on ANY instrument! He is, in my opinion, the most talented jazz trombonist to come around since Frank Rosolino.
