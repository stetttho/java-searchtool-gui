 This CD is a miracle! It is easily one of the most fresh and vibrant big band CD's of the past 20 years. Masanori Sasaji wrote ingenious arrangements on all of the charts. Jerry Hey brought in L.A.'s top session musicians (and they nail EVERY chart! Incredible lead playing by Gary Grant, Charlie Loper, and especially Dan Higgins) who basically sightread these charts in front of a live studio audience. And just when can't stand it anymore... there are AMAZING solos by all (Andy Martin's trombone solo on "Lush Life" is ridiculous). But then again, with soloists like Dan Higgins, Brandon Fields, Pete Christlieb, Larry Williams, Andy Martin, Warren Luening, and Ron Stout... what do you expect? The best. EVERYONE NEEDS TO BUY THIS RECORDING!
