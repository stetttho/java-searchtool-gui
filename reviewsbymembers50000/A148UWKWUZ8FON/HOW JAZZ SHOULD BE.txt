 Tight! Jazz is an ever-evolving art form and this group is not sheepish about showing us that. Don has taken a group of "contemporary standards" -- pop tunes with jazz sensibilities -- and given them that extra something. This album is great for me because these tunes happen to be some of my favorites of all time, and I was waiting for someone brave enough to come along and "mess" with them. And that they do! My favorite tune on the album is "Overjoyed" -- an already burnin' Stevie Wonder tune made even better, in my opinion, by arranger/drummer Ralph Peterson (this tune is so bad, I transcribed it after the first time I heard it!). RP is also one of my favorite drummers ever. He almost steals the show with his volcanic style -- always intense and busy, but never out of pocket... just like his mentor, Art Blakey. Mad props also to Don, Vincent Herring, and Terrell Stafford -- all of whom sound !@#$%^& amazing! A gadzillion stars for this one!
