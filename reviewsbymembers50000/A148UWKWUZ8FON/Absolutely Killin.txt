 Once again, L.A.'s elite have proven that they can play jazz with the very best. For nearly 30 years, Larry has worked in modest anonymity, but now steps to the front and hits a home run! "Struggle" also features Dave Carpenter, Vinnie Colauita, Jerry Hey, Gary Grant, Chuck Findley, Bill Reichenbach, and the wonderful Pauline Wilson -- all of whom have a chance to shine... and ALL burn it to the ground! One of many, many highlights of this CD is Larry's take on "Inner Urge" (one of a few standards on this side). It completely devastated me, because, although I've followed his career for 20 years now, I never knew that he could play jazz like THAT. He sounds exactly like his idol, the great Joe Henderson. Can I please have more stars for this one?... I think that 10 would be more appropriate!
