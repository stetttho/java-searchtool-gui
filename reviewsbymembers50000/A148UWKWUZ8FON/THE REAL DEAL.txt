 Terry Harrington is SERIOUS. Don't let the fact that he is a top-notch L.A. studio musician lull you into thinking that he can't improvise. I can't describe how burnin' Terry is. Not only he is quite possibly one of the most prolific woodwind doublers ever, but he is a world-class improvisor. Do yourself a favor, check this CD out. Terry, wherever you are out there, you and your colleagues (Dan Higgins, Gary Foster, Bob Sheppard, Dick Mitchell, Joel Peskin, etc.) surprise me everytime I hear you play. This review is for all of you. Can I have more stars for this one?
