 You know, I'm so sick and tired of conservatives crying about their man Bush. Did liberals cry when Clinton was raked over the coals? No. The truth is that Michael Moore is a brilliant filmmaker. Sure, he has a bias. If he didn't, you'd call him a spineless bimbo. I'm glad that liberals like he and Bill Maher are around. It seems to me that when intelligent, opinionated liberals are about, conservatives can't take it.  Now, with that being said, what is so difficult to believe about facts in this movie? I have read most of the reviews here and have yet to see anyone say exactly what Michael Moore is lying about in his movie. Even Condi Rice, when asked, couldn't provide proof of what Moore lied about in his film.  Let me pose this question: Is it really that difficult to believe that the President would NOT declare war on a man who he was in bed with financially? (although this man flew two planes into our buildings -- perhaps over said financial dealings, who knows?). Let's get it straight, people. When somenone punches you in the face, do you punch him back or the guy next to him? I haven't seen anything about us getting close to catching Bin-Laden, but we sure as hell have Saddam. When you think about it all together, it's really simple.     I think the conservatives who have reviewed this film are so caught up in the way Moore tells his story (very tongue-in-cheek) that they are consumed by rage and immediately ready to dismiss the film as lies.
