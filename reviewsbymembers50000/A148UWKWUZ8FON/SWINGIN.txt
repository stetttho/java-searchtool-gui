 This date is simply one of the most swingin' of all time! It is a classic  and should receive all of the accolades that go with that honor. Both Frank  and Q are at their very best. Yep, I even like this one better than Sinatra  and Basie at the Sands (I know... how blasphemous of me, right?). There is  something about the way Frank's voice sounds on this date... a real deep,  heavy, brooding, and pensive quality that I love. In my opinion, his voice  didn't sound quite that expressive before that date, and definitely not  after (kind of like Nancy Wilson after the Cannonball date -- it just  wasn't the same). I love Quincy Jones. I think that anyone who can change  "Wives and Lovers" from a Bacharach waltz to a hypnotically  swinging shuffle deserves all of the credit in the world.
