 This DVD met and exceeded my expectations in every way! Not only does it feature L.A.'s top studio musicians (some of my favorite players like Jerry Hey, Gary Grant, Dan Higgins, Bill Reichenbach, and too many others to name here), but it was recorded in a revolutionary format that makes the listener feel as though they're sitting in the middle of the band. Some of the charts on this recording are very difficult and the band slices right through them! They play these charts with expert precision -- tight, clean, and with perfect intonation. The solos are also burnin'! I've listened this recording many, many times and I can't find anything wrong with it -- and every time I listen to it I hear new things in the music. To me, that is the mark of an excellent record... a classic. This recording is, in a word, PERFECT -- and the most compelling big band record I've heard in the past 20 years. Don't sit on your money, buy it -- you will not be disappointed, I promise. Bravo, Gordon, Bravo!
