 You know, Branford may very well be the most consistently brilliant musician of our time. He always sounds as though he is in the 'shed. What others are ready to dismiss as "quirkiness", I embrace as pushing the envelope -- exploring all of the available musical options. As a listener, I LIKE to be teased by musical curveballs and angles. I LIKE players who resolve their musical statements in unconventional, yet strangely intriguing ways. I LIKE players who grow from record to record. To me, that's the essence of jazz.   The funny thing about it is that Branford has managed to do it it all very quietly. I guess we have come to expect this kind of consistent genius from him. I have thoroughly enjoyed every record from "Royal Garden Blues" to the present... and I will love watching "Eternal" take its place in the pantheon of best ballads records ever.  A billion stars for this one. Thanks for the music, bro'.
