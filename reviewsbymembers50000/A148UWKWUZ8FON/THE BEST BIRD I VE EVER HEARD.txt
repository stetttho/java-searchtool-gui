 This recording destroyed me. Imagine this... Bird just shows up with his horn at a concert one night in Washington -- and the rest is pure magic! This side, in my opinion, is the best Bird I've ever heard. Bird was clean, sober, and in RARE form. This recording has floated around for almost 20 years on tape, and I'm glad they finally remastered and reissued this thing of beauty... and I LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT! A trillion stars!
