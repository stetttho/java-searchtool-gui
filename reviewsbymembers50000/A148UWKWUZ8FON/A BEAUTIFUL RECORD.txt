 Beautiful... absolutely beautiful. This album is a throwback to how people used to make records -- by swinging their %$#@! off and not playing a whole bunch of notes. And this album does swing... HARD! In fact, I fell out of my chair the first time I heard it! And there is NOTHING like the sound of a press roll right before a big, fat down beat (you jazzers out there will know what I'm talking about). It's nice to know that in a "been-there-done-that" and "heard-that-before" era, people can still make records that make my soul shake. Thanks for "the swing", Papa Ray.
