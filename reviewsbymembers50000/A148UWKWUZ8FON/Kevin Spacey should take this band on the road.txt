 It's been a long time since I've heard a band swing this hard! Kevin Spacey has managed to re-create the 1950's big band jazz studio vibe letter perfectly -- even using Bobby Darin's original arrangements. Although all of the tracks are great, the standout tracks here are "Hello, Young Lovers", "That's All", "Charade", and "Artificial Flowers".  The thing you have to understand about Kevin Spacey is that he is an amazing mimic (his Christopher Walken and Jack Lemmon impersonations are the best I've ever heard). So, it was no surprise that he nails Bobby Darin (he admits that he has been a die-hard Bobby Darin fan since childhood). Unlike the previous reviewer, I think Kevin's scatting works here because he is mimicking Bobby Darin's exact scat syllables (it even sounds like he is doing a little Jack Lemmon in his scat). Whatever the case, it sounds like he, the big band, and the orchestra are having fun dusting off these vintage charts. This album is a MUST HAVE for BD fans and big band fans alike!
