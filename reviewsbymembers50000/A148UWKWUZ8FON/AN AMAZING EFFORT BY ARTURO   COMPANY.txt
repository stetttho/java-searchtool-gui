 First off, much love to Arturo for playing tribute to these guys... it's about time someone did it! Secondly, he is dead-on nails getting in and out of each trumpeter's bag (a near impossible task!). He does so without reservation, playing each trumpeter's solo note-for-note -- with their sounds, cracks, articulations, and all!). Next hats off to the "boys" from L.A and Miami. The amazing producers (Quincy Jones and Gary Grant), conductor (Jerry Hey), musicians (esp. Dan Higgins and Greg Huckins. Wow! I fell out of my chair laughing at the "period" clarinet and bass sax stuff... rockin'!), and transcribers. These guys had only a couple of days last November to record 19 tunes, authentically. There's no one who can touch you guys! Bravo, Arturo, Bravo!
