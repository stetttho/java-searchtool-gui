 If you're a big band fan and own a DVD player, this DVD is an absolute must! This DVD features the comical and brilliant writing of L.A. composer/saxist Gordon Goodwin. This DVD also features the flawless work of  some of L.A.'s top echelon studio musicians -- including Dan Higgins, Alex  Iles, Andy Martin, Bill Reichenbach, Jerry Hey, Gary Grant, Dennis Farias,  and Wayne Bergeron -- to name a few. Perhaps what makes the DVD most  intriguing is the 6-channel surround sound format in which it's recorded --  absolutely incredible! -- Every nuance of the playing can be heard and the  playing IS pristine. Mr. Goodwin also brings aboard burnin' soloists --  like Eddie Daniels, Arturo Sandoval, Brandon Fields, and Eric Marienthal --  to make it all complete. I knew about this project about six months  before its arrival, and I waited frantically for it to be released. This  DVD has lived up to my expectations and WAY beyond! There has NOT been a  better project done within the past decade. Thank you Mr. Goodwin and  company.
