 Burnin'... absolutely burnin'! This band is the real deal. They play these difficult tunes with incredible precision. The pitch, balance, and blend are all immaculate from start to finish. You simply can't miss with this group of L.A. all-stars: Jerry Hey, Gary Grant, Dennis Farias, Wayne Bergeron, Alex Iles, Andy Martin, Bill Reichenbach, Dan Higgins, Bill Liston, and, of course, Gordon Goodwin... just to name a few. The solos are also burnin' all around. Definitely the most compelling big band record I've heard in the past 10 years. Great charts, personnel, and recording technology. This CD is a MUST HAVE for all serious big band fans. YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!
