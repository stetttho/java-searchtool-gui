 This CD is a winner from top to bottom! From the fiery brass intro, skippered by L.A. studio great Jerry Hey (whom I call the Muhammed Ali of the trumpet), on "Birdland" to Tommy Johnson's elegant low-end power on Satie's "Gymno Pedie". But what would a sandwich be without the meat? OK... Check out Warren Luening's burnished brass sound and flexibility on "Girl Talk". Listen to Dave Carpenter dig in on "My Favorite Things" following by a burnin' and unpredictable solo by Brandon Fields. Dig Ernie Watts on "Freedom Jazz Dance" and how manages to capture the quirky genius of the late, great Eddie Harris (not an easy task). Next, check out Dan Higgins' smokin' alto on "The Sidewinder" (ya' gotta love Cannonball!) followed by a great solo by guitarist Dean Parks. Last, and certainly not least, much praise to Vinnie Colaiuta and the fierce pockets he lays down on this CD. Can I have more stars for this one?
