 George Stone is an under-appreciated genius. This is a very good CD that anyone would be proud to have in their collection. Also, I'm intrigued by how he recorded it. He recorded the project section by section in his living room, using his bedroom as a control booth (he couldn't fit the entire band in his living room at once) hence the title "Piece By Piece". The musicians are all L.A. studio snipers, so one can't tell that the project was recorded this way -- absolutely seamless (the sound quality is excellent, by the way). It just goes to show you that with gumption and resourcefulness, anyone can realize their dream.
