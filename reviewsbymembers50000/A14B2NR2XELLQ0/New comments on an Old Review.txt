 I wrote this when I only read the First book of the series, almost two and a half years ago.  I was somewhat overly optimistic, but generally this still stands.  Snodgras never wrote anything worthwhile for the Wild Cards again.   The only Wild Card book I've read so far, this is very promising. I think I'll start with the bad things first. Too many of the stories don't work. Some, like Witness, are bad, while many (maybe most) seem to be a beginning, setting the stage without solving anything. ( that is especially true of stories like ' The long night of Fortunato') Also, there are to many characters, and the story isn't focused enough. It covers thirty years, but most of the time its not very vivid. The early stories, at least, all feature Tchyon as a main character, but then he disappears, and that's a shame. Now for the good part.  First, the intervals are great. Especially the one summing up the red scare, and the one with the quotes.  Also the one with about the science behind the wild Card virus. Then we have the premise, which is great. The world, and many of the characters, seem fascinating. I love the wild card virus. Also, three of the stories are simply exellent. Those are, Sleeper, by Roger Zealany, Strings, by Stephan Leigh, and especially, Degredation Rites, by Mellinda sondgrass, which is a touching, tragic love story, as well, as a powerful political tale. The best thing about the book, though, is the great promise it contains. It thrills me, and I'm sure I'm gonna love the next books.
