 I admire Martin's work, but I'm not a Horror fan, so I was skeptical when I opened the book at the book shop.  after two pages, I wasn't skeptical.  after 5, I was ashamed of my doubts.  Martin tells a brilliant, strong and  powerful tale, and tells it extreamly well. The only problme is that the  first one hundred fifty pages are kinde' slow... but it picks up and is  alot of fun.  The ending was very touching.  Don't miss Martin's greatest  creation, A Song of Ice and Fire
