 1) the military is evil, (2) any person in the military is an idiot, and (3) any person who mocks the military is heroic No, the book doesn;t say this at all.  what it does talk about is, amoung others, the stupidity of  war and the ballance between indeviduality and duty. Don't foget, the  heor of the novel is a Captain in the AF.  He flys 70 fight missions.  It's  not a book against the military, it's a book against power freaks.
