 I read this book, as well as another one.  Well, this one was ok, but the other one( I no longer remember then name) was... exactly the same book, with exactly the same plot.  It's all the same:  a group of people with  verious problems on their habds go to the world of the wll and find out  that they have even greater problems... they don't have hands!  now the  problems are at their claws! Anyway, it's ok. Not spectacular in any way,  though
