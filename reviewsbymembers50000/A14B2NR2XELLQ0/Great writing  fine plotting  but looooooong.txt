 I haven't read anything by Dan Simmons since The Rise of Endymion, over 6 months ago.  I decided to read Carrion Comfort in an impulse - I was curious as to how good his horror will be. in the first 300 pages I was  enchanted, and I asked myself frenzily "How come I haven't read  anything by Simmons for so long?" by page 400 I knew the answer.   Because it's sooo loooong. Now don't get me wrong, Simmons is a hell of a  writer.  Many scenes in this book are really tense.  The characters are  vary between ok to great (most of them),and no stickers.  The action is  often exciting... But there is so much of it!  around page 350, Simmons  starts a huge sub plot about a gang war and a haunted house(kind of).  The  subplot doesn't really go anywhere, except that it kills a bunch of people,  and substitutes them with some other people. Simmons is the writer most  need of an editor that I know of.  This could have been a Thriller  masterpiece.  Had it been 700 pages long, it would have stood there next to  'Red Dragon' and 'The Silence of the Lambs' by Thomas Harris. Rather it  is 992 pages long( british mass market paperback), it's a really good book,  and a one that you would enjoy reading.  It has some minor flaws other than  the length, but it is really well done.  It has the spookiest chess scene  I've ever read, and quiet enough original ideas to keep this a truly  original Thriller. Dan Simmons wrote a Science Fiction masterwork with  Hyperion, and now he came very close to writing a thriller masterwork.   That's quite an achievement. If you're looking for a good  horror-thriller, with some mind candy and lots of action and obscenitites  and sex, this is a great choice.
