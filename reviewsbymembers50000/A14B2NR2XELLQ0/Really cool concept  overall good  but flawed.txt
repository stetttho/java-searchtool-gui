 I've heard about Turtledove for a while, but this is the first of his books I've read. Overall reaction - it was good, well written, I liked the characters(especially Jager and Russie) and the man defnetly knows his  history. BUT... There are lots of little things. The alien society,  for example, is written in such a 'tailored' way it's a litte annoying.  To  be able enough to cross light years they have to be really powerful, but in  order to lose to the humans they have to be very restricted.  Turtledove's  alien society answers these craterias well, but does it perhaps too neatly.   there's a great deal of tension lost because it seems like the aliens are  the underdogs. And while the cast IS interesting, we could have avoided  some of the clische's - all the americans are great(they are), all Nazies  who play a significent roles are not racist and non fascists, etc,  etc. There are also far to many inside Science Fiction jokes, which makes  it harder to suspend disbelief - comments like "Alien invasions are  not the same as they are in 'Amazing Stories'" may be realistic, but  they make it hard to take the story seriously. Also it was sometimes too  slow, we didn't get enough of the Strategy( as oppose to the tactics) and  gthe ending wasn't a really succesful Cliffhanger. Still, I enjoyed the  book's many positive traits, and I would recommand it to anyone.
