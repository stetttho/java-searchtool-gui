 I did.  I thought it was smart, action oriented, and with cool characters.  One problem, though.  I WAS 12 YEARS OLD. I re read it as an adult(18, not 78) or rather , tried to re read it.  The silly, sexist and obvious  book might as well have tagged the characters with GOOD and EVIl in huge  capital letters, cause it's so obvious which one is which.  The book is so  lean on making the hero great that it's insulting. Still, I gave it 2  stars, cause if you're 13-14 you might like this book.
