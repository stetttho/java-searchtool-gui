 Ocean's Eleven is a witty, stylish movie about a grand theft.  It is perfect entertainment - fun, energetic, simple but not stupid, and witty through and through. George Clooney has much to do with the success of the film.  This is easily the best vehicle for Clooney's non-challante charisma and he does the best of it.  Constantly clever on his feet, Clooney is always likeable. Daniel Ocean (Clooney) is released from jail, and decides to rob not one, not two, but three Casinos at the same time.  For that he recruits a large group of professional thieves, from Computer experts to a Chinese rubber man.  The large and excellent cast remains for the most part in the background, with only Ocean's friend Rusty (Brad Pitt) being a substantial part of the film.  The rest get at best a couple of meaty scenes.  This is not, however, a disadvantage - Ocean's Eleven simply moves too fast for more than the bare essentials in terms of character development.  Still, the fine, fine writing and even better acting ensures that the entire cast is memorable, with Carl Reiner particularly impressive as Saul Blum. The plot gets more complicated, because the villain, Casino owner Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia, in a surprisingly weak performance from an otherwise fine actor) is now dating Ocean's ex wife Tess (Julia Roberts).  This leads to the predictable scenes when Tess tells Danny she won't go back to him, and to the inevitable kiss at the end of the movie, when she does.  All very formulaic, but also very watchable - again, fine acting, directing and even dialogue manages to keep the Schmaltz level to minimum. The great robbery proceeds head on with all the expected twists and turns, rarely truly surprising but constantly keeping you on your toes - you're never entirely certain what will happen next.] I can whole heartedly recommend Ocean's Eleven as one of the finest of its genre - pure entertainment, fast paced, sexy and thoroughly enjoyable without insulting your intelligence.
