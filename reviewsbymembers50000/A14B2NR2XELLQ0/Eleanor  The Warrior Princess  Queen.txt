 'Eleanor of Aquitaine' is the story of the 12th century French queen of both England and France.  Hers was an interesting life, and Marion Meade tells it quite well.  In a real Epic, Eleanor marries the kings of France and of England, goes on a crusade, gives birth to no less then 10 children, including Richard Lion Heart and King John.  She divorces one husband and participates in a  rebellion against the second.  She helps to of her sons reign as kings, and finally dies before watching the collapse of the empire she so desired. The problem with Meade's narrative is that much of what she describes seems debatable.  As a previous reviewer noted, this seems as much fiction as fact.  hardly a page goes by without the words 'must have' appearing somewhere.  Much of the thoughts, plans, and ideas of Eleanor and other characters is pure speculation.  Worse yet, often some of the actions and whereabouts of characters are given based on extreme circumstantial evidence. Meade is also trying to hard to model Eleanor into a modern style feminist.  Although she constantly attempts to depict Eleanor as an active, resourceful and wise woman, who rarely if ever makes mistakes, it is quite clear that Eleanor does not fit into that model.  In fact, I got the impression you could easily have written the story of Eleanor as an essentially passive bystander in the political dramas involving her parents, husbands and children. The footnotes, by the way, are complete waste of time for anyone trying to distinguish fact and fiction in Meade's work, unless one is a scholar of the period. Ultimately 'Eleanor of Aquitaine' is a very good read, but one suspects it is a poor history.
