 OK, first I shall say it was a strange pick of stories.  where was 'Sentinals' Arthur C Clarke's story that inspired 2001: A Space Odyssy? And why are there no less then five Horror stories in this collection( Mimic,  Second Variety, Sandkings, Candyman and Reanimator?) But it was,  nonetheless, a great collection. Mimic was short, but interesting.    Second Variety was cool, even if it wasn't really surprising and had a  cheat ending. Amanda and the Alien was better then the movie, but that  doesn't say much. Sandkings is a stroy by one of my favorite writers  George R R Martin, and was the scariest thing I've ever read. We Can  remember it for you wholesale was very cool, and very different from Total  Recall, too. Enemy Mine was prety cute, if obvious. Air Raid was  intriguing but not all that unique, reminded me a little of stephen King's  The Drawing of the three. Johnny Menemonic, by william gobson, was  terrible, boring and totally uncomprihensible. The forbidden was Ok, not  great. Martin's second entry, Nightflyers, was extreamly cool, almost as  good as his first, defnetly a classic, even if it was a little similar to  2001. So go buy it, 'Sandkings', 'We can Remember it for you' and  'Nightflyers' each is worth the price of the book alone.
