 Of all the authors that have come to be noticed in the last 10 years or  so, Neil Gaiman might just be the most acclaimed.  He wins awards all over  the place, and justifiably so - his collaboration with Terry Preachett,  Good Omens, is one of the best Speculative Fiction books of the 90s, and  his Magnum Epic, The Sandman, is praised as one of the best ever Graphic  novels series, and unlike most of the praises of this sort, it isn't even  slightly exagerrated. Gaiman is also a very diverse author:  He writes in  many lengths - his latest book is a collection of short fiction, and he  wrote long novels (Neverwhere, Good Omens) and short ones(like this one) he  writes very adult material(Sandman) along with with stuff that can be  appreciated by people of all ages(Stardust again).  He writes Graphic  Novels, Scripts, Novels, Short stories and poetry.  He writes Horror,  Fantasy, both Urban and Fairy tale style and even Science Fiction and  mainstream fiction.  But most importantly, He writes well. Stardust is a  testament for Gaiman's ability to write in a style that is both enchanting  and inviting.  His books are easy to read - they're not page turners in the  sense of 'Oh I wonder what's going to happend next'  but in the sense of  'Wow, it's already finished?'  It is effortless reading, but high value  ones. In this little charming story, Gaiman's sense of humor and writing  abilities keep you reading as he tells you of witches, falling stars, and,  as allways, twists on the tale.  Gaiman has a maiden in distress story, but  this time, the lady is held captive by the Hero(!), who wants to bring her  as a present for his true love(!!). Gaiman is one of the most exciting  authors around, and he rarely disappoints.  Stardust is charming tale which  one can't help but enjoy.
