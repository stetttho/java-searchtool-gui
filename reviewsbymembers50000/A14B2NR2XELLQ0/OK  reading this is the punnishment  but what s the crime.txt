 In this inspired book, Dosoyevsky forwards a complex, brilliant and innovative world view - that you have to be punnished for your crimes! By a sexist, racist writer, we get the story to bore even the most adequate  reader.  It's so boring, dead people will rise to shut you up if you'll  read it to them. This is the lamest so-called classic I've ever read.   Read 'for Whom The Bell Tolls' read '1984'or 'The Picture of Durian Grey'  even read 'It takes a village' for crying out loud!  everything but  this! And by the way, lots of people say they liked 'Brothers K'.  It is,  admittedly, somewhat better then this one, but that's like being drier then  the ocean.  Evoid at all costs!
