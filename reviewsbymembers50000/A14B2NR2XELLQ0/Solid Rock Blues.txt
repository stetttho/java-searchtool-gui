 In July 2003, Zora Young was a guest of American-Israeli Blues/Rock performer Ronnie Peterson.  I caught a gig in Haifa, and although the band was very competent, it was clearly Zora Young who ruled the party.  Born into the music, Zora sang blues, rock gospel and soul with equal conviction.  Combining her own songs with covers, both well known (Summertime, There's No Sunshine when she's gone, and what she introduced as "one of Muddy's old tunes", actually a Preston Foster song, 'Got My Mojo Working'), and obscure ('Blues Falling Down Like Rain' by Bill Chinnock, also one of the highlights of this CD), Young commandeered the crowd with an energetic performance from a natural showwoman. The album Young was 'promoting', which I bought from her after the gig, does not quite capture the energy and enthusiasm that Young radiates from the stage.  At its best, when Young hallows that "Blues' Falling Down Like Rain", or moans "Damn your eyes... for taking my heart away", it comes quite close to capturing the presence and power of the live Zora Young.  At worse, in the needless covers of Chuck Berry's Living in the USA, and especially in the Tina Turner (Tina Turner!) penned Nutbush City Limits, the album feels lifeless and almost DOA. But for the most part, even if the album does not quite capture the fullness of Young's prowess, it is still very much entertaining.  There are few stylistic breakthroughs here, but it does range from rock (Pity Party), to Blues (Damn Your Eyes) and Gospel (The Lord Helps Those Who Help Themselves), with Soul influences everywhere.  With a production that generally gets out of the way, 'Learned My Lesson' is a solid blues album, with many outstanding songs, that is worth its while for any fan of Blues music.
