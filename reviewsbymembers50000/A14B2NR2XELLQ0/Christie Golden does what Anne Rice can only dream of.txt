 Golden is a terrific writer.  It's been years since I've read any AD&D books, and in retro perspect, only few of them stand out - RA Salvatora's Homeland, ElfShadow, and both of Golden's ravenloft books that I've read,  The Dance of the Dead and this one.  It's a very good book, one that can  compare favorably with 'real' Fantasy and horror.  I'd take Golden over  Rice every day. This one is way better then 'An Interview with A Vampire'
