 The world of popular music in the late 20th century was filled with troubadour singers, whose songs can be a soundtrack to our lives.  The best of them, like Bob Dylan and Leonard Cohen, wrote songs that transcend any genre and become immortal.  Johnny Cash's genius was not in his songwriting - it was in his voice.  When Johnny Cash sings, it is the very voice that hits you - not that the songs don't matter, but they are vehicle through which Cash shares his soul with us.  Cash's voice has a way of coming across to you, whether you're young or old, believer or disbeliever, American or not.  Cash doesn't have to shy away or to transcend country music, he's so natural with it, that what may sound as a terrible cliche coming from anyone else, is genuine when sang by the Man in Black.  I'm not sure whether 'Life', a compilation chosen by Cash himself is the best representation of his work, or the best introduction.  It contains its share of misses.  "I wish I was crazy again" is melodramatic and musically dull; "These Are My People" and "Ragged Old Flag" are slight, patriotic songs.  "Suppertime" and "I talk to Jesus every day" won't win any awards, either.   But the compilation does contain some of Cash's best, and some of his best known, songs.  "Man in Black" is an ultimate protest song, one that manages to speak about society and about Cash himself.  "Country Trash" and "Oney" are hilarious tracks celebrating the everyman's life, "You're the nearest thing to heaven" is a love song for his wife, the late June Carter, and "The Night Hank Williams Came to Town" is an equally powerful tribute to American music.   My favorite little gem, though, is the Gospel infused "I'm Alright Now".  "I've been driving on the devil's train but I got off somehow" Cash sings, and you know that he did.  Goodbye, Johnny, you'll be missed.
