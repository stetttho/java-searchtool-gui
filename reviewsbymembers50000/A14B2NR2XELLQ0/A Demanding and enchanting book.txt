 I've been introduced to the works of Stephen Leigh through his Wild Cards contributions, which convincewd me he is a powerful story teller, who posses a clever way with words. Speaking Stones isn't a page-turner the  way    Leigh's Puppetman stories are, but it ispowerful nonetheless, and  the ending is enchanting. If there is one complaint is that the book  isn't really a stand alone -  as someone who hasn't  read Dark Water's  Embrace, Ifound the p lot hard to follow at times, and the narration  technique, while cool and original, can be confusing, especially as some of  the narrations are of a time much earlier. Don't let all that stop you,  though.  This is a chalanging book, and reading Dark Water's Embrace may be  a good idea (I know I intend to), but itis powerful, and  rem inds me n ot  only of Ursula K Leguin, b ut also of Orson Scott Card's Speaker for the  Dead  and Octavia Butler's Exogenesis Trilogy. I won't spoil much of the  book,otherthan to say that it recounts a story of the clash of cultures,  with no Heroes and Villans, but real people and aliens, men and women and  mid-males (and one super cool computer called Ghost), who try to fight for  the good of their people. Leigh's a  great, under rated book, and this is  a great, underated book.
