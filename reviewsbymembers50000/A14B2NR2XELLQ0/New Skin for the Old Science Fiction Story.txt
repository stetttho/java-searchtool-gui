 In 'Ventus' Karl Schroeder creates a science fiction premise that is well established - a fallen colony, with technology equivalent to the middle ages.  A high tech McGavin from a defeated enemy, and undercover heroes going after it.  Add to this a coming-of-age story and a whole group of opposing factions (in the climax, there are three AI groups and 5 human groups alternatively cooperating and struggling), and you've got all the elements for a good planet based Space Opera. But Although 'Ventus' is not a classic like Dan Simmons's Hyperion Cantos and the 'Deepness' books by Vernor Vinge (an obvious inspiration for Schroeder - and why not learn from the best?) it manages to be more than just another good SF tale. One element that works well is the focus on nano-technology.  Yeah, Nano is the early 21st century equivalent to Atomic power in the 1940s - it's the technology everyone in the present (and thus also in the future) is obsessed with.  And yet Schroeder manages to do some very interesting things with Nano, including the cool idea of 'Winds' working together to terraform a planet, and some interesting musings about how nano may be used to resurrect the Platonian notion of 'the essence' of things. Also good are the characters, particularly Generals Armigar and Levin.  The former, a god learning to be human, is portrayed realistically, and the predictable love interest is nonetheless effective.  Some spooky scenes in which he eats wood and stones are cool, too. Levin, conflicted between love and duty, is also a very sympathetic and tragic character, and his scenes are the most effective in the novel. Although the pace is a little slow, the writing is effective and sometimes inspired, and Ventus is an enjoyable novel of action and ideas.
