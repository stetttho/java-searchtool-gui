 In 'Debating Slavery', Mark M. Smith has made quite an achievement: he took two topics which I personally find fascinating - American Negro Slavery and Historiography - and managed to produce a sordid essay, that is almost entirely unenlightening and literally painful to read. Smith's book exposes the opinions of scholars of slavery on several key questions about the 'peculiar institution':  Was slavery profitable?  Were slave owners Capitalists?  And to what extent did the owners control the life and culture of slaves? Smith's answer to all these questions seems to be a variation on 'to an extent'.  Slaveholders were part Capitalist and part not Capitalists, and what is Capitalism anyway?  The Slaves had their own culture but where very influenced by the masters, etc.  I don't mind ambiguity and nuance in analysis, but Smith comes off not as complex but as indecisive. It doesn't help that Smith's narrative is little more then a list of scholars's opinions, along with citations and reference.  There are some attempts to flash out the argument (often using graphs and charts), but those are halfhearted.  Smith seems to think that reference is a substitute for an argument. In what is essentially an extended bibliographical essay, one would expect a useful list of works sited.  Unfortunately, even that is not properly done.  After a short list of 'general books', Smith goes on to put a separate bibliography for each chapter, without repeating titles.  As a result, if you are trying to locate a reference to a book in chapter five, for instance, you may have to look through the bibliographies of all the preceding chapters, as the work you're looking for may be mentioned in any of them. All in all, Debating Slavery is a mercilessly bad book.  The only good thing I can say about it is that it is short; but that just means it's overpriced  :-)
