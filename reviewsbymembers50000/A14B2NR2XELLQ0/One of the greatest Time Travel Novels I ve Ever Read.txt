 Connie Willis has written many a great book.  but this time she superseded herself.  Intelagent, witty, smartly constructed and plotted, DOG is Willis's best tale. Willis is one of the few Authors, who not only use the first voice narration often, but also uses it well.  At her writing, the  characters come to live, as they battle their way through the brilliantly  realised Victorian England. There are a few complaints, however - at  points, its accessive, when Willis tries too hard to go for humour.  The  ending, although clever is a little bit of a cheat. Small Potatoes.  This  is one of the greatest Time Travel novels I've ever read.  The only one  that's quite as good is Isaac Asimov's The End of Eternity. Willis at her  best is quite close to Asimov at his best, and that's possibly the ultimate  complement an SF author can recieve.
