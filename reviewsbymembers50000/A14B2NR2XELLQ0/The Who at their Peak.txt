 Truth is, Who's Next wasn't the album I wanted to buy.  I was looking for  Odds and Sods, or something with 'Long Live Rock' on it.  I still want  that, but I'm REALLY glad I bought Who's Next first. Who's Next was born  out of failiure - the failiure of the Lifehouse project.  But it's no  failiure at all - It is a glorios success.  In no time at all, Who's Next  has grown to be one of my faovrite all time records. Look at the cover,  for start.  It is hillarious and provocative at the same time.  The Who  were past their 'trashing equipment' days at that point, but the cover  shows they didn't forget the art of making a strong visual impression. (A  short complain - I think that the addition of the preiviously unreleased  songs harms the album - Why do you think they WEREN'T released in the first  place?  Some of them are really nice, but I would have prefered them in a  second CD, not on the same one) It is the music, beyond all, that  captures you.  The rythem guitar on 'Barbara O'Reilly', John Entwistle's  powerful My Wife, which is a sad, powerful song... 'All I did was have to  much to drink'.  Going Mobile is energetic like few songs ever are, and  'I'm in Tune' is wishful and touching. But to me, The Song is Over is the  best of the bunch (Though it's a VERY close call).  When Roger Daltney  roars "I'll Sing My Song to the Wide Open Spaces" I was thinking  for a moment of Nick Cave at his best, but there is a beauty here that  supersedes even his great tunes.  Talented artists could persaps write  songs which have this level of Energy, or this beauty, but not combine both  in one song like The Who.
