 The 1970s saw David Bowie in one of the most extraordinary peaks of creativity ever achieved by any Rock'n'Roll artist.  Whole albums, such as Ziggy Stardust and Station to Station are perfect from the first moment to the last.  Other masterpieces, though flawed, contain such an overload of brilliance that it overshadows whatever weak track exist on the albums ('Hunky Dory' is a perfect example for that).  Lodger, in a sense, is different in the sense that it foreshadows most of Bowie's later albums: it's a mixed bag.  At times experimental ('Red Money'), Anthemic ('DJ'), silly ('Yassassin'), and sometimes just utterly brilliant ('Boys Keep Swinging' and 'Look Back in Anger') - Lodger is as good a candidate for a 'typical' Bowie album as it gets.  The weaker tracks, such as 'Yassassin' and 'African Night Flight' are not so much bad as miscalculated - Bowie's rock music talents gone wrong.  Some tracks, such as opener 'Fantastic Voyage' and 'Move On' are solid rock tracks, not spectacular but with interesting lyrics ('I'll never say anything nice again' Bowie mysteriously declares on 'Voyage').  The two highlights are the majestic, dark and hard rockin' "Look Back in Anger", which has been a frequent show opener for Bowie.  With rifts that anticipate the leaner, meaner sound of "Scary Monsters", "Look Back in Anger", as opaque as it may appear (the video suggests an allusion to a deformed artist, and maybe to Oscar Wilde's 'The Picture of Durian Grey'), it's a deserved classic.  Rarely played live, "Boys Keep Swinging" an ironic tribute to youth and masculinity.  It seems like a stylistic throw back to the 1950s or even 30s, but the music is patently Bowie, with a hard beat beneath the pretty melody.  It's yet another classic.  For most artists, Lodger would have been a career highlight.  Only in comparison to Bowie's remarkable career can an album as strong as this one seem so mundane.
