 I'm really someone who reads alot, and when I picked up Catch 22 I was worried.  More oftem then not, 'classic' books are disappointing. But by the second page I knew it was a masterpiece.  When I reached the ending I  knew I've never read anything quite as good. It's the ending that  captures you, cause it's what the book is all about.  It's not about war  being bad, but about the line between ideology and individuality.
