 It's strange that Amazon.Com doesn't offer Woody Allen's Melinda and Melinda as I just saw it on DVD yesterday.  That actually fits well into the film's theme - the existence of two parallel universes; For some, life is a comedy, for others, a tragedy.  A discussion between two writers as to whether life is a tragedy or a comedy ends with two radical reinterpretation of what is basically the same situation.  In both, the distraught Melinda (Radha Mitchell, playing a neurotic female Woody Allen type) crashes an important dinner party, and spins the previously ordinary lives of the guests into mayhem.  In both tales Melinda is part in a love triangle or two, and in both there is a suicide attempt.  Other than that, the stories couldn't have been more different.  The 'tragic' Melinda is a suicidal divorcee, with two children she has no access to and a secret past, who comes to entangle the marriage life of her childhood friend Laurel (Chloe Sevigny).  The 'comic' Melinda is the whacko neighbor of Hobie (Will Farrell) and his wife Susan (Amanda Peet), who reawakens both of their love life, albeit not to each other.  Melinda and Melinda is among the best of Allen's recent work.  The 'Comic Melinda' reminds you of his recent stuff, and is as funny as 'Hollywood Ending'; the tragic story, although not flashed out enough, recalls Allen's classics "Annie Hall" and "Hannah and her sisters".    Ultimately, Allen refuses to offer us his own answer about whether life is a comedy or a tragedy.  But the tale of two Melindas is neither a comedy nor a tragedy; it's simply a good movie.
