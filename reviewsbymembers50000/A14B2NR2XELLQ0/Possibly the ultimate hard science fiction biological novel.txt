 I have allways held a strange opinion about Greg Bear.  I thought him to be a quite a good writer, but I simply haven't read anything by him I loved.  I read a few short stories, and 'Foundation and Chaos', and they  were all good, but nothing to addict me. Alas, neither was  "'Darwin's Radio" But don't let that stop you.  Darwin's Radio  is certainly worth reading. I'll start with what I didn't like.  The  characters, while all different, didn't seem all that interesting.  The  only one I really cared about was Christopher, and to a lesser extent Saul.   They were different and came alive.  Bear spent alot of time about the  rest of the characters, especially Kaye and Mitch, but I never cared for  them, or for the romance. The other main complain, is that there really  isn't too much of a plot.  The book is marked as a Techno thriler, but  there really isn't any action or advature.  The characters are more or less  passive spectators, watching Sheva, speculating about it, and trying to  survive the catastrophes the world throws at them.  In a sense, there's no  story here. OK.  Then why should you read the book?  Simply, because the  ideas behind it are mind blowing, and well explained.  Yeah, sometimes I  was lost in the science, but I truly enjoyed Bear's scientific imagination.   Bear does something that science fiction rarely does - he expands  scientific ideas, and he should be commanded for that. Also, the book  deserve notice for Bear's ability to make the scientific method, and the  scientists, not only comprehensible but also fascinating.  The tensest  moments of the novel are scientifical exchanges of ideas and theories.  At  its best, you read with wide eyes as characters present incredible ideas,  that seem strangely likely.
