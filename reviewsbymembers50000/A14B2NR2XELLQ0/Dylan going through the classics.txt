 For this reviewer, the point of buying a recent live concert of someone with a long career is to hear the jextaposition of old and new, stuff that your Dad has heard and stuff that's so new you don't know yet. This is hard to do.  There are very few successful live recordings which do this.  Lou Reed succedded to do that in his 1983 live in Italy record (although his career was 'only' 20 years old at the time), but failed in 'Perfect Night', where the new (er) stuff works well, but with few exceptions the older stuff doesn't.  David Bowie's Live in the BBC concert fails miserably in the first half of the concert, but hits the bull's eye in the second half.   Bob Dylan, however, doesn't even try in this record. Out of thee 11 songs, all but 3 were written in the 1960s, and one of the three songs is "Knockin' on Heaven's Door".  this makes this a wonderful show for the people who left Dylan at woodstock ( yeah I know he wasn't there), but it feels a little like a nostalgy show for everyone else. Some of the Oldies work wonderfully.  Tombstone Blues, All Along The Watchtower, John Brown and of course, Like A rolling Stone, are brilliant, but others are just OK, and "Knockin' on Heaven's Door" has to go.  The new songs, are great, especially Dignity, which is one of Dylan's best songs. Overall, this is a strong record, filled with good songs by one of America's top songwriters.  It's Dylan in top form - I'd just would have prefered a little more of the new and the exciting, and less reliance on songs 30 years past.
