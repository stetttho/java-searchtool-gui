 Burning Airlines's debut album Mission:Control is an extremely impressive album - it is innovative and unique, and in the same time it works as a  classic rock album. I have never heard anything by any of the band  members in their former enterprises, but the album stands very well on its  own.  The singing, guitars, drums, etc, are all first rate, but it is the  song writing that makes this album truely unique, as far as I'm  concerned. Songs like Carnival or Wheaton Calling demonstrate rock song  writing at its best - singing about 'the gap between love and pornography'  shows that the Band know their Punk background, but can ascend it.  Tthey  can also write the fast, creepy choruses of Alternative music ' Repeat *  10, you're happy again, sinking where you lay' is cynical and funny at the  same time. The Alternative Pop elements are there - you have to love the  way they sing/scream 'Crowding the Candy Corona-TION' in Crowned. The  mere ability to say some of these lyrics deserves an award, let alone  singing them 'The taste of bitter fictions, the ring of contradictions that  sing to me'  is among the easier ones, but a favorite of mine. This album  is filled with great songs, from the fast Carnival to the fun of crowned  through slow, beautiful melodies of songs such as '3 Sisters'.  It also has  some cool bits from Orson Well's take of Kafka's The Trial, which are  humerous in a dark, rock'n'roll way - it almost feels like an  injoke. Only rarely do I find a band whose stuff I really like, and  they're often long gone before I notice them... but I fell in love with  'Burning Airlines'... and I'm gonna wait for the next album... and for a  tour somewhere close :-)
