 You thought Ender's Game is one of the very best books written? You thought Speaker of the Dead was a good book? You thought Xenocide was slightly above average? You'll think this is god awful... but you'll have  to read it, because you're an Ender fan. But I'd skip this and go read  'Hyperion' by Dan Simmons or some really classic Sci-Fi like Asimov, or  even ENDER'S GAME again
