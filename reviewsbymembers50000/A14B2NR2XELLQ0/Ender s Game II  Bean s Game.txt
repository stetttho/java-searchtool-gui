 A writer writes a book, the book happens to be one of the best science fiction books of all times, and makes the big money.  The author writes sequels, different but original, which are between good and terrible and  which also bring in money, but not as much as the first book. So what  does the author do?  what would you do? Orson Scott Card wrote Ender's  Game again. Not that the idea, telling the Ender story from Bean's point  of view isn't interesting.  The problem is, Orson Scott Card rewrote  everything. The result is that Bean is our new hero.  he's the Nouveau  Ender. Smarter then Ender, in fact.  It feels like one of the comedies in  which you have to take two people through the same place, without them  meeting each other, only it's ain funny.  It's like trying to sneak an  Elephant through the City hall.  It doesn't work, and it diminishes not  only Ender's game, but also ENDER.  But then, in the last two Ender tales,  he had to fight tax colloectors and was bored to death by his wife.  what  can you expect? There are good things in this book, too.  The scenes  without Ender are good, and finally getting an explanation for some action  by Petra is almost worth the wait.  I've been waiting for that answer for  like 6 years. BTW, if someone here hadn't read Ender's Game but did read  Ender's shadow, please email me, I would like to talk to you. anyone else  feel free, too
