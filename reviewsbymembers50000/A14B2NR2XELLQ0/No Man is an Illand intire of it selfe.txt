 I got the book because of a recommandation and because of the cool quote.  I've read The Old Man and The Sea in High School and hated it.  But Form Whom The Bell Tolls is brilliant. What impreses me about the book is how  Hemingway manages to come up with a tightly written action tale, with deep  philosophycal ideas and a great romance. I've read alot, and For Whom The  Bel Tolls is my second favorite book... you can't afford missing it
