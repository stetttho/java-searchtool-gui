 I am a great admirer of the Late Doctor Asimov.  The man had an incredible talent for clear, effective writing, and incredible ideas.  Usually I find his non fiction to be atleast as effective and as inspiring as his non  fiction. However, this is not the case with his Guide to the Bible. Don't  get me wrong... Asimov achieved everything he set up to do.  he exploars  the 'real' espects of the bible. However, that is not what I find  interesting in the bible.  to tell you the truth, I don't care about the  origin of every name, and about the places in which each event took  place(Asimov does not, in my opinion, stresses enough the fictious nature  of the Bible).  I'm more interested in the moral and ethical points of the  bible, and in its history. In the book, there are some interesting  ancedotes and facets about that.  However, those are hidden between pages  on pages describing the places and names, etc. If that's what you're  interested in, this is the perfect book for you.  I, alas, was  disappointed.
