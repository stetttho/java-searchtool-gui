 Across Realtime (My version) is an omnibus collection of two novels by  Vernor Vinge:  The Peace War, and Marooned in Realtime.  The Second book,  especially, is among the best SF books I've read. The Peace War is,  seemingly, a fairly standard SF novel: in a post apocalyptic world, a  dictatorship took over, and the brave heroes fight it off.  Except that it  is much more than that - Vinge's talent, his characters and his ideas all  turn this B movie premise to an original, powerful SF novel.  Especially  important is Vinge's simple but brilliant invention of the 'Bubble's -  spheres which are completely shielded off the world, in which time doesn't  move. 'Marrooned in Realtime' takes the premise established in the first  novel, and pushes it beyond belief.  The beginning of 'Marooned',  especially, is idea oriented SD at it's finest - you read going WOW every  two seconds. Idea oriented SF is probnably the hardest thing in the  universe to write - you need not only to know how to write well, not only  to understand science, but also to come up with a scientific idea which has  mind opening reprecussions.  I think I can count on 1 hand the number of  times I've seen Idea oriented SF done right - this is one of the prime  examples. If you're a lover of SF, Across Realtime will be a parade of  ideas, characters, action and thrills.  So don't miss it.
