 The cliche would be to say that words can't express how great this book is, but that, of course, is false.  For words DO express how great it is - George R. R. Martin's words, though, not mine. A Storm of Swords is the third, and the best (so far), of the Epic Fantasy series A Song of Ice anf Fire.  In a time when half the world is writing Epic Fantasy, George R. R.

The book's beginning is a masterful art of wieving threads together, and about a third way into is you start to shadder because you're in the most incredible rollar costar imaginable, and it won't let you off until the very ending, and you'll be left suffering until a Dance with Dragons will be out in 2002 - but that's true for all of us Martin fans. A Storm of Swords shows Martin's loathing of happy endings and black/white characters - Martin's world is so realistic it hurts.  The morality gets much more complicated, as we get indights into a character we thought was a villain, and see his actions completely differently.

But he has, and now all I can do is to count the days until A DANCE WITH DRAGONS
