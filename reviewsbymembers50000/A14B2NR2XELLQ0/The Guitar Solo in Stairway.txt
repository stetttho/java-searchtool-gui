 That's what caught Me. It takes awhile for music to sink into me, three, four listening are the almost-absoloute minimum.  Often its more. But I fell in love with The guitar Solo from 'Stairway' the moment I heard it.  I  was driving, and I recall putting the volume up considerably.  Its a  magnificent piece... the only solo I can think of too match is the one in  the Pixies' song, All Over The World. The rest of the album is great, too.   those guys can play!   the lyrics are powerful 'I'm waiting for the angels  of Avalon, waiting for the Eastern glow' ( I think) I keep humming 'makes  me wonder'
