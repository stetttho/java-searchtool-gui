 I AM LEGEND is a powerful tale of one man's life in an alienated world.  While seemingly an 'end of the world' novel, Matheson manages not to fall into clisch?, and his story is allways powerful and centered. The book is  somewhat dated, and at times maybe unclear, but those are minor points.   the ending, when Matheson's tale switches, is powerful, unexpected, and  touching.
