 OK.  Nice Cave in two sentences:  When he's good, he's really good.  When he's not so good, he's really not so good. Check out any Nick Cave album.  You've got 2-3 brilliant pieces(Deanna, The Ship Song, The Curse of Milhaven), and everything else pretty forgetable ( The Good Son, Plain Gold Ring, etc). Therefore, Nick Cave would be the perfect artist for a best of collection. So why the four star?   Well, because it's not a best of, DUH.  It's a MOST FAMOUS CD.  Now generally the singles are amoung Cave's best stuff, but hardly always.  So we get 'Where the Wild Roses Grow' which is really a very mediocre song, and we get 'Into My Arms' which is just OK.  But we don't get 'The Curse of Millhaven', or the great Elvis cover 'In the Ghetto' and we don't get Jack the Ripper, and most importantly, we don't get 'PAPA WON'T LEAVE YOU, HENRY' which is a Cave masterpiece. But we do get Deanna, and The Weeping Song, and The Ship Song, and DO YOU LOVE ME, and The Mercy Seat, so all in all, it's hardly a bad deal... depending on the price. Oh, and do get the one with the live performance, it's not GREAT, but it's fun.  And it'll allways crack me up to hear that guy Blixa do Minouge's part in 'Where the Wild Roses Grow' Oh, by the way, if you want a live recording that is also a 'greatest hit' thing, try LIVE SEEDS.  It doesn't have all the goodies, but it has awsome versions of Papa won't leave you henry, Deanna ( with cool extra lyrics), and some other classics, with a wonderful raw sound.
