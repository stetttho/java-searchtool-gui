 I've read, and reviewed, Worldwar: In The Balance.  The first book was interesting and a good read, if also flawed.  Alas, the second is a huge disappointment. Pretty much all that was wrong with the first book is  wrong with the second one as well. Very important is that NOTHING happends.  Except for one 'big' event, that is supposed to be shocking even though it  was refered to a million times, the situation remains pretty much the same  as it was in the first book. Everything is very repetitive.  We have  millions of battle scenes, which get old quickliy.  We get needless  descriptions of sex, we get a really bad soap Opera sub plot( more on that  later), and we get endless alien bitching about hwo "Chaotic"  humans are.  It was OK the first book, but now it's terrible. The worst  thing, are the characters.  now we have no less then three ex baseball  players as heroes.  Compare that to soldiers(2), scientists(1), resistance  fighters(1-2), pilots(2) politicians(1)... way too much baseball. But the  worst thing, and the very reason I stop reading this series despite all the  good things I said about it in my review of the first book, is Sam Yeager.   I just can't stand him.  He's simply the worst, most annoying charicature  of a character, the brainless brawn that saves the day and gets the girl.   I hate his character so much it alone would have been enough to make me  desert almost anybook, no matter how good.  Fortunately or unfortunately,  this isn't a great book in the first place.
