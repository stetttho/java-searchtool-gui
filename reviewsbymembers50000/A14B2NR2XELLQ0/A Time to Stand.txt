 OK. This is were I react.  The writer before me is certainly losing it, as well, as the woman who bitched about not havng stron female characters. Martin created the most incredible cast of characters, male  and female, to have ever apeared in a fantasy book.  Catelyn is a stron  female character, and so is Dany,and Arya.  Someone who doesn't think they  are probably will consider Pilar from 'For Whom The Bell Tolls' a weak  female character. As for likeable characters, it's true that a few  likeable character die, but that's life.  You have plenty of cool heros  left, most notably Tyrion Lannister.  If you feel bad about characters  sying, Martin has done his work properly. As for childlish, well it's  true that about half of the character sare children, so they act childlish.   Like DUH.  But there are lots of grown ups, and they never act  childlishly.  Catelyn and Tyrion's battle of wits, Ned's search for Robert  Arryn's murderers, Jon Snow learning about loyalty - all are simbols of  growth and greatness.
