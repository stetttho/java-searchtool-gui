 Aces High delivers on the promise of Wild Cards.  It is a magnificent story, and an addicting one at that. Unlike the first Wild Cards book, Aces High is a tightly written tale, following some threads to their end,  more or less.  It means that, generally , the individual stories are less  note worthy( with the exception of the remarkable "Winter's  Chill"and the half comic "Ashes to Ashes") but the overall  quality is high. The book introduces us some new heros.  the most  entertaining of them are Jube, an extra terrestrial who knows more jokes  than anyone else around, and Kid Dinausaur, a boy who can change into any  dinausaur he wishes, thought they're always tiny. We have some new  villans, only hinted to in the first book.  It is more of a comic book than  the grim first volume.  The writing seemed to have risen, and it is, all by  all, a much more entertaining tale. A special notice deserves George R R  Martin.  After writing the frankly disappointing 'Shell Games' in Wild  Cards, Martin returns in full shape with a remarkable, touching story.   Winter's Chill is the story in Aces High most resembling the WILD CARDS  town, and is also the best. If you can find this, BUY IT
