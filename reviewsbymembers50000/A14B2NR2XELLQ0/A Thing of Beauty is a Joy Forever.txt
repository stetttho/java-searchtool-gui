 For some reason, all great science fiction writers can't stop themselves from adding more and more to their greatest creation.  Since I believe most of the people here have read some of these, here goes: Asimov's Foundation  Triology still holds as the very best of science fiction ever written, in  my not so humble opinion.  However, All the sequels, with the possible  exception of Prologue to Foundation, were ****. Frank Herbert's Dune - I  tried to read a sequel, but couldn't.    Dauglas Adams's Hitch-hiker's  Guide to the Galaxy , as great as it was, added multiple of unnecessary  books too tire even Ford Prefect enthusiasts. and perhaps the most  relevant, ORson Scott Card created Ender's Game, and a reasonable sequel,  Speaker for the Dead, only to ruin them by two more barely readable  books. Given the repartoir, Simmons's work was the best of the bunch.   Hion and Fohion are amoung the greatest books ever written, sci-fi or no  sci-fi.  And the Endymion books? Well, Endymion was alright.  It was two  hundred pages too long, but still had lots od cool scenes, even if it was  kinde'standard. RoEion was much more ambitious, and for the most part,  better.  RoEion had  enough good characters, smart moments great lines, and action, to make up  for it and retain it's ground a relatively worthy part of the Hyperion  Cantos.  Had it not been for the great two Hion books, Eion and RoEion  would have been considered very good science fiction.  The only problem is  how they pale in comparison to the first too.
