 Yes, the writer throws her entire mental lexicon at us. Did i care really?? Not so much. It doesn't take away from the story line, and even if there were words I had never heard in my life the contexual clues help you out. This book is a great start for an interesting fantasy read. I would have given the book more stars except for one nagging point. When a writer starts out with such an interesting character and world, I expect a little more. The main character jumped around a lot in the first book, and a lot of critical events got crammed into a single binding. However, it truly is an original concept and the sheer fact that I really wanted to know so much more about the underlying mysteries really pulled this book along well.
