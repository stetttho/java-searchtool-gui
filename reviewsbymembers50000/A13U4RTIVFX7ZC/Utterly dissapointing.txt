 For the first time in a long time, I put a book down and just couldn't read anymore. This was the dullest book I had read in a while. I've actually suffered through quite a few dull books too. To begin, I could never figure out what the heck was going on. This book begins choppy, giving snippets of unexplained storyline from a few different characters' perspectives. This not only spans locations but also dates, so at one point your in the somewhat present, the next chapter you're in 2400 AD, each section not being very long or quite detailed. So by the time things started wrapping together I was pretty much fed up with this book. I dont usually mind being left in the dark; however, a combination of totally bland writing and one dimensional characters made me not really care what was going on in the next page. Also, there is a definate obsession with sex and pornographics situations, not really with any merit to the storyline other than as some sort of twisted fan service. I'm not even sensitive to that kind of stuff in books, but for some reason it really disturbed me here. Every single section of the book had some sort of dirty sexual fantasy (some of which involve young children) and I didnt even get that far in the book. Just bleh.
