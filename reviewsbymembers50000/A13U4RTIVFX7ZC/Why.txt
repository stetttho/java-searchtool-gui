 ...hadn't I heard rave reviews about Butler's work before? I picked this book up on a whim, which I never do with authors I don't know without reading reader reviews online first. After finishing it, I couldn't understand why I had never heard of the author before since I've been frequenting the sci/fi fantasy sections in stores and online for years. But let me just say, this book is amazing. I would be hard pressed to find more imaginitive authors who take such a big idea and wrap it into something that it such a pleasure to read.   Imagine being "revived" after the near death of a people and getting a second chance at life. Now imagine that this blessing is only with the goodwill of an alien race, and everything you once knew has changed. Butler takes this radical dilemna and offers a poignant story of a woman forced to come to terms with her changing perspective and the reality that the only way to keep her humanity is to loose a great deal of it as well.   I highly recommend this book to anyone wanting or willing to look past the hackneyed genres that, while still producing high quality writing, lack original thought. Reading this book was definately a breath of fresh air.
