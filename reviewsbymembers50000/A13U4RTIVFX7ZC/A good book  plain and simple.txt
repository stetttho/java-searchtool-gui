 I actually really enoyed this book. It hasn't gotten stellar reviews, but this can really be a fun book to read. I think the problem many people are finding is that the book is unpretentious. A lot of fantasy/sci-fi books come off very complex and involved, with names of people and places you can't pronounce. And while you're trying to remember who is who of the unpronounceable names, you've got to climb your way through a couple hundred years of foreign politics. What Trudi gives you is a good book, a good plot, and characters that you can see are still developing- as it should be in any series. I've read the second book in the series and it only gets better. I recommend this book to anyone who wants a good fantasy read and just that.
