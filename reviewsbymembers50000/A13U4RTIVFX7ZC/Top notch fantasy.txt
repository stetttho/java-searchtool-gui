 It's books like this that make you wish there was a larger rating scale. Some fantasy books deserve 5 stars for fluid, imaginative writing and original ideas. The you reach Hobb and wish you could add an extra star in retrospect, because its the epitome of a storytelling experience.   This book matches the first installment in the series very well. It doesnt lose steam like many series do by the second book, adding nonsense fillers and taking the story where it shouldn't because the author didn't have a 3-book installment planned from the beginning. Hobb doesn't have the most artistic writing style I've ever seen. It's not prone to lots of flourishes and flowery wording, but it is extremely solid and engrossing. Sometimes I can pick up her books and not be in the mood to start with her more subtle writing style; which sometimes takes recognition of her talent to see that the first few pages aren't boring, but perfectly developed, no more no less.   Character development flows nicely, and none of the characters are superheros who can't get hurt and have endless powers. Everyone is human and everyone has their own process. The suspense in this story is great too, as 3/4 of the way through i was literally holding myself back from skimming to find out what was going to happen. The lines between good and bad can be sometimes blurred, with the reader never being quite sure who's helping Regal amount to his devious plotting.   If you're looking for a synopsis you can find that on your own. What I offer is the assurance for a worthwhile fantasy, devoid of hackneyed genres and familiar pitfalls, that is neither overwhelming as sometimes can be, or too simplistic.
