 Okay, this game is rather amusing. There's lot to do in arcade style leveling which affects different parts of your pirate life, from swordfighting and drinking games, to shipbuilding. Crews go out on ships for more puzzling fun to collect one of the main sources of income for the game by battling other ships. There's crafting, and different ways to customize your character, and most everyone seems to get into the fun by roleplying pirate style. When I first popped on I couldn't stop laughing at all the people going "Arggg, billions of blue blistering barnacles, yar!!, etc." So it really can be all good fun and the ease of the game is charming.   On the down side, there are quite a few nagging elements. Puzzles can get Veerrrry tedious after a while, especially when you're on a ship puzzling for a captain who like to do long pillaging jaunts. You can leave at any time as long as theres no battle in progress and still get your due, but I do enjoy staying to the end. Thus, it's like how much more tetris style games can you take?  I also realize that with a game called Puzzle Pirates that it probably attracts lots of the younger crowds, although theres still quite a bit of swearing to be found (Dont worry. There is a filter. And a cute option I might add to change swear words to humerous pirate phrases). Never in any other RPG have I ever seen so many adolescent players doing the regular idiotic things, begging for money, being little nimphos, going against game etiquette. So you end up with a lot of fun people to hang out with and unfortunately, an equally large amount of people who do only what the youngest of people playing mmorpg's do best.   Note, And the reason I didnt dock it too many stars: I'm currently playing the downloadable version that allows people a trial period for a few days and then a paid subcription. With the boxed version maybe this will improve, or maybe not.
