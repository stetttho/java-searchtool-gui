 Like many others writing this review, I read this book a long time ago, before I was in my teens even, and I love this book. A decade later I still like to reread this book from time to time. Not only do I get pleausre from the feeling one gets from revisiting a childhood favorite, but it really is set in a wonderfully imaginative world, with a unique fantasy plot and setting. It's an incredibly easy read, which kind of adds to the charm, and I would almost consider it young adult, if not for the adult situations and language. It's probably the only reason I'm rating it 4/5. It's such a unique story with lovely characters, but it's not necessarily the most complex writing I've seen or the deepest development. However, as an avid sci-fi/fantasy reader I would say that Murphy gives other writers I've read a run for their money, especially this being a genre that she isnt recognized for, if recognized at all. Imagine my dismay after reading this book so long ago to find that no, there are no further books to let us explore these characters or world more, but that she doesnt even write fantasy.....she writes about cats. Still, I will always love this book.
