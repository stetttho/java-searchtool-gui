 First off, this isn't a bad book. It's well written and although the characters themselves leave much to be desired, the book can make you think a lot. To make sure I appropriately complain, this book made me so depressed. I'll try not to spoil anything, but the main characters in this novel make you want to give each of them a good [...] kicking. The male focal point is indifferent, abusive, and negligent, while the dear girl is flighty, needy, clingy, and naive, content to spiral into complete self destruction and ruin anything that might be good in her life for the sake of a recurring figure from her past. You spend so much time wanting to see the two for their inner beauty, but you can't help but really hate them and the situations they end up in. However, I think this book is a great representation of relationships where a person is happy to allow themselves to become a pawn and used for what they can offer at a single point in time. If you can stand to read a few hundred pages of frustration to see an author perfectly realize the not so pleasant nature of some human beings, then this is the book for you.
