 I purchased this Lush conditioner against all the mixed reviews, and I have to say I am very pleased with the results.   I didn't really have any of the problems others voiced with this product. I have very thick hair that has a bit of a wave to it. When it arrived it had a musky smell, underlayed with Lush's kind of signature playdo undersmell. In the shower though it smells exotic and heavenly. I kind of swoosh the bar down my hair a few times- DO NOT TRY  rubbing it into your hair like you normally would. It will get tangled. I just stroke it straight down and focus on the ends. A few small chunks usually come off in my hands and I use the excess to finish conditioning my hair. I leave it in for a few minutes while I shave and then rinse it off with hot water. It will not feel slick and goopy like liquid conditioner and you may notice if you're used to a really vigorous rinsing that you may feel a little more tangled than normal. This dissapeared totally once I was out of the shower.   I have noticed my hair is a lot lighter than normal, and the smell is just wonderful.  Overall my experience has been wonderful and I enjoy this so much more than liquid shampoos; I never feel like I've completely rinsed it all off and my hair often feels heavy and gets greasy faster.   I would NOT reccomend this if you have very tangly hair to begin with.  I would NOT reccomend this if you have dry, crispy hair to begin with.   I WOULD recommend this if your hair gets greasy often.  I WOULD reccomend this if your hair usually feels heavy.   Please remember that this is not your normal liquid conditioner, thus it will not work like your normal liquid conditioner. The results are well worth the difference though and it's my new favorite conditioner.
