 She succeeds in yet again producing another quality fantasy novel with so much trash already in the genre. This book concludes the tale of Fitzchivalry, alive and well, bent on getting his life together and revenge on those who should pay. It was like always, beautifully written with real characters and situations.   I've said it before that Hobb can be somewhat of a slow read. She gives highly descriptive accounts and makes what could have been cut down a third of a book into an entire experience by having an answer for everything in this foreign world. Given that, it takes time to get used to her writing, and while it is not the most artful, it is very well done and with great skill. Hobb has a very simple, yet rolling, way to her diologue and descriptions.   None of her characters are perfect, not everyone has happy endings. ****POSSIBLE SPOILER**** Part of the reason I was so bent on finishing the books is because all I wanted to read about was Fitz being celebrated for all his eforts and having the happily ever after he wanted. I could have almost cried. But you have to remember that some of the best books around are those where people learn to grow even when they've experienced the worst of life. It's a very moving tale and one that may take me a while to reread, because I don't know if I want to experience the myriad of emotions I went through reading it anytime soon. Wonderful book.
