 This is the most heavenly skin product I have ever used.   I started using this product a few weeks ago and absolutely love the way it makes my skin feel. It has this light musty jasmine scent. You may not love the smell at first, but honestly it grows on you. I generally put this on after a shower and it feels like it rolls over my skin. Hours later my skin still smells lovely and so smooth.   The great thing about this too is that a very little goes a long way. I keep it in my underwear drawer, but I plan on using this in my laundry and my bedsheets as well.   A note about opening this product: BE VERY CAREFUL. The canister requires you to push in a tab that, if just popped in, will cause powder to get everywear. I take a knife and pry it upward very slowly so I can grab it and pull it out instead of losing it inside the can. Then, I actually keep the top closed when I pour, as sufficent poweder comes out. The holes let out just too much powder.
