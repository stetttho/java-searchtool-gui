 This was my last read of all the Flewelling books. I actually started with the later series first and made my way back. I love her books, I love her writing, I love her characters...........just not in this book. I had to keep reminding myself that these were the same characters from the first two books in the series, so far removed were they from their original surroundings. This book is all about politics and names and words you probably can't pronounce. This in itself usually doesn't bother me, but overall the story fell flat. I think the problem lies in that, as Flewelling states, this isn't meant to be a trilogy. As a standalone novel though, the book falls short too though, although that's how you feel when you read it. If you've read the first two books in this "series" I would suggest just leaving this one alone.
