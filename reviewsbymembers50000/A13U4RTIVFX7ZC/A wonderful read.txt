 If you're a Martin fan for his popular Fire and Ice series, it's difficult to compare his earliest work to his popular fantasy series. The one thing I love about Martin is how his writing is absolutely effortless. Scenery and dialogue are never forced, and his writing is always an absoulte pleasure to fall into. This book has such a meloncholy beauty to it in the way the alien world of Worlon is depicted.  One also has to remember that this is a short story, not a full length novel. As such the characters aren't as 3-D as you might expect from one of his other books. I still feel however, that there was huge character development in comparison to other sci-fi/fantasy short novel's I've read. The inner realizations of the characters are so poignant and subtle that, even given an abrupt ending, I put this book down with a general feeling of "wow, now that's writing."
