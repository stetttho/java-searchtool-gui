      I had heard a lot of promising things about this book and found it be just "okay." The story itself has much promise, and starting off I got myself ready for one of those whirlwind reads. It never even got off the ground. The writing is very bland and undescriptive, filled with chunky, somtimes awkward dialogue. With a story based in what appears to be an alternate reality of our world, there is so much more that could be done with actually desribing the settings and even people, so readers can get a vivid feel for the storyline.      This is tolerable in the first half of the book, but in what should be some of the most exciting parts of the book, I've experienced the most anticlimatic storytelling of my life. It really feels like the author had so much he wanted to include he was just too impatient to actually include fillers for entertainment value. Instead it's and this happens and this happens and this happens, all one right after another, within pages of a few paragraphs of conversation.      And naggingly, but not so important, is the not so subtle context. When dealing with a reality based entirely on things that are very familiar, I found the use of skewing current words and phrases to make new words for this book more than irritating. Ethinicities, simple nouns, languages; the author just kind of adds a letter to the regular spelling to make it new an improved. Either take somethign very familiar and put it on a slant that makes people think, or create something totally off the wall and include what you know.     I realize that this is a young adult book, but honestly I wouldnt have been entertained by this book when I was younger and it wasnt very entertaining now. If its wasnt for the promise this book has I would have probably rated it lower.
