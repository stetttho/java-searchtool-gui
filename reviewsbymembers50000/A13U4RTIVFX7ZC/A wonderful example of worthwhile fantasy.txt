 I don't have words for how much I love this book and the series. Flewelling has brought us a wonderful story from the same world as her Luck series. I finished this book and IMMEDIATELY went to the store to buy the next installment, so enthralled was I in the plotline.  There's a lot of criticism as to the content of this book, that it's the same old rehashed fantasy stigmas. I agree that this isn't the most oringal story every written, but it is definately one of the best I've read in a long while. Rather than shoving the fantasy down your throat, Flewelling makes it more of a subtle backdrop,integral to the story but not detracting from it like happens in other books. People don't get new powers left and right, and we don't have the steroetypical mage/archer/swordsman etc. technique that Flewelling is even guilty of in her first series.  Instead this story is very well written and flows extremely well. I found myself caring for a lot of the characters, even the ones who were on the opposing force. Flewelling pays a lot of attention to details, which I think really makes or breaks a book. The reason there are so many poorly written, rehashed fantasy books out there is because so many people think they can take the same combo and mix their own plot line in, without planning for well written dialogue, the right touch of description, and decent storytelling.This book has all of that and more. It's merely storytelling at its finest.
