 I honestly thought I was going to have to give this one a lower star rating. Upon receiving this item in the mail, I dove right in. The one drawback that immediately hit me was the smell. It basically smells like mint toothpaste. I knew it was going to be minty, just not quite so minty. So I smoothed some on and rubbed it up to my ankles. The sensation was very cool and I was surprised how oily and slippery my feet were. I'm used to most feet creams sinking in and kind of dissapearing.   So, my initial thought was pleasant, but kind of wierd. Now I have to say though, that as a soother and moisterizer it works great. My feet are are very soft and it works at the rough parts of me feet very well. I'm excited to try this with an exfoliater of some sort.   I took away one start for the toothpaste smell, but really this is an awesome product. In the summer I'll probably keep this stuff in the fridge. I imagine it would feel great when really really cold after a long day of work!
