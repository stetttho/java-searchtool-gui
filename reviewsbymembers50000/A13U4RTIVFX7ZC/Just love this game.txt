 I got dragged into playing this game for the word preview event and absolutey love it. I ran right out an bought the presale package so I could play the beta events too. This game is a lot of fun. It has storylines, missions, pvp in two different arena type games, and even some armor weapon crafting. The basis, of course, is competing with a rated guild and engaging in a capture the flag type combat with other guilds, where teamwork is emphasized. However, if you feel like guild stuff isn't your thing you can go out adverturing solo. And for those who KNOW that going out alone might get you killed but you still don't like working with others, you can HIRE OUT, healers, rangers, warriors, elementalists, etc, to give you a hand in the field!! And finally, if you think you'll miss out on the pvp by not having a guild, you can go solo in a random entry arena where you are pitted against another random, and possibly uncoordinated, team.   I love this game and can't wait till the next beta event. The graphics are pretty decent and surprisingly enough, I can actually run it on my 5 year old computer with no problems and a cable modem connection. I can almost never do this with the latest rpg games. I wouldn't suggest this game to anyone running on much less than that, though. People with dialup connections tend to spawn so late in the pvp arenas that they're dead as soon as they appear. Overall though, I highly suggest this game. It allows to you to enjoy the game and allows character progression even if you don't have 7 hours a day to play, which you sometimes need with other mmorpgs.
