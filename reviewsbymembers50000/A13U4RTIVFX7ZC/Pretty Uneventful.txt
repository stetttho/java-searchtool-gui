 Like many others, I picked this book up because it was touted as a worthwhile example of both fiction and high fantasy. Now I must say it has all the elements and it has some high points, But I was bored out of my mind reading this book.   This story revolves around Thomas Covenant, a lonely leper in our world who is transported to another and finds himself set against the evil Lord foul. There are some neat characters and, for its time, races and animal types. However, the archtypes are old and worn out, even at that point. And a story based on a ring of power??? Come one. Characters overall we kind of flat and I can always feel the difference between being "in" the story and just reading the story.   The part of the book I liked the most was Covenant's slow descent into the foreign world. It takes him a long time to come to terms with it all, as for more than half the book he truly believes it's a dream. Therefore he does some unsavory things early in the book and realizes he's been really horrible to everyone from the beginning. I enjoyed that Covenant seemed confused and out of place, especially dealing with his disease and new surroundings. Isn't that how it would really be?   However, often times the text seemed disorganized and dialogue forced. Covenant has so much internal monologue going on that it takes a while to realize that someone doesn't emote than much in their head. i.e. Donaldson makes him shout/gasp/hiss/faint/everyting under the sun; and all with internal thought.   Also, even though I can see why the rape scene could be necessary to the emotional development of the character later in the book, I hadn't even read to the end and there were accounts of women falling all over him in a very stomach-turning way. I didn't find that enjoyable at all.   All in all, tolerable.
