 I recently purchased a bunch of lush products having neither seen nor heard about the line before. I was interested in the reviews I read online and wanted to try out a few.   Upon first glance the quantities are small and they all kind of had a base fragrance that kind of smelled like playdo. (After you use them though, the individual scent comes out.)  I've been using this on my face though and it has made such a difference. I have slight combinattion skin, running from oily to dry in the T-Zone. My actualy skin quality is pretty bad as I have a lot of little bumps, imperfections and some areas of my skin where it just looks "blah"   I used this on my face before I went to bed and when I woke up I could immediately notice a difference. It smeemed to have sloughed off the dead skin better than grittier soaps and scrubs. My skin was soft and looked like I had used a really good toner on it. The quality just looked much better. And really, I have to say again, it was very soft.   As far as use is concerned: the product comes in a little plastic container. It kind of smells like playdo-y oatmeal. I took the tiniest pea-sized amount and ran it into water and then rubbed it around on my damp face. It actually spreads pretty far, lathers a little, and you'll notice it leaves little flecks of seeds and such on your face. It feels like you're rubbing dry playdo on your face until it smooshes around a bit. In the mornings I put on a very very light moisturizer, so I haven't had problems with drying out at all, but I'm not sure how it would be without.   Overall I highly recommend this product if you want to try something a little different. I've noticed a definite difference to my face without all the drying and over-oily affects I get from normal soaps.
