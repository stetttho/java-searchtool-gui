 Words don't describe how much I loved this book. This book is a little heavier a read than the first one, as it deals more with transitioning the main character to her new role. It still, however is extremely well written and enjoyable. It has some laggy parts, more in part for me because there were some characters that Flewelling thought needed to be explored and I just didn't care about. Overall this is one of my favorite series. I couldn't wait to see how the plot played out and I can't wait for the third.
