 This is the first book by Tad Williams that I've read. I'm thinking maybe it was a poor choice because I was really unimpressed. There was really no one thing wrong with the story, I thought Mr. Williams had an interesting storyline going on for him with and imaginitive world and creatures. However, I never became attached to any of the characters and just couldn't get involved in the story. I found myself skipping huge chunks of descriptive story just to see if I could get to something more interesting. Overall it fell flat.
