 The one thing you have to understand about Carey, whether or not you can appreciate the story or relate to her characters; the woman knows how to write. Kushiel's Dart is such fun to read, so effortless, that I went back and reread it before giving it a rating. I absolutely love Carey's style, which is extremely elaborate, with a rich setting and detailed characters.   I understand this book isnt for everyone and I have a few warning's for people before they pick up this book. Understand first that this book deals with highly adult material that is very explicit in parts. However, I dont see how people reading the jacket could have been surprised when reading the book. Also, Carey's main character's have what some author's tend to fall on, which is super hero syndrom. They're pretty much perfect in every way so don't expect to see the harsh realities of human nature in this novel. And finally, Carey's writing style is quite poetic, a little flouncy, tending to forshadow often, but immensley detailed. None of these detracted for me however for the book. It's fantasy and I love it to death =)
