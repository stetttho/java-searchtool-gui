 Murray's book "The Conquest" follow's two women's lives and the experiences they have. One is a present day woman (Sara) finding difficulty choosing between her love of mysterious ancient manuscripts and that of a man, while the other is the focus of Sara's intellectual obsession; an Aztec woman who finds herself in Europe after the massacre of her people, and how she deals with desires of the body and revenge.   While I can say I enjoyed this book, the pace wasn't quite what I look for. It's not exactly a page turner, but there is interest enough to keep the story moving. My problem lies in the motivations and background of each woman. One bent on revenge who the next moment forgets her plans on a whim? and the other finding what truly makes her happy out of life and ends up sending some mixed messages about the past and present along the way.   It was a good read. It flowed well and I found the fictional experiences entertaining. However I don't know that it will be that memorable of a book which I'll remember a month from now.
