 Hamilton needs to work on being consistant. I fell in love with the first book in this Meredith series, the first ever of any Hamilton book I had read. Second book was pretty good too. Then I went back and started on her Anita Blake books- upon which I was horrified at the trash that she had produced and succeeded with numerous sequals. In fact, I kept buying the ridiculously priced($8 for 200something pages)in the hopes that somewhere I would find the Hamilton that I enjoyed. I finally  quit realizing the series wasn't going anywhere. AND UNFORTUNATELY, the latest installment in the fairy series smacks of just that. The book doesn't go anywhere. Towards the end of the book you realize that only two days have passed in the last couple hundred pages. It's not even the gratuitous sex. I don't mind that. This was just pages on pages of junk, and I had to keep reading back because instantaneously, with POOR EXPLANATION, someone would get new powers, or something strange would happen. About 50 pages before the end of the book, things start to get good. My recommendation for readers is to pick it up only if you're a loyal Hamilton fan, and my recommendation for the writer would be that(although I love some of her work very much) she should be less concerned on quantity and pace and more on quality. I've been waiting 4 years for the latest book in one of my author' series. I don't mind a bit, because I know in that space of time, something great is happening. And my $20+ will go toward a novel that can't be confused with the writing quality of a POORLY written romance novel.
