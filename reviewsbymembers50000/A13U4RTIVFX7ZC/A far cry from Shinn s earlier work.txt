 As a standalone novel Angel Seeker is a pretty good romance novel. I'm a fan of well written romance novels that have an actual plot and a bit of a spin on the old genre.   However, this is a far cry from Shinn's original series. Her Samaria series was interesting, creative, and smacked enough of sci-fi/fantasy to be labeled as such. Ths had just a little too much fluff and all I can really label it as is a comfort book. The book gets extra points for keeping me interested, but it literally dropped the ball in the last four chapters or so. There was so much buildup that it rushed the outomes of these characters' relationships and really cheapened even my beginning interest in the novel. We waited hundreds of pages to see the outcomes of the main characters and this is what you give us? Relationships just fall flat and there's a really lousy wrap up to the end of the novel. A better conclusion would have shown both girls and the new bond they may have formed through all their ordeals. It would have tied the story together very well.   Most blaringly is the absence of any of the mystery that surrounded the first books. I realize that the general populous doesn't know the truth behind Samaria, but why make no reference to any of it at all? At one point there is a slight reference to the oracles at Mt. Sinai, and then Shinn runs away from it as though she knows she doesn't even want to go there. Shinn had really spent a lot of effot creating religion and history in her past novels. There is none of this in that. I would go into more detail about this, but I don't want to give away any spoilers to anyone who hasn't read those books yet.   I understand that it's easy to give 5 stars to a fluffy romance that might have been enjoyable, but this really wasn't up to par or even in the same category as her previous books.
