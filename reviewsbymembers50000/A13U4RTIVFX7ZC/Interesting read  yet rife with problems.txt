 I did enjoy this book for the sheer entertainment value. I can't say I didn't take pleasure in reading about lurid sorority details. I'm currently living away from home at a college that doesn't permit greek organizations so take that for what you will. However, I agree with some others in how the book really comes off as stretching the truth to some of the situations. Sure, college girls go out and party and pregame, but the 'conversations" that were quoted appear entirely rediculous. Some of the explanatory comments that supposedly came out of these girls mouths were formed in a way that I rarely ever hear girls speak. I would be less surprised to see Robbins quoting the girls as "yah know, like, sororities are cool." That would be a more accurate representation than the masters level skill at which these girls tried to prove their opinions about sororities.    My other big problem is that this is supposed to be a truthful story. The way the text reads is "Sabrina felt like her world was crumbling, she felt so sad."," Amy couldn't see how someone could that do that to her"......well, how does Robbins get this exact pinpoint of the girls emotions. It reads way more like fiction than it should and I have a hard time believing half of the commentaries aren't biased and untruthful.   Entertaining, but I suggest picking it up at the library and not taking it too seriously.
