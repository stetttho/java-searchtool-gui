 Like many people, I have some mixed emotions. To get the record straight, I really enjoyed this book! I thoroughly enjoyed it and it's one of those books I end up reading till 4 in the morning so I can finish it. The characters are fun, if not entirely original, and it was like a jolly romp through Flewelling's world.   From another perspective, I can see how people criticize her "hit em over the head" approach to writing in her frsit novels. It lacks some of the finesse that I would require of a book with this potential, and like I've seen others point out, we're expected to believe kind of whaterver she throws at us as plausible.......like the folding longbows. Thus certain areas in the book you can see where Flewelling loses her grasp on the material because she might not be as able as in other areas. On the bright side though, I laughed quite often in this book. Some of the dialogue is very funny.   As a note on the series, I'm not a big fan. The first book is the best because the characters are new. For me, everything else goes downhill from there. I found my interest in the characters waned as the stories continued.    Also, I much more enjoyed her later Tamir series because they are much better edited and organized than in this series. The Luck Series being her first couple of published books I'd say it's an entertaining good start.
