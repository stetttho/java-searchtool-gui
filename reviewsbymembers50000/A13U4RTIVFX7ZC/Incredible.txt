 What an incredible read! Definately an all night page-turner to say the least. I'm not going to bother expanding on the premise of the story, you can read the plot in the blurb yourself. The book is a little Martin-esque. It follows multiple characters, jumping back and forth between chapters and giving a wonderfully detailed description for each person's story and plot. Sometimes with stories like these there's always a character you dread when you get to it because you find it less interesting than others, and know you'll have to trudge through it to get to the good stuff. To my wonderful surprise I enjoyed everything and every chapter. Even better the book has a nice intricate history and lore, and even though some of the court politics may be a little predicatble this is a solid 5 stars for me. I'll be picking up the sequal ASAP.
