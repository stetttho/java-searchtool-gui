 I wanted to try this product despite mixed reviews on Lush's own website. It is different from your typical gel or foam shaving cream. It comes out of the bottle more like moisturizer and spread on like it seeps into the skin.   It took me a couple of days to get used to this. You can't see where the shaving cream has been or where you last shaved due to the non-foaming or gel issue. On first appearances the product doesn't seem that much better than normal shaving cream, however after a few weeks of using I have to say I can see a difference.   It takes maybe a little more practice to get a closer shave but it is absolutely great for shaving my underarm and bikini areas where I used to get a lot of little red bumps and ingrown hairs. I don't get razor burn AT ALL any more and the texture of my skin no longer feels ragged or sore sometimes. It is great for sensitive skin.   The only drawbacks are that it wasn't as great for my legs, as since I couldn't get the close close shave I wanted I needed to shave more often with it. Secondly I have to say that for the price the size is awfully small. As much as I love this shaving cream I feel bad using it as I don't want it to run out. Although, like many Lush products, I have a feeling it probably lasts longer than you would expect.   Overall, a definiate pleasure using and worth the money.
