 I have read both this book and the the first installment in Caine's Weather Warden series. I have to say I enjoyed both, although I think I prefer the Ill Wind a little more.   This book takes off where the last one ended, exploring the main character's life from her new Djinn status. No sooner does she start learning about new powers and the difficulties controlling them, then a new nemesis appears and it's time to do battle again.   Most of what I enjoyed in this book were elements that were present from the first novel; Tough,independent woman fiction with a little steamy fanservice. I still enjoy the fact that there is some cleverly placed humor and constantly keeps your attention.   My problem with this novel is that it really could have been written with a little more respect for the genre. The dangerous "sparklies" are placed with no explanation of what they are or where they come from. We learn towards the end of the book that there was a previous occurance of these sparklies; however, nothing more than that. Description and events are vague at best, and sometimes I reread to make sure I hadn't missed something-which it turns out I hadn't. The book is really rushed through, as though to just hit the page mark and publishing deadline. The characters could have been much more dynamic, characters could have explored much more personal struggle, and it could have turned into what I like to consider a REAL sci-fi fantasy novel.....with some real meat in it.   On the plus side though I can almost picture it as a comic cartoon or movie. If that's what she was going for then it's great, but it seems to almost be slipping in the Meredith Gentry series, where each successive novel becomes more and more erratic, giving in to shock value and soft porn to keep people interested.   I'm on the fence with this one. It's fun reading, but not memorable.
