 I picked up this book on a whim and was surprised at the fast paced romp inside the pages. This is not literary masterpeice, with heavily developed characters and thoughtfully laid out plot lines. I can say it's a whole lot of fun though.   I can recommend this book to anyone looking for a fun and easy read. I literally tore through the pages of this book. The main character is a strong and an over-the-top independent woman who likes her cars, men, and mayber herself just a little too much. A lot of the characters are predictable and over-used, but in this context I really didn't mind. Caine has a way of giving readers exactly what they want in a story. I had to admire some of the humor that was carefully placed and how she veered from using the same hackneyed expressions so many other authors use.   The only really big drawback was that many parts of the book coudln't be explained, nor did Caine even bother to try. She goes into great detail in some areas, but leaves herself wide open for a lot of questions in others.    Overall though, it was very enjoyable. I highly recommend picking this one up.
