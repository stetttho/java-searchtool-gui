 I'm a recent convert to Lush products and I have to say I'm thrilled to find this new shampoo.   I started using this a couple of days ago and I've noticed a positive difference in my hair. My hair wasn't a total mess using silicone shampoos, but now that I've changed brands I can see the potential my hair had and I didn't even know it.   I have shoulder length really thick hair with a few waves and curls. I don't have too much of a problem with tangling to begin with. All I needed was a couple of swipes down my hair and this will lather right up. It smells awesome in the shower. Lush describes it as oranges in a bowl of spices; I'm not so sure about that but it definately smells kind of foresty and nice. It rinsed off very well with hot water and I followed with Jungle conditioner.   Hours later in the day I can stil smell Komba shampoo wafting around my head. It's amazing. I've never had a shampoo stick with me like this and my hair feels light and shiny and just clean. No matter how much I try to clean regular shampoo from my hair it seems to weigh it down. My boyfriend mentioned today my hair looked much less "poofy". This is just amazing.   I would reccomend keeping the shampoo in an airtight container. Keeping it on a shelf where any water will hit it will deteriorate its longevity. I keep mine in a very tiny tupperwear container in the shower. The size of the bar is small, but it will go a loooooong way.
