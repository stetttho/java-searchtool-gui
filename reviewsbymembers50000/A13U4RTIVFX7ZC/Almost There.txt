 I'm reviewing this book on the first novel alone, as I understand that many people are considering the duo when casting their votes. I loved the concept of this novel. The characters, situations, landscapes, etc. were all very original and wonderfully created. I saw so much potential and was naggingly dissapointed about some major things throughout the book. The main character in the novel is supposed to be a young, beautiful, twenty something woman. She reads like she's ten. The idea is that she never really had a personality or true character before she is brought over to a new world. Thus, her past reads very flat and we're expected to believe that she's never been kissed, never looked at another man and thought he was attracted, and for all her obvious beauty, not a single person on the street ever looked at her. This is all supposed to go hand in hand with the new feeling of purpose she has upon her mirror crossing. I don't care, I just kept wanting to either smack my head in frustration or smack her for being an idiot. I can't decide. My other beef: conversations and inner monologues seem very forced and unrealistic, but at other times don't seem to have a problem.    Overall though........I do enjoy the story for its sheer originality and the fact that Donaldson only has momemnts that don't detract from the whole book.
