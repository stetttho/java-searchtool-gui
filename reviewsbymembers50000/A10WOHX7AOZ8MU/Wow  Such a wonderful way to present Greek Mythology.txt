 I first became enthralled with Greek Mythology when I was 6 years old, after hearing my uncle tell me about it. I received this book as a present in 1995 during my second grade, and read it through and through multiple times...It was left to dust on my bookshelf for years until the summer after I finished 9th grade. I was required to read a collection of greek myths for my incoming sophomore Honors Humanities class. I knew I had a great book already, and while I had fun reading this book, my friends labored through pictureless novels of 400 pages+. And yet I got the highest grade on our quiz on our reading during the first day of school. :) great read~
