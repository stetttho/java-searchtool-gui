 This music is so enlightening! That is the first impression I get from listening to this cd. The lyrics and guitar are so light, they seem to float by gently. The overall tone is so unassuming, it seems like it would fit well into background music of any movie (and it already has in "In Good Company" and "Garden State"). The CD is the truly a breath of fresh air. In comparison to some pretentious loud jangly music, "our endless numbered days" is a relief. Yes the music is quite and can fade into the background, but that is just what I was looking for in this CD. You don't sing out loud and rock to it, you lay outside and read a book, or eat breakfast, or talk to a friend....
