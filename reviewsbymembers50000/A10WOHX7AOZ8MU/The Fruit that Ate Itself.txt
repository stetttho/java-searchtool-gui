 This CD is less refined and genius tha their actual first released CD "this is a long drive..."...It is more primitive (i mean, there are THREE untitled songs), yet still a pretty little piece...and it is less boldly a "Modest Mouse" cd. but this is their original work and their later which stemmed makes this CD better than it might have otherwise been. I'll just say it's a good thing they didnt stop here. (it deserves maybe 3.5 stars). but because of my biased devotion, i give 5
