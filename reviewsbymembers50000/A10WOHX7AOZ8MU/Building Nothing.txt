 Well Modest Mouse experiments with their sound quite often, and this is one of their pinnacles of lyrical genius...It is not the broodiest or funkiest of the spectrum (moon and antarctica to lonesome crowded west get those titles), it is a wonderful middle ground, with great lyrics such as Never Ending Math Equation. Doin the cockroach is a grody picture to your mind, but a great song to your ears
