 Sigur Rs really is a special band. I discovered them a few years ago after watching the terrific movie "Vanilla Sky". Their song at the end of the movie really captured and highlighted the transcendental, heavenly, and elated mood at the end of the movie. Sigur Rs consistently manages to set this very atmosphere at any given time.   Along with only a select few albums this year, I anticipated the release of Takk..., and bought it the first day it was released. Oh boy. The album starts off perfectly, just teasing you for what is to come with the first title track. Then, Glsli  begins, in a floating blend of delicate sounds, finally exploding in a big bang of electric guitar. I knew the album would not disappoint. Besides the Glsli , Hopppolla, Sglpur, Gong, and Heystan are amazing, ethereal tracks. Yet, the other songs are completely essential as well. They serve as beautiful transitions and need not be skipped.   Sigur Rs's back catalogue is admirably good as well. Looking for more of the experience, I looked to "similar" bands like Mogwai, Mum, and Godspeed You Black Emperor. Though these albums have their sonic climaxes, they often sound meandering, unfocused, boring, and annoying at times. I don't really need more bands like this anyway. I can (and have) listen to Takk... all the time without tiring of it. Sigur Rs is king at this type of music.   I really can't see how anyone could not like this album, unless they are just too engrossed in the mainstream to value this music. Either way, this is definitely one my favorites, A Best Album of 2005
