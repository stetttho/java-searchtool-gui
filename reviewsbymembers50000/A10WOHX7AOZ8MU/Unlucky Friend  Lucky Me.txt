 My roommate and I are Bright Eyes fans, not diehard, but quite fond of earlier CD's which we found to be lyrically great (Lifted of the story.., fevers and mirrors)...So when Bright Eyes was going to release 2 CDs at once, we were pretty enthralled. But being college students (and therefore slightly short of cash) I decided that I would buy "I'm wide awake" and he would buy "Digital Ash"...Then we could listen to both.  Well I am glad that luck was in my favor, because "Digital ash" is unlike bright eyes I have known. THey go for the Postal Service electronica style, but whereas "Give Up" is a pleasant if unexciting CD, it is more than listenable. To be harsh this CD is almost egregious to the point that it gets little to no playing time in our doorm.  If you want to get into Bright Eyes though, get some of the earlier CDs. I loved "Lifted" and "fevers", and to a lesser extent "Im wide awake". Not digital ash.
