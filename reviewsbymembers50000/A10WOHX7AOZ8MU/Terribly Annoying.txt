 I thought "what you waiting for" was an incredibly fun and catchy song, so i thought i might like gwen... then come her other "hit songs"...hollaback girl is effin annoying, as is rich girl, and everything else that comes out of her mouth.  What happened to only good singers getting famous? voice doesnt even matter anymore
