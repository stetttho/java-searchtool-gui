 Modest Mouse explores vast regions of music style while still maintaing a completely, unarguably unique "modest mouse" sound. This CD i would have to say is their most peaceful, elegant, brooding...it seems like outdoorsy songs, "3rd planet" for a cold rainy day, "Gravity Rides everything" for a sunny day, "Dark Center of the universe" for gray skies. I don't know how they manage to stretch themselves so much and pull it off so wonmderfully but they do. Lucky us.  + this has the bonus tracks live from bbc :)
