 To show example of Hawthorne Heights's main audience, I'll post a 5-star review given on this site for this cd: "This is one of the best cd's i have in my collection and i have a ton all the way from green day to good charlotte and Hawthorne is awesome I Love the song NIKI FM and anyone who insultes Hawthorne doesnt know anything about good music so um.. Ya!! Hawthorne is AWSOME everyone should own this CD!"  Um Ya! So basically for the "hard-core" punk sk8er girl with a collection all the way from GC to Greenday (since pop-punk to even worse pop-punk is such a broad variety of musical taste) this is the perfect CD to proudly tote around. The screaming on this sounds like the screamer might barf any second after his lines are over. The cliche emo lyrics "so cut my wrists and black my eyes" are hard to even take seriously, they are that overdone. Their self-mutilation may have been inflicted after hearing their own voices on CD perhaps? (Yes I am being brutal), but this is an embarrassing attempt of a harcore/screamo/emo/punk/poseur goth(or at least i want to be)CD.
