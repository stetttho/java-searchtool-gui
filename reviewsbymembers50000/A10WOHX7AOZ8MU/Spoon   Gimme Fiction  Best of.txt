 Spoon is turning into a real band. In all seriousness, I think they are on their way to becoming Indie Rock legends, with the likes of Pixies, Wilco, and My Bloody Valentine. After the great "A Series of Sneaks", the excellent "Girls Can Tell", and the even better "Kill the Moonlight", "Gimme Fiction" is actually the best. Not many bands can claim four strong albums at a pretty young age.  Along with Illinois, Plans, and Takk..., I anticipated this album before its released, and just had to buy it they day it came out. I could tell from the very first song, "The beast and dragon, adored", that I was going to like the album. The song is packed start to finish with excellent tracks. The vocals, guitar and instrumental work (even the jagged riffs sound harmonious), and writing are up to Spoon's best level yet.   "I Turn My Camera On" has a definite swagger unlike anything we've heard from Britt Daniels before. The classic-sounding "Beast and Dragon, Adored", "Monsieur Valentine", "Sister Jack", and my favorite "The Infinite Pet" are other highlight tracks...although, none of the songs need be skipped over. For me, Gimme Fiction is hands-down the best rock album released in 2005, from a veteran band that happens to be amazing in live concert.  Keep up the good work, Spoon. I'll make sure to buy their next album ASAP as well A Best Album of 2005
