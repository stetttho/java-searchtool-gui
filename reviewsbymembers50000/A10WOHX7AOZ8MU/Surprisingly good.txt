 I am surprised at my rating. . . BUt their music is so fun, pop-rock at its best. It isnt mindless catchy melodies like most pop. The music has heartfelt lyrics, (work is a great song), to songs you can scream along to (pain). Given I was completely annoyed by "The Middle" and most stuff on their first cd, I didnt expect this. Work is a wonderfully awesome song as is pain, futures, 23, and more. I wouldnt say this is for a certain crowd, but if you like having fun with an upbeat rock-pock record, buy this.  BTW I saw this band in concert with Taking Back Sunday who I would more closely align myself musically too...but Jimmy Eat World overshadowed them!
