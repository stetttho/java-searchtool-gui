 Death Cab's 2003 release of "Transatlanticism" was monumental. The CD was unequivocally focused, vocally cool, lyrically beatiful, and musically sound. How the album manages to average anything less than 5 stars is beyond me. The wonder of Death Cab is nothing new. They have always been a good band. "The Photo Album" to "Transatlanticism" was a bridge between a good and an amazing album, respectively. "Plans" does not reivent the band's talent, though it, at the very least, reaffirms it. Compared to Transalanticism, Plans is less unified. It does not convey a singe, unified message. Another difference is the sound. Plans focuses on a deep, reverberant sound explored similarly by artists like Frou Frou/Imogen Heap. As it is for such musical style, you will need a good audio system to fully appreciate the depth (as stated in another review). Lyrically, Ben is just as competent as he has always been. If you liked any of Death Cab for Cutie's first 5 albums, you will like this one more. If you liked their 6th album (transatlanticism), then you will have already bought "Plans" since you realized what a masterpiece the band had created in their prior album.  sidenote: Some have been concerned about a dumbed-down mainstream album succeeding the band's major label signing. The label has in no way noticeably changed the Death Cab style. On the contrary, the seamless production of the album adds a depth that the pre-transatlanticism albums didn't have. Indie rockers and OC groupies enjoy!
