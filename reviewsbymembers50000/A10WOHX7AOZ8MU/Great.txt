 Without rehashing what's already been said I will simply leave you to discover this fantastic CD by yourself. After seeing them perform live in concert with the Killers (whom I dont like very much) I was hooked. They were so sweet on stage, and their cD reminds me of seeing them. A good CD through and through when you are on a car ride looking for something that wont put you to sleep
