 The only reason I heard of Action Action was because a friend of mine took me to a concert where they opened.  Afteward, I bought the CD from the booth outside for $12. It was autographed, and really, really bright. As has been noted, this band is not original. They are, however, pretty "cool". Though the artists look the part, Action Action is not "emo" in its mood or lyrics. Like The Killers, The Bravery, Duran Duran, etc, the band is more a punk/poptronica band.  Standout songs include: this year's fashion, Druglike (my favorite), Photograph, Instructions on building a model airplane, dont cut your fabric, the short weekend begins with a longing. Yes I realize that is almost half the CD.  Anyway, the CD is worth buying though it definitely is more for a punk teen kid crowd. I give 3.5/5 stars.
