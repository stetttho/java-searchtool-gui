 Wooooow. I did not know what I was missing in Okkervil River until just a few months ago, when I read about them on Popmatters.com (their best of 2005 list). I would say I have to agree with them on their praise.   This band is awesome. Realllly, it is such a gooooooood band, what else can I say? "Black Sheep Boy" is a masterwork of solid rock tunes, with a touch of folk twang here, and a hint of "emo" softness there.   Though the first four songs are my favorite, none of the album lets down. This band is sure to offer more great albums in the future, and "Black Sheep Boy" is one of the best recent releases. Listen to it yourself, reading through these reviews will really just waste some listening time.   A Best Album of 2005
