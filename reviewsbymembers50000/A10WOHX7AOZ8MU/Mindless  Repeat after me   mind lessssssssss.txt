 Ever heard of hedonism?  For the sake of entertainment, and at the expense of our human dignity and intellectual potential. Ugh.  I'm not sure where this falls exactly on a list, but I know I could think of at least 500,000 better things to do than watch this or any "Jackass" stunts.  Given the embarrassingly numerous 5-star ratings (which imply "best ever" by the way) you would assume the movie is flawless. Is it just me or does barf-inducing, gross-out, disturbing behavior not qualify as a flaw these days?
