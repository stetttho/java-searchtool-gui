 I know everyone (everyone) has the need to put out a christmas album. Nobody wants them!  The cover is cute, but who wants to pay normal CD price for such a half-assed attempt at another CD. It shouldnt even be numbered the OC mix 3 because it misleads one into thinking it is a mix of good songs that the others contain. At a brief 28  minutes, the disc isnt even long enough to play while decorating the christmas tree.
