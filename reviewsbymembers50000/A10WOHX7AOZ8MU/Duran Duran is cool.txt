 So this is from where The Killers, The Bravery, Action Action, and all the new-wave electronica/synth pop of today draw their influences.  Great fun. :)  In my opinion, this band isnt more of a "hidden treasures" band, where their little-known songs are greatest. I have heard most of the work, and since this is a pop band, the catchy ones work best. Thus, the catchy hits they produce are their best, so this CD is the best pick.
