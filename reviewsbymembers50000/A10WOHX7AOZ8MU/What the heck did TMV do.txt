 As has been said, why the hell did TMV waste their talent like this?  Deloused was AMAZINGAMAZINGAMAZING! Their wailing rock was so emotional and heatfelt, the prog adding originality and experimentalism to their whole idea. It was a real CD, a great CD.  Frances the Mute seems a half-assed attempt to please the label by releasing some bull**** that posers and pretend fans will eat up.  This is my guess of how the cd was made...Spend a day writing a moving song, the Mars Volta style everyone loves...Well, we don't have to write that much, just a basic verse or two with a hook that we can repeat...Then leave the computer on and play with the sound to see what creepy effects we can make for the remaining 20 minutes of the song.  THe widow is an ok song on its own. The first half has some good rock to it. But who wants to spend the leftover 3 minutes listening to some electronic wailing noises which you might expect to hear as a soundtrack to a haunted house.  I won't give up that easy on a band with this much talent though, so while Mars volta remains high in my book, they really are cutting it close. Dont buy this CD< buy deloused
