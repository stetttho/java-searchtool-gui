 I bought this album on a whim. I liked the cover art...Well, besides that, the release from the mostly-Canadian Arts  Crafts label enticed me. Truly, this is one of my favorite labels, representing such great artists as Broken Social Scene, Feist, The American Analog Set, and of course, Stars.   The first song on this album is amazing. It would fit perfectly at the climax of any romance movie. The orchestral beauty and lovely vocals by Amy Millan make this song a masterpiece. Stars manages to blend male and female vocalists seamlessly, most noticeably on this first track. Other highlights include the etheral "Ageless Beauty" (a bit reminiscent of My Bloody Valentine), "The Big Fight", "Celebration Guns", and "Calendar Girl". Unlike many pop bands, Stars has good vocalists. Along with this, the pleasant instrumentation and occasional synthesizers make this album completely listenable and inoffensive.   There are some tracks that don't keep the momentum of this album. I really think they could have been a bit more selective with the songs they put on this disc. Despite the skipper tracks, I do love this album. They are not revolutionaries, but they do pop music at its best. Fans of Death Cab for Cutie, or Arts & Crafts supporters will find a lot to appreciate in "Set Yourself on Fire"
