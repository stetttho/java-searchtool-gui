 The great thing about Modest Mouse is that they change their style so constantly, yet unequivocally maintain the music that makes them modest mouse. They range from the consistently brooding Moon and Antarctica, the psychadelic Lonesome Crowded West, the lyrically genius Building Nothing out of Something, and a mix of all three This CD i would consider a "sampler" since it draws from different Modest Mouse cd's...A more varied CD, and good for a fan to test out to see if they will like modest mouse.
