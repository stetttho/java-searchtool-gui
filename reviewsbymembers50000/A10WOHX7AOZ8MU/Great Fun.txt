       Interesting that most of this album's criticism comes from it being 'popular' and 'mainstream'. Similar artists who sound pretty much the same receive less bashing...If it is really about the music, than mainstream should have nothing to do with popularity. Indie kids hold dear their esoteric music, and turn from it when it gains popularity and loses its obscure luster. I too scrunched my nose at The Killers at first. Their first two singles, "Somebody Told Me" and "Mr. Brightside" were annoying to me. I found that the album has better songs to offer than their biggest hits; standouts include "Jenny was a friend of mine", "Smile Like You Mean it", and "All These things that I've done" are SOLID and very fun pieces of synth pop-rock...Think Duran Duran tuned up and modernized a notch. Now that radios have turned 'brightside' and 'somebody..' off of repeat, I have come to enjoy these songs more as well. The first 5 songs on the album are a powerhouse of exciting and catchy and dance-worthy and sing along rock. The remainder of the album is nothing to scoff at. The songs are well enough on there own. In fact, they would be quite worthy pieces on their own, their downfall is in the comparison of the first 5 powerhouse singles. At 45 minutes of individually worthy tracks, the album is well worth buying as a whole. The album loses one star, since albums I associate with 5-stars are more than catchy; they are lyrically significant and superior to the songwriting of this album.
