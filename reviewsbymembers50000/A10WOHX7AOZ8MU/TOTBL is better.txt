 Turn on the bright lights to me seemed to have a more moody, dark soulful feel. Besides this it was Interpol's first full length album and more fresh and original. I actually believe that Antics feels different than the first, more catchy melodies than haunting bass riffs and monotone. Whereas TOTB works best as a whole (it doesnt have really standout songs, they just all sound good), this CD has "single-worthy songs". Next Exit is a good opener, and just a good of a song as any on TOTB Evil is a GREAT song. I would say that this works best of all interpol songs (over my second favorite even, specialist), blending their symbolic/haunting lyrics, deep bass tones, and catchy melodies. This song is highly similar to their other work, but its quicker feel makes it more catchy and memorable (and probably the most memorable on the cd). Even the video for this song is awesome Slow Hands is a good song, another upbeat Interpol song that works out well while maintaing their unique style C'Mere is my second favorite song on the album, and has a cool new video  INterpol has a great style from their fashion sense, liberal use of red-white-black, and unmistakable voice. BUy this cd together with TOTBL for the full Interpol effect...if you have heard one of their songs and liked it, chances are you will like both cds since they dont stray far from their great formula
