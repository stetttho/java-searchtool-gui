 Ok, Modest Mouse has changed...I dont give a rip/////  But, I do care about this new, idk "MTVness" that has Float on (an otherwise ok song but by no means great) on constant repeat. I hear the beginning beats and then drums of Float on and cringe. Hey, this is my FAVORITE band, i shouldnt be cringing! darn radio  Anyway, there is this "rocker/alt/indie/im badass/emo/ girl at my school, who made fun of me for turning up the radio when "ocean breathes salty" came on...she's like, "im sure you just love all these radio songs. you haven't heard anything good from modest mouse"...her "support" was the non-radio songs from Good News, and Moon and Antarctica. She didnt even know modest mouse had more than two cds. I just laughed.  But I will continue to love this band even if doing so has become slightly more difficult as of late. Its about the music anyway  favorite songs from this cd:  - ocean breathes salty ( great brooding and symbolic lyrics a la moon and antarctica, though the "that is that" hoook gets annoying given its constancy on radio) - the view ( upbeat pop sounds, mixed with the screaming vocals that get more back to roots that most of the songs on this cd "your gun went off, well you shot off your mouth and look where it got you"...the "awful feels softer" hook is entrancing - bury me with it (good simply for its lyrics at the end "good news for people who love bad news...we are hummingbirds who've lost the plot and will not move...) - Black Cadillacs ( a good song in its lyrics , though the downside is this doesnt sound like the modest mouse i know)  probably worth 4 stars or so, i give it 5 since i am a diehard, biased modest mouse fan.
