 Well, this is surely Bright Eyes' best CD. The lyrics are undeniably heartful, if occasionally overdone. I like most of you,  thought "what the hell?" when I listened to this CD for the first time. I can't say how applicable the phrase "It grows on you" is in this case. I wound up going to sleep with this playing for one week straight.  Like Bob Dylan, Connor has a story to tell with every song (and might thus be considered a "folk" artist). Like Bob Dylan, Connor does not have a good singing voice. For some reason I forgot about that after a couple weeks of hearing this CD. Anyway, what is so wrong with 'emo' music? There is no good music that ISN'T EMOtional. Compared to most other emo bands around, Bright Eyes is more eloquent and articulate in the song writing, making the whining seem more artistic - and less whiney.   "If you hate the taste of wine, why do you drink it till you're blind? And if you swear that there's no truth, and who cares, how come you say it like you're right? Why are you scared to dream of god, when it's salvation that you want?" - I like good lyrics =)
