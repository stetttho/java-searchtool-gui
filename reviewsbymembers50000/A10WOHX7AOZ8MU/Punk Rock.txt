 Well this mix of punk/rock/pop/ sounds familiar. I would group yellowcard with Simple Plan, Good Charlotte, and new found glory in a category of whining punk music.  Sure, you'll probably like this CD at first. The band while not talented, has catchy tunes. You'll like to sing along for awhile. Then you will realize this innocent album is nothing special and not a CD you need to buy.  I can say I like Only One for its lyrics, and life of a salesman since it tributes the singer's dad.  2.5/5 stars
