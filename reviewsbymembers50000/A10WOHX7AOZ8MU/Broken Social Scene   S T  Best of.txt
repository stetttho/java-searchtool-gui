 Broken Social Scene is a indie supergroup, a rock orchestra. With 17 members, and 4 guests putting in time on this album, their sound was bound to be unique. Boasting such talents as Amy Milan, Evan Cranley, Jason Collet, and Feist,and represented by the Canadian super-label Arts&Crafts, the successful results are no surprise.  Listen to Broken Social Scene, and you will hear guitars on top of guitars on top of vocals on top of a keyboard and bass and perhaps a barely-audible violin or synthesizer in the background. These sounds may tend to create chaos, but I have never heard such a glorious cacophony. Yes, folks, there is beauty in the chaos. The first two tracks prove that.   This record, more than any of their past ones, is big, and quite ambitious. The success of it means that it is also their best album thus far. Track after track, you wonder when BSS is going to let down. The answer: when "It's all gonna break" (the rocking last track) ends. But wait, this is the Limited Edition A Bonus EP called "EP to be you and me" is included. This snappy little 7-track EP is really not just filler. It includes some of my favorite tracks in this collection, "No Smiling Darkness/Snake Charmers Association", and a reprise which enhances the already amazing song "Major Label Debut".   This album has been underrated, I think. Listen to it yourself, what an easy solution! You might hate it. But, if you get it, if you can see through the hazy vocals and screeching guitars, I think you will find yourself enthralled, listening to a collection of some amazing music.
