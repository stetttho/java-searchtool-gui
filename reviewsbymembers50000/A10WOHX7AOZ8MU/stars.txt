 This CD is worth the buy for "Such Great Heights"..But dont buy the single, there are enough good songs otherwise to warrant purchasing the full album. 'We Will Become Silhouettes' is my personal favorite, along with the 'The District Sleeps Alone', 'Such Great Heights', and 'Sleeping In'.  I really want to give this song 4.5 stars...It isn't AMAZING, but it's pretty darn close. I could say it is a little too 'cutesy' at times.
