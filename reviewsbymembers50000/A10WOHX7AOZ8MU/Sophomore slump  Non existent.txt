 Franz is back. Just as we had nearly forgotten the hype from their "Franz Ferdinand" debut, they release yet another album to keep their buzz alive. In such a short time, for a relatively young band, it is only natural that they would follow up on their winning-formula with another dose of upbeat pop/rock. Good news for fans; Franz Ferdinand is the same band as they were when they last left us.  The album starts off with the incredibly catchy "fallen; which leaves the lines "For the fallen walk among us - Walk among us" lingering in your head. Their single, the next song, "Do You want to" is no masterpiece; it is a fun-loving, simple dance piece. In fact these words can find meaning as a description for the entire album. Franz Ferdinand offers nothing revolutionary to the world of rock. Rather, they have thus far produced two solid, easy-to-love pieces of upbeat material. To credit the band, Franz has grown a bit since their last album. "You Could Have it So Much Better" delivers on this fun pop/rock theme more confidently and effortlessly than did their debut.
