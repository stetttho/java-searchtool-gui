 This album is not exactly easy to describe, but it is sooooo easy to like. My Morning Jacket really does have a sound of their own. They sound mellow, but are able to create epic choruses at the perfect moment. They sound a bit old-school country, but are never boring or repetitive in any way.   I only discovered this band this past fall (05), in the most unlikely way. My dad had gone to one of their concerts with his friend, and brought back an album. In no way is he a source of good new music to me, so I was suprised to fall in love with "Z". Songs like "Wordless Chorus", "Gideon", "Off the Record", "What A Wonderful Man", and "Lay Low" show MMJ's talent for crafting mellow, delightful songs, that will not get old quickly.   As with all album reviews I write, I am listening to "Z" as I type. It sounds just as good as the first time I listened.   One of the best complete albums of 2005
