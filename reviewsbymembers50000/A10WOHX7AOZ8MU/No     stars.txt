 Sharon Creech manages to write book after book that, unlike most Children's Novels, manage to fabricate an engaging and interesting piece without the use of fantastical and phenomenal events. There are no super heroes, villains, or special powers to be found in this novel. The author thus partakes a far more difficult road in writing a great work, devoid of the usual fantasy which entices young readers. Creech succeeds in creating a work both vividly descriptive, poignant, and ultimately bittersweet. The characterization, if unusual, is genuinely comical at times, and always heartfelt and believable. Most of the 1-star reviews are, unsurprisingly, "A Kid's Review". A general misconception is that Sal "didn't know" (I will try not to spoil the surprise in my explanation), and her father "didn't tell her". Obvious to anyone who has at least an elementary comprehension of literature, Sal indeed did know the truth all along. Rather, she experiences the various stages of Grief Response, from denial to acceptance.  Like all of Creech's works, this story is appropriate material for Children grades 3-6, yet is clever and sensitive enough to appeal universally, to all ages. Unlike many other lackluster quality children's books, you will never forget this story. It made my mom cry.
