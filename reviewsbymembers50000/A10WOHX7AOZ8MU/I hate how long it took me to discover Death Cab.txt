 I hate that I only found out about Death Cab for Cutie last summer (2004). I wish I had been with them album to album to see how they grew, and eventually cumulated this masterpiece. I am only slightly obsessed with this album. Every song is so good that I find it impossible for me to push 'next' on my stereo. Seriously, even though I have my favorites (lack of color, title & registration, we looked like giants), every time I put in this disc, I end up listening to the whole thing. If you have seen any of my reviews, focus is a big issue for me in an album. You can't get more focused than "Transatlanticism". Each song ties together perfectly and, as noted by many others, sends a clear message of distance, yet avoids being repetitive in the slightest. By the way my first impression of this CD was that it was pleasant, but sort of boring. I have made a complete change to declare that this CD deserves no less than 5 stars.
