 Rogue Wave is not an original band. That said, they are still a good band. I think, they do what they do best, in a sea of sound-alike Indie Pop/Rock bands. They sound so pure, so fresh, and fun. Who can deny the beauty of a song as rockin as "Bird on a Wire". Other sweet tracks like the bittersweet "California", "Catform", "Publish My Love", and the single "10:1" complete this album.  "Descended Like Vultures" is vastly underrated. In my opinion, few other bands have put out such a complete album of ballads and rockers and pop-hooks and outstanding song-writing.
