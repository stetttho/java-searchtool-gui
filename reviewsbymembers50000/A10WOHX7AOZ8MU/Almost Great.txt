 This CD sounds like a blast of old rock from 70s. One review whined that the band ripped off every indie band of the 90s, and was thus unoriginal. Haha! If you put interpol, death cab, modest mouse, the shins, elliot smith, futureheads (whatever "indie bands" you want to insert here)in a blender, I cant think of ANYTHING more original.  Neighborhood 1 is my favorite, it sounds classic enough that even my dad likes it. Neighborhood 2 is just a fun song, and reminds me of Modest Mouse, my favorite band Other standout songs include Neighborhood 3, Crown of Love, and my favorite, Rebellion (lies). This incredibly catchy song gains momentum as it goes on, and is great to pick up the slow atmosphere that develops near the end of the album.   This rock album has cool packaging and is worth buying.
