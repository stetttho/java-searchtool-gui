 Right from the getgo, the clapping in "Kissing the Lipless" makes me grin. This CD is so incredibly well made. Song after song after song, the CD doesn't lose it's momentum. Nor do the Shins stray from their winning formula in "Oh, Inverted World". The songs are short and sweet, and work just as well together as individually. I could pick nearly any song on this album as a potential single.  Don't hesitate to buy this CD! Mellow music just doesn't get  better than this.
