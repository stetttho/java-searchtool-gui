 These album, really doesn't need a super-eloquent review to entice listeners to sample this album. Twin Cinema is such a catchy pop-piece, I think it would be hard to keep people away from this album.   "Twin Cinema", "bones of an Idol", "These are the fables", "Use It", and my favorite "Bleeding Heart Show" are some of the best tracks...But who cares? This album is good enough to purchase and listen to in its entirety, catchy enough to keep your interest, but poignant at times and mellow during Neko Case's vocals as well, which helps maintain the albums longevity. In other words, Twin Cinema never gets old.   Check the New Pornographers' back catalogue, they aren't new at writing exceptional pop. Yet, none of their prior albums has been as cumulatively GREAT as this one. Heck, even my parents like it.   A Best Album of 2005
