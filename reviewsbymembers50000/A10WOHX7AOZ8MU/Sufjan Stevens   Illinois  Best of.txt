 Sufjan is back :) Along with select few other albums this year (Gimme Fiction,Plans,Takk) I anticipated Sufjan's album, and was able to grab a copy the day it was released. You see, I had fallen in love with Sufjan's "Michigan" album, which I received as a birthday present.  Oh, boy, this CD does not disappoint. I might as well just get into it: the album is beautiful at the right time, grand without being grandiose (if that makes sense), articulate but not pretentious, and catchy without succumbing to mainstream commercialism. Sufjan is everything I love about music, and more specifically, everything I love about independent music which I have obsessed with over my teenage years.   As you may have read, Sufjan's album is sort of a collection of historical anecdotes about Illinois, in verse. This may sound a difficult venture to pull off, but you would never even know he was trying. Song-writing comes so naturally to Sufjan, I would say he was born to do it. Tracks like "UFO Sighting", "Wayne Gacy Jr.", "Chicago", "Casimir Pulaski Day", and "Come on, Feel the Illinoise" will prove to you his talent for music and song.   Yet, writing a single song would not be enough to make an album. Sufjan is able to blend 22 tracks of just about every subject matter imaginable, and make it fit into the one, single, unified masterwork that is "Illinois". Listen to how the trumpets of track two (too long to name) segue perfectly into "Illinoise", and you will see talented album crafting.  The album will get to me every time, just as Sufjan intended. For me, this is the one best album made in 2005(my other favorites can be found in my reviews).
