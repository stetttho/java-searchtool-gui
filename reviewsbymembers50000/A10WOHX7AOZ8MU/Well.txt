 This CD exists to sell itself, pure and simple. You could always make a mix of these same songs, and spare some of the torture...Or if the songs are inapropriate, it is probably not an artist your child should be listening too anyway  "Kidz Bop, Vol. 8 [ENHANCED]". Apparently this is an enhanced cd. Hopefully, by ehanced, they mean that this CD has no sound. That would be a big improvement.
