 The original 1987 release of this book is worth 5 stars, make no mistake. The artwork is still worth 5 stars.  And when I saw it was out again, in a new version, I didn't look past the pictures before I bought it and ran it home.  Then I started reading. And I knew in my bones it couldn't be the same book. I would never have treasured a book that read this badly. So I compared it to a library copy of the original.  Though the authors are the same for this new release and for the original release, most of the text has changed, and for the worse in every case.  Many readers, working only from old memories (If they've seen the book before at all) will only notice that Childe Wynde has been renamed Prince Richard. The new version is shorter, but clumsier. the writing that used to flow ends up awkward. It also talks down  to the reader, explaining and repeating itself where the original didn't.  One illustration has also been replaced (The climax page, which is also used as the new cover art) with a similar but inferior version. The rest are not only left alone, the colours are redone, a bit fresher and crisper. I'll grant them that.  Look for the original release. Pay more if you have to. The original is worth it. This is a cheap imitation.
