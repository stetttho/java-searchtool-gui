 I heard a few snippets from Carols and Capers at one point, and was not totaly impressed - however, when looking for Christmas music this year, I decided that, since I like Steeleye Span, and adore Maddy Prior's solo work, I could do worse than to give her Carnival Band albums a try; sometimes a 30 second snippet doesn't give you the real feel of the music, or the appeal. When I noticed that A Tapestry of Carols had "The Angel Gabriel" on it, I decided to take the plunge and snap it up. Well, by the  end of the first track, (which, after a few listens, became one of my *least* favourite tracks), I had decided this album was a definite keeper. Maddy's voice is in prime form; slipping easily over the extended Glorias in "Ding Dong Merrily on High" and "Angels from the Realms of Glory", and redeeming a rather somber version of "the Coventry Carol" (Which has become a bit tired to my ear, so many people seem to be recording it.) As for the backing band... These were all unknown names to me, and I had no idea what to expect from them. The arrangements are spectacular; from the twinkling sound of the glockenspiel in "Ding Dong Merrily on High", to the traditional vigour of "God Rest You Merry, Gentlemen", to the understated and somber wordless singing in "the Angel Gabriel" - a version to compete with the one that made me love that carol in the first place - to the performance of "Angels From the Realms of Glory" (Usually sung here in Canada as "Angels We Have heard on High") which was one of the real surprises of this album - this is not your typical church music! But it works, oh, does it work; a wonderful departure from the usual, and from the rest of the album, too. There were other surprises, other rewards, in the singing, the songs, and the arrangements; some subtle, some wide open joyous. This is my new Christmas favourite.
