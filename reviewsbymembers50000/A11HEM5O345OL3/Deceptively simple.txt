 Lisa Goldstein has a very unusual style among fantasy writers. She doesn't fall do anything resembling Tolkien's writing style (as many try) or his epic world of elves and dwarves. She doesn't fancify, she doesn't try to  make her works grandiose. She refuses to write a series, as almost every  other fantasy author does. She enchants instead, but using surprisingly  simple language, depicting surprisingly normal-seeming events, and evoking  wonder on every page despite. I have heard her work compared to oriental  brushwork - the description fits. This collection of short stories is one  of the best single author collections I have read. She explores a huge  variety of subjects, from the historical, with Sir Walter Raleigh, to the  disturbing story of an old woman, neglected for years, chosen by aliens to  decide if the human race should be exterminated, to the story of a man,  given photos that show his future, in a desperate search for the woman who  appears ion one picture. She skirts her personal rule of never writing  series' a bit closely, by returning to the same fictional country of Amaz  in two stories (also featured in her novel Tourists), but those stories are  decidedly stand-alones, each exploring the theme of being a stranger in a  foreign country, but viewing that theme from a different angle each  time. A reader looking for sweeping action will likely be disappointed;  even Walter Raleigh's journey across the sea to seek El Dorado is not an  action-adventure, but rather a smart moral dilemma. Anyone seeking  intelligence, creativity, truly human characters, and sudden moments of  beauty, will be delighted.
