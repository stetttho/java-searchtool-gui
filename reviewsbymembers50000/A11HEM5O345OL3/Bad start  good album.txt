 If this album didn't open with a version of "What Will We Do?" that I can most politely describe as weak, it would be a far better album. I skip this track on most listenings. It's miserable, the voices are clashing as often as harmonizing. The album them begins to redeem itself with a light piece about a husband and wife and the langths they'll go to keep a bet. Humour-wise, it doesn't bear up to multiple listenings, but it has some pleasant harmonies and a nice instrumental background. Then comes Blood and Gold/Mohacs. And here is where the Sisters hit their stride; this song disturbed me on first hearing, wowed me on second, and I have nevr tired of it. It's gorgeous. The song is grim, the performance equally so, but also beautiful. The instrumental is lush, a perfect complement. This song, and a similar treatment of The Agincourt Carol/Le Route Des Beziers (opening with the instrumental part), are probably the two highlights of the album. Then there is the sad "How Should I your True Love Know?", words taken straight from Ophelia in Hamlet, and "Fine Horseman", half-dreamlike lyrics with a definite taste of death and poverty. More grim beauty in both, and quite lovely - though it is a good thing the entire album isn't so grim as those four! But then there's "Cakes and Ale", and "Hedger and Ditcher", are well-performed and lighthearted songs about wooing - or failing to woo in the latter case. Maddy Prior's closing piece, "Somewhere Along the Road" is a lovely simple tune. Unfortunately, there are a few other weak points in the album - "Old Miner" takes the tragic tone of other songs, and makes it dreary, and "Rosie Anderson", sung by June alone, is just too too too long. However, even these are listenable: technically excellent, albeit a poor choice of material. I don't know what happened to that poor song that started the album, since through all the rest, the voices are clean and lovely, and the musicians crisp.
