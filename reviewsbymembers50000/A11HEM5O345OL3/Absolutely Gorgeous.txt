 As a longtime lover of Fairy tales, I've gotten rather picky about which picture book versions I pick up. And I wanted to buy this book the first  time I flicked through it. This one includes a variety of stories, all  well known, from the obvious choices, like Cinderella and Beauty and the  Beast, to Aladdin, and the Wild Swans. The stories are told well, though  without any newness - these are familiar, comfortable stories. Ah, but it  wasn't the tellings of the stories which had me sold on this book. Jane  Ray's illustrations are utterly beautiful. Normally, I am a fan of  neo-renaissance illustrations - almost realistic, almost three dimensional,  and full of elegant landscapes (See Kinuko Craft's work) The illustrations  in this book are flat, far more stylized - but they're full of movement and  feeling, and they look like they came from the best of medieval  manuscripts. The touches of metallic gold only add to this impression. The  full colour full page illustrations are also complemented by silhouette  illustrations and border images along many other pages. This is inspired  art, lovely to look on, and perfectly matches the feeling of fairy tale  stories.
