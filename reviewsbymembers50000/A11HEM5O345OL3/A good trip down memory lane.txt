 My only gripe about this is that I actually found the Star Wars Episode hard to put up with. While there was humour,a dn even some good music, there were far fewer laughs than I expected from something I remembered as fondly as the Muppet Show, and also several moments that made me grind my teeth, and wonder if my memory was at fault. I was so glad to be proven wrong! The other two episodes are the wonderful show I remembered it being. "Inspirational, celebrational" indeed! Paul Simon does some fine music, and the comic moments have the needed punch and flash (Although the joke about being arrested for luting is a little too roundabout). Raquel Welch... well, what can one say? Just as with the much weaker "Muppets Tonight" series from the 1990's, this was an unpromising "sex bomb" guest star whose presence provided some of the best comedy of the tape! (In "Muppets Tonight", one of the funniest episodes I saw featured Claudia Schiffer, a guest who made me groan when i first heard about it). Alas, there is one other disadvantage to the tape. On the VHS copy, Brian Henson introduces each episode - with what appears to be pretty much a straight explanation of what happens in the episode, and about the guest stars. Um, Brian, really. The box tells us the guest stars for the chosen shows, and we can see the episode to see what happens; the intro should talk about something less obvious regarding the episode. I fast-forwarded these bits. Still, the shows themselves were worthwhile picks. I just hope they release more, as I've only seen this and one other tape of the actual shows available. More! More!
