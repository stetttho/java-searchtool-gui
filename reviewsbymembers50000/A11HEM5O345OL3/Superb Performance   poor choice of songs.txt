 This live album is potentially the last recording by this artist for some time to come - rumour says she has stopped writing since her fiancee passed away in a boating accident. It is also an excellent showcase of her talents. Words like Ethereal, elegant, and gorgeous leap to mind, but they also make it sound as if the review is trying to avoid saying her work is limp (which is true of Enya); but Loreena's work is vivid. The performances are superb. I was not a great fan of the studio _Bonny Portmore_, the weakest track on _The Visit_, but this live version won me back. There are highly noteable versions of _The Old Ways_ (Which gets an instrumental nod in the improvised closing after Cymbeline, as well), _Between the Shadows_, and _Dante's Prayer_, as well; though it is obvious that it is the oldest work that gets the freshest treatment. And there lies my one complaint about this album. I have noticed several times with live albums that when older work is included, the band tends to try and do something new with it - possibly because the fans are looking for a new take on a tune they've heard for years, possibly because the performer themselves is tired of doing the same old thing. However, when new work is included, the arrangements rarely change a great deal from the studio, save only to compensate for studio effects that cannot be reproduced live. Disc one of this album is _the Book of Secrets_, repeated track for track, and every track on disc two is taken from either _The Visit_ or _The Mask and Mirror_. While I can understand why there is no material from her seasonal albums, and even from the rough first effort of _Elemental_ (Though considering how she completely reworked _the Old Ways_, I would love to see what she could have done with a new style and arrangement of _the Stolen Child_). But the excess of _the Book of Secrets_, and the lack of any single track from _Parallel Dreams_ seems jarring to me. Why record every single track from your newest album? If you must, could you not at least mix them up with the older work? And _Parallel Dreams_, although more Celtic than the later albums, is the first hint of her new direction. _Standing Stones_ (My single favourite song of all her work), _the Huron Beltane Fire Dance_, and _Breaking the Silence_ could all have fit beautifully on this album, especially if she played with them as with other less-recent tracks, to replace some of the newer work that is too close to note-for-note to the studio. Maybe it's too picky to say that while every track is performed excellently, and I love the album as is, I wish it could have been a little more varied. But the choice of what to perform (rather than how anything is performed ) did prevent me from giving her the five star review she deserves.
