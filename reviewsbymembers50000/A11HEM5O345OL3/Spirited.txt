 I love 90% of this album. Well, more accurately, a little more than that, as there are 12 tracks... This is the second album by Luka Bloom, though apparantly his fourth or fifth in all - he recorded some obscure, out of print albums in Ireland as Barry Moore, before swtiching personas, (and apparantly styles), to get out of his brother's shadow. Well, having never heard the Barry Moore albums, all I know is that I love Luka Bloom. He has a wonderful voice, and a vivid performance style. "Exploring the Blue" is a lovely, soft track, but does not descend into empty mellowness - even in the soft moments, the music is full of spirit, emotion to the fore. LL Cool J's "I need Love" is completely transformed in this cover, easily one of my all time favourite Luka tracks. The one track that falls flat for me is "Listen to the Hoofbeat", which is musically promising at the opening, but loses it in the vocal melody, and loses it worse in the lyrics. Luka's most overt political moments are often his weakest, not because the issues are unimportant, but because he cannot seem to get past slogans into the heart of the matter ("Forgiveness" on Salty Heaven, is the exception). His more subtle political tracks, those where the issues come second to the music, are invariably twice as strong. Still, aside from that, this album is powerful. Luka plays around with several different syles and moods, with covers and originals, and the passion of an artist still discovering his strong points. Some songs are more rough gems than others, inevitable when an artist is still experimenting, but equally inevitable, the album is more interesting, because the talent and the voice shine through, and the artist hasn't fallen prey to the dangers inherent once he's established his sound - there's no chance of stagnation or repetition. I just hope his future albums never do fall prey to that; there's too much good stuff going on here.
