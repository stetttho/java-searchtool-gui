 The three stars is specifically for the novel edition. The story deserves  four; while not perfect, it is an excellent story in traditional Victorian  style. Gaiman's characters are familiar - we've met some of them, the rest  we wish we could meet. The story is well-rooted in folklore, and has some  fine vivid moments. So I don't know why Neil decided (After having  orginally conceived the project with Charles Vess and finished it  beautifully as a painted book) to market this as a plain, unillustrated  book. Charles Vess' illustrations (watercolours, painted full pages and  partial pages beside the text, not the standard comic layout of multiple  panels and word bubbles) were bright, sometimes breathtaking, sometimes  merely very fine. Gaiman's text is identical - I believe I found two  sentences different between the two. (A side note; the reason I know this  is that a friend gave me the impression he had expanded the text at first,  which would give him an excuse for marketing the novel. And so, when I saw  a phrase I didn't remember, I looked it up. To my disappointment, it was  there, and it was only my memory playing tricks.) So why take a  collaborative, beautiful project, full of fine art as well as gentle  cheerful prose, and cut out half of the work? Because adults don't read  illustrated books (Never mind the number of different people who've  illustrated Tolkien and Peter S. Beagle). Adults don't read comics (Another  fallacy), which is how the illustrated edition is marketed. Since when  are adults less sophisticated than children? Since when are adults unable  to appreciate art? Go into a comic store. Find the Stardust collection  with Vess' illustrations. Then appreciate a perfectly melded work, done by  not one but two highly skilled artists - Gaiman with elegant words, Vess  with colour and character.
