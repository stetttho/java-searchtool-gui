 I have listened a good deal to this recording and can simply say Karajan has the key to the requiem in D minor.  His conducting and control of the flow and majesty of this piece are never in question...in spite of the period instrument approach he has a sound architechtural understanding of this mighty work.   In the Dis Irae we are really given bite and push!  I think this recording is the sum of the merits Karajan achieves.  Maybe not altogether polished and as perfect as some but very musically thought out and grave and sombre as a Requiem Mass should be!   Bravo Maestro Karajan!!!
