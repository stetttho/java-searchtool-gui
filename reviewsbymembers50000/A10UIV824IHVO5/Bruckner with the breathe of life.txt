 Every phrase is wondefully etched in this awesome recording..the mastering is a bit distant but with the glorious blend of the Scottish Nat. Orchestra I am quite pleased.  Very few ensembles in the world have the kind of patient discipline it takes to put together a really fine 'Romantic'.... but this one is gutsy and extremely earthy so I would not hesitate to give it two thumbs up....very nice.
