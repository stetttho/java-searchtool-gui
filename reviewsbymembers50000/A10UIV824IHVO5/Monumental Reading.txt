 I have always found the 8th to one of the most problematical of all the Bruckner canon.  It is an extremely severe and craggy work and requires an ear and eye for deatail that goes far beyond the previous works from this composer.  Kna seems to really have taken a second view of the work and for me in some ways this version cannot be dismmissed as easily as others.  On top of this he has the Munich Philharmonic(an orchestra that he got on well with) and therefore the partnership from bar one onward is never in question.    The opening movement is very commanding with superb Brass throughout...this alone is the test of a great interpretation for the sonority of the brass truly sets the tone and quality of any Bruckner 8 reading..only with Karajan and Jochum do I feel as comfortable.  By the way, if you expect anything remotely like Karajan or Jochum you are not buying the right reading then.  On top of this Kna was a great theatre man, being opera conductor extrordanaire...and given his penchance for being dramatic somewhere here his inclination for drama is really astonishing...climaxes are incredibly well arched but with great control and stunning uniformity.  In the slow music one really feels the orchestra is being played like a great cathedral organ, so superbly caught here.   The sound is pretty good for its age as well...the Finale and Scherzo are given very fine interpretations too...I love the way he handles the Landler feel in the Trio of Scherzo..superbly done!  For me alot of the greatness here is we finally have a studio recording of Kna in which we get true snapshot of the genius of this great and very much overlooked conductor.  He is very much a Richter or Nikitsch...  Kna also hated working in the studio and this translated to not really have the recorded output of quality and size anywhere near the likes of Bohm or Karajan.  This is sad because his ability to eclipse anyone on the Podium is  clear evidence here.
