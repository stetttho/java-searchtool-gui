 I listened for the earth shattering epic quality the Seventh can have an really feel somewhat let down by the Scottish National Orchestra here...balances are fine and playing very nice but the phrasing lacks some of the bite and poise of even Barenboim who did a fine job of this in Chicago.   The slow movement is done very nicely here, and I give the slow movement here the heads up above alot of the competition.  That being said I will certainly keep my Jochum and Karajan Berlin DG ones over this...I just found the finale of this performance a bit too staid and somewhat restrained for my personal liking!
