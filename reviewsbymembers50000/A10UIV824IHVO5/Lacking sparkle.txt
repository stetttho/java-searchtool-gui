 The performances here are very correct and yet err on the conservative side... orchestral tuning is not always so accurate and yet I find the tempi to be fine.  Not the best Haydn out there when one considers the poor recording and sound given to these famous works...try Colin Davis with famed Amsterdam Concertgebouw for a really good time in Haydn!
