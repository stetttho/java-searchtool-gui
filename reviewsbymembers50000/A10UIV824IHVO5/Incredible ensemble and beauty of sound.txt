 Rarely has the Cleveland and George Szell ever sounded so fresh and spontaneous as here.  I am quite critical of some aspects of the whole Szell Brahms thing.  At times Szell can become very calculating and overtly clean but here at once is the adrenal and gusto one gets from a group that really is allowed to phrase and let loose!   The opening movement is not taken overly fast and because of this it really scores high marks.  Bernstein is a bit too frenetic and almost schizoid in his tempi choice with the VPO on DG, but Szell is incredibly passionate.  What I can't understand is Szell never allowed this to be made public during his life.  Once again the enigmatic thinking of Szell has to be wondered at.  The same holds true with an interpretation of Tchaikovsky 4 which he did in London which he never allowed to go public and yet it is once of the finest things he ever did! Without sounding abrasive I can say this shows a side of Szell we never get to hear...passionate, foreboding and even human.  Truly a wonderful record and with super sound!
