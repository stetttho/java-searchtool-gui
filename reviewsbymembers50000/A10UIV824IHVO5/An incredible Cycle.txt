 Rather than goading and beating his players sensely Walter was always a gentleman of conductors and was very much old world by the time the 50s came about.  Never in a rush, these interpretations balance a view halfway between modern interpretation of Conducting and yet maintains the old world sense of proportion and blend.  The Columbia symphony sounds wonderfully European...robust woodwinds out front and a natural unforced balance between winds and brass.  Rather recently I heard the Naxos Tintner set and was very dissapointed with the Beethoven installments..and in No. 4 you simply have to listen to Walter.  The warmth and roundness of phrasing and the subtle dovetailing of phrases is an instance where Walter can never be matched.  I also dislike the idea of doing Romantic interpretations with Chamber music forces...here the Columbia symphony is around 75 players and yet play with a smooth clean sound that is very delicate...  I have a great admiration for Szell as well and for different reasons...Szell is very clean and more tense generally which works for Beethoven.  However, I really think any genuine collector must have Bruno Walter's complete recordings on the "shelf".  They are  simply great and appeal to the sensibilities of serving the music without fuss.
