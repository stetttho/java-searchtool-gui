 The level of concentration throughout in this set of recordings is amazing...even though some may not know it, the Lamoreux orchestra is one of the very finest and it is the oldest orchestra in Paris.   All of the recordings are top notch and are played with polish.    As a backgrounder, you may want to investigate the 1936 Casals/Szell coupling of the Dvorak on EMI!  Wonderful in different ways!
