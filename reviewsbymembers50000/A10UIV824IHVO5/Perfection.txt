 This is a recording worth listening to over and over again.  The peerless playing of these CSO principals as well as the excellent conducting from Barenboim make this CD the best there is in this repetoire.  The Oboist Mr. Klein is sadly no longer playing much anymore due to a rare case of focal dystonia...he is an incredible musician and this performance of the Oboe Concerto is absolutely flawless with superb range in the bass register as well.
