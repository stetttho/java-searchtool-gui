 I have so long tired of these works...they are overdone, overplayed and in many ways become a dull and lackluster experience to any classical listening/musician.  However, Karajan has an approach which some may considered controlled yet he allows phrases to breathe and in many ways emote which conductors like Szell can only dream of touching in this repetoire.   Proof is in the Second symphony at the end towards the coda(First movement). The warmth of playing coupled with such  lack of affectation as well as the tremendous feeling of flow of the coda IS the most satifying ever put to disc ever.  Karajan in Brahms is truly a giant and stands way above any other conductor of the 20th Century.
