 I find here the approach almost too literal.  The orchestra brass are no where near the quality of the Berlin version or the Bavarian Radio version under Jochum.  I also find the recorded sound too thin and recessed ....important subjects and repeated motifs are lost in the mix and therefore I find this to be quite far behind the searingly intense approach from conductors like Kempe and Jochum.
