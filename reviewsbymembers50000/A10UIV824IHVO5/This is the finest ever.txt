 To say in one word...PERFECTION!!!  Karajan has a grasp of structure and tone few others ever come close to in this music.  I also love Davis with Boston for different reasons..  Finland is a cold frozen arctic country and this music reflects it...there is one whole piece Tapiola which evokes this country wonderfully....   You have to go to Finland to understand this vision of music, but if you can't get there Karajan has an understanding of the desolate north...  I live in Canada so comply that this interpretation has that feeling of the North!!!  For serious collectors indeed!!!
