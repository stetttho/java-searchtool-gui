 After years of performing and listening to these works there is very little that can be said negatively of the perfection of this particular set of sessions done in the mid 1970s.  Kleiber really unleashes the most incredible sound from the VPO since the days of Solti.  We also are treated to the warmest tone and the most incredible Brass and Woodwind work ever to be put to disc.  I also find one thing in the 7th intro quite amazing.  Simply the tempo being slow is so right and played with such precision as to be breathetaking...the transition to the fast 6/8 is arguably the finest interpretation of this music without ever sounding forced.   The Beethoven 5th has the most incredibly tight opening ever as well.  Surely one wonders why Kleiber is not more popular!!!
