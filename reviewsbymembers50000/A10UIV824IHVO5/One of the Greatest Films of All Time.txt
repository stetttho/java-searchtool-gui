 In spite of the rather hackneyed expression which I preface this review, Eisenstein has given us not only one of the most powerful films of all time, but also  an incredible visual experience.  The vastness of Russian steepes is so well caught that one feels one is part of this film.  As a result of this film Eisenstein really made a profound imprint on Cinema and gave film emotion.  There are so many things that are impossible to capture in a single review..however, the beauty of Edward Tisse camerwork is fantastic.  If you are a true fan of classic cinema then this is for you!
