 There is very little to add to the previous reviewer.  I remember getting this on Lp and being mystified at just how intent Klemperer is at the Bruckner thing.  He never drags and moves things along, which somehow goes against everything people criticize in his conducting.  The Philharmonia plays with great feeling and fervour.  Wonderful woodwinds with Gareth MORRIS and Bernard Walton on clarinet.  They just have the right tough of refinement for this epic music. Sadly there are few ensembles or orchestras today who could ever touch this in any way.  Recently Tintner has done wonders in this repetoire but maybe without the last touch of personality we have here...this is Bruckner carved in granite.
