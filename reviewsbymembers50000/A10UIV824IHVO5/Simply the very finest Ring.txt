 After listening to the dull and heavy performance of Karajan..... here we have  Solti!!! and he really  brings  epic  life affirming fullness to the Wangerian ethos.    The wonderful work of the Vienna Philharmonic is always a pleasure and with such a super cast which is having a "good day" so to speak we are given Wagner with no holds barred.    I am always impressed with the Hans Hotter Wotan...there is simply no better on any disc of this...  Karl Bohm's Theo Adam always dissapointed me and Bohm's ;use of Gwyneth Jones always confounded my sensibitities...maybe she way a fine actress but she stunk out loud.   As to other great aspects of this Ring is a wonderful round Decca recording with super dynamics and excellent perspective.  Added to this the wondeful Principal winds of the Vienna phil and you are on your way...  I also love the way Solti paces this work..heeding the natural flow rather than forcing us to slow dull tempos like Szell(Met from the 40s...and Karajan in Berlin from the 70s...)  This is the REAL Ring!!!
