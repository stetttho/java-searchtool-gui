 I am at a loss why some are reviewing the Image Entertainment version when the KINO INTERNATIONAL VERSION is the one listed above.  The Kino print is wonderfully clear and very sharp with excellent detail...there are some specks left here and there but this in no way detracts from the enjoyment.  The intertitles are a bit on the slow side, but at last you can read them.    I really have little to say that hasn't gone on before except this is a superb silent film with an incredibly delicious plot twist at the end...Very dark cinema and excellent soundtrack as well!   Bravo KINO!!!
