 I really enjoy the wonder of Marcellus and his simple approach the phrase..he also has a full round sound which is very french in some ways.  I love the warm approach from Szell here..it is elastic and yet the playing is natural.  As to the flute usually we either hear the basson concerto or as in the previous CBS incanartion the Sinfonia for Viola and Violin which was done with Szell.  I prefer this coupling over the current one..however, well worth of the price just for the Clarinet Concerto...unless of course you are a Zuckerman fan.
