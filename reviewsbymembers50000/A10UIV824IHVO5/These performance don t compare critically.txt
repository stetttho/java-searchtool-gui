 If your an audiophile looking for superb sonics and balances these records are not what you are looking for.  If you are a Tintner fan and proud of his work in Canada they may be for you however, that being said these are really more like radio sonics and have limited dynamics and give the impression of live concerts with the inherent flaws in the foreground.   YOu will never go wrong here, but of you are looking for truly great and weighty interpretations step towards the DG Bohm or even Szell on Sony with even lower pricing.
