 In spite of the fact others may not care for Barenboim at least he has the gall to get lathered up into the whirlpool of Bruckner's crescendo markings.  The freedom with tempi are really quite elastic and help make the phrases move nicely without forcing too much.  I am tired of listening to lifeless Bruckner...at least here we have some fire and blazes in music that needs it.  These are super sounding recordings as well.  Power Bruckner with dramatic bite as well.
