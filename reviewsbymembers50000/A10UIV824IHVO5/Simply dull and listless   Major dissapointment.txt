 Other performances in this cycle are exeplary but this interpretation of Beethoven 9 is in some ways one of the weakest performances in this cycle.  The choir pronounces german with little or not uniformity and the consanants are not together.  On top of this the Baritone has very little power unlike the Karajan Walter Berry combination.  While the slow movement is quite nice there is really little happening...whereas the Fricsay Beethoven 9 had an incredible power... I think there are alot of better budget alternatives...including Furtwangler in Bayreuth on EMI which sounds incredible for its time....Szell is simply not shaping phrases or even attempting to mould phrases.   In other words this is one of the worst and least exciting 9ths on record...go to Herbert K. or even Bohm to see what I mean.  As for the Fidelio the solo horn is off pitch most of the time...
