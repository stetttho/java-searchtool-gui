 For those who have the other CBS classic recording of overtures...this one is a must for any serious Ring collector.  We have Szell on the top of his form giving an incredible performance...sonorities are clean and withouout the plodding sentimentality heard in the 20s.  Szell is just the man to give us this music...he has a rather pristine view of Wagner textures...sound is always clean and the melody is allowed to come to the fore.     I have always liked this record...which far surpassed the crappy Ormandy Wagner album...that was a pretty banal attempt at Wagner.  I found Ormandy more convincing in Sibelius.
