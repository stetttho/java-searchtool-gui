 If you are looking for well thought out interpretations without the overt moulding of phrasing that Karajan and Kleiber involve themselves with ---then here you have lean and mean Brahms!   I tend to find these performances lack the overt mannerism in other discs.   Wonderfully caught is the blended wind sound of the Cleveland orchestra with the burnished string sound Cleveland is famous for.  These are very well remastered without the annoying harshness that ruined the lps for me back in the 70s.  The Brahms cycle by Szell is worth it's weight in Gold!
