 Rarely can one find a recording that so epitomized the Bruckner idiom, and yet here Klmeperer is really under the skin of Anton Bruckner for sure.  To simply say the tempi and sound are good is just idiocy.  The real key with this performance is the majesty and wonder of the interpretation beneath the baton of old Klemp.  He just seems to peel away layers of interpretive mould that others simply heap on to this very austere and beautiful music.  The only conductor who comes close in this work is Georg Tintner and ever in this symphony he is not anywhere near Klemperer in terms of atmosphere and feeling.  this is just not simply a great recording, it is a milestone in the whole arena of recorded music.   This is one tought symphony to pull off and Klemperer really shows how great a work this is...only Tintner comes close with the New Zealand Orchestra on Naxos.
