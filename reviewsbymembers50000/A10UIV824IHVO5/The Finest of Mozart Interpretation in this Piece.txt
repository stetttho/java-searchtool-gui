 For many years I have played this recording over and over and can simply say this is one of the best sung and performed Flute's about...the pacing and flow are natural and in spite of the dialogue being cut(none of it makes any sense anyway) we have a miracle unfolding before our very ears.  Klemperer has always been a conductor to arouse controversy...he was a champion of Stravinsky and Hindemith to name a few and really could perform music  in such a way that it became clear.   As to the ensemble work the Philharmonia has a perfect quality of lightness of tone which I daresay adds a special quality to this work.  There is no American performance of this work that comes near to the exceptional work of Cast and Orchestra.  I doubt today you could come close to finding a performance even near this one, excepting the Solti Vienna version from the mid 80s. What is so wonderful is the delicacy and phrasing and the way Klemperer lets it happen...only Karajan and Bohm could do justice to this musical work.  Lately I have been very dissapointed with recent releases...among the worst James Levine from the Met... So, if you want to hear some great singing and ensemble, this is the Magic Flute for you.
