 You have before you one of the great testimonials of the passion and beauty of Mahler's music.  Bernstein really gets inside the music of Mahler in a way very few conductors do..I find in some regards the sound of the NY PHIL not as refined as some but with wondeful expression and faithfully following the letter of the score Bernsten achieves dynamic performances from the NY PHil.   The 5th is given a superbly controlled reading and the finest performance here is the Ninth...superbly played and without affectation!!!
