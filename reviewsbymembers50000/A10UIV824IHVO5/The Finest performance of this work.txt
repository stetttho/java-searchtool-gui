 There is something here which goes beyond the normal studio recordings one hears of this piece..mainly is the performance is one with the electricity of a concert.  The opening bass notes in 16ths are spellbinding. In spite of other people's reservations about some small glitches, these no way detract from the glory of this performance.  In fact, they may even add to the wonder and humanity of Klemperer's artistic vision.   No other recording  catches the spirit of this mighty work!
