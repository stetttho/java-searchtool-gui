 Once again we have Szell and Cleveland at the height of their powers digging into what for them would be a rare performance of the Mahler repetoire.  The opening movement as a fine sense of "gemutlekeit" and a balance of textures which is definitely PERFECT. Rarely has any orchestra been so ably caught sonically and we are in for a real treat.  As a counter measure the Kubelik is very similar in the way the music is allowed to flow as well.  I really reccommend this disc simply becuase of the impeccable phrasing and well nigh perfect intonation in the different choirs.  As to the vocal solist Raskin does a commendable job and has some of the boyish quality really needed!  She was tremdously good and one wonders where she is these days!  This is a superb disc for the people out there who want a non fussy interpretation which really sticks close to the score.   Keep your Klemperer discs as well...Szell and Kemperer were much more alike than one would wish to think!
