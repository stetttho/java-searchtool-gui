 I remember listening to the old lps of Jochum doing the Bruckner symphonies and can honestly say they have yet to be interpretively passed.  Where others plod and linger sentimentally Jochum phrases and moves things along. In the very difficult works like Nos. 5 and 6 there is also no conductor except Klemperer who can conduct these.   The Bavarian Radio Orchestra in No.5 is easily the finest interpretation put on record.  The later matching of Jochum with Dresden is fine but seems to lack the personal touch.  On top of this Jochum never allows the Brass to overblow and ruin the texture of any of these works!  Every nuance and texture is allowed to stand out!  No. 9 is certainly the very best performance and can sit along Walter and Karajan anyday!  As for the sound it is very fine, but when all of these symphonies are given such special playing and feeling you have one of the greatest buys of all time in the classical CD World!
