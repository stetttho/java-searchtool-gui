 Having seen Georg Tintner conduct on numerous occassions I can honestly say his genius in this repetoire is truly spellbinding.  He conducted here in Canada Symphony Nova Scotia and yet I always felt he need a larger ensemble to create the canvas of sound so needed for the Romantic music he was so attuned to.   His skills at balance and getting the right colours for the music are much in evidence here.  This Irish orchestra is incredible as well and perform with such conviction one almost thinks it's the Vienna Philharmoncic.
