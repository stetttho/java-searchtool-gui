 Here is the right ingredients for Brahms E minor symphony.  Add the delicacy of the winds with the incredible warmth of the brass and this is certainly has to be once of the most successful Brahms in the history of interpretation.   Movement one has a natural unforced flow which allows the themes to expand nicely.  Woodwinds are just wonderful.. The slow music in the second movement is well done.  The secondary theme which comes from the lower strings is marvelous. The third movement has a excellent sense of pace without the bombast we hear from other groups... The variations in this recording are the most flawlessly caught...the trombone choir in the last pages is fantastic.  Bravo Cleveland and Szell
