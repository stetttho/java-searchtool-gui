 It is with only the rarest of greats can a recording stand up to the level of beauty that one hears on this recording.  Not only do we have two very fine ensembles in repetoire they know, but we have the incredibly gifted hand of Furtwangler who shapes every phrase into a beauty of line that only others can imagine. Conductors like Walter and Szel could only dream of convincing an audience of their correct ideas of Bruckner.  The Bruckner feeling of the mystic is firmly in place here.   The sound is very good for it's age and is very clear.
