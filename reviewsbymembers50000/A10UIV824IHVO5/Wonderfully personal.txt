 Harold Wright spoke with his clarinet to you personally...as a student of his for 4 years I am reminded of the wonder  of his phrasing and remarkable musicianship in these recordings.  His tone in real life was so pure that it was a revelation.   His technique was so refined and so french..the opulence of his tonal character was American!!! I was very lucky to have learned so much from such a great teacher.   this is among his finest recordings...but clarinetists should look for the older Harris Goldsmith recordings of these works as well!!!   Of course Harold Wright is better than Marcellus...he had soul!!!  His Brahms is the finest out there!
