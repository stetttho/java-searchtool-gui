 You just don't get any better in this music than what is recreated in these 60s sessions.  The 8th is quite relaxed with super phrasing.  The opening of the 8 is the finest on disc and a touch slower which gives the music a bit more breathe and fullness..  I find the 3rd to be one of the most intense...very clean winds and super playing throughout all sections...the recording isn't great but the performance is among the very best ever done...who can complain when the orchestra is this fine!!!
