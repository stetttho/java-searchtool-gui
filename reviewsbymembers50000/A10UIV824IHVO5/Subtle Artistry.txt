 Harold Wright possessed an incredible command of the clarinet...his tone and wonderful expressive phrasing was the envy of many!  This recording shows the ease of his artistic playing and gives a great example of his phrasing...never shallow or prone to vulgarity he was a true genius of the clarinet.  As a private student of his for four years I learned everything I needed to know from him about making music...!!!  If you really want some great playing...check this out!!!
