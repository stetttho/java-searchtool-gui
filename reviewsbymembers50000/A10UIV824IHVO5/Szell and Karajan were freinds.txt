 In a recent bio on Karajan I was surprised to read the two were very good freinds and shared a alot  in common. They also had similar approaches to orchestral sonority...  Suprisingly enough the approach to the Wagner here is very alike Herbert in some regards...I like the way Szell approaches the music in a more intense approach.   Karajan did get to do the Ring...but alas we may get to hear Szell with the Met from the 40s which some believe does exist in archive.  As to the playing this is the finest Wagner record of exerpts out there.   It surpasses Herbert's any day!!! The wonderful thing is how Cleveland is so transparent in it's textures...not as unlike Klemperer as one would think!!!
