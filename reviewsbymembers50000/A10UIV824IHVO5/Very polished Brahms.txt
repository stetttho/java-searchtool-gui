 Wonderful performances from the finest of the Brahms conductors...Herbie Karajan.  Wonderfully straightfoward performances without the wayward stylings of the 63 set....  That being said the Fourth and First of the 63 set are incredible and deserve to be in any serious Brahms collection ...  sonincally these are very fine readings!!!
