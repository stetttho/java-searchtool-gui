 There is a sublime quality to these readings...the BRSO is not Berlin or NY but they seem to strive for goals and ideals far beyond the reaches of these groups.  There is a sense of the mountains  in this music...inspired majesty and an almost unbelievable passion to all of these readings!!  Sadly, few people ever get the chance to listen to Kubelik in this repetoire and time has been unkind to his memory.  On an occassion I had the chance of working with Maestro Kubelik and can say he brought passion to every bar and phrase he ever conducted!!!  For me this is Mahler etched in stone...very well played and with alot of edge...not for those who expect refinement and cloying beauty...but instead pure water which flows to the ocean.....the Second is very well done with excellent brass and singing throughout...  The 5th is very cleanly played and without vulgarity...the 9th has a very slavic sound to the winds which I find very appealing.    The 1st and 4th are among the very finest versions ever done with some wonderful singing...the Finale of #4 is incredibly played with excellent lower brass and winds.   The 8th has some wonderful sonorities with excellent singing from Fischer-Dieskau....this is a very volatile performance and bear repeated listening...  The 3rd here is truly epic and the 1st movement is among the finest played ever.   Go for IT YOU Mahlerians!!!!!
