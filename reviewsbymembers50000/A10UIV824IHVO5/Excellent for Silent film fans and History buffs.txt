 I was reluctant at first to write a review about Eisenstein due to the very hot political nature he is still regarded under...that being said I feel his first three films are absolute masterpieces of cinematic art.  His ability to create tension through sequencing and visual narrative make him an uncanny choice for the greatest director of all time.  He was making these films under very primitive conditions.  However, Eisenstein has an incredible sense of knowing how strong the visual medium can be and is not afraid to go places in his directing where no one has gone to since.    Sadly time has been somewhat unkind to him.  I also read that his last years were very unhappy and he was shadowed by the Stalin regime.  As to Nevsky and Ivan the Terrible I am less defernetial...they are obviously not as close to Eisenstein's heart as the first three..Strike, October and Battleship P>
