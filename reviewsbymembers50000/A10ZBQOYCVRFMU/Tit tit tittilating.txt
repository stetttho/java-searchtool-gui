 This movie gets five stars for pure awfulness!  "Based on the novel by Ed Wood," (did he direct this under a pseudonym...?) a bunch of "damned" (and mostly damned chunky) chicks are raised from the  dead by a guy in a REALLY cheap vampire suit and forced to dance (in  various stages of undress) for his jovially demonic pleasure. With a plot  about on par with the average "Tales From the Crypt" episode (and  with even more frontal nudity), you can just let your brain go out for a  beer while you watch this one!  My (and my wife's) personal favorite:  the  porky "indian princess" in red thong undies!  Dig those tom-toms!   I'm sure all the women who were in this (if they haven't killed themselves  from shame), are somewhere thinking "I can't BELIEVE I slept with Ed  Wood to get this part!" I'm especially amused that the only other  review of this movie is by some OTHER poor bastard in Akron, Ohio.  Plainly  this IS the cultural center of the universe!
