 Keach plays a deputy sheriff in a small town who's everyone's buddy.  He's the kind of guy who settles barfights and counsels couples and gets kids cats down out of trees.  Thing is, he's also a psychopathic killer who's  quickly losing his grip on reality, and his ability to fool the people  around him.  KILLER INSIDE ME follows him through his rapid decline and  ultimate doom. I looked for YEARS to find this movie, because I'm a HUGE  fan of the book of the same name by Jim Thompson (who also wrote THE  GETAWAY, THE GRIFTERS, and a number of other gritty, suspenseful books that  became solid films).  Ultimately, I was a little disappointed with this  movie. In the book, the main character (it's told in first person from his  perspective) is pure evil personified.  He knows what he's doing is wrong  and doesn't care a bit.  In fact, he gets off on it! Hollywood had to make  Keach a "poor victim" by pitching him as a nice guy whose  terrible childhood catches up with him, and that kind of blew is for me.  I  mean, we're supposed to be rooting AGAINST this guy!  That's the whole  irony of the book! That said, Keach's performance is great (the way his  eyes glaze over when his evil side comes out is just perfect), as is Susan  Tyrell's performance as a scheming hooker.  (Tyrell also co-starred with  Keach in John Huston's wonderful FAT CITY, a film I HIGHLY recommend.)  There aren't ANY extra features on this DVD (no production notes,  commentaries, etc), and it's in full-screen, but you can't beat the price!   In short, I'd recommend this movie if you're a Keach/Jim Thompson fan, but  you should read the book (which I'd just bet you could find right here on  this site) first.
