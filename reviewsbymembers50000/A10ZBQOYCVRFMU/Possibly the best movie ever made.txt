 This is the film on which FISTFULL OF DOLLARS and LAST MAN STANDING were based.  Although I love both of the remakes, the original still kicks their collective butts! Mifune plays Sanjuro a down-on-his luck master swordsman  who happens to get falling-down drunk in a town where two clans are  battling for supremacy.  When he comes to, he realizes that there's easy  drinking money to be made by playing one side off against the other as a  bodyguard (yojimbo).  He starts off hustling both sides, but gets  personally involved when he realizes that one of the clans has enslaved a  young woman by threatening her husband and son.  When he's discovered  helping her, he's almost killed.  ALMOST killing him is the last mistake  EITHER of the clans make! This is my favorite Kurosawa movie, and contains  one of my favorite dialogue exchanges:      Bad Guy:  You'll just have to  kill me!      Sanjuro:  It'll hurt... [SLICE] It's multi-layered,  brilliantly acted and wonderfully executed by Kurosawa.  If I could only  watch one movie for the rest of my life, it might be this one, because  EVERY TIME I watch it I catch some nuance that I missed before.
