 Like USED CARS, this movie is bawdy, rude, over the top, politically incorrect, profane, gratuitous, and loving every minute of it!  Newman plays the captain of a bush-league hockey team that's going down the tubes.   For most of the players, it's either hockey or an assembly-line job, so  Newman decides to bring in the fans with violence.  He succeeds, thanks to  some brilliant manipulation and a trio of hockey-playing idiot savants  (mostly idiot) named the Hanson Brothers. This is one of the funniest  movies I've ever seen.  The first scene where the Hanson's get off the  bench (heck, EVERY scene with the Hansons) is a classic and will make you  laugh until you need surgery! The DVD isn't much better than the VHS,  unfortunately, as far as picture quality or features go.  There are some  alternate language tracks (if you're a big fan of Newman in French), but no   director's commentary, etc. SEE THIS MOVIE!  Every performance is  hilarious and perfectly-cast.  George Roy Hill (who also directed Newman in  the classics BUTCH CASSIDY and THE STING)  seems to just bring out Newman's  best no matter what the genre.  Also Strother Martin (of COOL HAND LUKE,  "failure to communicate") fame, is in this and is totally  hilarious!
