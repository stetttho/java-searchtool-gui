 Based on the novel by Jim Thompson, THE GETAWAY is a must-see for fans of Peckinpah, as well as those who love a good caper-flick. Doc McCoy (McQueen) is a master thief cooling his heels in prison.  His wife (McGraw)  springs him by sleeping with the warden, but that's only half the price.   McCoy must also pull a bank robbery at the warden's request, and his  partners are a moron (Bo Hopkins) and a psycho (Al Letteri). Of course,  it's a set-up, and McCoy is not intended to come out alive.  Letteri, the  warden, and maybe even Doc's own wife are in on the plan to murder Doc and  split the money.  McCoy and wife take off for the Mexican border, with  Letteri hot in pursuit. This is classic Peckinpah.  In fact, Peckinpah is  the only director I've ever seen who does FULL justice to the gritty,  savage novels of Jim Thompson (THE GRIFTERS, KILLER INSIDE ME, and THIS  WORLD, THEN FIREWORKS are a few other Thompson adaptations).  Walter Hill's  script (Hill also wrote and directed the 1996 remake) is a masterpiece! Not  a lot of features on the DVD (I'd've LOVED a commentary by Walter Hill on  this one!), but the format really brings the beautiful cinematography to  life in a way lesser formats can't. A GREAT film!  This is one of McQueen's  grittiest, toughest roles, and he's the PERFECT McCoy.  Cool and deadly as  a cobra, yet with genuine emotions and doubts.  You'll want to buy a 1911  Model .45 after you see this movie!
