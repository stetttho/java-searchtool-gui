 Hackman plays a world-weary private investigator who's hired by a hollywood widow to track down her nymphette daughter (Melanie Griffith in her first film role).  He finds her and brings her back, only to find out a  few days later she's died in a bizarrie film "accident."  As he  digs deeper, he finds there's no one he can trust. This is a complicated  but brilliant movie, and a great performance by Hackman.  Great supporting  cast (watch for James Woods in a small role).  You may have to watch it a  couple of times to pick up all of the pieces, but you'll enjoy doing so!  This movie rates up there with CHINATOWN and LA CONFIDENTIAL in my book.
