 This beautiful, sad film is quintissential Peckinpah, and for my money is better than even WILD BUNCH (which is generally regarded as Peckinpah's masterpiece).  Once an outlaw, Pat Garrett (James Coburn) is now a  bought-and-paid for lawman assigned to hunt down and kill his former cohort  Billy the Kid (Krisstoffersen).  Though he eventually succeeds, Garrett  ironically sews the seeds of his own destruction, while ensuring that The  Kid's name will live on forever. The fascinating, horrifying slow-motion  violence and operatic pace that made Peckinpah a legend are here in spades,  along with a great supporting cast and haunting score by Bob Dylan.  You'll  want to watch the "Keep the change" scene a million times!
