 James Caan plays a hardcore master thief who's spent almost his entire adult life behind bars.  When he makes a Faustian bargain with a mobster (Robert Prosky) in order to get out of the life, everything he's worked for  tumbles down around him. This is a MAGNIFICENT movie, full of power, irony,  and ferocious action!  I think it's Caan's greatest role, and that's saying  A LOT!  He brings incredible intensity to his role as a man  who, in order  to save himself, must destroy everything he loves. Not only is this a  fabulous movie, it's my favorite DVD.  The DVD/widescreen format truly does  justice to Director Mann (MIAMI VICE, MANHUNTER, HEAT)'s  quirky,  ultra-slick style.  Also, the commentary by Mann and Caan is EXACTLY what a  DVD commentary track should be:  two great artists commenting on the film  at the same time, playing off of each other and really adding a whole new  dimension to the film (for instance, did you know that the "technical  advisors" for the film were a "crew" of jewltheives, and  that Caan was breaking into REAL safes with REAL burglary tools?). If you  loved HEAT, you HAVE TO see this movie!  In fact, this is almost a  companion piece to HEAT, because  Caan's character is sort of an earlier  version of DeNiro's character. If you are a fan of films like RESERVOIR  DOGS, HEAT, PULP FICTION, and THE GETAWAY, this is a MUST-SEE!  This is  truly a modern classic!
