 DARK CITY beautifully and effectively combines elements of science fiction and film noir. John Murdoch (Sewell) awakens in a hotel room with a murdered woman and total amnesia.  We follow him through a (as the title  might suggest)  dark, labrenthine city where the landscape--and even the  inhabitants--keep shifting.  Humanity, as he discovers, has become the  subject of an experiment by an alien race.  The Strangers, as the aliens  are called, seek to save their race by discovering what gives humans their  individuality  and instinct for survival. Not only is this a brilliant,  original, and awe-inspiring movie, but the DVD is GREAT!  There are 2  commentaries, one by the director, screenwriter, and other creators, and  the other by critic Roger Ebert. The only downer was that it also includes  (supposedly) an interactive game, which I couldn't get to work. I very much  recommend this highly original film, especially in the DVD format.
