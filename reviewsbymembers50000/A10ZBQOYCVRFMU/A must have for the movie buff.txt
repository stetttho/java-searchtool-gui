 This book is a vital reference source for fans of American cinema.  Those who denegrade this book because they disagree with Leonard's opinions miss the point entirely.  True, he's dead wrong about a TON of movies (in fact  he should probably be imprisoned for giving BLADE RUNNER 1.5 stars), but  hey, that's why they've got windows at the race track!  What makes this  book valuable (and for my money, INvaluable) to the true film buff is the  wealth of FACTUAL information about more films than you can safely shake a  stick at.  Includes full title, year of release, director, cast, sequel and  format information and trivia on over 15,000 films! And by the way, for  every one of his reviews with which I disagree, I find one which astounds  me with its concise brilliance!  Buy it, use it, and don't take the fact  that he trashes your fave flick personally!
