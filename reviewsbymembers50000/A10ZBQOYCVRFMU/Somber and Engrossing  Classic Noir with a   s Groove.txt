 This is a true piece of american noir.  It seems like a diverting little car chase movie the first time you see it, but O'Neil's stoic, nihilistic getaway driver has a way of bringing you back for more viewings.  It's interesting that Ian Muldoon mentions the similarity to a Jean-Pierre Melville film in his review, because I think this movie owes a lot to Melville's LE SAMOURAI (on which John Woo's THE KILLER was also based).  Just like Melville's hit man Jeff kills without conscience or reflection, yet still abides by an unbending code of honor, O'Neil's Driver is, ironically, more moral in his way than the obsessed, power-mad cop (Bruce Dern) who pursues him. Walter Hill no frills, straight-to-the-gut style really works here.  The costumes, sets, and cinematography are dark, understated, and really engrossing, especially on repeated viewings.  I believe that this is a movie that grad-school film students will be watching 100 years from now.
