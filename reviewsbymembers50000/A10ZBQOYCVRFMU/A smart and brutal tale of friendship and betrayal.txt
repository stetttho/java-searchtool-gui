 Mark Dacascos hooks up with his prison cellmate (and sometimes lover) Jaimz Wolvett (Schofield Kid from UNFORGIVEN), and agrees to come along on ONE MORE job.  Unfortunately, the drug-buy goes bad and Dacascos (whose  history in kung-fu flicks serves him well) wastes the double-crossing  punks.  Trouble is, the double-crossing punks were the little brothers of  some REALLY BAD hombres, who set out after Dacascos and the rest of  Wolvett's crew (which includes the always slut-o-licious Tracy Lords in a  stand-out role). Dacascos and Wolvett end up at a desert motel, occupied  only by the owner (Frederick Forrest), and his super-fey wife.  The  killers, however, are not far behind.  Let the bottom-kicking commence!  This film really incorporates elements of exploitation, prison-flicks,  martial arts chop-suey, and acid rock-n-roll movies and filme noir, and  does it in an INCREDIBLY skillful manner.  I LOVED this movie!   I rented  this expecting basically a kick-butt and shotgun-splatter buddy flick (and  wasn't disappointed in either regard), but there's a lot more here.  The  performances are really solid, especially kung-fu star Dacascos and  teen-porn-star Lords, who for me moved into the realm of "real  actors" with this film.  Wolvett, as always, is quirky and  fascinating, and Forrest is awesome as the doped up and margirita'd out  proprieter of the motel. Also, look for Joan Jett as a rock-n-roller (did I  mention this film is also partly THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN ARM...?) If you  like movies about the dark underbelly of man's soul (is that a mixed  metaphor...?  Sorry...) ala THE KILLERS, REQUIEM FOR A HEAVYWEIGHT, and  THIEF, you should definitely see this movie!
