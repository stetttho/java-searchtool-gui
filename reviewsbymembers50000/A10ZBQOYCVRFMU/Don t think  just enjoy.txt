 In the (near?), post-apocalyptic (actually, I think it's post-environmental-disaster) future, a group of survivors try to rebuild society on Manhatten Island.  Led by Max Von Sydow, they hire Yul Bynner as  their "fighting man" to defend them against a rapacious gang (led  by William Smith in one of his bad-*** roles). This movie is a lot of  fun, and I've got a soft spot in my heart for it, because I saw it as a kid  and just thought it was totally cool.  It's by no means  great.  However, it has some great action and fight scenes (Yul Brynner  doing his portly, half-***** kung fu against dozens of badguys is worth the  price of admission).  The fight scene at the end between Brynner and Smith  is especially great, with Smith's bunch weilding medieval-type weapons in a  ruined subway tunnel. Let me put it this way:  It's not as good as THE ROAD  WARRIOR or ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK, but it's a hell of a lot better than  CYBORG (all of which pay homage to ULTIMATE WARRIOR in a number of ways).   See it on a lazy afternoon instead of washing the car!
