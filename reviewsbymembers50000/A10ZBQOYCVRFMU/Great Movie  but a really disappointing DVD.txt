 This is one of my all-time favorite movies, but I was terribly disappointed with the DVD.  There are simply NO extra features (the trailer doesn't count, guys).  The DVD was billed as having a commentary with Russell and Carpenter when I ordered it (although I can't recall whether it was Amazon or another movie site which made that misrepresentation).  I understand that even the laserdisc version had a commentary!  Come on, can't you just TRANSFER the old commentary to the DVD?!!?  The commentary with Russell and Carpenter on THE THING is great, so I'm sure I'm really missing a treat by not hearing their commentary on this film.  Also, I understand from an interview I saw with Carpenter (on the VHS version of ESCAPE) that there's a whole opening scene which was cut from the final release, which shows Snake robbing the Federal Reserve Depository and escaping on a bullet train.  Now wouldn't that footage make a nice extra feature? Frankly, in retrospect, we should probably all just boycott this movie.  Think about it... first, the original ESCAPE comes out, and it's AWESOME.  Then, twenty years later, I buy a VHS "Special Edition" which claims to have "unseen footage."  That footage turns out to be about 5 seconds of Snake in the deleted opening scene, inserted as part of a long, fairly boring interview with Carpenter plugging "IN THE MOUTH OF MADNESS."  Next, ESCAPE FROM LA comes out, which film I won't even dignify by trashing.  Then finally, we get a DVD with NO features, not even a remastered soundtrack!  The more I write the madder I get! I realize I'm reiterating a lot of what the previous reviewer said, but I waited a LONG time for this to come out on DVD (some of you may remember that it was to be issued almost a year and half ago... I pre-ordered it then only to have the release delayed).  Maybe the plan is to issue a "special edition" with the extra features, and I'd probably buy it, but I'd sure feel like I'd been shafted!
