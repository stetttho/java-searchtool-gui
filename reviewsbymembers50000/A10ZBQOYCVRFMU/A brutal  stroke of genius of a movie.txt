 This remake of the 1932 classic has become a virtual synonym for over-the-top violence, profanity and amorality.  This reputation is not entirely undeserved.  Still, those who see only the mahyem are missing a  sad, gripping, and dead-on-the-money tale of ambition and hubris.  Pacino  is at his absolute best, and is supported by a phenomenal cast. You  probably won't find parts of this movie easy to watch (the  chainsaw-in-the-shower scene is as much a part of movie folklore as  "Here's lookin' at you, Kid), but it's a work of genius for both  director DePalma and much of the cast.
