 During the Vietnam war, an abandoned castle in the Pacific Northwest becomes the site of a highly experimental mental hospital for shell-shocked soldiers (who may be faking).  Psychiatrist Colonel Kane (Keach), arrives  to take over and begins to earn the grudging trust of the patients,  especially Capt. Billy Cutshaw (Scott Wilson).  Thing is, Kane's got issues  of his own... This is a brilliant movie which manages to combine humor,  violence, madness and theological angst with a what-the-hell-was-that pace  that will put blisters on your eyeballs.  Unfortunately, for some reason,  this film is virtually unknown.  If not for the wonder of cable TV, I'd've  missed it myself, but now it's one of my all-time favorites. In short, SEE  THIS MOVIE!  NOW!
