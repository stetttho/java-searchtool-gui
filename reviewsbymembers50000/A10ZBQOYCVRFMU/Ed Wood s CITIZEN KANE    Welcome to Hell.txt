 Common wisdom has this as the worst movie ever made.  I've seen a bunch'a movies, and so far I'd have to agree.  The CLASSIC "so bad it's good" flick, this is Ed Wood's CITIZEN KANE.   The plot (to use that  term in the loosest sense) concerns a group of aliens (led by the most  overtly homosexual alien overlord ever to grace the screen... ahead of its  time in that way I suppose) who plan to take over the world.  "The  world," as it turns out, is a graveyard with a bunch of styrofoam  tombstones.  The aliens are on "Plan 9" (the other eight failed),  which involves raising the dead (among them the talent-challenged Tor  Johnson and remarkably top-heavy "Vampira").   They do this by...  well, it's never quite explained, except that the aliens have  "knowledge of... such things." Boris Karloff appears briefly, but  died during filming to be replaced by Mrs. Woods' chriopractor. This is a  perfect movie, in the sense that it simply could not be any worse.  If  you've ever had dreams of being a hollywood director, go ahead!  You'll  NEVER make a movie worse than PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE!
