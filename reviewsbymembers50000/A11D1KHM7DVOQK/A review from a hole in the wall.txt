 Hmm...It's been almost six years since this release. I still haven't reviewed it! I know, I can't believe I forgot.  Ok.  1. Britney Spears, Baby One More Time: B- I used to hate this song, now I like it because Britney Spears sucks really bad now.  2. New Radicals, You Get What You Give: B Good song. Nothing special, but a good listen.  3. Robbie Williams, Millenium: D- Sorry, I thought it sounded like Justin Timberlake smoking p0t.  4. Semisonic, Closing Time: A One of my favs. Too bad Semisonic was a one-hit wonder.  5. U2, The Sweetest Thing: C- Worst U2 song to date. Slow, stupid, and boring.  6. Sheryl Crow, My Favorite Mistake: B- Not the best from Sheryl Crow, but, I guess it's decent.  7. Fatboy Slim, Praise You: B+ Not the best from Fatoby Slim either. It's still pretty good.  8. Garbage, I Think I'm Paranoid: C+ Pop-Metal? Don't think so.  9. Cake, Never There: B+ Pretty good, but why is it so short?  10. 98, Because Of You: D+ Worst 98 song yet.  11. Spice Girls, Goodbye: F The worst song on the CD. The Spice Girls can do much better!  12. Mya & Blackstreet, Take Me There: F Rugrats? Right...next track  13. R. Kelly, When A Woman's Fed Up: C- This song has absolutely no point! Who cares?  14. Everclear, Father Of Mine: A Woo...a breath of fresh air from the crap on the last 4 tracks. This is a great AC song!  15. Sublime, What I Got: A Once again, this is a great song, that is really short.  16. Backstreet Boys, I'll Never Break Your Heart: C- Meaningful lyrics with horrible singers.  17. Jay-Z, Hard Knock Life: B+ This was a great rap song, but Now could have done a bit better with editing.  18. Baz Luhrman, Everybody's Free To Wear Sunscreen: F I've changed my mind, this is the worst song on this CD. Wait, it can't be because it's not a song!  CD. Various Artists, Now 2 Overall Grade: C+  Truly not the best now, but I've seen much worse with Now 12 and 17.
