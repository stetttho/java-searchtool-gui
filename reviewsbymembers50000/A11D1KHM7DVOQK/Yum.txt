 Missy Elliott, the first girl rapper to lose over 300 pounds, is back and ready to serve up some very tasty treats on her new album, "The Cookbook". Missy calls it the "Cookbook" because Missy says, "On every album I put out, it has it's own flavor." In the song "Joy", Missy adds a With that said, Missy threw in a variety of guest stars, ranging from Mike Jones and Slick Rick to Fantasia and Mary J. Blige. Missy decided to throw in a few R&B tracks, and new producers Scott Storch (most of 50 Cent's "The Massacre") and The Neptunes (check out "The Clones" to see their other efforts), as well as her best pal since her group Sista, Timbaland, will make "The Cookbook" a sure summer smash.  The first single off of "The Cookbook", "Lose Control", has it's own flavor indeed, with new R&B princess Ciara, and hot new rapper FatManScoop. It's so infectous that it'll keep you in lock for awhile. Another song with an addictive beat is the Neptunes produced "On & On", which is rumored to be the next single, and is featured at the end of the "Lose Control" music video. "We Run This" is also addictive, even though the beat is a remake found in the 2004 hit movie "Dodgeball". "Bad Man" also has a similar beat to "Lose Control".  There also are some very decent R&B jams on "The Cookbook" too. "Meltdown" may have sex lyrics, but the "Rock The Boat" by Aaliyah like beat will surely have you pressing the repeat button a few times. "Time And Time Again" is another R&B track that Missy flows in very well.  "Partytime" is just a fun, 70's-like song, that should be played at dance parties. "We Run This" is also a 70's based song.   We all thought Missy Elliott would be disappointingly over with "This Is Not A Test!", but "The Cookbook" proves wrong as one of Missy's best albums. I recommend you to try out Missy's recipes. They turn out quite good!  Replay Value: Medium Child Appeal: Low Teen Appeal: High Adult Appeal: Medium
