 I bought these because I just could not stand the headphones that came with my CD player (SL-SV570). They were extremly uncomfortable. So, I went ahead and bought them. I pluged in the headphone, and I couldn't hear anything. The volume was around the 10-15 area, and the player only goes to 25. I could hear music on 20, but it was still too quiet. I put it on the highest volume, 25, and automatically I heard distortation. I was very unhappy with these headphones. They are just so quiet. Just save yourself the money and don't buy these headphones.
