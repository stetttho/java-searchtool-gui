 First off, I do not own this camera, my friend happens to. I really wish my Sony had the features of the 1.8" LCD (with backlighting), esay gripping, and a few other picture taking options that I don't have with my Cybershot. There are also bigger zoom options, as well as more user-friendly software (but if you have Windows XP, you don't really need photo software). There is one issue that is a bit dissappointing... flash quality. The pictures taken without flash are great, just see the customer images. But, you can't take photos in the dark, because the flash is awful. Why? The pictures are of horrible quality! The fuzz is not just easily shown on the LCD, but on the computer, you'll not see anything but fuzz! The video is even worse. There are green spots and fuzz over everything. The videos don't have flash, so the video option is basically useless. Both with and without flash. The videos on my Sony are crystal clear, even on a big, 17" monitor. The picture quality on my Sony is WAY BETTER THAN THIS HP, ESPECIALLY ON FLASH! I even did a test on photos and took a picture in flash and without flash on both cameras. The HP lost on both points.  If you're looking for good quality pictures and decent videos, pick up a Sony Cybershot instead. The M407 is below average, even with it's features.  Unrecommended.
