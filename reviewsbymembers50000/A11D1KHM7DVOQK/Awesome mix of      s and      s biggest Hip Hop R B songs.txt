 This CD has some good songs on it. The ending is a little on the sloppy joe side but the beginning is awesome. Not a lot of people know about this CD because it's brand new. THIS CD IS SIZZLING WITH HIP-HOP/R&B HITS!!! People who like Totally Hits or Now That's What I Call Music series and like hip-hop/r&b, you should love this. Sizzle. Sizzle. I hear sizzling hits here. You gotta get this, because if you don't, you won't know what hip-hop/r&b really is like. You gotta feel me when I say GET THIS CD! YOU WILL ENJOY IT!
