 I do not own this, but my friend does. He says he never uses it becuase of it has poor sound quality and the radio doesn't come in well.  So, I tried it and turned it on. I couldn't agree more with him. The sound quality is just horrible. 0 bass, and screeching treble.  The radio is basically useless. It can barely come in on any station and the knob is hard to configure due to this.   The shower radio can't even go in the shower. It says is not recommended to keep near humid areas. Huh? Is this a shower radio?  Really, he wished he spent more money on the Sony one (which I heard was an excellent shower radio, that could ACTUALLY be near a shower), or had spent less money on an equally dissappointing one.  I recommend the Sony one. I haven't seen Panasonic, Philips, Koss, or anyone else making shower radios. So, I think the Sony is your best bet. As for the Jensen, stay away!
