 This is not a good driving game at all. It's graphics are so bad. It's controls are hard to use. It's so hard to turn in every car even the one with best turning. It's not as good as Driver. That's a good driving game. Driver isn't a racing game, but it's so much better than Rally Cross. At least in Driver you have good graphics and easy to use controls. If you disagree than buy it. Keep your reciept so you can take it back. I also think Sony could have done a way better job considering their good reputation in electronics.
