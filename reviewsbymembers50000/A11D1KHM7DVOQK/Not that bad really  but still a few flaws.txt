 Well, the company Iconcepts make various types of hardware for low prices. I can find these products usually shopping around dollar stores and small department stores around my area. And, I found these speakers at a low price (I don't remember excatly, but it was around $5-$10), and need an extra pair in case my Creative speakers broke on me (they are almost 7 years old and starting to lose touch), I would have another pair to replace them. If you're using these for your computer, like I am as I have to now use my Creative speakers for my portable CD player as my microsystem broke (it's currently getting repaired). Well, if you're just use this for your computer and you're not going to use them often, the value is really not that bad. The design for these is great, which I love because they don't take up too much space around the desk. But, if you are using these for audio such as tapes, CDs, and mp3s, DON'T BUY! Why? Turn them up about 1/4 way and you hear this irritating humming noise in your audio, which is why I only use for my computer. Another reason is the bass and treble aren't set all that great. So, if your looking for flat speakers for your CDs and tapes, you really should do a lot more researching, but if your using them for computer use and you don't really listen to audio or video on your computer that much, they are really a great buy, and you should get them.
