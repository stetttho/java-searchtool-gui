 The first ones I owned, the flimsy cord broke. The second ones I bought lasted awhile, but then they broke in half. The third ones I owned they had bad no sound on the left side. The were comfortable, and I liked the second pair because it had awesome sound quality. Though, the durability of these are a big problem, which means I will not be buying them again.
