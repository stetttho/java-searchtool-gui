 I AM REALLY UPSET WITH THESE. NOTHING REALLY ON THESE HEADPHONES ARE PROS. THEY ARE MOSTLY ALL CONS  Pros: - Volume remote...which doesn't even help peak volume anyway, so this really isn't a pro.  Cons: - These are some of the most QUIET HEADPHONES I'VE EVER USED IN ANY OF MY PLAYERS! The impedance is 32 ohms, one of the worst impedances you can get. - There is SMALL BASS ON THESE! The bass is completely bloated and tinny. - The treble is IN A TUNNEL??? Honestly, is there a long tube in between these. - These have HORRIBLE COMFORT. The rubber headband makes them extremely oversized. - These are NOT DURABLE! Every single pair of these broke in the same space, with good care. The left side of the earcup, which features the right side's cord. - If there not durable, they are NOT PORTABLE EITHER. Sure, they fold up, but that's all the portability you'll get out of them. They break, one in my backpack, one putting them on the way I always do, the headband on my head, and the speakers correctly on the ear.  SO YEAH! I'M KINDA MAD, EVEN THOUGH I'M GETTING MY $$ BACK. THE FACT THAT THESE HEADPHONES HAVE BAD SOUND, COMFORT, DURABILITY, AND PORTABILITY, WHY ON EARTH WOULD I GIVE THESE A GOOD RATING??? THEY ARE WASTING ABOUT A WEEK OF MY LIFE. NEVER AGAIN WILL I BUY FROM JENSEN.
