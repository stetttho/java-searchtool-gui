 Brian, Kevin, Howie, A.J., and Nick haven't been in the studio since their November 2000 release, "Black And Blue".  And four and a half years later...  Not a bad comeback! Very suprised, I hated the first single "Incomplete" because it was boring, unpowerful, and had a country feel that made me want to gag in the first minute.  Overall, the album compares to something Hanson or Gavin DeGraw would do. "Weird World" sounds almost exactly like Gavin DeGraw, but songs like "Just Want You To Know" show a style similar to their older albums, like "Millenium".  My favorite track would be "Lose It All", because it's so powerful. They better think twice about releasing "My Beautiful Woman"...not only was it stupid but it almost put me to sleep.  Overall, it seems the BSB have matured in a good way. Their songs are much more powerful, and the true style inside them is forming out.  Oh, and to Sally Jenkins, please learn how to write reviews...thank you.  Replay Value: Medium Child Appeal: Medium Teen Appeal: High Adult Appeal: Low
