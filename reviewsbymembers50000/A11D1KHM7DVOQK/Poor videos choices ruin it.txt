 MTV, or it used to be, one of the best ideas for the TV. Music videos were a great idea for the TV, until MTV made crappy shows, then it went extremly downhill. Now the only shows on MTV that are worthwhile are Pimp My Ride, The Ashlee Simpson Show, and maybe the RR/RW show is aight, but other than that, MTV sucks now considering they play more crappy show like Punk'd, Jack***, and other junk rather than doing what their idea was in the 80's, shows music videos. Anyway, I'm not going to waste my review bashing MTV, I'm going to review the DVD. Well, it's kinda hard to make a DVD of the biggest songs of 1982-2002, and MTV did an ok job on it. Mainly because MTV put on so-so to forgettable videos on the DVD. Some of these videos are also low quality, but, just buy the DVD if you see it for half-price somewhere, but other than that, this DVD is wasting your money.
