 The iPod has been an extreme success over the past two years and it seems no matter what competition comes in, Apple is still going to win.  This is the second edition of the iPod mini. It still has the same, durable, and fashionable design, and the easy click wheel to navigate from music to the calendar to the games.  The battery life is up to 18 hours, which is excellent. Some other MP3 players won't even last 5 hours, which is pretty lame becuase you need (or as I'm agreed with) at least 5 hours of playback.  The sound quality is very decent. Not the best sound quality, but still has bass and clear treble to it.  The price has been lower to $199, but still, the price seems a bit overpriced...as most 4 GB MP3 players are lower priced.  Another big drawback is that the AC adapter and the FireWire cable is unincluded. THis means you need to pay an extra $50 for these needed accessories. Also, the iPod Mini can ONLY be used with iTunes, though, iTunes is a nice software, if you haven't used it before, re-iding your tracks will become a pain.  Also, as most people know, all iPods are FM tuner free. This is poor because 80% of MP3 players out now have some tuner in it.  Overall, the iPod may not have FM tuner, the decent sound, stylish design, game features, and a strong battery life to be happy about. If you really careless about a radio tuner, and have some cash on hand, the iPod Mini is a fantasic choice.
