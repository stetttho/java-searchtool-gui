 Okay, first off, Black Eyed Peas + Monkeys + Elephants = nothing, but that's really the point. The Black Eyed Peas are a group that mix genres of music into form of the genre they like to call "phunk", a pop and hip-hop version of funk.  So yeah, mixing genres is great. Take "My Style" as an example. Take a hip-hop beat, and mix it with funk and African beats, and hey, it turns out to become quite a good track. The all hip-hop track "Feel It" is decent too, as well as the James Brown song.  But some tracks like "Pump It" proves disasters with monkeying around with genres. With lyrics like "turn up your radio, blast your stereo", and the fact that it mixes genres makes me wonder who thought of that. That's where the album starts off on the wrong foot, leading into "Don't Phunk With My Heart", which is catchy, but makes no sense and is a complete mess lyrically.  The Black Eyed Peas proves they know how to mix genres well, but this album seems either it was rushed or they just need to go back to the drawing board.
