 Ok, for writing a 1000th review on a headphones, I'll just say I've tried or owned about every single headphones they're is on the market. Lightweight, closed, earbud, volume control, ones that elimanate outside noise, and ones like these, behind the neck headphones.  One thing I have to say is, they are actually pretty comfortable, unlike other types of behind-the-neck headphones. The sound quality on them is pretty good, with banging bass and clear highs and lows. They aren't too expensive, and they are kind of portable.  One thing I do have to point out. The cord is kind of short. Though, for portable player listeners, this shouldn't be a problem. Though, you'll feel like a dog on a leash if you use them for a computer were you have to hook them up far away (that is if you don't have a headphone plug on your speakers.)  Overall, these are a good buy. I would get these if you like this style and/or using a portable player.
