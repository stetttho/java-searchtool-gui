 My Ratings: Sim Town - B This game is good. Sim City is better. But, Sim Town is less confusing and may find kids interseted. Sim Park - A This game is great. It was very fun for me to play. I liked takng the quizzes and getting mail. Sim Safari - C This game is ok. It sometimes lacks fun because there isn't anything inerseting to do. Sim Tunes - B This game is better than it sounds. Kids get to experience making songs with many musical insturments. I enjoyed playing this game. Widget Workshop - D This isn't that good of a game. Well, One thing it's very hard to solve the problems and kids get bored fast. Another thing is that it isn't much fun. Sim Ant - F Oh pleez don't make me play this again is the #1 response for this game. Overall - C It's an ok package. It is worth the money, but some games may not be very fun.
