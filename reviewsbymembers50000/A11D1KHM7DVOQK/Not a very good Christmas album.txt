 This album seems really dull. Jessica didn't not do well on this Christmas album. Her vocals, to me, sounded pretty bad. I think she could have tried a bit harder to make the songs more fun, since a lot of the songs are dull ballads. I really, really did expect more from Jessica, since her other albums are really good, but this one is really dull. However, I did like Ashlee's part in Little Drummer Boy and she should make a Christmas CD. But for Jessica, this Christmas CD isn't worthwhile, and only big fans of Jess should buy. Very, very bland and boring. Only recommended for big fans of Jess.
