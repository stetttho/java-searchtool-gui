 First off, I'm somewhat amused (especially Amazon.com) by some reviewers calling this album exceptional and one of the best artists in a long time. Sorry, but this is nothing but a Mexican and more dance version of Britney Spears. If this is the best album in your collection, I'd recommend starting over again.  The thing about this album is that it's not meant to be good. It's just to be a fun, dance album, not to be taken seriously at all. And, that's what it "Arular" is. Take "Bucky Done Gun" for example. Throw in a hot, dance beat, lyrics that makes no sense whatsoever, and some hot sex kitten, and there you go, you get the song. Though, the best song is "Galang". I watched the music video on MTV, and it is one of the most catchiest songs ever created. "Galang, galang, galang. Gala, gala, gala, galang, galang. You get, you get down. Get down. Gala, gala, gala.". Even if the lyrics are out of wack, you have to admit, it's catchy and a guilty pleasure. The "Banana" skit was awful, but so awful that it was good. And, that's basically sums up "Arular" in one sentence. It was so awful that it was good...well, ok. Though, if this was actually taken seriously, American Idol rejects would be at the top of the charts right now.  Go ahead and buy it if you have a dance collection. Otherwise, stay FAR away.
