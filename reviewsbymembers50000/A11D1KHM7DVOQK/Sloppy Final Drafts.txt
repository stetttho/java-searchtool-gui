 Ok, you're probably thinking all paper is mostly the same. Not really. Some brands have thicker paper than others, and some have smoother paper that make things messy. Let's use Mead's College Paper for an example.  For pencil writing, this will do fine. Pencil are harder, and "grab" the paper easily, so you control your writing.  For pens and markers, this paper is a nightmare. Pens seem to be hard to write with on the Mead college paper. They tend to go off, and lose track, making you have to write slowly so the pen won't go in different directions. Markers are the same.  Fountain pens seem to leak through the paper, making things hard to read.  This paper may do pretty well with roghdrafts, but for final copies, this paper is a nightmare.
