 Driver 2 is a great game. It has good sound,, good control, and it's a lot of fun. I haven't played the first one so I don't know how much worse or better the second version is from the first version. The only problemm is that iit's graphics are a little off, but otherwise, it's a great game. Graphics 3/5 Sound 5/5 Control 5/5 Gameplay 5/5 Replay 5/5 Overall - 4.6/5
