 It should say "Wanted Fans! Only $15!"   It's not that Lil' Bow Wow (oops, I mean Bow Wow...but Lil' Kim, Lil' Rob, Lil' Flip, etc.) can't rap. If you look at the lyrics of the album, he's truly matured and can rhyme millions of things. Maybe if he could get good material, he'd be wanted. I mean, girls, clubs, and dreams are VERY overused topics. The lyrics of many songs want me to just skip them, no matter how good the rest is. If this album was ade, say around the 2002 or 2003 area, this wouldn't be such a below-average (lyrically) album, becuase in 2002, there were barely any new rappers overusing these topics. Now, you have loads of rappers, talking about the same things; it's annoying. But, "Wanted" isn't terrible.  His beats are from Jermaine Dupri, and this saves the album. Jermaine Dupri, if you don't know, is one of the best producers before Dr. Dre, and has worked with Murphy Lee, Mariah Carey, and many others. I mean, the beats of "Caviar" and "Let Me Hold You" are worth the album alone. Maybe when the instrumental is released I'll buy that.  If you're a fairly big Bow Wow fan, or love Jermaine Dupri's work, you should check out the samples, because the beats are very decent. If not, you may want to pass this buy and get the new Missy Elliott album. Well see next time if Bow Wow is still wanted enough to make another CD, because this CD definitely will make fans un-want him in a snap second.
