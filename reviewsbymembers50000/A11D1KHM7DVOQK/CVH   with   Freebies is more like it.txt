 Lightweight Set (CVH42) - If you really like this set, I would highly recommend you to buy the seperate set, because this is probably the only set in this combo really worth having.  More deep into the lightweight set, the sound quality is excellent. The bass can get very deep with the 40mm drivers, and the treble is clear.   Watch out with this set on durability, though. The first set I got, the right speaker would not turn on, and on the second set the earpads are chipping off on normal usage.  They are very comfortable to wear as of course they're called the lightweight set.   Clip-On Set (CVH69, but no volume control in combo) -   First the positives; the sound quality is very good on this set. Not quite as good as the CVH42, but still very good, and clear.  So, what's the problem with this set. Not much, besides the fact that you can't wear these for 5 minutes without yelling in pain. This set is definitely for people only with very small ears.  If you like this set and have normal-large ears, try the CV123 combo with the adjustable clip, so it fits better.  Earbuds (No Seperate Set)  These are the earbuds that are free with every cheap product you buy. Absolutely no bass, screechy treble, those kind of earbuds. They are comfortable, but they fall out often. The free earbuds I got with my $7 radio were better than these. If you want earbuds, Sony is the only and I mean ONLY company that makes good earbuds.  Overall, unless you have small ears, skip this set and buy the stand alone set (CVH42), or get the other combo (CV123).
