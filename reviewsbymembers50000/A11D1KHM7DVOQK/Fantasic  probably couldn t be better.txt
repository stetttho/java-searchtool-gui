 I got a Samsung MP3 Player (YH925GS). Problem, my microsystem has no line out, and uses wires to connect to the speakers.  So, I needed something to connect to my microsystem, because who wouldn't want an MP3 player blasting out 200 something watts?  The cassette adaptor was a thought. Then I realized how dumb I was even thinking about it, because the microsystem has the cassette door shut. So, the FM transmitter was the only option.  I felt shakey about this, because if you went to Tucson, you'd see that our station numbers are pretty spread out. 89.1, 90.5, 91.3, 92.1, 92.9, 93.7, 94.9, 96.1, 97.5, 98.3, 99.5, 102.1, 104.1, 104.9, 106.3, and 107.5. If you look at those station numbers, you'll see a fairly big gap between 99.5 and 102.1. With that said, placing it on 100.7 made it perfect. The sound was not clear. Here's the thing, it doesn't matter how far apart stations are, it's the clearness of the station you're using. However, I did find very clear signals at 90.1, 91.7, 106.9 (so that was the techno music I heard down the street), and 107.7. Just go to your radio, and skip down stations and find one that has only fuzz and no station interferring. That's how you can tell if this will work or not. If you can't find a station with only fuzz and no interrference, your unfortunately gonna have to buy a normal cassette adapter. Though, if you find one or some stations with only fuzz, like I did, then this will work excellently.  Instead of placing it near the microsystem, I put it too the test. I placed it directly in the center of my apartment, checking to see how well the signal was. Well, as it's advertised at 10 feet, I got 12 feet...and I didn't test it further. So, a walk outside, realizing that I got it up to 40 feet. Then yet, I don't live directly in Tucson, I live about 15 miles away from metro Tucson, which may be a reason of why this worked so well. People living in urban-ish areas probably won't even get 30 feet, but it's worth a shot.  Overall, if you own an MP3 player, you HAVE to get this.
