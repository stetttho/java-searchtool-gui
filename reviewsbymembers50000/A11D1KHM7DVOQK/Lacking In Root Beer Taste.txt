 The Barq's Root Beer soft drink says it is root beer but only has half of its taste. This is for one main reason, the soda isn't really even made of root beer, instead a basic soft drink that is similar to root beer. If you ever knew when it came out, it wasn't even a root beer drink, though it tasted slightly of it. So, instead, they followed IBC's path and slightly changed the ingredients to have more of a root beer flavor. However, since Coca-Cola has been using artifical sugars, the taste level dropped (on ALL of their sodas, has anyone seen the "new taste" signs on Diet Coke for a month two years ago?), therefore Barq's root beer has fully lost their root beer taste. Right now, it tastes similar to generic store-branded root beer. I would recommend buying IBC root beer, root beer that doesn't change their ingerdients no matter what.
