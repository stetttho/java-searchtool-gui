 Don't ask me why, but I don't think "The Incredibles" deserves 5 stars. Most of you 5 star reviews right now probably looking at this review with your mouth like an O. Well, here's the problem with it. Not only does the plot seem a bit boring (it repeats over 5,000 times), but it takes too long for anything to happen. It took about 45 minutes for anything interesting or funny. I think it has a rocky start. If you ask me, this should be labeled as a family action film, not a family comedy. Though, I'm not a kid, so I of course don't laugh a much as a kid would.  There was a great amount of action in the film, which did keep me entertained. And there were a few moments were I chuckled a bit (Mr. Incredible is very hilarious at times). So, this movie is worth it.  So, the rocky ride ends after the comedy, action, and adventure start to kick-in.  I don't know. I don't think it's in the same league as "Finding Nemo", and I think it's a little overhyped. But, it's still a fun family film, and I would recommend it. See for yourself.
