 ...then you've come to the right place.  After the heavy selling album "Ocean Avenue", along with an MTV2 award, Yellowcard moves only towards growth on their third album "Lights and Sounds". Much of the work on this CD will appeal to those who like pop-rock especially The All-American Rejects and the old Green Day from the 90s.  The album goes right through and instrumental track and immediately starts with "Lights and Sounds". The hard-heading track has already recieved airplay on most Alternative Rock stations. It's mainly about how people caneasily mistreat others. The next single will be "Rough Landing, Holly" which sounds a lot like Yellowcard's last album. The fast-paced guitars and drums should make this a sure hit. Another pick is "Martin Sheen or JFK", while the song has nothing to do with the title, is about taking their significant other back so they're considered "safe". The guitars make it one of the CD's best songs. As far as negatives "grey" doesn't seem to go anywhere and isn't too catchy as the rest. "How I Go" is a great song and sounds similar to Rise Against's acoustic version of "Swing Life Away".  As far as the CD, it's much better than I expected. There are some songs that could use improvements but there are some very good tracks on here and it is definitely worth a purchase especially if your fans of All American Rejects, Green Day, and Simple Plan. 4 stars.
