 I bought this product because it was up-to-date. Well, Norton AntiVirus 2002 saved my computer completely! Norton AntiVirus 2003 destroyed my computer. A virus struck it and, all of my programs and documents were gone! After the virus, I installed Norton AntiVirus 2003 because, that was gone too. It wouldn't work! It still doesn't even work now! There is a red X on it and, whenever I click enable auto protect, it tells me to go to Knowledge Base. Knowledge Base didn't help at all! I even called Symantec and that didn't help either! I will never buy Norton AntiVirus again! I went back to the store and got McAfee instead. Highly unrecommended. Buy McAfee, the company that will cover ALL viruses. I hope this helped.
