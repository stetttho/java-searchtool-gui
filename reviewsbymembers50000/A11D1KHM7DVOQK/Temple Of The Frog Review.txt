 Ok, I think Frogger's Adventure's: Temple of the Frog, is a great game. It has some good graphics, excellent sound, and good control. The only reason that it wasn't a 5-star game, is because it was too short, and if you replay it, it gets sooooo boring. But, that's why they made Frogger's Adventure's 2: The Lost Wand. So, buy both games for extra action, or you can buy the first one for average action. Hey, it's up to you, but, I recommend getting both games.
