 It's the stuff Mystery Science Theather 3000's are made of... a disaster of spectacular proportions. Put together enough pointess, random details, and you get Gigli, amovie that's less incompetent than bewildering. So forget the hype -- this movie would stink even without its big-ticket stars, which isn't to say that either is entirely blameless. The dialogue from writer-director Martin Brest is clunky, the film has serious tonal inconsistencies and at over two hours, it drags on way longer than it should. Really silly is the kindest way to describe this hopelessly misconceived exercise in celebrity self-worship... it has a special badness all its own. I highly recommend not seeing this junk.
