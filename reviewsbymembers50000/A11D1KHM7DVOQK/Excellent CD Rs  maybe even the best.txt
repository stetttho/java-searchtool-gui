 These Maxell CD-Rs are great.  First, I've only had one burn failure, which was mainly my fault because it had scratches all over it. The CDs are very reliable, and they have a hard time scratching.  The data works like new, unlike some of the other brands (especially Memorex) who's data comes out reading very slow and choppy. But Maxell is perfect, making extra copies of games run perfectly, and without poor graphics and gameplay.  Music doesn't sound distorted (like Imatation), and it sounds just as good as the MP3 on your computer.  I only have one negative, which is kind of a funny negative. They, for some reason, smell AWFUL! Yes, these discs smell really bad, and don't ask me why because I wouldn't know.  I've had a lot of companys of CD-Rs, but Maxell has some of the best, and I highly recommend them. Go through a lot of CD-Rs in a 20 pack? Buy this! You can't go wrong!
