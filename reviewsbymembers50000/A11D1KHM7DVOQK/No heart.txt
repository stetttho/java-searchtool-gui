 When Martina McBride sung "Independence Day", she had heart in her voice, and she sang it with pride. She meant what she said, and it seems like Carrie Underwood just doesn't care, and doesn't really have heart in what she means...you can't feel her expressions.  And in "Inside Your Heaven", Bo Bice was a little better for that song. Carrie does it okay, but still, barely any heart in her singing.  In my opinion, Vonzell should have been in the top 2, Carrie didn't deserve it...it makes me feel that she got there from her body possibly.
