 I was thinking I was going to get a pretty decent set of headphones, the frequency range looked okay and theprice was good. Not so.  As far as sound quality, unless your just buying these just to hear any sound, it will work. I found the bass to be very tinny, the bass on my free set of headphones with my cheap CD player had richer bass. Even the free earbuds that come with the set have better bass, however they don't have much of a good high-end, therefore they don't sound all that great either. The treble is pretty good, but as an overall sound these were a no-go because of the tinny bass.  As far as comfortability, these are good as long as your into listening for three songs. After about ten minutes of use, my ears were beat red from these headphones. The plastic is fully unadjustable so you can't get a good fit no matter what. Maybe a open/close design would be good (like the Panasonics I have, they're broken unfortunately) but this is just chaotic on how bad these feel.  Durability, I think they will last in  plastic tub for a few years. I won't be able to find a use for these. I would return these but they were $5 and it's not even worth the trip.  These headphones are pretty much a waste of the $8 you pay for them (luckily I only paid $5). The sound and comfort are both so unbelievably poor that I can not recommend these.
