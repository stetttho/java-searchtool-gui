 I like these headphones. I'll break them down best and worst.  Pros: - Long cord which can be helpul at times. - Durable/You can count on Sony. - Great for sound. Good bass and treble. - Great for traveling.  Cons: - Long cord which can also be a pain at times. - Somewhat uncomfortable. - (not really a con but a comment) Why do they say studio monitor at the top of the headphones?  Pros - 4 Cons - 2  Pros are 4/6 = 67% 4 stars  So, they aren't excellent, but they are good. Worth getting them if you want hi-fi or they look good to you. Though, I think the HD-202 and the UR15C headphones better. If you're really picky about comfort, I get one of the two I just said.  P.S. COMFORT TIP-  Take off the earform things. They feel fine, but you may want to put something on them afterwards.
