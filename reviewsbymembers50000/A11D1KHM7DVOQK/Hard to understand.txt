 I just couldn't get this book. I was at the library, looking for a good book. "Dive" just seemed interesting on the back cover, so, I checked it out. The moment I read the first paragraph, I knew it was trouble. They had not explained the characters yet, they haven't even started with a person's name. Just "I" "you" "they" "the". Those are word that are really hard to understand when reading the first few chapters of a book. I checked it in, and got another book. Really hard to understand. Is it a sequal? The book didn't say. Then yet, even other sequal books I've read were easier to read. I do not recommend this book.
