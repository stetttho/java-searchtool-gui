 Material Girl (a.k.a. Madonna)'s new album "Confessions on a Dance Floor" does not have much substance, however, it's production is very up to par. One of the best songs of the album is "Hung Up", which uses a sample from one of the biggest dance groups, ABBA, with a simple yet addictive beat. "Get Together" is another pick, with almost monsterous electronica beats. "Let It Will Be" is a nice dance with a ballad touch with strings. Madonna also does a tribute to New York with a crazy beat to get the actual feel of the live in New York.  However, the lyrics aren't the best. This is likely due to the fact that it's dance music, and strong lyrics aren't truly needed. Most lyrics are about breakups, very uninteresting, however, with the production over it, most people will careless. Lyrics in "Hung Up" are sub-par, saying that's she's "hanging up" on someone who doesn't care for her. A similar meaning is in the song "Sorry".  Madonna shows that her production levels are almost up to her debut, however there isn't a large amount of substance. I would still recommend it for a dance or fun kind of record, or just chillin' with some friends. 4 stars.  Replay Value: Medium Child Appeal: Low Teen Appeal: Medium Adult Appeal: Medium
