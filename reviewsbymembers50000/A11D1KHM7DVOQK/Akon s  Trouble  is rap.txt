 First off, yes, Akon produced his own album. This is very rare today because so many artists have other producers and take the credit for it. Instead, Akon takes credit for his own credit.  A majority of the album is about being in jail ("Locked Up", "Ghetto", "Lonely", and "I Won't"), life afterwards ("Trouble Nobody" and "Showout") and getting girls ("Bananza Belly Dancer", "When The Time's Right", and "Don't Let Up". The good thing that worried me of what would happen is that the subject of jail would be repeated again and again, though Akon decides to mix it up a bit. The gangsta beat songs "Gangsta" and "When The Time's Right" prove that they are mostly medicore and Akon's style isn't for that.   The CD features "Locked Up", the first single, which on the album is the version without Styles P (though there is a remix with Styles P). This is nice because the Styles P remix is awful, and makes it too rough. Which leads to the fact of why the gangsta songs are medicore. Because Akon is an R&B. Okay, so he decides to rap, there's nothing wrong with it. The problem here is that you know, you have to...know how to do that. The "Bananza Belly Dancer" song isn't too bad, actually is quite good and danceable, with some pretty catchy lyrics, but "Gangsta", "Showout", "I Won't", and "When The Time's Right" are very medicore and are unlistenable without a skip button.  Most of the disc is R&B though. Songs like "Ghetto", "Pot Of Gold" (which is the true ballad of the disc), and "Lonely" are good examples of shining R&B on "Trouble", but that basically breaks the rest of the CD, making half unlistenable, and the other half some of the best songs released in a while.  Overall, Akon's "Trouble" is a nice CD full of smoothly-styled R&B, but with medicore rap. Though, "Trouble" is definitely worth the buy, because there are some wonderful songs on the disc.
