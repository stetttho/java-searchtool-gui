 Stiller and Aniston's pairing is never believable and their chemistry never comes along to rescue the film from its flimsy foundation. It's not like there's a classic comedy hiding behind these crude attempts at humor, but the elements of 'Along Came Polly' otherwise aren't so noxious. 'Along Came Polly' is a hit-and-miss affair with more flat moments than comic onesous. The result is a disappointment, yet it's not something the actors will want to remove from their resumes. Watching these two go at it is almost as uncomfortable as observing the 60-something Woody Allen nuzzling a beauty less than half his age. I recommend renting this movie first before buying it.
