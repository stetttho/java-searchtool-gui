 This CD player is not really that good. As Memorex is the #1 brand of CD-Rs, the have a lot of trouble with television sets and CD players. The CD player has lasted only 2 months. After that 2 months, the top of the CD player would not close. I had to use invisible tape to fix it, and now it looks ridiculous. Other people have had the same problem with this and other Memorex brand CD players. The AM/FM radio is a nice addition. The radio does have a lot of static. Not static like "Oh well, I could move it a few inches and there would be no fuzz." They kind of static that will make the radio (FM really has this problem) fail completely. There says there is skip protection, but it takes 45 secs to read the tracks of the CD (I think it takes longer than advertised, like 60 secs), and then you have to wait another 45 secs when you skip something. THAT IS NOT SKIP-PROTECTION!!! Skip-protection is something that makes your CD player not skip AT ANY TIME. Whether you change the track or not. The headphones that comes with it are [useless]. I would buy an extra pair. Overall, I think Memorex should stick to blank CD-Rs and CD-RWs until they can make a good CD player.  CD Player - 4/5 Radio - 3/5 Headphones - 1/5 Skip Protection - 1/5 Construction - 2/5 Overall - 2/5 (2.2/5)
