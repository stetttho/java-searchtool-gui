 Sim City 2000 was an absolute dissappointment. It was extremely boring, and tiring.  Then came Sim City 3000, my favoite, with much more enchanced style and didn't look like a Game Boy game. It was very fun, and challenging at the same time.  Now, were up to Sim City 4. First thing, which is kind of weird, is it's name. Shouldn't it be Sim City 4000? Whatever, more about the game. Ok, I admit, my computer isn't really all that great. I have Windows XP, but with a SLOW 40GB hard drive, and only a 256MB memory card. But, still, all of my programs run fine, including Sim City 3000. But, not Sim City 4. Sim City 4 on my computer is almost unplayable. The game is slower than you would ever expect. It takes minutes sometimes for it to unfreeze. It does take up a lot of computer space, but still, it runs very choppy. The gameplay is much more difficult in Sim City 4 than 3000. Now, you have two modes, God and Regular. Also, the game is too challenging. The game expects you to have EVERYTHING just perfect. Things cost more, making more difficult to play. But not a fun kind of difficult, a kind of difficult that makes you want to take out the CD and crack it in half. The game does have it's high points though. The graphics are just outstanding, and far better than 3000. And, if your computer isn't slow, it can be kind of fun. But, if you see Sim City 3000 standing next to Sim City 4 for the same price, grab the 3000.
