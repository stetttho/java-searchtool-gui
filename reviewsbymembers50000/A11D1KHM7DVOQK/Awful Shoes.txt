 I bought these shoes because my 8 1/2 sized Adio Callicuts were getting old, and the shoes were too small. I wanted to buy another pair of awesome Adio Callicuts, but everywhere I looked, Adio Callicuts were not avalaible. So, I tried Vans. Vans is a company that makes shoes for althetic activities. The look of the Maestro was nice, and my feet are big, and the Maestro looked big enough to fit my foot. I tooked them home, laced them, tied them, walked, and tomorrow, I am returning them.  The shoe must be new, because I took back a 9 1/2 for a 9. Surely enough, both shoes were too big. Not big in size, but in width. The laces don't go up far enough, so when you are walking, the upper part of the shoe with air goes down into your foot, causing pain. And I was only using the Maestro to walk, I can't imagine how awful these would be for althetics. Save your money!
