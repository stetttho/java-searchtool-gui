 I went to my friend's house and to notice, he had purchased a 20GB Ipod. I asked him if I could try it out. I noticed that the Ipod earbuds were not pluged in. Instead, were the Sony H.EAR headphones. I thought, why not rate these headphones on amazon.com? I already looked at them and knew they were gonna be bad. They were cheap earbuds that had a hook on them. Of course, the sound is going to be trebly and they will be uncomfortable.  ... Not so.  The sound quality, I thought, was excellent. The bass was kinda deep, but not as good as overhead headphones or the closed-ear kind. The trebles were very clear. For sound quality, especially for earbuds, was amazing.  Actually, the first thing I thought when I put these on was "These are very comfortable, and fit just right." Unlike other clip-style headphones. The plastic isn't adjustable, but it is bendable so it stays on your ear in a comfortable manner.  These are obviously portable, due to the fact they're small earbuds with a hook on the end of them. They each are about a size of an overhead headphone speaker.  The cost is about right. I don't think they are an extreme deal or anything, but $10 for these is quite right.  I think I'm going to buy these soon. Ok, if you've read my other reviews, I also own the HL150, MDR101LP, and MDRG42LP. Well, I don't use the MDRG42LP because the are so uncomfortable. And, the MDR101LP I can probably sell to oneo f my friends for maybe $1.  Anyway, you could carless about that. So, these headphones are great for the price. But warning, do not buy if you have extremely big ears, they will likely keep falling off. Look at the amazon.com image first too. But, I think these headphones will fit almost everyone, and that shouldn't be too much of a deal.  P.S. I also found it interesting that the warranty doesn't cover acts of God, accident, misuse, or abuse. WTH? That basically elimanates the warranty right there. Is there any other way these things can break?
