 My friend has this printer and he says its horrible! The print quality is awfull. Though, it's speed is fast, this is a horrible quality printer. Two of my friends on Compaq computers. One put it in the garage a year ago and has been happy with his new one. My other friend suffers from having one with Windows 98 (not to mention incredibly slow) and is going to get a new one soon. Compaq I guess is just a horrible company.
