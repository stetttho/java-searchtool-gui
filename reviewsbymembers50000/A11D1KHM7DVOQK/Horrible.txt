 Why does anyone like this song! It's just another bad singer. She doesn't even sing. She only sings in the chorus (badly) and squeeks on "...you know exactly what I mean." If you don't believe me, then follow these easy steps. 1. Buy garbage. 2. Keep reciept with proof of purchase of garbage. 3. Listen to garbage. 4. Return garbage. THAT SIMPLE!!! So, don't buy this. Buy something worthy like, Hoobastank or Usher or even Britney Spears because they are all better than Maria Mena.
