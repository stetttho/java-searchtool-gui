 Re-releasing album is great. Albums 10 to 30 years old can be remastered to sound great and to be used in a CD format.  Re-releasing albums can be a problem as well. Sony, Artista, and Columbia especially. Come on, the In This Skin CD was released 2 years ago. But wait, it was re-released a year ago. And it's released AGAIN! Yes, again people. What does that tell you? This is just pure marketing. Why release CDs 2 years of their age? This is beyond me.  The CD itself is quite nice. Song like "You Don't Have To Let Go" and "In This Skin" show her vocal improvement of the past years. And some dance songs like "Forbidden Fruit", still show vocals. The weaknesses are in "My Way Home" and "Angels" which still say vocals are not totally matured, but are still there.  This CD gets two stars. 4 Stars for the original album, then -2 stars for releasing the same thing twice. Are they expectng people to buy the same thing twice? I only bought one copy of "In This Skin", the first re-released version with the DVD extra. But nothing else. This proves Columbia's and Sony's totally ridiculous greed.
