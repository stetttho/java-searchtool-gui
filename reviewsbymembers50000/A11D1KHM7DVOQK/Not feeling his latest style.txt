 I don't know what happened? Sure, he went into the spirit thing, but man what happened? Not only has he changed spiritually, but vocally and in style. Ma$e used to be a regular rap artist, just one of the best around. Who could forget his wonderful part in the song, "Mo Money Mo Problems"? And that was just a part of a song! Now, after 5 years, everything changed. His vocals sound extremly weak in every song. And what is with his style? On his "Welcome Back" vid, he wears what? What was that? A dollar store T-Shirt and cheap partially ripped jeans? Really, something happened to this guy, and I know it had absoultely nothing to do with him being spiritual. But the main question is if you should buy or not. If you own any Ma$e CD, just throw this in with your collection. If you don't, forget it. It's really not worth it.
