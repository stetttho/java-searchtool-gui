 Ugh how much I hate this series! They take singles from 1 year ago (I mean they were at #1 1 year ago), have out-of-tune adults that make me think my hamster can make a record, and then have 5 year olds that sing that aren't no American Juniors! Edit out everything (even words that aren't bad), put on a horrible cover and having 20 CDs staring at you in your nearest CD store. Ugh! Who wants this crap! Adults don't want this unless they are deaf and don't know what "kidz" means. Teens don't want this because I am a teen and I'm sick of seeing it in stores. Kids don't want it considering an earlier review saying "...why do they call it kid's bop...". Baby's don't know what music is. WTF? This is useless crap bop. Oh, did I forget to mention they are already fliming the commerical for Kidz Bop 7? When will people notice that this is crap and complete medicorocity? Just buy the Now series! Now 18 is coming out on March 15, and none of the CDs in that series have explicit lyrics. Crap Bop, when will it end???   Also, if these really are for "kidz", then why do we have sex, drugs, and violence lyrics in these songs. I heard Modest Mouse's "Float On" is going to be on Kidz Bop 7. They sing more drug related lyrics than 50 Cent.  Bottomline: Buy the Now series if who your buying it for is above 6 years old. If not, pop music as a whole may be still too explicit for her/him.
