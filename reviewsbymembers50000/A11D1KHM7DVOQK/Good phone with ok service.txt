 Let me first say that this is a good phone. It has web service, a camera, games, and other good features. I bought a phone with Sprint. I'm kinda glad I did There service is was ok because I've had a few problems with Sprint. A lot better than my friend's Alltel phone. Here is the good and the bad.  Pros & Cons  PROS  - A phone book that lets you have speed dial up to 300. - Instant messaging that works good. - A fast web service. - High quality camera.  CONS  - The web only has a few websites, but still very useful at times. - Ringer tone downloads are low quality and sound cheesy with such a good phone. - Games are sometimes expensive. - Sprint isn't the best service out there. Verizon Wireless and T Mobile are better.  I somewhat recommend this phone.
