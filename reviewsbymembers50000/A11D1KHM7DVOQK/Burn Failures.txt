 When I got my Buslink 52x24x52 CD burner (Christmas 2002), I also recieved this 25-pack Imation CD-Rs. I just couldn't wait to burn a bunch of mixes, and songs I downloaded from Real.  The burner also came bundled with Nero 5.  I loaded 18 songs (around 60 minutes) of songs I wanted to burn mixes for.  Instead of burning 18 songs, it burned only 16. I looked at the Nero screen, which stated that the burning process failed. I was so dissappointed.  About 3 CDs later, it finally worked. Though, I still had problems with burning CDs.  I tried playing some of the mixes and CDs I burned on my CD player (at that time I had a Sony Walkman, I can't remember the model number).  30% of the CDs would either say "NO DISC", or it would go to a track and the CD would just keep spinning, and would not play.  I couldn't stand the imatation CD-Rs so much, that I went to Wal-Mart and purchased a 50-pack of Colored Maxell CD-Rs. I couldn't be happier.  So, I wouldn't recommend these. I would recommend CD-Rs from Maxell and TDK, as those seem to work the best for me.
