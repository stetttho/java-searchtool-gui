 I bought these dividers a while back at Walgreens when I needed dividers for my school work because I did not have one with my binder. The colors are indeed cool, and still are vibrant even after inserting white paper labels inside them. What I didn't like was that they only lasted about two months. The first one to go was the front one. I wasn't suprised that the front one was the first one to go, but it's that it only was two months...I expect longer lasting dividers than that. The bottom ring broke, though this was fixable. About a few days later, the top ring was broken. This was also fixable, but looked very tacky. Afterwards, the back one just broke off. That was barely fixable, but it worked, for about a day. Then the front one just broke off. Then all of them either broke off or they only had one or two rings left. I don't keep that much papers in my binder, maybe around 200 pages. That does seem like a lot, but that's only about a pack of paper. Very dissappointed with these. I will be buying another brand next time Avery!!!
