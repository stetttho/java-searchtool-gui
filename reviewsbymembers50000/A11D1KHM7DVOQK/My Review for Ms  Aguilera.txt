 Ok, let me start by saying this is a pretty good album, just as long as you don't mind a few ballads here and there. Christina Aguilera is a very talented person. Unlike Britney, she can sing, though, Britney's voice is mostly manufactured. One thing I would like to point out, which I have already mentioned, are the ballads. Well, I know this album is pop, but if you don't like ballads, you may want to head to the Britney direction. If you do like some ballads, you've hit the right CD. I'm not saying the CD is loaded with ballads, but there are a few. Christina Aguilera sings her songs in a heartful, yet enjoyable and danceable way. This album also is a good album to keep listening to, because it never seems to get old. This album feels to me to be one of the top albums of 1999, and I still listen to it now in 2004. If you still haven't purchased this album in 1999, now is your chance. Take a try with Ms. Aguilera.
