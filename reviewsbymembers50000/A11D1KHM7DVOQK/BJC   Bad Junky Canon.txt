 I really don't like this printer. Though, it's good in some ways. The printer doesn't use that much ink, so you don't have to buy printer ink very often. Plus, it does a quite good job cleanig itself.  Now for the negatives, which are much more important than the positives. First off, I have a LOT of paper feed problems. A lot of times when I put 5 sheets in it takes the whole entire 5 sheets. Another problem is the print-out quality. Even on the best setting and on high quality paper, the print is still low-quality. It has white lines all over the picture. Also, man is it SLOW! It's the slowest printer ever! It takes more than 3 minutes to print out something that covers half of the paper. Half! The whole paper takes 6-7 minutes depending on the color of the document or picture you choose to print. Of course, there is a draft mode (a.k.a. poor quality), which is pretty fast (about 30 second a full sheet of paper), but is almost unusable because it's quality is horrid! It has white lines on the paper and it has little ink on it. Even though it does a good job cleaning, cleaning takes a little while too. Also, this printer is not new. Were not in the 90's anymore people! There are probably printers for lower price that work much better. Which leads to my next complaint. Install on Windows 2000, Windows XP, Mac OS 9, and Mac OS X are a pain! The operating systems listed above are pretty new and aren't supported by the OS, so it's a PAIN to install or uninstall.  Overall:  Pros:  - Don't have to buy ink often. - Good cleaning.  Cons:  - Bad paper feed. - Bad quality print-out. - Very slow at printing and cleaning. - There are better printers for less price. - Bad install. - Bad uninstall.  Recommendation: If you see it at a yard sale for less than $20 and you don't care much for quality or features, buy it. But other than that, DON'T BUY! Not worth $70.
