 These pencil have some nice lead. The lead is thick, and hard, but not too hard. The pencil sharpens easily. These are things thst earn this pencil 2 stars.  The eraser doesn't work! How on Earth can you work without and eraser? It just makes a bunch of smudges, making the eraser lead itself.  Paper-Mate makes other great pencils. So don't buy these. I think they already discontinued them due to the poor eraser.
