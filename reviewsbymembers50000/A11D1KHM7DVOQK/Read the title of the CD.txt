 Ok, believe it or not I only listened to part of this CD. Yes, one of my first reviews to not listen to the full CD. But there is a reason for this. I think I got a good enough idea on how bad The Massacre is.  The first thing that bothers me is the awful, wack beats on The Massacre. Come on! Listen to "This Is 50" and try to tell me this beat is good, because it's not.  The second thing that comes to mind are the boring, second-grade lyrics. "Clicky clank money goes in my bank." "Get in my car b****!". What was that all about?  "Ski Mask Way", "Hate It Or Love It", and "Candy Shop" are the only songs on this CD worth listening to. If you own a radio, you'd probably heard "Candy Shop" at least 100 times this week. And if you own Game's CD, there's "Hate It Or Love It". If this CD has only one song on this CD that is good, my question to you is why even bother?  Replay Value: Closet Storage Child Appeal: Low Teen Appeal: High Adult Appeal: Medium
