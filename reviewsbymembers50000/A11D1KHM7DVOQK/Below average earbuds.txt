 These earbuds are not that good.  1) The comfortability of these were kinda painful. I have to shove them up my ear to get any sound.  2) The sound quality isn't that good. The bass is only ok, and sounds bloated at times. The treble seems to high-pitched for some reason.  3) The earbuds are not very durable. The left side broke within one week.  4) The cost for these are very expensive for the quality you get.  Overall, I've had Jensen products in the past. I honestly have to say, Jensen is not a very good company for headphones. The JM10, JB6, JM25, and others have flaws, and only ok sound. I would only recommend Jensen for cost, since they have such a low price for everything they sell. But, I guess the reason they are so inexpensive because the quality is lacking.
