 I usually don't review discontinued items I own, but this item is so bad that I probably should. My old Walkman before I got this one (forgot the model #, it was excellent) was beat up very badly, it was on it's fourth year and I decided to pick up another one. I picked this up in spring 2003 since it had the same features, only a different look.  I wish I would've looked around a bit before buying. No problems in the first month, everything played well. CDs to CD-Rs to CD-RWs, everything played flawless with excellent sound quality. Then things started to happen with CD-Rs and CD-RWs. I was playing a 20-track CD-R, and the last 2 tracks would skip like crazy nutso. I took out the CD-R and it didn't have any scratches whatsoever. I tried burning the music again...same problems. I played the CD-R in my computer and my old Walkman without any problems, so yes, it's the player. For then it was OK since I didn't have that many large track CDs. Then it keeped getting worse, not on the end tracks, but the whole CD. Then my old Walkman would play CDs way better than this. That was unacceptable. Then it came to the point that it wouldn't play anything burned. Funny, the SAME issue as an earlier reviewer (peenkparrot). I also tried cleaning the lens, first with a Memorex CD Lens Cleaner (with no result) and the rubbing alochol swab treatment that Sony recommends (with no result).  Otherwise, the sound was decent, crystal clear. The buttons were easy, small but easy to learn. The headphones were decent. The CD player was durable, it's still in good condition (as far as the plastic goes).  But as far as buying this, a definite NO!!! I have been trying CD players for a while now, and my favorites are the Panasonics (though I own an iRiver 20GB MP3 player that I use 99% of the time while listening to music). Unrecommended!!!
