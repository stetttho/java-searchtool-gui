 Two years after their re-release of their self-titled album, the All American Rejects form into a more pop-rock band.  The CD starts with the hit song "Dirty Little Secret", which has recieved massive airplay on most pop stations. The song is about secret relationships, which is easily described with the lyrics.  I'll keep you my dirty little secret Don't tell anyone or you'll be just another regret I hope that you can keep it Dirty little secret, who has to know?  The CD then goes to "Stab My Back", about sharing someone. At this point you can tell most of these songs are about relationships until the next song "Move Along", a pop-rock friendly song "Move Along", which is a "don't give up" song.   When all you got to keep is strong Move along, move along, like I know ya do And even when your hope is gone Move Along, Move Along, just to make it through  "Move Along" is the next single which should do very well with it's outstanding lyrics and fun, catchy rhythm.  Other highlights are the fun, catchy, and danceable "Change Your Mind", the soothing and powerful ballad "Straitjacket Feeling", and the fast paced pop-rock song "11:11 P.M.".  This album should put a smile on fans of pop-rock fans. If you like it then I highly recommend Fall Out Boy and Plain White T's.
