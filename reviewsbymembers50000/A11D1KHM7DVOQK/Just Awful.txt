 First, let me say that I really tried to like this. You know, the beach, the life...maybe. This show is just boring. What it really is is a bunch of hot, rich, teen girls and their life experiences. I'm sorry, but this has got to be awarded for the most boring reality show of 2004. Mainly, it's about Lo, Kristen, and Carrie going through Senior year of high school, going through relationships and life.  I don't know, but watching teen girls grow-up is boring. The thing that probably makes this boring is that not only have we seen it over and over, but they have nothing odd in their live. They basically live their life by "the book", and do nothing abnormal, and just be the rich, wealthy girls they are. All they do is go to school, have relationships, hang with friends, and party and become sluts.  Like I said before, I really tried to like this, but Laguna Beach is just a boring show about teenage girls's lifes.
