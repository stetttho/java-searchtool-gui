 I was pretty much looking for any inexpensive wireless mouse and keyboard. I saw this to be one of the most inexpensive (I won't say cheap) ones avaliable.  As far as communciation, so far it has been excellent. The mouse took a restart to connect but everything connected and went smoothly.  The keyboard is pretty much your standard keyboard but with additional features. The media feature does not seem to work, my guess is that it works for MusicMatch since it is on the CD. The play/pause button will pause and play your music, this worked in all of my music programs (Windows Media and RealPlayer). The mute and voulme controls worked perfectly. There is a favorites button to open your browser's favorites, the e-mail button open Outlook Express, and the www button goes to your home page.  The mouse is your basic mouse with a scroll. So far it has been very accurate with the reciever, though don't be too suprised if your photo editing gets rough a few times. It is optical and it does not need a trackball and uses a laser.  One of the negatives is the battery life. It is around the area were AA batteries last, which is 15-20 hours. This is ok for some users, but for people using the computer daily for a few hours, that would mean you would have to replace the mouse around 2 times a week, which could get costy. The keyboard doesn't run the entire time you use the computer so it shouldn't be too bad.  It is compatible with Windows 95 and above as well as the latest Mac operating systems. The keyboard can be run on USB or the PS/2 Port but the mouse must use the PS/2. The USB is the slim long port and the PS/2 port (usually colored) is the circle port.  As far as the CD, it contains software but chances are your computer has them already from the Control Panel. There is some adware along with the CD as well. I wold just leave the install CD alone and just plug-and-play.  Overall, this set does have a few quirks, but it is definitely worth the low-cost. 4 stars.
