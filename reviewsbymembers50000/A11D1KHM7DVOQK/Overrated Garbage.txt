 Calling this song cool or good is a mistake. This is a TERRIBLE song indeed. The lyrics are stupid, none of the artists feature their usual good flow, and anyone wanting to talk about teeth for four minutes is definitely inhuman. The beat is ridiculously overrated and predictable, while it is slightly dsnceable, it still lacks a lot. The lyrics also copy straight out from "Soldier" by Destiny's Child which is a much better song. I've seen better work from all of these artists (Nelly, Paul, Ali P) seperately. This song is definitely overrated and copied DC's track.
