 Ok, I know this was released, like, 5 years ago, but I have never reviewed this. So, I will now.  1.Smashmouth - All Star: A- It's a pretty good song. It was overplayed, but now, you don't even remember it.  2.Lenny Kravitz - American Woman: C+ I thought this song was good, now it's just average and annoying.  3.Blink 182 - What's My Age Again?: A Great song...wish it was longer.  4.Enrique Iglesias - Bailamos: D It use to be fun, then I listened to it more, and it as annoying as hell.  5.Britney Spears - Sometimes: B+ Pretty good for Britney!  6.BSB - All I have to give: F Backstreet Boys is a no no.  7.K-Ci & Jo-Jo - Tell Me It's Real: C I didn't like this song at first, but it grew on me, but I would still like to listen to something else.  8.Fatboy Slim - The Rockafeller Skank: A+ I loved this song, but I didn't get the part that sounded like a lawnmower???  9.Limp Bizkit - Nookie: A- It was a little poppy for Limp Bizkit. Whatever, it's their best song made to date.  10.Garbage - Special: B I like the song. Nonetheless. Somewhat average.  11.R.Kelly - If I Could Turn Back The Hands Of Time: A I would have give this an F if it didn't grow on me.  12.Ideal - Get Gone: F Ideal should get gone out of the music industry.  13.Chante Moore - Chante's Got A Man: C I really tryed to like this song but I guess it's just your average boring R&B song.  14.Blessid Union of Souls - Hey Leonardo: A+ Sounds like Bowling For Soup w/o gross lyrics. Awesome!  15.Oleander - Why I'm Here: D I don't know? Why are you here?  16.Case - Happily Ever After: B- It's ok, but not the best.  17.98 Degrees - Hardest Thing: A I know, 98 Degrees is a boy band, but I thought it was pretty good.  18.Fastball - Out of my Head: A+ One of the best!  CD. Various Artists - Now 3 Overall Grade For CD: B-  So, it's not the best of the Now series, but it's worth picking up.
