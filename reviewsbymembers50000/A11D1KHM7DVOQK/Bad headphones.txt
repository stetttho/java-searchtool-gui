 These headphones are not very good at all. First, they do not stay on my ear at all. Just walking one inch of the ground or turning around, they will fall off. The sound quality is pretty good, though I've seen better. I guess you can say they are portable too. Overall, I'd not get these or other clip phones, they fall off too easy. Just get lightweight headphones, like the UR5 and the MDR101LP. Or, get closed headphones like the UR15C or the MDRV150. They stay on your ear and have the same or maybe better sound quality than these.
