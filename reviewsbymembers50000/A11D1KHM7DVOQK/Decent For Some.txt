 This printer came with my friend's HP computer. The print quality is good but there are a few downsides.  As far as photo quality, it is very clear and crisp. Maybe not as good as store made printouts but good enough for most. Pictures look good to me but they aren't completely perfect. Text is very good and no streaks here unless you have a low ink cartridge. The copy quality is good enough, and the scanner works better than most.  But the true downside is its interface. This printer has paper jams often, and let me remind you, it does this when it is rolling, which means if you get it jammed usually you have to pull it out slow or you'll have to take the printer apart. The printer drivers are annoying, when some pages don't print at all because of a paper jam or no paper, sometimes you have to reinstall the drivers on the CD. The instructions are pretty unclear for beginners, intermediates and above would be able to install without instructions. The cartridges suck ink like muthafu(ka, and you have to clean them often or you will get some free streaks along with your print. However, I enjoy that the printer tells you on the computer if you need to replace your cartridge, but usually at this time your print-outs look terrible. And beware the dreaded red exclamation point on the printer, it's evil.  The printer will be OK for some advanced users but beginner users should look at other companies.
