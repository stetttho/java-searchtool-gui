 I was looking for clip headphones because I wanted something portable I could take to class that don't allow CD players (not that I was going to use it...just that I didn't want bulk. I thought the Philips Clip Headphones would be a great deal. Small headphones, good comfort, good sound.  Ugh...bad idea.  The reason is that it's almost the exact opposite of what is advertised.  1) They're not clip headphones. They just have a plastic thing that goes around your ear, that is extremely painful unless you have very small ears. There is also no way to adjust the plastic piece. Only by pulling on it really hard to accomodate your ear, and then they are painful. The headphones are hard to put on.  2) What bass boost? I also own the HL150 from Philips, and that has louder, more bassed, clearer sound than these. And these are designed for good sound. Huh? I don't know about you, but all I'm getting is a small-bassed, unclear, tinny sound.   3) These things are not cheap! At my Target, I paid a lot for these! $15 may not sound like a lot to an audiophile, but everyone should agree that's a lot of money down the drain.  OVERALL - If your getting these for sound, go for the HL150. I was extremely pleased with those. Or, if you really want clip, try the Panasonics. They have an adjustable clip, and sound a bit better too.
