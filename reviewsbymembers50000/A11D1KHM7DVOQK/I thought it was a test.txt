 First off, why in the WWF is Missy experimenting? She made 5 or 6 albums (maybe more or less, not a long enough fan to know). You would think she found her style by now, though maybe she's trying to get a bigger audience, which probably is working.  The album starts with an intro, than moves to "Pass That Dutch". The song does have a nice production and beat, but it's only satisfactory for Missy E. Another similar song is "Wake Up".  Next up is "Keep It Movin'", which I'm guessing is some sort of R&B experiment, that turns out weak. The vocals...meh! They sound pretty average, maybe a little below that. The production so far has been good, but not as crisp as earlier albums. Though, the production also seems much different, because the rap seems to be getting more dancier and not so much rough or aggressive. Then we get to "Is This Our Last Time?". It's seems like another R&B attempt, but it's more rappier and dancier than the last track.  "I'm Really Hot" is probably one of my favorites of the album. It sounds similar to the tune of "Gossip Folks", but it's not annoying. The production is once again not the crispist from Missy and her producers, though still fun and listenable.  Now we're at another bad R&B song; "Dats What I'm Talkin'". I don't think much people will say that after listen. Just another song like "Keep It Movin'".  The song "Don't Be Cruel" make me wonder who this producer was. It sounds like it was leftovers from Britney Spears's sucky album "In The Zone". And, the vocals somewhat match. Hopefully, that's the end of that.  "Toyz" is probably one of the most unique song of the CD. It really did remind me of a 70's dance song, sort of disco-ish. Anyway, this song was quite good.  I wouldn't be suprised if someone heard "Let It Bump", they would think about "Work It". "Work It" was excellent, so this is definently good.  "Pump It Up" sounds like it was done in a basement with a cheap Casio Keyboard. The production is horrible, and vocals and lyrics don't help it.  "It's Real" sounded like it came from Kelly Rowland or something. It's a nice song, and yes, it is real.  "Let Me Fix My Weave" is the worst song on the CD. The production is awful, the vocals are awful, lyrics mean nothing. Nothing on this song seems to be good.  "Spelling Bee" is another unique song that has an old school beat rather than a normal beat. It does somewhat fail, but it is pretty danceable.  The last song is "I'm Not Perfect". It is unique, and has another 70's beat, making me think Missy's going disco.  Though the CD's production wasn't the best, and it was an experimental album, Missy E delievers some good tunes. Hopefully on her next CD, she will do what she does best...ORIGINALITY!
