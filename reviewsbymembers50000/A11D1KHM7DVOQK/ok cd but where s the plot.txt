 Every cd should have a plot. Well... Totally Hits 2002-The plot is hits. Now That's What I Call Music!-It's what u call music. Shrek Soundtrack-Music from the motion picture Shrek.(duh) Top 10 Now-Well... is top the plot? is 10 the plot? is now tne plot? NO. Well,the only idea of plot is the cd is top 10 music. But wait,it's not top 10 music so... Why did they make it? Is it a series? What is the plot? Where did the songs come from? Maybe from the billboard 3 years ago? If u know the questions than GOOD! You know the plot,but u must be pretty smart too know the plot. i hope this helped
