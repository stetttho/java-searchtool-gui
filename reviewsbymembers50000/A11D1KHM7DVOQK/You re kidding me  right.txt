 This has to be the worst game ever released for PS2. The graphics are ok, sometimes the tires sink into the pavement. This game is no fun!!! The cars are crappy, cheap, and slow cars. At least they could have included regular cars, you know, not "Peanut" or "Froggy" as names for cars. And top speed of these are about 45 mph. Honestly, you would have more fun waiting at an intersection of traffic for 30 minutes than playing this game for 30 minutes. Try "Crazy Taxi" and "Need For Speed Underground Hot Pursuit" if you want good racing andcar games.
