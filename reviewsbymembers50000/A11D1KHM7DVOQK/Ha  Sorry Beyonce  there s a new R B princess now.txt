 1) Goodies 4/5 Okay, we've all heard this. Ok, it's good...bottomline.  2)1,2 Step 5/5 One of my favs of the album, it's just a very hot dance track that WILL keep you moving.  3)Thug Style 4/5 Good song. A bit slower than I'd like, but hey, it's R&B people.  4)Hotline 3/5 I dunno. I just didn't like it much.  5)Oh 3/5 Another one I didn't really like much. It fit Luda very well, but it's just not Ciara's way, man.   6)Pick Up the Phone 5/5 This song is just awesome, probably my favorite song of the entire album. Very anceable and fun.  7)Lookin at you 5/5 Another awesome fun and danceable track. Another one of my favs.  8)Ooh Baby 4/5 I dunno, but I hear a voice change, but in a good way though, but I just don't like the beat choice of this song. Still hot!  9)Next to You 3/5 It's a good meaning and it has a nice beat, but hear voice sounds like she's reading a happily ever after story to 5 year olds or something.  10)And I 5/5 Love how the song flows though so smoothly with her voice. It's just overall awesome.  11)Other Chicks 2/5 Other people will like it, but it's just not what I'ma looking for.  12)The Title 4/5 Good song, but a big standout in the beat.  13)Goodies Remix 2/5 What is with T.I.'s lyrics and voice?! Congradulations T.I., for making a great song sound awful!  Overall CD 4/5 I luv this CD!!!!!!! I'm so glad I bought, even though it's only 4 stars. Mainly becuase I just bought the CD and haven't got into the R&B slow style yet. Much better than Beyonce's borfest album. (Beyonce = boring, Ciara = Fun, danceable, great flow of voice w/beat). Get this CD!!!!!
