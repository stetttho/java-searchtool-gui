 I hate to say it, but other than the hit-single "Don't Cha", I'm wondering how they actually recieved a record deal.  The first song "Don't Cha", as well as one of summer's biggest songs, is definitely hot, with one of the most catchiest beats (which was actually preformed by Tori Alamaze). The lyrics sure don't make girls happy, "Don't cha wish your girlfriend was hot like me? Don't cha wish your girlfriend was a freak like me.", but it's definittely a cool club jam.  Sadly, that's really the only thing worthy on here. "Stick Wit U" is a great song, similar to a Mariah Carey song, otherwise the Pussycat Dolls can't sing for their life, unfortunately. "Buttons" is one of the lamest song I've heard all year, along with some of the worst vocal talent...and I mean come on...BUTTONS??? Along with that, they've done the worst covers of "Hot Stuff" and "Tainted Love" I've ever heard of. "Beep" is just an annoying sex song that the Ying Yang Twins would be better off doing, again, they can't sing their way out of a bag. The beat is totally lame and wack, he!! I could probably do better and I have no production skills whatsoever.  Though "Don't Cha" was a hot, summer, club track, after you hear the full CD, you'll be singing "Don't cha which you didn't buy PCD". 1 star.
