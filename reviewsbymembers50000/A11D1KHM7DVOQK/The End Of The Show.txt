 Before I start this review, I have to ask, is 2005 one of the biggest years for artists to retire? Just seems like it to me. As for "Curtain Call", I was fairly dissappointed in song selections. Yes, you do have some hits, but not all. If you look up Eminem's singles, there is many singles that were missed. Seems like some company named Interscope (they own Shady) only alouded a one disc.  However, for the songs, this complication is great. Whether your interested about his life, his beefs, or the hilarious songs, they're all on here. My favorites on the disc are "My Name Is", his first song and an intro to his career, which is downright hilarious, every Eminem fan should remember the first laugh they got out of that. Another one of my picks is "Stan", where one of Eminem's fans trys to copy Eminem's life and kilsl their girlfriend. "When I'm Gone", just in my opinion, is one of Eminem's best songs lyrically. "Rejoice everytime you hear my voice, just know that, I'm looking down at your smile." Other good songs include "Way I Am" which is about people ocmplaining about his style and that he's white, "Lose Yourself" about having to leave his family to have a chance to be a big music star, "Sing for the Moment" which is about complaining about MTV and that he admires his fans, "Without Me" which is one of Em's most hilarious songs, "Like Toy Soldiers" about his Murder Inc beef (interesting because Ja Rule's Greatest Hits is out now and doesn't seem to be selling a lot of copies), and "Mockingbird" about Hailie. I don't think there is a song on here that is "bad". Really the only reason this didn't get five stars is that it didn't include "Encore", "Just Don't Give a F***", "Still Don't Give a F***", and other hits. If your a new Eminem fan or if your a big fan and don't have a lot of his CDs, you should get this under the Christmas tree.
