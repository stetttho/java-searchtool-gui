 Ok, Crash Nitro Kart (basically CTR 2) is a great game. But, the best thing about that I thought was crazy were the graphics. They were so crazy and they looked so real. The music was a bit of techno, and it had fine sound quality. One thing I do want to point out on the bad side is that the game play is choppy, and I just don't like it cuz it makes you urge to turn off the game console. But overall, if you avoid game play choppiness (poor story line), then you should like this game.
