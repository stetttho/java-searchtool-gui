 What I can say, is that this series is HORRIBLE! The series is all about kids and adults (who by the way, are horrible singers) singing on a CD. Why don't they just put original artists on the CD. That would be so much better.  Also, if your buy this CD for some "kidz" (I lost 10 IQ points spelling that), remember the artists on the CD. I mean Modest Mouse is all about drugs. The song "1985" is about someone thinking about killing herself because she wants time to stop. And "Welcome To My Life" is about someone having a very abusive life. "Dare You To Move" is about someone wanting to bring back someone that probably died. (if you don't agree with me, watch the music video). Come on, if your going to make it for smaller kids, at least put some child-appropriate singers and bands on the CD, and if you're making it for older kids, why not original artists.  What a waste of time. Plus, there are plenty alternatives. Radio Disney, NOW, and Totally Hits to name a few.  Honestly, you probably don't want your kids to be raised this stupid (or that is, I hope not).
