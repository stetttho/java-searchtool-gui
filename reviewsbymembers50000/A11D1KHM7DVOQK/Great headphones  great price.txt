 I bought these just to use for back-ups. However, when I listened to these, they became my favorite pair I have.  1. The sound quality is amazing, especially at $10. The bass is HUGE, hip-hop fans will love and admire these headphones, I mean can you say big bass ports on the headphones? The treble is nothing special, it's just there, nothing good or bad about it, it's pretty neutral. Mids are fantasic. All in all, sound quality is literally as good as those Sehnneisers across the isle.  2. The durability has been great, though it seems to have some weak spots. I will say the most commonly places this pair will break at (if they do) would be at the swivel earcup, the twist where the headband meets the swivel, or the head fitter.  3. These headphones are very comfortable. I suppose I could wear them for hours and forget they were on. They don't put on any pressure (sometimes they're too loose) and the fit doesn't have any effect on sound.  4. They also come with a big-plug adapter to use on DJ equipment or hi-fi stereo systems.  5. LOOK AROUND! The price for these headphones range from $10-$25, literally (even though I would pay $25 for these). I got them at a Ross store for $10, my guess is that is the lowest price around.  6. The bending parts get stuck to your hair often. Long haired people will find this slighty annoying and painful.  7. As far as comparisions, they sound better than the similar Sony model MDRV150 and Koss model UR15C. They are almost or at the same sound as the HD202.  8. Overall, this is a very good deal for me. These headphones are comparable to $30 headphones at 1/3 the price. The sound, comfort, and durability should be good enough to push you into buying these headphones!
