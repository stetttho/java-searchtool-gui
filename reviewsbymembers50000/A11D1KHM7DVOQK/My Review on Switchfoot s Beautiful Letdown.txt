 1. Meant To Live (4/5) It's a good song, but it was better when it wasn't so overplayed.  2. This Is Your Life (4/5) I didn't like it as much as other songs, though, I guess it's pretty decent.  3. More Than Fine (5/5) This is a great song, and it mans a lot of feeling. Great song!  4. Ammunition (4/5) Really cool rock song! It could have been a bit better, but it's still good.  5. Dare You To Move (3/5) I would have given this a much better rating if it wasn't so always overplayed.  6. Remdeption (5/5) This is a great pop/rock song. It reminds me of the good days.  7. Beautiful Letdown (2/5) Yuck Switchfoot! This songs is creepy and weird. It also doesn't have a good point or meaning. One of the worst on the album.  8. Gone (4/5) This is a good song, but it sounds to much like a pop boy band.  9. On Fire (5/5) This is a great slow song by Switchfoot. Nonetheless, a great song.  10. Adding To The Noise (4/5) This would have been a better song if the singer would have sang better. Still, a good song, and a worth listen.  11. 24 (3/5) This sounds like One Thing by Finger Eleven, though the singer sounds very annoying in the song so it sounds very bad with the acoustic instruments.  CD (4/5) This CD was not flawless, but it was truly good and a worthy listen. I recommend this if you like any style of pop or rock.
