 This is a pretty great overall CD. Most of the songs I liked listening to. But, I always give credit for integrity, but it feels Diana DeGarmo didn't have that. It just feels that she's trying to be the next Britney Spears or something. I really didn't enjoyed the parts of the CD she acted like that. Diana has a great voice (much better than Fantasia), she just needs to use it better. As for getting the CD, go buy it! There's a lot of great tracks, but maybe the next time around, Diana will do better. Hey, look at Kelly Clarkson! Her first album was ok, and now her second is a masterpiece, and I know that's what will happen with Diana. Go buy today!
