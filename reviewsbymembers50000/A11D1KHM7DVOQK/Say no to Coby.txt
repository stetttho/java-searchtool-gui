 The sound on the unit is very good. You can recharge rechargeable batteries while in the unit. Only one inch thick. These are things that earn the CD player two stars.  The quality/durability of this Coby CD player is horrid! It only lasted a few months, just like the earlier review. It also skipped all the time, meaning the skip-protection barely worked at all, and it's the stupid meter protection, the one where you have to wait for your skip-protection, which in reality isn't TRUE SKIP-PROTECTION.  There are a few features, but for $30, a CD player that lasts a few months isn't worth that. Don't buy.
