 1.Ludacris"Act A Fool" A- Truly not the best Luda could offer, but an awesome dance track with an insane beat.  2.Snoop Dogg feat. Pharrell and Uncle Charlie Wilson"Beautiful" B Ok, I guess Pharell didn't totally ruin the song, but he made it much worse.  3.2Pac feat. Anthony Hamilton"Thugz Mansion" A+ Anything with 2 Pac is awesome.  4.Nelly feat. Murphy Lee,Ali and Kyjuan"Air Force Ones" D- All Nelly does is talk about his shoes. Very annoying too. Also, a bit overrated.  5.Lil'Kim feat. Mr.Cheeks"The Jump Off" B+ Good track, but Magic Stick blows it to hell.  6.Fabolous feat. Lil'Mo and Mike Shorey"Can't Let You Go" A- A nice, soothing, and underrated track.  7.Benzino feat. Mario Winians"Rock The Party" F Benzino? On a rap CD? Not gonna work.  8.DMX"Where The Hood At" C- Not a very good track, especially for DMX.  9.Bone Crusher feat. Jadakiss and Busta Rhymes"Neva Scared" F Is this a joke? It's just yelling and screaming.  10.David Banner feat. Lil'Flip"Like A Pimp" B Good, but not the best he can offer.  11.Ja Rule feat. Ashanti"Mesmerize" A- Not as good as previous Ja Rule/Ashanti songs, but it's good.  12.LL Cool J"Luv U Better" F Not only is this song annoying, but it was never a hit.  13.Panjabi MC feat. Jay-Z"Beware...(Jay-Z Remix)" D+ Just more yelling.  14.Missy Elliot"Work It"A+ A crisp classic.  15.Untouchables feat. Benzino"Untouchable" F Boring Benzino? Why is he on this CD so much? So, he's the editor for the magazine. How does he think he can rap?  Overall Grade - C- This could of been mmmmmmmuuuuuuccccchhhh better. One of the weakest of the series, but not completely terrible.
