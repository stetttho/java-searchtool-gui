 Sony lives up to no things on these earbuds.  SOUND: Blotty? The bass is good, too good, way too good to the point where it's not so good. Female vocals on R&B songs are overly blotty and overpowered by the bass. The treble was powerful also. This helped the bass problem, but no there was no mids or "warmth" in the sound. I personally liked Panasonic's neutral sound on theirs.  DURABILITY: Awful. In just two months of use, the cord resembles silly putty. I heard that the cord material was good before they changed it in February 2005. I can't feel the digest by this. Within 2-4 months, the wires will get damp and wrinkled as if a dried out sponge. Then it starts easily peeling. One thing you could do is wrap duct tape around the cord right after buying but the cord will probably look unbearably ugly. Sony gets a no-no for this.  FEATURES: A lot. Since they are canalphones, they create a seal that elimanates outside noise, which I love. The Z styled cord is nice (though some think it's awful). Don't like the warranty, only 90 days, WTF??? Panasonic's is one year and Koss's is lifetime. Sony has the worst support in history of electronics, so be careful (take my word for it dealing with them four times).  PRICE: A little step at $40, actually very step. These earbuds just aren't worth the $40. Maybe if you find them for $10. The sound and features are ok, but the durability just ain't the paper it's printed on. Unrecommended.
