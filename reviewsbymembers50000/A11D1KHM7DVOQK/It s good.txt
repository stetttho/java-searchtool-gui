 This is a good vaccum. The only reason anyone would have a clog is because they don't have it on the right carpet setting. If you would leave it right in the middle, I promise you will not have these problems. Anyway, it's a good vaccum. It does everything you want it to do. It sucks up dust and dirt very well. I have two birds that leave a mess everyday. With this vaccum, It cleanes the mess and leaves a good clean look, and sometimes smell too. This is a good vaccum. I highly recommend it, however, I would not recommmend it to people that don't read the instructions and don't change the carpet setting.
