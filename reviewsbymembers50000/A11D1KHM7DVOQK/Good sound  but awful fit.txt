 Onething about behind-the-neck headphones, either they get it or not. Well, Koss seems to be a company that doesn't get it.  The sound of the KSC11 is pretty good. The bass isn't the deepest, but it's $10. If it were more, like $20, we would have a problem. The sound of these is truly a value.  The main problem I have with these is a big one. They hurt badly. Not badly like if you move them they feel better, more like pounding someone's head. They sure are uncomfortable.  Another problem with these is sound. They have a low output, making the highest volumes quiet.  The sound may be good on the KSC11, but because of the comfort and output, these are unrecommeded.
