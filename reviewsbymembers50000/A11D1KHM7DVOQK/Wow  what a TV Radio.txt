 Pros: - Great reciption, both on TV and radio. - Very portable. Easy to carry around, put in a car, really you can put it anywhere. It's extremly small. - CHEAP PRICE! At Big Lots this thing was $20, and originally at Target it was only about $10 more. - Though the screen looks small, it really isn't THAT small. Think 5 inches. - TV, movies, and video games are crystal clear. - THIS IS TRUE!!! I took the THX test, finding the unit to be 5.1 SURROND SOUND! I really wasn't expecting that. I was excepting some cheapy treble-like sound on cheap products.  Cons: - The little white dots on the top of the screen while watching full screen videos (which is not much of a problem).  Well, when it comes to my TV and sound, I'll think of Sylvania in the long run. This TV rocks, and the sound is good too. Has Sylvania thought of making CD players?
