 What happended here? All of these rap songs are elementary. How much time did it take to make this album? A couple of days? It's horrible. However, Big Chips is a great dance tune, but other then that, it's s***! Get real, this is truly business that should have been stayed unfinished.  P.S. Jay-Z is making more albums! This one, and the one with Linkin Park. I think the retirement thing was a lie.
