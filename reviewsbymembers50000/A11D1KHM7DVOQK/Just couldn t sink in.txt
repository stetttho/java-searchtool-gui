 I read the sequel to this book (Snail Mail No More), and I loved it. I'd thought I would read this one also. I really didn't like it. There was something about this book I guess I didn't like or couldn't understand something. This book just wasn't really for me. I loved Snail Mail No More! Maybe you might like it much better too.
