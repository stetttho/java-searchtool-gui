 Chingy is getting more rough on his songs. He's taking stuff more seriously. Maybe the reason I gave Powerballin' not 5 is because Chingy is taking himself too seriously. Another thing I should point out is a lot of songs sound alike. "Balla Baby" is the only track that really stands out. The rest of the songs are rougher, and some people who liked Chingy's slower stuff may not like this album as much as Jackpot. So, if you like Chingy, you should get it. Actually, get it anyway if you like this kind of music. Now your probably thinking, Why give this album 2 or 3 stars. Because, it has pretty good overall lyrics, and it's beats are overall pretty hot. So, a solid 4 stars.
