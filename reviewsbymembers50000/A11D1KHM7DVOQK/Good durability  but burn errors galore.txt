 Blank CD-R companies always seem to be a hit or miss. Some have good durabilty, and some have good burning, some (only a few) have both, and some (once again only a few) neither. TDK is the company that has good durability of their CD-Rs, but almost half are errors.  The packaging states "48x", so I burned at 48x on a Buslink drive (52x24x52). It choked, and took 10 minutes for Nero to say "Burn error had failed at 48x". So, I went lower at 32x. Same thing. Then I went to 24x and the thing finally worked. If a package says "48x", I'm expecting 48x, not 24x. Even at times 24x would choke and not burn correctly.  Yes, I do have a few TDK CD-Rs that are 2-3 years old and look almost new compared to the 2-3 month old Sony, but with all these errors, will I ever get to experience that? Try looking at Maxell, Philips, and Samsung.
