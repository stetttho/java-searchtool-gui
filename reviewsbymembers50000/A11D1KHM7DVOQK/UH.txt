 I thought Queen had something here. I think Queen and David Bowie had Under Pressure. Then you here "V.I.P.!!!" It's like shut the **** up! Vanilla Ice was a horrible rapper. The only good white rapper is Eminem. Vanilla Ice, I'm glad you aren't in the music industry anymore! Actually, you should be glad because you would be getting your ass kicked out on the streets. Oh yeah, YOUR STUPID SONG ICE ICE BABY IS THE #6 WORST SONG EVER ACCORDING TO VH1!!!
