 It's seems ever since it's 6th edition, The Source Magazine has been having a very rough time keeping up with what's hot and what's not, as well as adding tons of filler. It seems on it's 10th release, things aren't much different as far as song choices and quality.  The CD mixes and matches the same music. First, you have some big stars of the second half of 2004 and the first half of 2005. You have Trick Daddy with his luke-warm hit "Let's Go" featuring mega stars Twista and Lil' Jon, you have Pitbull as your Spanish act, you have Juvenile, Lil' Jon, and Trillville for the "shut the @#$% up!" group, you have Fabolous and Lil' Wayne for the quality songs group, then you have Geto Boys (* it should be Ghetto Boys) and Jim Jones for the unknown people, then add a few #1 hits, for that part is Ciara and Terror Squad. Afterwards, just add filler minors and some Benzino tracks and that's about it. Hmm, not much difference from the other CDs in the series. Basically, all you need is a few big songs, at least one Benzino song, and smoother it in filler.  Now, the songs aren't all bad, in fact this one is better than the 9th edition (not saying a lot). Ciara's "Goodies" will get the party started with it's answer to "Freek-A-Leek" by Petey Pablo. He's on the CD too with "Vibrate", though, a minor on his part. Trick Daddy is on here, he made a big splash (I'm talking about the song here). But otherwise, the rest is filler.  Overall, as a CD, The Source still has not figured out how to make a hip-hop complication, and the word "Billboard" is erased from their vocabulary. While this CD is filled with minors, there are some gems in here, but definitely not worth spending money for it.  Replay Value: Medium Child Appeal: Low Teen Appeal: High Adult Appeal: Low
