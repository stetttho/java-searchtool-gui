 I purchased this notebook for graph paper for algebra class for doing geography and line units. Big mistake. I ususally use a roller pen for graphing since the lines look bolder and dots look more detailed, and graphs look excellent. Not on this paper. First thing is that the roller pen tends to smear on the paper, making numbers and letters very uncomfortable to read, and become very blotty. The letters, especially on letters like e, m, k, and g, become blotted and look like different letters. Numbers are the same. Another thing noticeable is that the paper is not strong, and very weak. Roller pens leak through the paper and end up on the next page.  This notebook was very dissappointing, and even more dissappointing is that it was made from Mead, the most popular and best paper company in the United States. Sadly, when it comes to grpahing paper, I will look elsewhere. If you're using ballpoint pens or pencil, this will work, but anything else is awful.
