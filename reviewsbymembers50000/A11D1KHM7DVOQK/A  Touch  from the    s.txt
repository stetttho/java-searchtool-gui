 For all you R&B newcomers who don't know, Amerie is not a new artist. No. Amerie's debut was back in 2002, with her hit single "Why Don't We Fall In Love?".   "Touch" is very 90's influenced, with beats from "One Thing", "Touch" and others featuring the saxaphone, and other songs featuring the 90's hip-hop feel.   The CD itself was pretty good. The beats were very exceptional, especially from "Not The Only One", "Come With Me", and "Falling" to name a few. The remix of her hit "Why Don't We Fall In Love?" is an unforgettable track as well.   The vocals of the CD are varied throughout the CD. Some soft vocals, and some vocals you would hear from Ciara, or the legendary TLC. Some vocals being poorly drawn. Some vocals sounding to hard. Not hard like aggresive, hard like she's trying too hard to use her vocals in a good manner that they fail completely, though "Touch" overall as a vocal experience is quite nice.   The lyrics of the CD aren't outstanding, but not poor. Songs like "One Thing", "Talkin' About", and "Can We Go" could use a lyrical polish-up, but aren't terribly needed.   When you put the CD in your player, you'll hear the great sounds of Mariah Carey and TLC coming thorugh hear pipes. She definitely has potiental to be a great artist just like them, and it will come.  Replay Value: High Child Appeal: Low Teen Appeal: High Adult Appeal: Low
