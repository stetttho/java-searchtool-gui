 I purchased this jWIN radio because I was shopping at a Ross store, which carries lots of inexpensive items from low-end brands like Coby, jWIN, iConcepts/Sakar, Protocool, etc, and this radio was under $10, and it looked like it could be also used for shower/bath use, and I don't need one bad enough to pay over $20 for one.  Before I even opened the box, I knew the earbuds were going to be very poor. My prediction was correct. However, using a nice pair of Sonys, the sound quality was excellent. I still use the earbuds in the bath/shower so if the earbuds get soaked, I can get a new radio, and if I use the Sonys, well...I'm out $20. The built-in-speaker could have its treble lowered, but for $7, I'm not complaining. What I can say is that the speaker is far better than a comparable Jensen.  I like that it's water resistant, meaning it can be used in steam and minorly wet areas. It can be used for baths but for showers you may want to have a hook so it won't get too wet. One dissappointment is that it's not digital, so you can lock off buttons if you have the radio in your pocket. Though, it does have a belt clip, so you can have it under your shirt under rainy weather, or you may want to hide jWIN so people think you have a radio over $20 lol. Oh, make sure you have a screwdriver to open the AAA battery compartment. I had to use scissors, and, that didn't turn out well lol. Radio reception for both AM and FM was minorly staticy on stations further than 30 miles, but satisfactory otherwise.  Overall, this jWIN radio is a great radio for someone looking for a sports radio or a radio used near steam or water, but doesn't want to spend a fortune for a Sony.
