 Most people are reading these reviews for the MDRE828LP without clear minds. $10 headphones are good? As for the MDRE828LP, the answer is yes.  As far as sound goes, it's pretty good. Yes, it is somewhat lacking on the bass side, but for $10 it's probably the best bass you will get. The treble is very good, it is clear and crisp. I'll say rock music sounds the best on these, as it needs clear treble but rock does not require much bass. If you really need bass you could press bass boost on your player or buy an equalizer to adjust the bass level (I'm not sure how much they cost, but I know Koss makes them).  Durability seems good. The cord is made out of normal plastic (unlike the Fontopia earbuds, yikes!). It's durability is enhanced with an earbud case that stores the earbuds. The are pulled in a wind-up manner.  They are very comfortable to wear, usually you can't even feel them. I would keep an eye on wear the earpads are, they feel pretty uncomfortable without them.  All in all, if you need a pair of earbuds under $10, the MDRE828LP earbuds are recommended.
