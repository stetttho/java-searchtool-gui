 Back in Decmember 2003, I decided it was time for a new DVD player. Not only would my Panasonic refuse to play some DVDs, but it didn't have a VCR, and all I had was a cheap, Funai VCR that had awful quality. So, as a fan of some earlier Sanyo products, I checked out the DVW-6000 (Amazon's model # is incorrect). This player so far has served me great.  The DVD player is great. It reads discs great, and barely skips, if at all. It has a screen to keep track of the playing time of the DVD. Somehow, there is no rewind or fast-forward buttons on the DVD player, which means that you will need the remote. Luckily, if you happen to lose it, it works with 2 of 2 Universal remotes I've tried (Dish Network and RadioShack). The open/close button is not at the bottom of the door so it's easy to press.  The VCR is a very nice add-on. Also, there is no rewind or fast-forward buttons for the VCR either, so keep the remote in a safe place. The picture quality on the VCR is very good. The only problem is that the sound quality on VHSs that you record from it is very poor. Both on this, my Philips, and my Emerson units not only record better, but they also experience a problem from the Sanyo recorded tape. Although a major flaw, the rest of the unit is almost flawless.  The unit has two AV inputs, one in the front on the right (see picture) and one in the back. Also has a very easy setup. You can either set it up using the yellow, white, and red jacks and put them in the slots on the TV and the unit, or you can use cables if your TV doesn't have AV jacks.  I was and am pleased with this unit. I have owned it for 1 an d 1/2 years and it is still in great condition, though I'm thinking about replacing my crap Memorex TV with a DVD/VCR combo and putting this in the living room. I'm still going to check around for a Sanyo model before making my decision.
