 Yes, it's nice to finally see modern singers make original Disney songs into modern hits. However, most of the songs are bad and dreadful. The only ones I found good were the ones by Ashanti, Jessica Simpson, Hilary Duff, and Christina Aguilera. The rest are pretty bad. Boy bands? Teen pop girls? Don't think so. Don't think this will be very good. I don't recommend this CD. Get some better music, although I give it 1 extra star for the good songs I mentioned earlier in this review.
