 The twentieth edition of Now That's What I Call Music proves that they can still do it. While this edition is clearly too full on rap, it is by far not the worst in the series.  The rap collection features favorites from the summer and fall's biggest hits, with Missy Elliott providing a rap and dance twist on "Lose Control", a rap-funk song by the Black Eyed Peas, and a guilty pleasure from The Pussycat Dolls. Ludacris's "Pimpin' All Over The World"'s production saves the song through the subject manner isn't the most appealing. The CD also features a new song from Dem Franchise Boyz. The rap may be overloading at first but it's definitely a pleasure nonetheless.  The R&B section features new artist Rihanna with "Pon De Replay" and holding the title of "song of the summer", Destiny's Child's "Cater 2 U", a nice Lyfe Jennings tune, and a funky and fresh pop-R&B song from Natasha Bedingfield. The R&B songs are all excellent choices though "Must Be Nice" was less played on Top 40 radio.  The pop section of the disc includes new artist (on a NOW) Kelly Clarkson with "Behind These Hazel Eyes", and new pop-rock sensation, The Click Five. D.H.T.'s "Listen To Your Heart" is on the disc but the dance mix was more perfered. The Backstreet Boys are a guilty pleasure however they don't put talent in their work. All of these songs were pretty big, The Backstreet Boys one being the worst on the charts.  The rock section includes rock favorite Weezer, Fall Out Boy's addictive "Sugar We're Going Down", and Lifehouse's "You & Me". The rest of the CD pretty much holds on it's own, however, the Coldplay song may make some pop fans fall asleep.  This edition doesn't have the biggest hits, however, most of the songs hold on it's own. While it doesn't get the best grade, it's still work looking at. 3 stars.
