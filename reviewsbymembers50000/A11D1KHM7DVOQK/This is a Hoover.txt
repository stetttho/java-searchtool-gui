 I bought this vaccum from a retail store about two years ago. Since then this vaccum has served me very well. The vaccum is very compact, and it's lightweight. The vaccum has sucked up very well, much better than my Eureka. Then again, it is a 12 amp so it is supposed to suck up well. There are a large variety of tools, from a tube to a corner tool, this vaccum has them covered. The HEPA filtration has worked, my air feels a bit cleaner after using it. It was a bit expensive but it seemed worth it after its features and it's year use...not until...  In Novmember when the bagless part would not stay shut. It seems a plastic part was missing, resembling cheap quality. I had to use duct tape for a long time. Luckily, my local vaccum reatil store finally got my ordered part, the vaccum worked flawlessly until...  In March, the plastic tube tool was chipped in the middle, the suction would go out and it would clean very poorly. Duct tape solved the problem until I went to the vaccum retail store and just bought one. The vaccum was then perfect, until...  Today when I tried to vaccum. It started making odd noises, thinking whatever. Then the room started smelling of burning plastic and smoke. The vaccum was literally on fire while it was on. I rushed to the plug and immediately took the plug out. Unfortunately, duct tape can't solve this problem, and I'm not spending the value of this piece of junk to have it fixed.  It's finally time to say goodbye to this junky Hoover. Suprised, NONE of my other Hoover products have been throw-outs, unfortunately enough, this vaccum is garbage. I will definitely be avoiding Hoover for my next vaccum purchase. I think you should do the same!
