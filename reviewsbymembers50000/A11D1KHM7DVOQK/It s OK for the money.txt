 My friend bought this computer from BestBuy, a big electronics retailer. It had a good price for what it had and it came with a free monitor.  The hard drive is 200 GB, this is a lot of power. Of course every manufacture rounds it, it probably has 190 GB. Still, this is not a small hard drive. You can store a lot of stuff on this thing, music, movies, games, documents, or anything with ease.  The processor is an AMD Athlon 64 3700+ processor. Overall, AMD processors are a problem with Windows computers, I'm not sure why this is true, but it is so. I've had a few lock-ups, mainly on Windows Media Player 10, even though it's a memory stealing program, 1 GB and a 3700+ processor, I expected more. I think an Intel Inside Pentium 4 D would've worked fine.  The CD drive with this thing is packed with features. You can pretty much do anything with CDs. It can write any CDs you can want. It also has a DVD/DVD-RW, which will play and burn DVDs. It also has HP's lightscribe, which is a pretty neat feature that will write on the top of your CDs.  The keyboard is a basic one with internet features. It is not wireless but what CAN you expect. The mouse is a basic wired scroll mouse.  The graphics are powered by the ATI Radeon XPress 200M IGP, a pretty average graphics set, usually Nvidia's are sharper. It should work for most movies and video games but if your looking for the best graphics chip around look elsewhere.  It also has a memory card reader which will read any kind of memory card avaliable today.  If your buying this for the Media Center, I'd pass. It's honestly not anything big and you can do most of it on Windows Media Player 10.  One thing that sucks about it is that it freezes a LOT, especially on Windows Media Player 10. I've got a lot of errors and waiting while using it.  Overall, it's OK for the money.
