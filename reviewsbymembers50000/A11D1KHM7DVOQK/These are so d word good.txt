 Enough said. The flavor in these are wonderful. Though, this isn't the best version (vanilla is the best), it's still great. It's much better than regular coffee with vanilla, cream, and milk. If you're looking for a cold or more flavorful alternative to coffee, this is your pick.  One little issue, these are VERY expensive. $1 is expensive, that would be 4x the cost of soda (4-pack soda is $1). But, it's worth every penny.  These are so good!!!
