 This phone is too good to be true. It has a lot of good features. But every phone has some kind of flaw. This phone has a mega flaw in reception. I can't get a good singal. Even in metro Tucson it's kinda hard. It's an awesome phone, with bad service. Don't get me wrong. Nextel is good, just not their reception.
