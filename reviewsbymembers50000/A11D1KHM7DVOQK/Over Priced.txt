 I bought this to improve the reception of the ANT110, a much cheaper model that had good reception overall but I wanted much more. I spent $30 for the ANT301 and overall it was not worth the cost. I plugged in the amplifier and it actually made things WORSE. But when I removed the amplifier I got much better reception, but the $20 ANT103 is the same thing with no amplifier so it has similar reception. If your looking for great reception go with Trek's version but if you are looking for decent reception go with the ANT103. For this, avoid it, it's overpriced and the amplifier is worse than a push-pin.
