 These batteries only last so long. Yeah, it beats Duracell by a landslide, but I mean COME ON! These only lasted 24 hours in my CD player, and even store branded batteries lasted longer, and they were ALKALINE! These batteries may be industrial and will be good for stronger operations, but if they only last 24 hours, then you'll even be better off using store-brand alkaline poor quality batteries that last 40 hours.
