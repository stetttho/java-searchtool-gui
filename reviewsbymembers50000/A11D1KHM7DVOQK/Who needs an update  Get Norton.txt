 I am really not suprised by the overall rating of the product rating. 2 stars! That is not a good rating.  I'll start by saying that I don't own this product. I've had Norton Antivirus 5.0 (made in 1999), and it works beautifully. I've purchased Norton Antivirus 2003, and have seen how much Norton AV has changed...for the bad. Really, Norton Antivirus versions (2003-2005) are basically the same thing, but each newer version getting worse. The 2005 edition is no difference. It eats a lot of RAM. Which usually means for most people, it is ssssllllooooowwwww. Live update crashes halfway through the process. Scanning takes awhile and sometimes crashes too, and not to mention misses various viruses that may be on your computer. Auto-protect is just as similar. A virus may break through any minute! Not only that, after a year, you can't use it again! Wait a minute...I thought once you pay for something you can use it again. Not with NAV 2005. After a year, your subscription is over and you have to pay for another subscription online, or buy the new version which is worse as I mentioned earlier.  Honestly, isn't this enough. Some of you have the older version of NAV (1995-2002) somewhere. Just use that, considering it has none of the problems listed above (well, on NAV 1999 they ask you to renew your subscription or reinstall the software...just reinstall the software and don't buy money for a subscription!). Of course, if this is you're first time using NAV, it will be very hard to get an older version of it. Just get McAfee then. Just get anything but NAV (2003-2005). Besides, each version has the same features, besides 2003-2005 that actually do have spyware.  Bottomline: Just save yourself the grief and buy McAfee or an older version of Norton.
