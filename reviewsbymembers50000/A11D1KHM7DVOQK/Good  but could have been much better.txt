 Well, Ashanti has released 4 albums and 1 remix CD, so she's been around for a little while. Ashanti's Concrete Rose features R&B with some hip-hop trown in it. What really bugs me about this album is that Ashanti is much better on hip-hop songs rather than r&b. She did great on songs like Only U and the duet with T.I. because they were hip-hop songs. Songs like Take Me Tonight are just plain boring and generic. If only Ashanti had more flavor, this would have been such a better CD. Maybe on her next one it will feature more hip-hop rather than her boring r&b tunes. Anyway, if you like Ashanti or R&B, you should buy this, but if you like hip-hop, go pick up Snoop's R&G or Luda's Red Light District.
