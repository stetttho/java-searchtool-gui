 "Pon De Replay" first set off in late-May and is Rihanna's first single. The song has an infectous and catchy beat. It is obviously impossible not to dance to it. The lyrics aren't the best since its not really required for a club song. Rihanna sings pretty well on this track as well. It's a cool club song and it will do until the next big thing in radio comes along (excluding terrible Atlanta acts like D4L).
