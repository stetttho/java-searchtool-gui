 1. M!ssundaztood 5/5 Great intro!  2. Don't Let Me Get Me 4/5 Great song! Too bad it was highly overplayed.  3. Just Like A Pill 5/5 I used to hate this song but now it's one of my favs.  4. Get The Party Started 5/5 Funky and fresh!  5. Respect 5/5 I forgot what this song was about but all that I remember is that I loved it.  6. 18 Wheeler 5/5 Great song! Not too rock but not too pop either. Perfectly adjusted for P!nk and that's what makes this song so good.  7. Family Portrait 3/5 I don't know what to say about this one but that is too deep and dark. Plus, P!nk's voice doesn't fit the track too well.  8. Misery (w/Steven Tyler) 2/5 About the same as #7 with just worse vocals.  9. Dear Diary 5/5 I love this song! P!nk released it as a single but I don't know why radio didn't play it.   10. Eventually 3/5 Kinda weak for me. Another one similar to track #7.  11. Lonely Girl (w/Linda Perry) 3/5 same as #10  12. Numb 4/5 This is a good track, but not the best on the album.  13. Gone To California 1/5 Worst one of the CD. What was P!nk thinking???  14. My Vietnam 4/5 Good ending of the album, though it's still a bit weak.  Overall - 4/5 The beginning of this album was great, but at the end it kinda fell flat. Try This, or I thought, was a better album than this and if you're like me and enjoyed the 1st half better, I think you'll like it better too. Though, truly worth picking up for all your favorite P!nk hits and favs.
