 What is up with all of the reviews? Either you loathe this album or you love it. Well, I'ma one of those people who like this CD. I think the problem is people listen to way much bubblegum music. Well, I tend to like some bubblegum music, but people listen to too much and forget what real music is. WAKE UP! THIS IS REAL AND GOOD MUSIC! Listen to this a couple of times. It took me also a couple spins to like it. Overall, if you listen to good and real music, you should get this. If not, go get Britney Spears, J.Lo, or whoever you listen to because this is GREAT music.
