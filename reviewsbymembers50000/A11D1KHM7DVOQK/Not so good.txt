 The CD kind of sucks. The CD starts off with 3 good songs: My Happy Ending, Breakaway, and Everytime. Avril Lavigne's "My Happy Ending" is not the best song, but not bad either. Kelly's "Breakaway" was good, but the stupid people on Top 40 radio killed it. "Everytime" is a nice soothing ballad. And, that is where the fun ends. "Invisible" is just awful, with lyrics like "If I could just watch you in your room, if I was invisible, wait, I already am". Not only do the lyrics have everything to do with sex and nudity, but also make no sense whatsoever. Soon, it's the most fake punk band ever, Good Charlotte. Their songs may be catchy, but that's about it. Horrible, screechy vocals, and meaningless lyrics. Switchfoot's "Dare You To Move" is just okay. "Meant To Live" was a much more worthy song. Skye Sweetnam just sucks. Lil' Romeo, congrats on having a horrible show for 2 year olds! You can't rap! Another fake rock band called Simple Plan. Sure, their show Damage Control is one of the best shows ever, but their music is some of the worst stuff yet. Jessica Simpson's "With You" could have been put on, but no, they put the worst song by Jessica "Take My Breath Away", an 80's Berlin remake. Fantasia can't sing, and her voice screeches all the time. JoJo has the last good song on the CD, "Leave Get Out", about a break-up. Her voice is good, but the beat just is outstanding. The remaining 5 tracks are horrible. Oh, wait, "Dairy" is the last good song of the album. It's a nice mellow tune.  Other than those 5, this CD all around sucks.  Best Song: "Breakaway" Worst Song: A lot of bad, but "Found A Way" is just horrendus.  Overall, buy something worth your money, like the Kelly Clarkson CD, or the Ciara CD. Because these songs suck.
