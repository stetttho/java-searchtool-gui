 I think about a week from today, this thing broke on me. I've had it for about 4 months, and you guess it, the CD changer broke. I had a CD stuck in it, and it took me a long time for me to get it out. I eventually did. The radio and tape player still work, but the CD player is completely dead. I'm returning it tomorrow hoping that 1) it was just a malfunction that won't happen again and 2) that the store will actually take it back for a new one. I hope this doesn't happen again.  UPDATE ON 12/20/04  Well this is just fine and dandy. I have the stuff I need to return it including receipt (is that how you spell it?), but Wal-Mart is unwilling to help me. Sony said take it to the shop in Tucson. The shop was also unwilling to help and said it would cost $100. HELLO THE WARRANTY IS ONE YEAR!!! They obviously don't care and said it costs $20 to even look at it. Now, I'm taking it to another repair shop called Martin's something and it will only cost about half of the Sony repair. Gee, thanks Sony! Thanks Wal-Mart! I know I should have purchased the RCA at Best Buy. How silly of me.
