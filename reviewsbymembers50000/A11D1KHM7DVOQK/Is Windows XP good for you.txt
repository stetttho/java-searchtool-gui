 Ok, Windows XP may be good for people doing some things, while the older versions may be easier for you.  Usually Typing Pages In Microsoft Word - Windows XP and Windows 98 really make no difference in this. You could use both, and you could probably get things done quicker. Though, Windows XP is a bit more user friendly, so I'd get it for that.  Multimedia - You NEED Windows XP if you love movies and music! It comes with WMP 9, but I recommend using the 7.1 version, it's much better. But in XP, you get to create your own movies, and make cool music playlists, and burn CDs in minutes. Windows XP is the way to go here.  Interet Surfing - As owning 98 for 6 years and XP for not even a year, Windows 98 is better for this. I've had a lot of viruses with the SP1 version, mostly trojans. I've never had a joke, worm or mailing worm yet, but hoping not to have another.  But...  Since this comes with SP2, Windows XP is the best choice for the internet. I've never had ONE viruses with the SP2, so I would highly recommend downloading it if you currently have SP1.  Gaming - Hmm...a bit tricky here. If you have a lot of Windows XP compatable games, go to Windows XP. I have a lot of 98 games, and most of them run perfectly on XP (I've only had 2 out of 20 not working). So, XP is good for gaming, escpecially with the new DirectX.  Freezing - I've only had my computer freeze once on Windows XP (and it was my fault to, I pressed IE about 10 times in a row). On Windows 98, some days the computer wouldn't even open the start button. Windows XP's point.  Customizing Your Computer - Windows 98 time. On Windows XP, they only give you have of what 98 has. Plus, the desktops and screen savers are less outstanding, though with the upgrade, the 98 themes are still inside. Though, I think 98 should take this point.  Overall -   Windows 98 - 1 point Windows XP - 5 points  Hmm...I'd recommend getting XP. It's faster, funner, and easier than 98.
