 Hmmm not sure about the complaint of Splenda (the review 2 below mine).  Overall this gum tastes fairly good. One thing I will point out is that it is really strong, mainly to last longer, but some may find it over flavored. And this gum tastes VERY bad when it gets old. Otherwise, Big Red is good gum.
