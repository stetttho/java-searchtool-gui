 Britney Spears - Stronger: A+ My favorite song from Britney Spears! The music video was the best!  Samantha Mumba - Gotta Tell You: A- Good song, yet it's a bit generic.  *NSYNC - Bye Bye Bye: F I hate boy bands and this was my least favorite song by any crappy boy band. Hate it!  ATC - Around The World (La La La La La): A+ Hot dance song! A dance classic.  Jennifer Lopez - Love Don't Cost A Thing: B+ Not as good as Jennifer's earlier stuff or newer stuff, still, it's okay, just a bit boring.  Destiny's Child - Independent Women Part I: B+ Good, but seems a bit empty.  Shaggy - It Wasn't Me: F This song is just gross. Shaggy's mom caught him having *** and ****ing her ****, and maybe it's also about ******* (maybe) which I think is crude in a song and just nasty.  3LW - No More (Baby I'm A Do Right): A Great song by 3LW.  K-Ci & Jojo - Crazy: D I can not stand this group!  R. Kelly - I wish: F Similar to the annoyance in the earlier song, this one is by R.Kelly.  Backstreet Boys - Shape Of My Heart: A Heart touching song, tohugh boy bands are awful.   Evan And Jaron - Crazy For This Girl: A Very overplayed, but it's a great song!  Coldplay - Yellow: D- Annoying, and overplayed song and band.  Lenny Kravitz - Again: B+ Extremly overplayed, but a still very good song.  Fuel - Hemmorrhage (In My Hands): A Great rock song, but also a bit overplayed.   Creed - With Arms Wide Open: D+ I like Creed and everything, but this song was so overly played that I have no point or interest to ever listen to this song again.  Incubus - Drive: A Perfect song from Incubus.  U2 - Beautiful Day: A Great song! Though, a bit overplayed.  Everclear - AM Radio: C- Average...really no comment  Overall Grade - B+ Ok, I raised the grade a bit, so what. I loved the artwork of the album, as I always am, but this one has to be the most mesmerizing. Well, if the songs weren't so overplayed and annoying, it would be an A.
