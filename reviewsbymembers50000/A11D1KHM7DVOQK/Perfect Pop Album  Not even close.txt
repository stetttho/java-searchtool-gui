 Well, it has been more than two years now, and Perfect Pop Album is (somehow) back after it's very minor success with the first edition, and it seems that this new edition is going to do even worse.  First problem, Hollywood Records shouldn't be doing complications. They are Disney Records's sister. I mean, look at the tracklistings. They look like another Radio Disney Jams CD. Joss Stone, Josh Kelly, and Liz Phair are really the only reason buying "Got Hits 2". The rest are Disney Channel fillers.  The CD starts with seven Disney acts in a row, starting with Hilary Duff, the lastest flop in the music industry. Depsite the fact she had multi-platinum success with "Metamorphisis", she didn't even go Gold on her self-titled second album. "Come Clean" was really the only big hit by this artist, which to me was a big shocker, "So Yesterday" was way better. Then we move to Jesse McCartney, OH BOY! "Beautiful Soul" may have a good melody, but Jesse's vocals, awful. And the lyrics make no sense. "I don't want another pretty face, I don't want just anyone to hold, I don't want my love to go to waste, I want you and your beautiful soul." Well, if you think about it, isn't that a beautiful soul? A girl with a pretty face, and good personality? Whatever. Let's move on to JoJo. Okay, I don't mind her, as long as you put something decent by her, like "Leave (Get Out)". Instead, they put her hit "Baby It's You". The song did well on the charts, and the song is decent, but I think I've had enough. But wait, there's four more! Lindsay Lohan is next up, she didn't have many hit songs, unless you coun't her minor "Rumors" big. They put on "Ultimate". WTF? When and where was that a hit? Or maybe I should look on foriegn charts to see why Hollywood Records chose this. It was on the 2003 soundtrack "Freaky Friday", and all of the sudden it's big. Moving on. Next up is Bow Wow's rival, Romeo. Okay, for all honesty here, how DID he get a record deal? Master P's song "Make Em Say Ugh" wasn't bad enough? "My Cinderella" is just a poor quality rap song you'd hear on Radio Disney. Then we have Skye Sweetnam. Now, "Tangled Up In Me" is actually a decent song. It's melody is damn catchy, and they have pretty good voices. I definitely wouldn't recommended their "Noise From The Basement" album. Way too much filler. Then we have unknown Jump 5. Okay, don't name the album Got Hits if you have an unknown artist. Anyway, "God Bless The U.S.A." is horrible, they can't sng their way out of a bag. Then we're FINALLY up with Disney artists (but their revenge comes again later in the CD).  Next, we have a country song by Rascal Flatts. It's okay; not a country fan. The album is called "Got Hits 2: More Perfect POP". Notice the uppercase letters. Then, we have our first song worth listening to, from Joss Stone. Though, "Some Kind Of Wonderful" was barely a hit, it's still an awesome add, as the song is decent. She has a great voice and her songs are great; jazz flavored pop songs.   Then we have Raven-Symone and the Cheetah Girls. I'm not even continuing with this song, since those artists alone should spell trouble.  Luckily, after that, we have alternative rock queen Liz Phair, with her self lyriced "Extraordinary". The song is excellent, from the jammin' guitars to the extraordinary lyrics, to her voice. You should definitely check out her music, especially her older stuff.  Two paragraphs back, I said that Disney's revenge is coming. Well, the Disney Radio artists have returned. We have Raven Symone (second time on this CD) doing "Supernatural", which was probably the biggest hit in Disney Radio history, and is featured on "The Haunted Mansion" soundtrack. On regular Top 40 radio, never heard it. The song is average at best, and the same rule applies. Just because you have a big TV show, does not mean your vocals are automatically good and you can make a record. And the same rule applies with the next artist. Once again, the second song on this CD by Hilary Duff, and she brings her sister into the song, which is the third Disney Soundtrack song. This one was featured on the "A Cinderella Story" soundtrack. Okay, this remake is just horrific. First, you have the second worst vocals in the history of music (Milli Vanilli being the worst), then you have "Our Lips Are Sealed". Now, the Go-Gos version is very good, but the lyrics don't even fit Hilary. Next, we have the Vengaboys. Enough said. Then we have some group called Mr. C and the Slide Man. Maybe I'm not quite old enough, but who the F is this? The song is ridiculous, and definitely should not end up on a 2004-2005 hits album. Then, Josh Kelley's "Amazing" is amazing, and he actually writes his music. That gave me some hope about the end of this album...but wait...we're at the end.                 Unless you're a gigantic fan of Radio Disney and like 2003 songs on a 2005 complication, avoid this on all costs, and get Now 19 in stores Tuesday July 19, 2005.
