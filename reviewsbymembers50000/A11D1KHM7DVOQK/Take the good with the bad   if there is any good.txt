This headset is excellent for Internet chat/telephony, video conferencing and voice-enabled multiplayer games. Compatible with popular PC sound cards, just plug-it in and start talking. Our products have been tested by industry professionals to ensure your desktop experience is a comfortable one."  Anything you read up there is complete BS. Easy to wear! CD quality audio! State-of-the-art noise-cancelling microphone! Our products have been tested by professionals! Was that some kind of joke?  First, the setup is a pain. You have these two, 4" wires trying to connect way back in the computer. The problem here is what if you have an extension cord to plug your headphones in? My extension cord reaches at 12", so this is a problem if I want to use another pair and just use the microphone.  Secondly, and most importantly, the microphone and headphones barely work. Extremely low output. I would get more output plugging earbuds into the computer on the lowest possible sound. When you speak into the microphone, it barely records. I even tried yelling without a one's success.  Lastly, the headphones are hard to put on, and are uncomfortable. Ouch, they hurt! That's what you'll be saying. I almost guarantee it, or your money back!  The only thing good about this headset is that it comes with a Lifetime Warranty, meaning I can take them back, which I will be doing, and I will guarantee that as well. Try something else, like from Labtec.  UPDATE (Later 4/24/05) - In the program Nero Wave Editor, which records sounds, has a volume increaser. This works, however, it sounds someone is lawn mowing near me while I speak. What crap!
