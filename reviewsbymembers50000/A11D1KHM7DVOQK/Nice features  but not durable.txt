 Well, I was looking around Wal-Mart for a new CD player. They had a few Durabrands, but I was scared to buy one because of their lack of durability and quality in the past. They had a few Maganvoxs (spelling check?), but the look wasn't too appealing. They had some Sonys, but they were kinda pricey, even though the money was worth it. So, on to Target (which had a bigger selection anyway).   They had GPX, but similar to Durabrand. They had the Virgin Pulse and I've read poor reviews about it in the past.   Okay, you're sick of me talking about the selection...alright alright alright already.   Anyway, I found this. It had exactly what I was looking for, and the blue color catches attention. The price kinda turned me off, but I really did want it.   I'm glad I still bought this. The sound quality is excellent, and features not one, not two, but three bass setting. One is no bass excelerator, SXBS, and SXBS+. The headphones are a bit akward to use, but once you put them on, they sound great, and they become quite comfortable.   It took me about 15 minutes to figure it out, but the manual was very clear, and then I got used to it, though the beginners may want to stay away if they can't read the manual.   The battery life lasts much longer than my old player (RP2472). 72 hours will last you awhile!  The durability is quite bad though. While in a backpack with little to medium pressure, the LCD was completely shattered to point that the player was useless and the broken LCD pieces would scratch the CD playing.  Overall, skip this one.  * - This is a very similar review as the SLSV570, mainly because all of the 2004 models are not durable, however, I highly recommend you to check out the 2005 models, I've owned the SLCT582V for almost 4 months now, and it is VERY durable. Just see the amazon.com avaliable date and if it has a date in 2004, skip it.
