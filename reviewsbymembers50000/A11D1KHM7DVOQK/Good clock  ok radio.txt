 Pros:  - The time on the clock is easy to set and use. - The clock is easy to see with the bright time option. - The alarm can actually go off even if the batteries are dead. However, this only works with battery power. - Very durable. Dropped it from a bunk-bed about 10 times, and still no defects. - Nap setting is a great future of the alarm clock.  Cons:  - The alarm sound is kind of quiet and inconsistent. Both two alarms are quite quiet, and are just small beeps that are 1 1/2 seconds apart. - The radio quality is poor. It's hard to get even some local stations to work correctly. - The speaker is very poor. The sound on the radio disorts a lot.  BOTTOMLINE: If you're looking for a cheap yet durable alarm clock with a radio you're not gonna use often, this one is a perfect pick. If you're expecting a lot from the radio, I'd look elsewhere. Otherwise, great alarm clock!
