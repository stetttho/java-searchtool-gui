 Ashanti has a lot of talent, and I look forward to Concrete Rose after hearing Only U on the radio. Anyway, this album is very generic and I could pick up any blah CD an it would be pretty much the same thing. Ashanti sings her songs striaght-forward, and that's good, but it gets boring after awhile. Ashanti's lyrics, however, are great. They are all about her personality, which gave this album a great mood for summer, though, it's still pretty generic. So, if you like generic R&B sometimes boring albums, buy this.
