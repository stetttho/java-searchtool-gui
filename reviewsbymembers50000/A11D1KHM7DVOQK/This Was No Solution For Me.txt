 I used this Resolve cleaner on my rug for a stain from cocktail sauce. I assumed from everyone's trust in Resolve branded products for their low prices and good performance, I bought this to clean out the stain. This was definitely no sloution for me. Only the slightly colored stains would come out. Everything else was still red-orange and even noticeable in the dark. I have bought generic Albertsons carpet solution on the stain and it worked wonderfully. This proves this Resolve product needs to be redone. I would not recommend any Resolve carpet cleaning products. The price was great but the performance was very poor.
