 I am dissappointed with this DVD player. As I do not own it, my mom's work has this exact unit, and the people at work are very unhappy with it.  DVD Player -  The DVD player was good, but not as good as it could be. Some discs with some minor-medium scratches and/or fingerprints would sadly refuse to play. The fingerprints could be wiped off, but some DVD with only a few scratches had to be purchased at the store again. Otherwise, the DVD picture is very clear and crisp (using a 19" Samsung TV) and sound quality is above average.  VHS Player -  Just awful. Old tapes, damaged or perfect, would not play. Mainly tapes before 1997 would play with bleeps every second, with the tape being in good condition, but would play fine in an old Samtron (unknown brand). Another dissappointment, which is the biggest one, is that it WOULDN'T PLAY RECORDED TAPES!!! This was SO dissappointing, recorded tapes, from Funai to Sony to TDK, nothing would play. Everything refuses to. Either the picture quality was way below average or it would make all of these grinding sounds and spit the recorded tape out. People planning on using this for home movies, recorded from TV, and recorded from camera to recorded tape, you should NOT buy this. This was so dissappointing, almost half of the library was recorded tapes.  Functions/Remote -  Normal DVD/VHS player function. Play, pause, stop, rewind, fast-foward, the DVD/VHS switch, etc. The remote was very useful, but it's not universal to change the TV channel to the player. The remote had all of the DVD player's functions. The DVD player doesn't have every function so keep the remote in a safe place.  Overall -  Do not buy this unit. The DVD player works well, but having an old, unknown brand VHS player working better than a Toshiba...that's sad. My mom's work will likely be looking for a new unit without Toshiba on it.
