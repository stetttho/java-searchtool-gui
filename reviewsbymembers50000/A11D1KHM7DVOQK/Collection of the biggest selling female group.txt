 Destiny's Child, with Beyonce Knowles, Kelly Rowland, and Michelle Williams, with over 50,000,000 records sold, slipping over TLC, call it quits on their first and last tour for their album "Destiny Fulfilled".  With collection, we have all the hits y'all. From the club songs "Soldier", "Jumpin' Jumpin'", "Lose My Breath", "Bug-A-Boo", along with the slow songs "Emotion", "Say My Name", "Bills Bills Bills", and "Cater 2 U", and the songs about woman independence "Independent Woman" and "Survivor". The disc also includes three new songs, "Check On It" and "Feel The Way I Do", which are Beyonce's new singles, and the last group song "Stand Up For Love".  Destiny's Child has proved that they are talented people. From their soulful singing, to their beats, etc. Picks on their greatest hits collection would be "Jumpin' Jumpin'", a true club song that's still going from Writing's On The Wall, "Bug-A-Boo", starting a new word for an uncaring man from their first album, "Say My Name", "Independent Woman", among with many others. They have also proven nice writing talent throughout their songs, writing about many differnet subjects and keeping R&B fresh.  However, the end of Destiny's Child has come, and it's time to put them in the invisible R&B Hall Of Fame. It's no wonder Destiny's Child were the best selling R&B group, their talent, lyrics, and heart (well, maybe Beyonce...remember she's the one that is the talent hog) made them there. A definite 5 star collection.  Replay Value: High Child Appeal: Low Teen Appeal: High Adult Appeal: Low
