 Ok, Tipsy was a hot song. It was a big dance song, but every other song on this CD sucks. You and Me, J-Kwon's lastest single, is one of the worst song I ever heard. There are bad lyrics. Why the F*** does he talk about ice cream, as far as I know, I'm not even sure he is because his lyrics are so bad. Seriously, get something else worth your money. Not J-Kwon!  P.S. I'm not a hater!
