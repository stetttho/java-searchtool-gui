 I'm honestly suprised that Beyonce's solo album was the one getting awards and airplay. Yet, Kelly Rowland was shut out completly.  First, I know Kelly Rowland, and I know that she can do MUCH better than this. But, yeah, it's not her fault. She wasn't getting ANY material or help from her manager (a.k.a. Beyonce's father), so really all she had to work with was Joe Budden, because that's the only person she knew. And, of course, Beyonce's father just HAS TO include Solange to start her career. It just seems Beyonce's father wasn't even giving Kelly a fair chance.  Secondly, there still are some good songs on this CD. I lovethe song "Stole". "Dilemma" was the only #1 hit from this album (read above), mainly because Nelly's manager is nice and gives him good material. "Train on a Track" is another good song.  Ok, there's not much to listen to. I do look forward of Kelly making another solo debut. But hopefully, she'll be able to by having a fair chance and getting more producers besides Solange and Joe Budden.
