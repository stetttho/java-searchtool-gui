 If you're looking for something that will staple 50 pages, this isn't for you.  But...  If you're looking for this and staple maybe 5 pages, and is just getting for usefulness, this is excellent.  It staples nice and smooth and it doesn't jam up like most mini staplers do. It staples nice and smooth and it is very useful when you NEED a stapler and low and behold, the Swingline Mini is right in front of you. Even if you're not a heavy stapler and staple things once a month, this is a handy-dandy product. And, it doesn't costa ton.  Awesome! Highly recommended.
