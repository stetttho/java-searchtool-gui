 I bought these a few weeks ago, but I already have a replacement...  The good stuff is that the sound is excellent, as Sony headphones always are. The bass can get very deep, and the treble is clean.  The bad stuff is overall comfort of the headphones, and the style. The MDRG42LP and long hair do NOT mix. I'm guessing the headphones are for people with smaller ears, like elf ears for example. Well, for normal sized ears (like me) these headphones are horrible. Every way you put them on, something will happen. If you put them on half-way, they are comfortable, but fall off. If you put them on the right way (as on the back of the box), the very top of the speaker will hit the inside of your ear (and my ears became red of doing this). If you put them on like the guy on the front (headband all the way down to your neck), the headband becomes highly irritating, and people with long hairstyles will feel extreme discomfort.  The price of these headphones (the list price) is horrible. I've found competable RCA behind-the-neck headphones for half price that sound the same, and are much more comfortable.  I don't know what to say. I'm using these for back-ups, but as for other people buying them, I would not recommend.
