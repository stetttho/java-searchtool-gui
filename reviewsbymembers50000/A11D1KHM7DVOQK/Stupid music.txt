 Romeo sucks. People need to get a life and listen to real rap.  He has absolutely NO skills! He should leave the music industry. He should because he is the worst rapper out there. Parents who buy this for their kids is stupid because amazon.com sells clean versions of real rap. Romeo has never got it on and never will.
