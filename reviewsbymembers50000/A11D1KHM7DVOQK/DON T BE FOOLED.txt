 Well, here's the story. I was shopping around ROSS and found a CD collection. I love the 80's music. I found this CD the best so I purchased it because it had many good songs and the price was resonable. I couldn't wait to listen to it, until I put the CD into my CD player. I didn't find out tell then I was fooled. Actually, I find many 80's CD's that are like this everyday I shop. It's really a shame how people make unreal CD's and sell them to the public. The CD was made by people that sound almost as bad as the Kidz Bop people. Then, I read the CD more carefully and realized the words PERFORMED BY STARS AT STUDIO 99. A complete waste of money. People that are ready to buy this CD, if you don't like fake imations, don't buy this. So, DON'T BE FOOLED!!!
