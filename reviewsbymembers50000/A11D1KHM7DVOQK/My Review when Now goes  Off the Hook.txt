 Ok, this is a pretty good complicaton of Hip-Hop & R&B hits. It features some new artists, as well as well-known ones. It a good mix music wise with ballads to strong raps of 01-02. I was pretty suprised, I thought I wouldn't like this album, but I did. The thing I didn't like is that you could hear these hits often on the radio. Otherwise, it's a great investment, just as long as you don't have any house deposits. (LOL)
