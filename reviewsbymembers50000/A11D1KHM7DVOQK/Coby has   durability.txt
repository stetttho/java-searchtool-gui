 I was using this radio for about two weeks.  Before I get to the one-star, let me just say that the only thig good is it's portability.  Firstly, sound quality, even on nice headphones, is crap. It sounds like there is additional fuzz in the treble. So much for the sound quality.  The durability isn't good. I was using it, dropped it from two feet, smash, gone. The radio is now worthless. So much for the durability.  There weren't many features. The only one I liked was the lock button, but it was to easy to press, that it was useless. So much for the features.  It was cheap.  Let that be a lesson to you. Cheap doesn't always mean value.
