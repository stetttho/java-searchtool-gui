 Beyonce used to be in a great group called Destiny's Child. And she threw it out the window. Yes, Hilary Duff did that too. But there both stupid. When you have friends, you should keep them, and not throw them out the window. Well, enough about that, let's get back to the reviewing. crazy in love 5/5 naughty girl 2/5 baby boy 5/5 best hop hop star 1/5 worst be with you 4/5 me myself and i 4/5 yes 3/5 signs 4/5 speechless 3/5 that's how you like it 4/5 the closer i get to you 4/5 dangerously in love 5/5 beyonce interlude 1/5 (bad interlude) gift from virgo 2/5 daddy 3/5 overall 2/5 My recommendation is either burn it, or don't buy it and watch it go down the billboard charts. Listeners Very Strong Voice Youre Cool Friends Might Have It Returners Way Too Slow Songs Not Any Good Songs (baby boy and crazy in love are actually pretty good) So take my advice or read others because it's the same review. I hope this helped.
