 Sony's latest portable CD/AM/FM/TV/WB walkman is a nice player. The sound on the unit is very good, tough not quite as good as Panasonic's. It has 2 equalizers, while may CD players out today have 3.  The design is below average. The buttons are poorly placed, and button are hard to find and memorize. The CD player is very slim, which is a plus. Also, the CD player is sturdy and has good construction, as most Sony products.  There are many features, such as AM radio, FM radio, TV, and Weatherband, but there is no MP3 feature, which is a big minus. The player does come with a remote, but only very basic features are on it, like play, stop, pause, back, and next. There is a hold button on the CD player and remote.  The cost is way overpriced. Most players at this price range have MP3, and have better sound.  Overall, the DFJ200 is a flawed and overpriced CD player. Not recommended.
