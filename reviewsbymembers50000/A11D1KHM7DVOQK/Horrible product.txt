 It ruined 4 of my CDs! It has this white circle thing on the CD that will not come off! I went to my local music store, and they said the Skipdoctor took plastic off of the CD itself. Though, I bought it at Best Buy, which of course they basically don't return anything. Bad! Just go to your dollar store a few blocks down and get bathroom disinfecting wipes. They will give more satisfaction than this CD ruiner will!
