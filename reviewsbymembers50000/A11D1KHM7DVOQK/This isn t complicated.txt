 Ok, let me start by saying that Complicated was my favorite song of 2002. Everyone loved how good it was and how much airplay it recieved. I bought this CD expecting Complicated. Well, it was Complicated, just not how I remembered. Complicated on this single is some weird remix. I hated the remix. Then I heard the rest of the CD which was actually worthless. I Don't Give and Why were both medicore. 1. Complicated (Remix) 1/5 2. I Don't Give 2/5 3. Why 2/5 Overall 5/15 30% F
