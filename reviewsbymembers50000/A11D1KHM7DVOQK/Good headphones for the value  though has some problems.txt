 I don't know why people are complaining about $7 headphones. They are $7, they are probably the cheapest headphones with foam ear cushions! Anyway, these are not the best headphones when it comes to sound. One problem I've had with these headphones were VOLUME! The volume on these are extremly low even on my loudest setting on my CD player and the loudest setting on the headphones. The design was extremly comfortable. Though, for these headphones, they are perfect on a low and tight budget, but if you have a bit more cash, you may want to go look at some more expensive headphones and a better brand.
