 Before buying this, I didn't know Fall Out Boy from a ham and cheese sandwhich. I bought this album for "Dance, Dance", "Sugar We're Going Down", and all the hype. Well the truth is...  this album isn't really that good, most of it is forgettable (funny how people call this the most catchy band ever and I find most of these tracks forgetable). However there are some good cuts on the album. The song "Sugar We're Going Down" (which I'm guessing where at least 60% of these reviewers came from) is a good song, though it is very catchy. "Dance, Dance" seems annoying and weird at first but it becomes very pleasureable at the end. As for tracks that aren't singles, I found "7 Minutes in Heaven (Atavan Halen)" to be a very great song, with fantasic riffs. "Sophomore Slump or Comeback of the Year" is at least halfway decent pop-rock even though most of the song is forgetable. "A Little Less Sixteen Candles, A Little More "Touch Me" is a good song, with great riffs, and some very creative writing, though it can get somewhat repetitive, it's still worth a few listens.  But the rest of the album just doesn't match up. "Xo" is a very good song until you get to minute 1:42 where it gets more repetitive than ever. "Get Busy Living or Get Busy Dying" isn't very appealing at all, most of it is just screaming while a guitar and drums are just rolling along. "I've Got a Dark Alley and a Bad Idea That Says You Should Shut Your Mouth" is nothing special, a ballad that doesn't seem to go anywhere. "Champagne for My Real Friends, Real Pain for My Sham Friends" has a decent chorus but the rest of the song is just forgetable pop-rock with not very decent riffs or drums.  Overall, if I were to make the decision of downloading the good songs or buying the full album, I would've downloaded "Sugar We're Going Down", "Dance, Dance", and "7 Minutes In Heaven". The rest of the CD is forgetable, and very bland, or maybe even moldy pop-rock.
