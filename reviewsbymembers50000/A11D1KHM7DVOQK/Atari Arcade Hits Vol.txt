 Well this game is really good. I'm getting it soon and my friend has it. Sound Quality - 4 This game doesn't really have sound but the way the beeps sound it feels like you're in a 90's arcade. Graphics - 4.5 The graphics are actually really good for arcade games. ( -.5 for centipede) Fun - 5.5 Well, 5.5 is all you have to say. Challenging - 4 These games are highly challenging. NOTE: I got all the way to Level 10 on Centipede. Pros: Still Fun To Play Suprisingly Good Graphics Cons: Using The Keyboard Peforms Choppy Gameplay Not Enough Games On CD GO BUY IT TODAY! I hope this helped.
