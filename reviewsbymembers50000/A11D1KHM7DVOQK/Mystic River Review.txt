 This is at bottom a pulp thriller that strains to reach the level of basic human truths. This is one of the best American movies of the year, crisply well-crafted and beautifully acted. What results is also Eastwood's best direction since 'Unforgiven' and arguably the best, most mature work of his career.'Mystic River' merits serious awards attention for Eastwood's artfully understated direction, and come nominations time, Robbins, Penn and Harden belong among the front-runners. 'Mystic River' is the rare American movie that aspires to the full weight and darkness of tragedy. I highly recommend buying this movie.
