 Paul Crewe (played by Adam Sandler), former NFL quarterback, gets thrown into a maximum security jail in Allenville, TX after stealing his girlfriend's rich car. But the football coach of the jail (played by Burt Reyonlds) has another thing coming to him. Paul is forced to join with the football team, one that is better as acting like Beyonce than throwing a football. Paul will have to teach the crew how to play football. However, as the co-captain, "Caretaker" (played by Chris Rock) gets killed by a bomb, the warden of the jail will file complaints on Paul if he doesn't lose a match of football to the guards to set him free.  Sorry, but usually whenever Adam Sandler is on a front cover of a movie that means good. Not this time. Adam Sandler tried to be a good actor but the script couldn't help him. Same thing happened to Chris Rock, nor were either of the two comedians hilarious, I could not think of a time where I truly laughed. Nelly definitely deserved more time on the movie, he was a very good actor. The criminals were all bad actors, either they were way too rough or your sitting there thinkning "These are criminals?". THe guards were awful actors too, telling people to sit down and shut up, acting more like a teacher than a guard of a maximum security jail. The movie's main problem, however, was that there wasn't a resolution. No ending........just leave it for you to decide. Although the plot was good, the actors need lessons and Peter Segal forgot his 7th grade English lessons. Unrecommended and 2 stars.
