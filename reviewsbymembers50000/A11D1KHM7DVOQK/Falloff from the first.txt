 1. Maria Maria- F I very much hate Santana.  2. Genie In a Bottle- A+ Very great song! ONe of the only good ones on here.  3. Never Let You Go- A Jumper was great, and this is no exception.  4. Falls Apart- D+ Very weak follow-up to Someday.  5. Amazed- F I hate country. Hate it, hate it, hate it!  6. Mambo #5- D This was a great song, but once it's overplayed, it's cursed.  7. Beautiful Stranger- A Very good, but doesn't beat Ray of Light.  8. My Love is Your Love- B+ A good song, but it's very old.  9. Take a Picture- A+ Very great rock song!  10. Dear Lie- D- Wait...wait...wait...is this TLC? The creators of Creep? The creators of No Scrubs? The creators of CrazySexyCool? No, this must be a mistake. TLC can't create this kind of song..can they? It's horrible!  11. Hot Boyz- D- Hot is an overused slang term. Hot Boys is annoying enough, and when you spell boys "boyz", it's just awful.  12. Natural Blues- A Moby is awesome an he is soooooooo underrated.  13. Girl On TV-Drippy boy band ballad. F *cough* LFO *cough*  14. I Drive Myself Crazy- D- I have enough on my mind. I don't need Justin Timberlake making my music choices for me.  15. U Know What's Up- F Poser! Poser! Stupid! He also sounds like he may be...g@y. Who knows? May be true!  16. Right Here Waiting- B- Monica is awesome, but one of her worst.  17. The Great Beyond- D- You have to admit, this song is boring, but R.E.M. is awesome.  18. I Will Remember You- A+ WTF? TH gives us all of this crap and the ending has the best song of the CD? Anyway, best ballad of the year.   Overall - D+ Mega falloff from the first one. I wouldn't get this CD only if you like most of the songs. Get the first one, it's much better.
