 NOW and Totally Hits have both been competetors of biannual (or sometimes triannual) complications. It seems in the beginning, Totally Hits had a strong lead above NOW, but then Totally Hits started to flat out, offering more flops and songs that people have never heard of. Maybe with this issue, Totally Hits will start to get back-on-track and getting more satisfaction of what NOW used to offer (Now 17 & 18 were complete flops).  The CD offers four #1 songs (I'm talking about radio top 40, not the Hot 100), "Since U Been Gone", "Let Me Love You", "I Don't Want To Be", and "1, 2 Step". To back up the CD, there are three that made the top 10, and six that made the radio top 40 at all. All together, that is only 13 songs.  The other 7 were complete flops. Though, "Truth Is" is backed up by the R&B charts, that doesn't match up to the CD of any sort. "Charlene" could have been added to an earlier disc, as it was a hit way back in the fall of 2004. "Charlene" was also backed up by R&B charts. "Bring Em' Out" was very minor on the top 40 charts, however, once again, it was backed up by other charts. It would be better if the CD sticked to one genre. When your make a "mixed bag" complication, add songs that people who are buying this know.  "Tempted To Touch" and "So Much More" were minor to say the least. "So Much More" and "Turn Da Lights Off" were basically non-existant and "Tempted To Touch" in the Top 60.  It also wouldn't be too bad if these complications were so predictable. Adding artists that weren't on this complication before such as Green Day, Natalie, The Killers, and Usher would be nice.  Maybe I'm right, but maybe I'm wrong, but I think Totally Hits 2005 flopped with 65% of songs in the Top 40, and Now 18 had a 75% rate. Most of the songs on the CD were good, but if they aren't hits then why are they on this CD?  Replay Value: Medium Child Appeal: Low Teen Appeal: High Adult Appeal: Low
