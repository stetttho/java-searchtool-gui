 It seems like this DVD is missing a lot of stuff, and has some mistakes!  First off, there is nothing inside the case but the DVD. Big dissappoint, since it makes it look good.  Another thing is that you HAVE TO watch the commercials. Not aloud to skip + it's on the main menu trying to force you to see it.  The biggest dissappointment is the movie itself. At the end, I asked myself, "Is that it?". Shrek 2 was cute, but that's it.  Really the only thing you need to know is a cat joins Shrek. Wow, big changes! Oops, guess I spoiled the movie. Sorry! Wasn't that good anyway.  Go get Garfield, Cinderella Story, Elf, or something cute to watch, because this DVD is boring and a waste of time.
