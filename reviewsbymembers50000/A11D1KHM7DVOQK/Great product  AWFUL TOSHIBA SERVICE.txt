 I bought this computer a while back, because at that time (Spring 2003), my Gateway 400C (very old), had completely died (I got it to work in Decmember 2003, then it died in May this year...for good). Although the computer's power is good, I was VERY dissappointed in Toshiba.  The proccessor is an Intel Centrino...nice! The memory is good at 512 MB, but I wish I could upgrade it. Some programs use a lot of the memory. It uses Windows XP Home. I love Windows XP, it's one of Microsoft's best OSs (unless you count Longhorn). The hard drive is 100 GB, that's big...for me that is. It's a little big but it's really light, so you won't notice.  But what really wanted me to write this review is the VERY poor Toshiba service. In October, the Blaster worm was attacked on my computer. Sadly, Norton definitions were outdated, and didn't track it. All of the sudden, restart in one minute. Frustrating. I called Toshiba since the computer was still under their warranty, I asked them about 10 times (for them to understand me) that I would need a restoration disc. They said it would be here in 3 weeks. Four weeks...it's still a no-show. I call them again, and they actually have the nerve to refuse to help me! I took the computer to Best Buy to see if they could get me a restoration disc. They said that they have them...they're coming in a week. So far, add it all up, it was about 3 months before getting the computer to work (which inspired me to fix the Gateway). Adding on, my friend's Toshiba laptop (different model) had spyware on it, and Toshiba refused to help them...to be honest for no good reason. Also, if you read my review for Toshiba's DVD/VHS player, it seems Toshiba is just a poor company.  I know the review is about the computer, but I'm VERY angry at Toshiba. I am not buying Toshiba again.
