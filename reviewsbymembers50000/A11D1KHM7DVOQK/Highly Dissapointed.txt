 I am really dissapointed in this film. Ben Stiller is hilarious in Starsky And Hutch, but Dogeball dodged me in the wrong way. One thing that I didn't like, was that in the first 2 minutes of the movie, it felt like I already watched it. The rest of the movie just seemed so predictable afterwards, and I got it right on the first try. Usually, this never happens. Dodgeball is more of a rental, or maybe it's not even worth a rental. If you ask me, it's really not that funny. The only part I even smiled was when they called this girl a double 0. I think that's just hilarious, but the rest of the movie was dull. I thought the DVD case was more entertaining than the movie really. It is! Go look at it! Please, don't buy. It's a rental, or even not a rental. Maybe it's a throw away movie considering I've heard the double 0 joke somewhere else. Not funny! Try again Stiller!
