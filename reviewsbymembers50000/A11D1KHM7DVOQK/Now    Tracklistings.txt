 Here is the Now 19 tracklist, now fan already posted it, but some songs are incorrect:   PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS THE REAL TRACKLIST, NOT A PREDICTION LIST, I REPEAT, NOT A PREDICTION LIST  1.

Killers - Mr. Brightside  19. Coldplay - Speed Of Sound  20. Gorillaz - Feel Good Incorporated    Around April, I posted a prediction list/list of chosing the songs on Now 19.   Pop   "Rich Girl" Gwen Stefani/Eve  "Incomplete" Backstreet Boys  "Get Right" Jennifer Lopez  "Dirty Laundry" Lisa Marie Presley   Hip-Hop/Rap/R&B/All That Kind Of Stuff   "Candy Shop" 50 Cent  "Goin' Crazy" Natalie  "Lonely" Akon  "Girl" Destiny's Child  "Don't Phunk With My Heart" Black Eyed Peas  "Baby I'm Back" Baby Bash/Akon  "Okay" Nivea/Lil' Jon  "Girlfight" Brooke Valentine  "Oh" Ciara/Ludacris   Rock   "Let Me Go" 3 Doors Down  "Almost" Bowling For Soup  "You And Me" Lifehouse  "The Geeks Get The Girls" American Hi-Fi  "Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own" U2  "We Believe" Good Charlotte   Country   "Making Memories Of Us" Keith Urban   First, Pop. "Incomplete" and a Gwen Stefani song were predicted. Gwen Stefani's "Hollaback Girl" was added (more recent) instead of "Rich Girl". Jennifer Lopez wasn't added, but Shakira made a spot for the Latin area. Lisa Marie Presley's "Dirty Laundry" didn't make much of an entrance on the charts, so it was left in the dust, and Anna Nalick's "Breathe" was added for alternative-pop.   The hip-hop is loaded, again. Luckily most of the hip-hop section is R&B, so were not choaked on hip-hop *cough* Now 17 *cough*. 4/9 of the predictions I chose made the Now 19 tracklistings. Instead of 50 Cent, they chose Eminem, which Imo was not a smart move because Eminem's "Mockingbird" is a bit dated right now. 50 Cent's "Candy Shop" or "Just A Lil' Bit" would have been better additions, but Eminem is better than 50 Cent. Natalie suprisingly was not added and the Black Eyed Peas were suprisingly not added. Instead, Baby Bash and Frankie J were added in the R&B/Hip-Hop section. Nivea wasn't added, but that wasn't too much of a suprise. Bobby Valentino was added instead of Ludacris, and of course, they have some kind of connection.   My rock section of my prediction list was completely outdated. Most of the rock choices that were added would be ones I would choose if my prediction list was more recent. Notice the word most; how did Relient K make it on here?  And, of course, the random country song from Keith Urban was added. Nows include a country song from the Dixie Chicks, Keith Urban, or Gretchen Wilson. It's a trend that started on Now 16, through Now 12 has Keith Urban and Now 11 has the Dixie Chicks.  Now 19 rocks! Tracklistings rock, and it looks like people agree (now fan, tracklistings look similar to moaning for a life's).  Also, this may be ridiculous, but I'm so bored...here's a Now 20 prediction list.  Natasha Bedingfield - These Words Pretty Ricky - Grind With Me Destiny's Child - Cater 2 U Eminem - A$$ Like That Gwen Stefani - Cool Bowling For Soup - Ohio Come Back To Texas Amerie - Touch Akon - Bonanza Belly Dancer Backstreet Boys - My Beautiful Woman 3 Doors Down - Behind Those Eyes Killers - Smile Like You Mean It Coldplay - What If Black Eyed Peas - Gone Going Jessica Simpson - Those Boots Are For (she has an album coming out + this is the 1st single) Nivea - Complicated Ludacris/Bobby Valentino - Pimpin' All Over The World Keith Urban - You'll Think Of Me Bobby Valentino - Tell Me Relient K - Getting Into You
