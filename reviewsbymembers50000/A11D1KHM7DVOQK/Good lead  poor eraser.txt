 God people, it's a pencil...it's pretty hard to not like it. Unless your like an artist or something.  Well, I'm no artist, but I have to travel around my school, going to class to class that are on the other side of the school to the other, so I NEED a lot of pencils because I do lose them a lot, and I need something kinda cheap too. So I bought the Office Depot brand, because nobody could screw up a pencil.  And, Office Depot didn't these wrong. These are great pencils for a very low price.  Oh, just so everyone knows, I bought the 24 pack. I didn't want 72 pencils, because I don't use them THAT MUCH.  Here's the thing. Using regular Mead paper, I just can't seem to get the darn pencils to erase. I have got the eraser to work a few times, but usually I end up having to use a seperate one.  These are great pencils for a low price. But, having a seperate eraser can get annoying at times.
