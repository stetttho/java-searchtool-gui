 (1) Madonna "Music"(Deep Dish Dot Com Radio Edit) B+ This is a good song, but I didn't like the remix too much.   (2) Pink "Most Girls" A- This is a good song, but could have been a bit better, considering it's P!nk.   (3) Matchbox Twenty "Bent" B- I like Matchbox 20, but this song didn't have enough flavor.   (4) Vertical Horizon "Everything You Want" A+ I very much like this song. It's very good, and has a hint of Alternative.   (5) Third Eye Blind "Deep Inside Of You" B- Good song, but a bit too repetitive.   (6) Barenaked Ladies "Pinch Me" B Not as good as One Week, but still has effort.   (7) Faith Hill "The Way You Love Me"(Radio Mix) A Once again, I hate country, but love Faith Hill, and this song is no exception.   (8) Dido "Here With Me" B- Not as good as other Dido songs, but still worth a few listens.   (9) Toni Braxton "He Wasn't Man Enough" F He wasn't man enough because he was a girl. Sorry, but this song sucks @$$.   (10) Christina Aguilera "What A Girl Wants" B+ It's good, but I've seen mmmmmmmuuuuuuuucccccccchhhhhh better from her.   (11) Next "Wifey" C- Was this even a hit?   (12) Debelah Morgan "Dance With Me" F This is a horrible song.   (13) Joy Enriquez "Tell Me How You Feel" F Hate this song? Who is Joy Enriquez?   (14) Vitamin C "Graduation" A+ Now were getting somewhere! Great song, and fullfilling to all graduations.   (15) The Corrs "Breathless" A- This is a great song from some UK rockers (I think they are from the UK). Anyway, great song guys!   (16) Whitney Houston "Fine" C+ No, this song is not fine, it's ok.   (17) John Michael Montgomery feat. Alison Krauss and Dan Tyminski "The Little Girl" F I just wanna say, who cares for this song? Not oonly is it annoying, it was never ahit. Plus, who are all these people? WTF???   Overall- B- Just barely made it to the B range. But, I know they could have done much better. Will the first always be the best?
