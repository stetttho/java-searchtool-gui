 Okay, before you scroll down and click "no" just because you admire Ashlee Simpson actually read the review first. To be honest I'm sick of people posting SNL again and again but this review is about the CD.  Let me start by saying that I really enjoyed "Autobiography". I loved the feel of it, and the odd blonde-pop-rock genre. I think "Boyfriend" is one of the worst songs I've heard in a while. "I didn't steal your boyfriend." . Ha ha I heard that from someone yesterday, but nonetheless it doesn't work in the song. The unmelodic guitars don't improve anything and Ashlee trys but her limited vocal range is against her. And I'm serious, the next time I hear "L-o-l-o-l-o-l-o-v-e" (I've heard the song only 2 times), I'm gonna rip my ears off. Ashlee trys to do a club record, fat chance. Same thing with the wasteful "Burnin' Up". Trying to make rumors of Lindsay Lohan in "I Am Me" is okay, but, umm your not 50 Cent! "Coming Back For More" is okay but it has a country feel that makes me gag.  There are few, and I mean a few, tracks worth this CD a second listen. "Beautifully Broken", yeah it's about SNL screw-up but it's definitely a nice played song from her band. "Dancing Around" is another pick with an upbeat feel, and is it just me or does it sound almost exact to "Love Makes The World Go Round"? "Say Goodbye" is my last pick, a nice ballad that shows all of what her vocal range can produce.  This comparing to "Autobiography", is a shame. In "Autobiography" we got fun catchy pop-rock songs you'd be playing for hours, but this is carbon-copy material that's barely worth the disc it's printed on. Unrecommended and 2 stars.
