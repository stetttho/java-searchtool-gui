 ...but they're okay. As a matter of fact, I'm not what you'd consider an audiophile. Although I wasn't totally dissappointed with these, I ended up getting the MDR-J10.  SOUND QUALITY: While the sound of these are better than some similar priced earbuds, the sound is just okay. The MDR-J10 from Sony in my opinion has a fuller bass, though not clear treble that the MX400's have. I have to turn up the bass on my player all the way up to get the bass out of the MX400, and it distorts a lot at high volume. If you dislike the sound of these, I'd highly recommend trying some Fontopia's or the h.ear from Sony.  DURABILITY: These seem to be pretty durable. The plastic is pretty tough, but I wouldn't be suprised if they cracked or something.  PORTABILITY: They're earbuds. Nuff' said.  COST: For the sound, I think these are a little overpriced, and should be around the $5-$8 range rather than the $10-$15 range. The treble is clear, but the bass...the headphones free with my $5 cassette player had more bass.  OVERALL: Get something else for a better sounding experience.
