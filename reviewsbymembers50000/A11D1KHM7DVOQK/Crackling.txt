 The CD player has some problems. First, the sound quality is pretty bad in the headphones and on commerically avaliable ones from Panasonic and Sony. The bass is not good, and treble is somewhat screechy. Secondly, and most importantly, I hear cracks. Not skipping, like the music will stop, just cracks, and a lot! I went to check if it was the CD and it wasn't, it was this Coby CD player.  If you're going to buy a good CD player, why not fork out $20 more for a Panasonic, Sony, Philips, or another good quality brand. If you're gonna get something, why not get something a little more expensive and not have to buy several (which will cost more in the long run) CD players. Why not get a CD player that is better than the rest? DFJ-200, SL-CT582V, the RP models, those are some good examples.
