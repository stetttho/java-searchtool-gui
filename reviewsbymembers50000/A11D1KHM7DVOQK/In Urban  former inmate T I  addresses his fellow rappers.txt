 T.I. recorded Urban Legend while in a work-release program for probation violation. But judging by his grudge-laden approach, he's addressing other violations as well - namely, claims by fellow Southern rappers that they're superior. Backed by synths for a sound he regards as counter-crunk, he lays out his defense in lyrical volleys aimed at rivals like Ludacris, and when he declares ''I'm the King,'' you just about believe him.
