 "Let Go" is hands-down, one of my favorite albums of all time. Comes from that, is a fun rock song called "Losing Grip". It's a little rougher from what Avril usually releases as CD singles. Yes, it's a fun, very catchy, teen-rock-somewhat-pop-but-not-really-considered-pop song.  Here's the problem with this single. Pop radio (which is where her songs are mainly played) will not play this song often, because it's too rock for pop radio.  Yes, it did get some spins on pop radio, and maybe (on some) alternative rock stations played it, but radio didn't like it, because it's too hard for pop, but it's too soft for rock.
