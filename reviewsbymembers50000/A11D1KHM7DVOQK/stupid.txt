 I don't know anyone who would like this CD. Well, Master P wasn't a good rapper, and the generation passes on. Lil' Romeo sucks. He can't sing or rap just like his dad. Go get real rap. not LITTLE Romeo.  P.S. Whoever said Lil' Romeo was part of the best record company, THINK AGAIN! Go to Product Details and you'll find he is actually on one of the worst yet...KOCH!!! Yes, Koch, the people who make Strawberry Shortcake albums and Barbie CDs...oh yeah the best record company ever.  LITTLE ROMEO SUCKS BAD VERY BAD VERY VERY BAD VERY VERY VERY BAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
