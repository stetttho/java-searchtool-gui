 Natalie, the latest Mariah Carey-wannabe (which there have been many of), decided to make her own album. As of passing times there have been numerous Mariah Carey-wannabes that fail, but luckily, Natalie has the talent, and is on her way to become the next Mariah Carey.  Natalie's voice is soft, nice, and gentle. She can hit notes perfectly, and at times not. "Ooh" and "You're The One" don't have quite enough prominency as songs like "Goin' Crazy" or "Emptiness", but Natalie's voice easily flows through the dancier tracks such as "Something About You" and "I Can't Wait". And don't forget the bubble-gum yet wonderful feel in "Energy".  Natalie's lyrics, as all do these days, need some work. The lyrics are about simple love, using words in different meanings, and other common problems with lyrics today. However, Natalie's lyrics never bombed. They are just average love lyrics, like "I love you...I want to hold you.", "Where are you? I miss you.", and other so-s lyrics that you can think of. The lyrics don't really need to be complex, they just need to be catchy, and Natalie's lyrics are indeed catchy, even if they're basic.  Natalie's CD surely is a mixed bag. You get R&B, Pop, and Dance all in one. Example, "Ooh" is a slow, R&B song, while you can have "I Can't Wait" on the dance floor.   The beats in the song are a very nice addition, though "Stay" is...um...beat-less. A lot of the R&B songs have strong bass beats, while the others are little bass beats, but I'm unsure of how that makes the song better or worse.  Natalie's CD is definitly a treat for everyone. I highly recommended you go check her out. With songs like this, she may be the next Mariah Carey. 4 stars.  Replay Value: Medium Child Appeal: Low Teen Appeal: High Adult Appeal: Low
