 This CD is incredibly awesome! It has a bunch of genres anyone would like. Contemparary (ADULT) - Momentum, Love Is In The House, and In The Air. Pop - Irene, and Don't Bring Me Down. Rock (MAINSTREAM) - Get This Party Started, What's Going Down, Yours, and Extreme Days. Rap (HIP HOP) - J Train, Wondering Why, and Somebody's Watching. Urban (R&B) - Do You Know. So, that pretty much explains why everyone would like this CD. Really, there actually isn't very many strong gospel words in Momentum. There might be Lord, God, prayer, etc. So overall, anyone would like this CD, even if they don't like gospel music. I'm actually a fan of Pop and Rock. Now, I can listen to two genres on 1 CD and don't have to switch. P.S. TobyMac has an incredible voice!
