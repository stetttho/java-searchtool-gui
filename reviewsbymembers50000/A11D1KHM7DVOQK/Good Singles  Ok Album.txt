 Matchbox 20 released a lot of singles off of this album. I really enjoyed the ones they picked. I couldn't wait to get the album. I got it but, I wasn't impressed. The only good songs were the singles which were all overplayed besides "Downfall". Really, you would be better off listening to the radio, but, you would like a few songs that weren't singles. It's worth the money, but it's not the best of Matchbox 20.
