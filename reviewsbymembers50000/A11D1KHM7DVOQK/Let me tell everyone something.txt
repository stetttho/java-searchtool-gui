 Some people are complaining about Billy S. It's not their fault. Actually, it's Nickeloden's fault. Skye Sweetnam was going to sign with Nick Records, but then redecided to join with Capitol Records. On with the album, it's great. Every song is just so perfect. Skye Sweetnam is a great band! Everyone should listen to Skye Sweetnam and buy their album, and remember, Billy S is for kids.
