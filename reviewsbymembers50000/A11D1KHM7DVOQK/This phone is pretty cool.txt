 I like the camera and video camera. I also like the Get It Now feature, where you can download ringtones and games. It also has a planner and voice recorder. It even has text messaging and you can check your e-mail and log onto the internet.It has voice recognition so u can dial hands-free. I like this phone and plan to keep it for the rest of the plan. I am a teen and this phone rocks!
