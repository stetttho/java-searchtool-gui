 The "Overprotected (Darkchild Mix)" was really the only reason I purchased this, because my Now 10 CD broke and I didn't have enough money to buy another, and I found this at a much cheaper price (probably because it's only a single). I found one more song that I kinda liked, and the Darkchild Mix that I had wanted. The rest I could careless for.  1. I Love Rock & Roll [Album Version] - D+ Very poor remake of the Joan Jett/Heartbreakers version. I guess you can take it or leave it.  2. I Love Rock & Roll [Karaoke Version] - (no grade really, I don't have a karaoke machine)  3. Overprotected [Darkchild Remix] - A+ Really the reason I got this single, because my Now 10 broke (sad face), and there was no other way I could get it.        4. I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman [Metro Remix] - B- It's an okay remix, not one of my favs though.   5. I'm a Slave 4 U [Thunderpuss Radio Mix] - F Horrible remix! Plus, I'm A Slaue 4U is such an overrated and stupid song!        6. I'm a Slave 4 U [Miguel Migs Petalpusher Vocal - see #5  7. I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman [Spanish Fly Dub Mix] - D Although I love this song, the remix ruines it.  Overall Grade - D If the remixes hadn't ruined it, it would have been an awesome single, but I guess you can say only buy this if you like the Darkchild Mix or I Love Rock N' Roll (which mostly everyone should hate considering it's a horrible remake). Stay away!
