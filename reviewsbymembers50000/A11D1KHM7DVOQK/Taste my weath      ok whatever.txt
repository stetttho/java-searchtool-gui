 Fabolous's Real Talk has some good and some bad songs. It's a good effort, but it's not a great CD. It's only good, but it's truly worth some spins. I thought the single "Breathe" was medicore. 1, and the 2, then the 3, then breathe? I can hold up to 10 seconds without breathing, and I have asthma. If you can only hold your breath for 3 seconds, you are going to die tomorrow. Good luck!  Fabolous sometimes, kinda what I said earlier, raps about some strange things. He starts saying weird things like, "...brace myself, pace myself, taste my weath..." First, what does brace myself mean? And, taste my weath? I think Fabolous could think of something better in replacement. On songs like Can You Hear Me, he puts his skill to work over the medicore tracks. On "Gangsta" he threatens to "put the red dot on you like the Japan flag." Great -- got any raps about Sweden? I mean, rap about country flags? Get real! Anyway, if you pass over the medicore tracks, you may find a great CD in here somewhere.
