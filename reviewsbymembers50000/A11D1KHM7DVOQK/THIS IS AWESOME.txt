 Pieces of Me is a really good song. I can't wait for Autobiography to be released. I listened to all of it on MTV and every song is sooooo good! Ashlee sort of reminds me of Avril. They both started with a soothing pop song and the rest of their songs were rock. I hope Ashlee does awesome. KEEP GOING ASHLEE! YOU ARE DOING GREAT!
