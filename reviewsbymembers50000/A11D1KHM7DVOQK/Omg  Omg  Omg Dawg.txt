 First off, what's with all these garbage reviews? I looked through, and saw various 1 and 5 star reviews, hence the overall 3 star rating. Either they're an obsessed hater, or an obsessed fan. Not that all of the 1 and 5 star reviews are garbage, but take a good look at all customer reviews.  Anyway, I first heard Mike Jones on the radio with "Still Trippin'". I learned Mike Jones was in a small group before, but got little success.  I heard the "Who Is Mike Jones?" album online and wasn't expecting too much, as "Still Trippin" had the deepest and most annoying vocals I've ever heard, and just a so-so beat. It seems my expectations were set correctly.  The lyrics were pretty basic, not to mention odd. "pockets stick out more than my belly..." is an example. Another thing in his lyrics are his shout-outs, including his phone number (of course not his area code), other rappers he was influenced by/rappers he enjoys and the rappers of his old group. This is boring and also annoying. His shout-outs and phone number are filled, make the CD like a broken record. "phone number...shoutout...shoutout...phone number...shoutout...phone number" and on and on and on.  The vocals are quite bland, and are shockingly deep, which is not a good thing. Take Andre 3000's voice and take it to -3 semitones. Many of you recorders know what I mean. Anyway, his voice is annoyingly deep and annoying.  One thing I noticed, is the Jamster Ringtone commerical where someone says "OMG! OMG! OMG DAWG!" on the ringtone, hence the review name. If this is in the chopped/scrwed CD, this is beyond me.  Well, the question still remains. "Who Is Mike Jones?". Well, after listening to this, you'll be thinking "just another one-hit wonder". Try looking elsewhere for your new hip-hop/rap CD.
