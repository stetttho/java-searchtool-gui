 Hi! I will rate the first five songs on this cd by F by being the worst and A being the best.They will be rated by how big of a hit it was and how good it sounds. 1.The Game Of Love-Michelle Branch ft.Santana- A it was a huge hit on the adult contemparary chart. It charted on for over 40 weeks. 2.Family Protrait-Pink- B it is kind of an earlier hit but it did score on the top 10 on billboard hot 100. 3.I'm With You-Avril Lavigne (see number 2) 4.Just Like A Pill-(once again see number 2) 5.What Happened To That Boy-Baby ft.Clipse- D Ugh! This is a terrible song + it didn't chart above 50 on billboard hot 100 so it wasn't an ultimate hit. First 5 Songs-Various Artists B there were some hits,some of them are old but most of the songs are good. The Full CD-Various Artists B (four stars) (see first 5 songs) Well,what are you waiting for?
