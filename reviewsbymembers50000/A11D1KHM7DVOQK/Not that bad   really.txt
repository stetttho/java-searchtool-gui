 Believe it or not, I found these at a local dollar store. They aren't as bad as I thought, but other people who think the sound is booming, lower your expectations NOW.  Pros: - Good traveling headphones. - Fairly good sound suprisingly since they are earbuds and other bad reviews on Amazon. - Good carrying case.  Cons: - Not so durable. One headphone broke and I had to buy a new pair. - Amazon's price is very high.  Overall, these headphones derserve a try, but remember to 1) lower your expectations and 2) not buy them for...let's say... more than $5.00.
