 Well, I just want to get something of off my chest to tell everyone thinking about buying this album.        Ruben is boring. His voice is great, but nothing fits him, as if he should go away. Ruben and this CD are not R&B, or pop, or rock, or country, or rap, or AC. So, what is this album? I think Ruben made a new genre called "borsoul" because this album is a mix of gospel, R&B, pop, and boring.  I'm not going to blame Ruben, I'm blaming J Records for making this.  Sorry Ruben. Maybe next time, if there is one, you'll create a good and fun album like Kelly Clarkson and soon Diana DeGarmo.
