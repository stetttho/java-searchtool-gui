 It's a good cd, but there are barely any "classics" to make this a holiday cd. I would take all the "non-classics" and make them singles so they can become "hits". As for the cd, it's really good, all of the songs are fantastic. But, it needs some songs like "Christmas Song" "Winter Wonderland" "Let It Snow" "Deck The Halls" and stuff like that. The artist choices are good, but the songs choice are kind of bland.
