 I'm not going to talk about the game...because that will waste time. I'm going to talk about the system itself, which personally I did not enjoy. I did NOT buy this system or recieved for a gift, but my friend did.  Pros: - Awesome game...no doubt Mario rocks - Stereo speakers, which as I remember did not come with the other systems as the GB, GBC, GBA, or GBA-SP - Two screens. - Pictochat is awesome.  Cons: - Two screens. It can also be a pain as well as a benefit. - Hard to find people on chat. - Personally, I think it's too big and bulky to call it portable. - Can't play Game Boy/Game Boy Color games (though...most old GB games are extremly boring) - Highly expensive. Even for the game and case. - Hard to find other DS compatible games. - Download updates takes FOREVER!!! Trust me.  Overall: Game - awesome DS - good speakers, good chat, good game screen, bad touch screen, bad price, bad updates, a bit big for portable style  Advice: Get the GBA-SP. It's cheaper and a bit more enjoyable.
