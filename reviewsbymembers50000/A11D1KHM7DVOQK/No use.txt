 As other reviewers have mentioned, the hub does not come with the power adapter needed to use it. I'm probably not going to try to find one, because adapters (especially big ones) are almost impossible to find. Also because I have Windows XP, and an earlier reviewer said it wasn't compatable. Just skip this one.
