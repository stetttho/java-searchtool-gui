 Ok, Men in black is...well...ok. Not the greatest game in my collection, but still not the worst either. It doesn't have very good graphics, and the sound quality isn't the best either. Control is suprisingly good, and replay is not much boring as the first time. Overall, it's OK. Game Ratings for Men in Black Graphics 2/5 Sound 3/5 Control 4/5 Gameplay 3/5 Replay 3/5 Overall 3/5
