 Yes, this CD is great for the gym. You usually don't pay attention to the music anyway. It's nice jsut for a good beat.  Though, these aren't original artists, making the box set awful for CD complications, or any real listening whatseover.  So, if your doing something and you could careless about the quality of the songs, this will do. But for anything else, please by something with original artists. Thank you.
