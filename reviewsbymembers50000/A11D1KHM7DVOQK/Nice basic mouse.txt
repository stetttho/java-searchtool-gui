 This is a pretty good music. It moves smoothly around my computer desk as I click on stuff, and the ball under the mouse is soft as well. I don't know what they mean by "4D". This mouse has nothing near 4D. It's just a basic mouse with scroll. If you just want a basic mouse without wireless or laser features, get it. It's a great buy for under $15. Installation was a breeze, though the software only has a few options (remember, I said basic mouse). Anyway, I would recommend this mouse for people not looking for much features, and/or have a tight budget. Go buy it today!
