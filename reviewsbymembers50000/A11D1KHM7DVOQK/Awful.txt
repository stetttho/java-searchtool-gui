 I bought these, thinking that the CD-Rs would enhance the music, and a 30-pack was a great deal.  Not really...  First, I've had more burn failing than anything else. So, I've had many times when the CD would do only part of a CD I wanted to burn.  Secondly, they have a hard time reading in my truck, and in some other CD-R compatible players.  Thirdly, where is the album track thing, were you right the track, artist, and time. Almost every Music CD-R pack has this.  Finally, and most importantly, they really don't work. They are supposed to boost and enchance the quality of the music (or that is I think they should), and I haven't seen any difference from normal CD-Rs from Maxell, TDK, and Samsung.  Overall, try Maxell, TDK, and Samsung. Those seem to work perfectly fine for me, unless your burner can't handle these brands.
