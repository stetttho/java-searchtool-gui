 Once the balladeer of hip-hop, Ja Rule has been struggling to restore thug cred ever since 50 Cent trashed his mainstream appeal. But the sole standouts on R.U.L.E. - the heartfelt ''Passion'' and the Ashanti-R. Kelly collaboration ''Wonderful'' - suggest he might want to stick to raspy romanticism. Because of all of the medicore rough songs, it makes me hard to give it 4 stars, so 3 stars for the effort and the hi-hop ballads.
