 I bought the HL150 with the HS430, because if I liked one, I could take it back. Let me tell you, the HS430 is going back to Target, pronto.  SOUND QUALITY - Very good. The bass is pretty deep, and the highs are very clear. I can hear stuff that I couldn't hear from the MDR101LP from Sony. Also, these are LOUD!!! These are even louder than the Panasonic Wrap-Its! I'm serious. These are a true buy if you hate the headphones that came with your quiet player.  COMFORTABILITY - Very comfortable. Then yet, I've never seen the overhead style be uncomfortable. Because there the fold up ear-cup style, the are able to exactly match the ear.  PORTABILITY - They don't fold up the bend way. They fold up across, which is a bit awkward, but they do fold up, and they are very portable.  COST - I'd rather pay $9 for these, than pay for the Sony brand. I just like the Philips brand so much better because they're loud, have great sound, and are comfortable.  OVERALL - These are a great deal for people looking for new overhead type headphones. Look no futher, these are a great pick, and can fit into any budget!
