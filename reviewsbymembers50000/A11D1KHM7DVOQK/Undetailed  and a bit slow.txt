 My best friend owns two of these GPS system things. So, yeah, I'm a newbie at this GPS thing. I turned it on, and it took 10 seconds for it to go to the map. Then, 10, 20, 30...60...100 seconds...why aren't the satellites connecting?...200, then finally a satellite was connected, and I was outside. I zoomed all the way in, and it was very confusing. I could only see three roads, one being the I-10 freeway. And no, Tucson is not a small city. Actually, it's pretty big, the second biggest city in Arizona, and Phoenix being the biggest, and due to all of the northwest area construction, that's not saying much. The map was very unclear, showing two main roads, I-10, and this big circle saying Flowing Wells. And Flowing Wells was actually misplaced, and should have been a little more southern.  It does have it's high points. At least you have specific numbers, on how far and fast you are walking, but once again, slow.  It does what it's supossed to do, but it does it in such a below-average way that I can not recommend.
