 Hilary Duff...oh God! That's what you'll hear from many people...including me.  Hilary Duff was never an overrated teen girl in movies and music. No. First, she was just an innocent girl, doing Disney TV shows, like the popular Lizzie McGuire, but not much bigger than that.  Then she had this weird idea that she could have a CD. And, with basic, and I mean basic, singing lessons, she made "Metamorphisis", and you don't even have to remind me how awful that CD was, full of pop/rock imatations that had awful vocals with screeching. Then that lead on to staring in many movies, "Cheaper By The Dozen", "A Cinderella Story", and many others that turned out not-so-good.  That idea soon lead on to Raven, Lindsay Lohan, and more Disney stars making music contracts.  But, Hilary Duff tried again. She want to make another CD. Which lead on to this, "Hilary Duff".  The CD is almost an identical copy of "Metamorphisis". Loaded with screechy vocals and bad writing. As usual. And with only good song, "Metamorphisis" with "So Yesterday", and now "Hilary Duff" with "Fly".  So basically, if you've seen, owned, or listened to "Metamorphisis" at all, and disliked it, don't even bother with this. Though, if you did like "Metamorphisis" (which is a low chance), this CD may be just for you.  Replay Value: Low Child Appeal: High Teen Appeal: Low Adult Appeal: Low
