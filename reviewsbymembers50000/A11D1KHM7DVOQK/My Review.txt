 Ok, let me start off by saying this is an average reggage album. Kevin Lyttle could of use a little better material, since the music sounds a little of a bor. Kevin Lyttle has a pretty nice voice, though, he's not extreme on voice. Kevin Lyttle also made a somewhat-classic with "Turn Me On". Overall, Kevin Lyttle did a great job on his album, but next time, he may want to do a little better to get more than 3 stars. Like I said this album is average, mostly because everything is good, not bad, not great. Not a bad way to start off his career.
