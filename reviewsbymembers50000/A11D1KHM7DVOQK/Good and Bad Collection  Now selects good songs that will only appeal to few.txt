 The "Now #1's" CD contains various #1 hits from artists Nelly, Jennifer Lopez, Ashlee Simpson, Nickelback, and other artists in this "genre group". Chances are if you are interested in the artists on this CD then you buy "Now" complications.  Overall this CD has a fantasic/bad collections. It contains 20 #1's from the past five years in this decade. The songs here are all good (after all they were #1's). However what most people will dislike about the CD is the song CHOICES. What I mean by this is that all of these songs have appeared on other Now complications. This is "ok" if your more of a radio listener but if you buy CDs (or MP3 or tapes...etc), chances are you own at least half of these songs somewhere. If Now included the BIGGEST #1's that they forgot on other complications, it would be a whole lot more popular and other's would be more tempted to buy. Also, they should have went back the 1998 mark (when the discs were released) and went back to 1990 at least, I think it would make the complication stronger while throwing out some of the knock-off #1's like "Pieces of Me", "Bump, Bump, Bump", "Hot In Herre", etc. This complication would have been a WHOLE lot more appealing to people that buy Now CDs and they would be more likely to buy the CD, even though strong hardcore Now fans will buy the disc regardless, only around 10-20% of Now fans will buy the disc regardless, which makes Now loose a whole lot of buyers. I can only recommend this disc to people who are hardcore Now fans or don't buy CDs and just listen to the radio.
