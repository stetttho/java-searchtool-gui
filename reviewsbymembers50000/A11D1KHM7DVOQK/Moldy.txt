 Like most people, I listened to this album after hearing "You & Me". Personally I think that "You & Me" is an excellent rock ballad. But what really caught my attention was "Blind". "Blind" is my favorite song on this CD, and has a pop-rock feel of The All-American Rejects, with great guitars and great melody. However, when I listened to the rest of the CD, the only word I could come up with is "moldy". I'm not going to blame this just on Lifehouse, but pop-rock as a whole. It seems when a band doesn't have much creativity, the songs tend to blend together into just blandness...like all of the sudden it fades into the sky. That's the exact problem with this CD. I found all of the songs (exceptions "You & Me" and "Blind") monotonous and moldy. I can only listen to about thirty seconds of a song and then get so bored that I strain to press the skip button. "Undone" is okay, but it's too much. If you would've taken out some of the guitars, it would've been a great song. The guitars play too similar melodies in the songs, the drummer is not seperated, and the writing is cliche. If half of the other songs were cut out I wouldn't care at all, in fact, it would probably make the album stronger.  If your an old Lifehouse fan, you may enjoy this CD regardless because you're used to the band, so no matter what style they do, you'll probably love it. However, if your a new Lifehouse fan, you'll become so bored you might fall asleep. I highly recommend "No Name Face" to newcomers, that CD has more upbeat and unique tracks. Only recommended to fans and 3 stars because "Blind" is one of my favorites of this year.  Replay Value: Low Child Appeal: Low Teen Appeal: Medium Adult Appeal: High
