 The real value of this book is not so much the workout and diet program, but the success stories of several men who range in age from their early 20s to 40s and have lost a considerable amount of weight. What is unique about the book is that none of the men featured in it have followed the program in the book. This does work, however, because the message I got from those stories is that we can't just rely on this workout or that diet to lose weight and get in shape. Ultimately, we all have to figure out what makes sense to us and what works for us and fit it into our own lifestyle. There are some common threads that run through each success story and if you focus on those things, you can succeed no matter what approach you end up taking. The diet and workout program presented in the book is based on some sound research and will probably work if you give it a try, but even if you don't follow the specific program in the book, it's still worth buying so you can learn from others who have successfully beaten their weight problems in their own way.
