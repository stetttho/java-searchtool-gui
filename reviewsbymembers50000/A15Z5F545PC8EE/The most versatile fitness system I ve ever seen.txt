 I've been using FitDeck to supplement my usual workout program for the last month now, using it whenever I've had time to kill or when I couldn't get to the gym or didn't feel like going to the gym. Because I've been doing other stuff along with it, it's hard to say how effective it's been, but I have found it to be almost addictive. A lot of people quit working out because they get bored. But this product solves that problem. You can use it for years and never do the same workout twice. You can do as hard or as easy a workout as you like. You can do exercises from the deck in the middle of cardio workouts. The only limits are your imagination. I especially like how on his Web site and on the DVD the FitDeck's creator doesn't make any promises about what kind of results you can get. There's no foolishness about "melting off fat" or building a world-class athlete's physique in two weeks or anything like that. In this day and age, that is truly refreshing.
