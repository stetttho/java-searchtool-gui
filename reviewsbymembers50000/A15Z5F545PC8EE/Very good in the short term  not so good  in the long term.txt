 The program in the book is easy to understand and if you have the necessary discipline, easy to follow. There are no complictated recipes, no expensive supplements (though it does suggest a meal replacement product that is no longer on the market, you don't need to use it)and a workout that can be done at home with minimal equipment that doesn't take up a lot of time. The combination of low calorie, balanced dieting, intense strength training, lots of water and lots of rest does work very well when it comes to losing weight. The problem with the program is that it is not a realistic one to follow for a lifetime. I don't see how somebody can eat like that for the rest of their lives. When I followed it, all I could think about was how I couldn't wait for it to be over. Then, unfortunately, I went back to my old ways of eating and gained the weight back.  To be successful at losing weight and keeping it off, you need to make a lifestyle change and find a way of eating and exercising that you can follow for the rest of your life. Exactly how to do that is a lot more complicated than following this diet or that workout, and probably requires some personal help from a trained professional, but it's the only way you can succeed over the long haul.
