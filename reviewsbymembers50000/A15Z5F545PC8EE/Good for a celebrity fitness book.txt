 I remember hearing somebody once say that relying on a celebrity for fitness advice is like taking your car to a celebrity with a well-maintained car for repairs. There's probably some truth in that statement, but that doesn't mean that Stallone's fitness advice is worthless. The man has spent the better part of his life working out an attaining a level of fitness that most of us will never know. He obviously knows something about training and eating. The workouts are good, basic ones, but unless you have a very well-equiped home gym, you'll need a health club membership for the workouts. I found it a little odd in the "classic" workout that he recommends working biceps before the back and I would have liked to have heard the reasoning behind that since it's not what most people would recommend. There were some questions that he left unanswered, such as rest between sets, but the workouts are safe and can be adapted to almost any fitness level. There's nothing about anything he recommends that could get you hurt (assuming you have no previous injuries). The workouts also take a reasonable amount of time, typically one hour or less. The nutrition advice is good, giving people a blueprint for a solid lifetime eating plan that doesn't force you to count calories or exclude entire food groups. The best part of the book, however, is Sly's own story of how he went from a down-and-outer to an American icon and the role a fitness lifestyle played in achieving his success. Even if you decide there are better workouts or nutrition plans out there for you, his story is still an interesting one. I wouldn't say I was a huge fan of Stallone. I could take or leave most of his movies, but I developed a greater respect and admiration for what he has done after reading the book.
