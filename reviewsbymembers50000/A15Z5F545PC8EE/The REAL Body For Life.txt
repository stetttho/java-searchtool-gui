 While the title of this book certainly gets your attention, Body for Life would have been an appropriate title had someone else not taken it first. The author does not show people how to transform their bodies in 12 weeks; he wants us to change our behavior, especially eating and exercising and do it for the rest of our lives, not 12 weeks, 12 months or 12 years. He starts us slowly having us build the discipline we need to work out and eat right before we do anything else. The way the workouts progress is almost ridiculously slow, but look at it this way: By the time most people have given up on their more extensive workouts, you're just getting started. By his own admission, Tuley does not tell us anything new or revolutionary. Most of the diet and exercise information he tells us, we already know. And he knows we already know it. But sometimes the best coaches are not the ones who come up with new plays or strategies, but the ones who effectively teach the basics and motivate their charges to get the most out of themselves.  Tuley is that kind of coach.
