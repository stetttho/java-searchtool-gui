 For someone who is overweight and out of shape, this book is a good place to start. The idea of comparing a workout and diet regimen to a business plan is a novel idea, but it's the only gimick in the book. The workout is simple and can be done at home with only a few relatively inexpensive pieces of equipment. The eating plan is also simple and repeatedly hammers across the point that you really do need to count and cut calories to lose weight, there's no way around it. In this age where you're constantly being told that you can eat all you want as long as it's low in fat or low in carbs, it's a dose of much-needed common sense. Karas also stresses the importance of putting things into writing, both what you eat and the excercise you do. Yes it's a pain, but it really helps because the very fact that you are observing a behavior tends to change it. The only thing I wish I could have seen are more specific workout options, both free weights and machines. For those of us who already belong to a gym, I would have liked Karas to talk about how to get the most out of our memberships
