 In The Lean Body Promise, Lee Labrada presents a balanced, easy to understand program for fat loss and fitness. The former Mr. Universe's program attacks excess body fat from all angles, strength training, cardio and a balanced eating plan. The workouts are brief, and when I did them they were as short as 25 minutes and as long as 40 minutes, but they're very intense and require a daily commitment. I can see how working out really hard day after day can become a grind after a while, but if you can stay motivated to give your best effort every day, you should see some good results. Labrada also provides a ramp-up program that true beginners can follow to prepare themselves for the rigors of the full program. The eating plan is easy to understand and requires nothing more than food you can buy in your local grocery store. Yes, Labrada owns a nutritional supplement company and he does recommend his products (mostly the meal replacement products), but they're not absolutely essential unless you plan on entering his company's transformation contest. At no point does he make it sound as if supplements are an essential part of the program. You can do quite well on the plan with real food if you really want to do it. The recipies are easy to make and the ones I've tried are quite good. Labrada also tries to entertain the reader, making little corny jokes throughout the book. It seems like he's trying too hard when he does this but it keeps the book from getting boring.
