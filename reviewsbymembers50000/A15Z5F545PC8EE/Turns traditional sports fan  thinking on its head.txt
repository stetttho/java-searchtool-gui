 Everytime I hear somebody complain about how ballplayers today play for the money while old-timers played for the love of the game, I want to give them this book. The same is true for whenever somebody complains that high  salaries drive up ticket prices. Those are two of the many myths that the  author debunks in this book. The author backs up his arguments with plenty  of historical evidence and presents well-reasoned cases for why many  commonly accepted things about sports just aren't true. I don't agree with  everything in the book and I doubt most sports fans will, but it's still a  good read. The author shows he is very knowlegable and writes with a great  deal of authority about several different sports, which is no easy task.
