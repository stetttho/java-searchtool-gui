 This is one of the few fitness books (especially those dealing with bodyweight training) that really can be used by anyone of any fitness level. Can't do a pushup or a chinup? No big deal, John has a workout that can allow you to build up strength until you can handle your own bodyweight. On the other end of the spectrum, he presents several ways that you can continue to challenge yourself through a lifetime of working out without ever having to go to a gym or buy special equipment. The exercises John teaches have been around for years and since the old Charles Atlas stuff (a big part of these workouts) went out of fashion at least a quarter century ago, many of us have never heard of some of these techniques. While the workouts haven't been mainstream for a generation or so, the nutrition advice is pretty much in line with what most registered dieticians would recommend. It's not a low carb diet, but an approach that will allow you to shed fat and provide enough energy for your workouts. It's a good, entertaining read and the workouts are definitely worth a try.
