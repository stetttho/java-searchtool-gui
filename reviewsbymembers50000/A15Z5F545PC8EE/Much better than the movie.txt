 Seventeen years ago, as a junior going through a rather undistinguished high school wrestling career and frustrating first relationship with a member of the opposite sex, this book really hit home with me. The story  was much more complex than the movie, as were the characters. It was about  more than wrestling, it was about the insecurities, fears and hang-ups of a  young man trying to find his place in the world. It wasn't just about  Loudon's relationships with Carla and Kuch, it was about his whole world.  His family, his friends, his teachers. It's a cliche, but it's true. It  made me laugh and it made me cry. It still does.
