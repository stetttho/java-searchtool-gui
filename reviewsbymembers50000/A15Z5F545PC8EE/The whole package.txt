 While Lose Your Love Handles, one of Shilstone's previous efforts, was a solid work, I wanted to see more specific guidance on how to work the rest of the body and incorporate his core training into a complete program. A few years later, Shilstone delivers.  The program is extremely well-rounded, with a mix of cardio, weights, core training and intervals, plus balanced meal plans. If you're loooking for 5-minute workouts, forget it. You won't have to live in the gym (he also has a home strength training workout you can use), but you will have to invest about an hour a day, six days a week to exercise. This is definitely not a something for nothing plan, but if fat loss and getting in better shape is a priority, you can find a way to do it. The meal plans are good. I didn't see much that appealed to my taste buds, but with a little creativity you could probably come up with some good "Mackie Meals" on your own.
