 While not prescribing any specific diet or workout regimens, this book gives anyone who wants to start a fitness program that includes strength training all the tools they need to develop their own routines. The authors, who come from power lifting and endurance sport backgrounds, recommend an approach that is similar to the one advocated by people like Wayne Westcott, Matt Brzycki,Dan Riley and Ellington Darden, in other words, low volume, high intensity with slow, controled movements. They do discuss other approaches, such as multiple-set training and plyometrics and come down against them, but don't flat-out say "Our way is right; every other way is wrong," instead giving the pros and cons of different techniques. I also like that their nutrition advice is very sensible, advocating good, basic nutrition rather than fad diets or supplements. While the target audience is newcomers to strength training, more experienced trainees can still benefit from it, picking up some new techniques, learning about competitive lifting or just getting a refresher course on the basics. The best thing about the approach they recommend is that it's one that can easily be adapted into your life with your other interests.
