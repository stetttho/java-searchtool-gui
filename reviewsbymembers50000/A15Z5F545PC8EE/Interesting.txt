 I also purchased this book and Slow Burn by Fredrick Hahn and the Eades. They're both pretty solid and each one offers something the other doesn't. It's worth having both titles to get a complete picture of this style of strength training. While Slow Burn does a better job explaining the science behind slow training and the technique of performing each rep, Power of 10 gives you more options for routines (both home and gym). The nutritional approach in Power of 10 seems more balanced to me, more like a Body For Life type plan,which I'm more likely to sustain over the long haul than a low carb diet, which I have my doubts about as far as safety and being able to sustain it over the long haul are concerned.
