 Rev.Dr. Amalraj presents a challenging psychological investigation of Eastern & Western spiritualities which explores the role of mental imagery, mysticism, and contemplative prayer as common ground for the attainment of physical, psychological, and spiritual healing.  Christian, Jewish Kabbalah, Shaman, Hindu, Buddhist, and Sufi spiritual methods are examined and explained; and twenty-four diagrams help to make certain concepts more understandable for the unitiated. While this thought-provoking work does briefly define the respective terminologies and philosophies of each spiritual tradition, it would likely be most appreciated by the mental health professional, philosopher, or cleric who is interested in learning more about holistic healing modalities as utilized in Eastern and Western religions. In this time of international unrest, much related to spiritual ideologies, it is helpful and encouraging to learn more about our common ground. Knowledge leads to understanding; and understanding leads to PEACE. Dr. Amalraj's work might be a way to that all-important end.... PEACE!
