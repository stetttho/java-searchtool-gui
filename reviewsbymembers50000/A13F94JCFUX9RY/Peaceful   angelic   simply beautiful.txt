 Theresa Schroeder-Sheker truly sounds angelic in this beautiful CD.  It evokes such a sense of peace and tranquility.  This is one of my all-time favorite Christmas CD's -- which, I think, would be just as soothing &  comforting any time of year.  And I would echo the 2 previous reviews.  Heavenly! Close your eyes when you listen to this and you'll think you're  being serenaded by an angel!  (\
