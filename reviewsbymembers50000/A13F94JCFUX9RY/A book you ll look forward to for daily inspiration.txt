 Divine Intimacy is the book, next to your Bible and Divine Office/Breviary, you will look forward to reading daily. This series of books is arranged according to the liturgical calendar and its messages  will coincide with each day's Mass readings. Because each day's reading is  at most a few pages in length, it's easy to fit into even the busiest  schedule and gives you plenty of food for thought and inspiration every day  of the year. Reflections are based on Carmelite spirituality and there are  numerous quotes from Saints Teresa of Avila (founder of the Order of  Discalced Carmelites), John of the Cross, Therese of Lisieux ("The  Little Flower"), and others.  This is a wonderful way to start or  end your day. And the relatively small paperback format makes it easy to  carry in a briefcase or suitcase even while traveling ~ because you won't  want to miss a day of these inspiring thoughts for contemplation and  prayer.
