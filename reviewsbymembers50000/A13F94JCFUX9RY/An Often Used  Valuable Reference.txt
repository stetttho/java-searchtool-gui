 I purchased this book several years ago, when I first entered private practice as a hypnotherapist. Nine years later, I still refer to it frequently. As a previous reviewer commented, many of the scripts can be  used verbatim; however, I use them mostly as guides and personalize them to  the client. It's a must-have book for every hypnotherapist's library.
