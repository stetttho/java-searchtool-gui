 I've found HERBAL MEDICINALS to be a frequently-referenced book in my library. The many tables with dosage information, contraindications, potential drug interactions, and herbal recommendations for specific  illnesses are most helpful. A very useable and practical guide for both  allopathic and natural health practitioners.
