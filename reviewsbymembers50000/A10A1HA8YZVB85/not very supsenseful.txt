 This was very much like other series.  Poor girl goes to live with rich family.  The only neat thing was the grandmother was nice to her.  The ghost writer has used the incest theme with Roy and the actual  half-brother.  The mother refuses to acknowledge the kid for fear of losing  everything. The wicked person is the aunt here and her character is not  well developed nor is the half sister.  We can except in the next book the  possibility of Rain turning up pregnant and grandma bailing her out. She  meets her dad in England and another possible pass from both Roy and Brody.  And the aunt and half sister, once the secret is out, (the aunt knows) to  make her life hell. I was disappointed at the predictablity. I have to  wonder how much of this story line is really VC Andrews idea.
