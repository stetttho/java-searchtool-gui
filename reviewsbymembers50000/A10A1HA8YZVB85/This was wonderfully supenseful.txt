 This is my second book I have read By Ms. Coulter.  The first one was "The Edge" (which was very good.)  I look forward to picking up another one of her books very soon.  "False Presences" reminded  me of some books written by Sidney Sheldon.  That is probably what I liked  most about it.   Elizabeth is suddenly placed in a high profile court  case with the dead of her husband and then because very rich after her  aquittal.  She must now make it in the world of business which she knows  nothing about.  Her husband's family is out to get her and ruin her.  The  family is run by the mother-in-law who believes Elizabeth has killed her  son.  There is lying and bethrayal,love and hate all the makings of a  great book.  What I most liked about the books was the friendship that  developed with Elizabeth and her step-daughter,Catherine.  Catherine  started off in the book as a woman scorned and turned out to be a true  friend.   This books had wonderfully developed characters and constantly  kept me changing my mind "who did it."
