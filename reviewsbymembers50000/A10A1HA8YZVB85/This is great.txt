 What a great change of characters.  The romance of a vampire...I could not put the book down.  I read it out of order but it does not matter.  The books stand alone with just a mention and explanation of other vampires.     I found it very interesting to fall in love with a vampire.  This was a  wonderful book if you are interested in a new twist of love.  Who says a  vampire should not search a lifetime for the love of his life.
