 This book gets every emotion in you building as you read.  First the horrible fear of what the parents went through trying to make the best decision for their child.  The shock and anger for a doctor that would not  hear of anything else but the support of his THEORY.  Compassion for a  child trapped in confusion.  The love felt by one doctor that made a  difference to a child with difficult problem.  And admiration for an adult  man who knew that living as a woman was not right and dared to make his  life right.  This was a touching book that was hard to put down.  It really  challenges a reader about what they might do in a similar situation.  It  also shows that not everything is science and cut and dry... there really  is something inborn that makes you one sex or another. I admire David for  being brave enough to share his story and challenge the experts.
