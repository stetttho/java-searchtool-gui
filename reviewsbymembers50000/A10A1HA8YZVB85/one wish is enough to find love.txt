 I picked this book up on a rainy Sunday morning and was so taken away by it.  I had read it all by mid-afternoon.   This is another small town where two kids meet by accident.  Little Charity offers a kiss or a wish.  Young Luke not very excited about a kiss  says he will save his wish for another  time.   15 years later, they meet again. He was a poor soul with a bad  reputation... now grown up, rough, rugged and handsome.  Charity is still  young at heart looking for magic under every rock.   The characters are  very well developed and it is wonderful to read about them falling in love.   The test of faith is will they stay together.  It has all the details of a  western town... cattle ranchers, gunslingers, stubborn father, the saloon,  and a gold shipment robbery.   I felt wonderful when I finished because I  felt so taken with the idea that the WISH was hanging over them.  They did  not need it but it helped secure their happiness. If you like this book  then you will also enjoy her Springwater series.
