 I have been  a big fan of her later works.  This is the first one I have read that is a bit older.  I like her novels that lead into a series.  Wanton Angel leaves you dancing in the aisles.  She never fails to sweep a  reader away with the heart felt search for love.   I found myself a  wanting to help the young woman find a better job though.  Ms. Miller's  more recent novels the springwater series are quick reads and very  enjoyable.
