 This is an outstanding children's book from my childhood.  I can remember it being read on Captain Kangaroo.  It has great illistrations and add to the story's delight.   Milton is a great dane (dog) who has wandered away  and no one can find him.  His owner has looked high and low.  It is a sweet  story about family and losing something very special.  And most of all it  is a story of new life and love.  If I tell anymore I will spoil the story.   (don't worry Milton is found and is just fine.)   It is a hard to find  book but well worth the search.  I enjoyed sharing something from my  childhood with my own child.
