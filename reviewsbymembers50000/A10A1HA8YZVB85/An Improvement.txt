 I have just started reading Bertrice Small recently and started with the Skye O'Malley series.  I have enjoyed this family series.  I get hooked on all the family and eagerly await each new book to see what this active,  adventurous family is doing.  There is not a huge amount of references to  Skye's many other kids and their activities in this book.  But it is still  well done.  You could very easily pick up this book and read it without  having read the rest of this series (however I recommend that you do so.)  The history details are always very well done and interesting.  Ms. Small  has taken her readers to Ireland and the New World this time.  The O'Malley  clan will soon be worldwide.  Fortune is every bit like the free spirited  women in her family and wants to find that passionate, true love.   Her  mother and father have gotten their backbone back in this book.  It was  refreshing to see Jasmine to take a stand again.  The only thing that I did  not like was the Kidnapping scene.  It seemed incomplete or maybe a last  minute thought (not very well developed.)  The book could stand alone  without that scene.  I look forward to seeing a mention of Fortune and more  family moving to the New World as the colonies expand.
