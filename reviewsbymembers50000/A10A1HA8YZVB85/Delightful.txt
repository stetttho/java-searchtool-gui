 I read this in a day.  I could not put it down.  I enjoyed everything about this book i.e. the mind reading, suspense, love and mystery. I kept changing my mind about who was the killer.  I think I picked the actual  person twice but kept changing my mind.  It was wonderful to read while I  am anticipating the continuation of the Jewel of the Sun series.
