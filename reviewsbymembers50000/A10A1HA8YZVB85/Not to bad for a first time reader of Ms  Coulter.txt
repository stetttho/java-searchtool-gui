 This is the first time I have read anything of this author.  I found it pretty good.  From reading other reviews I have found that it is part of a series which I am interested in reading.   It has all the makings of a  great book: deceiption, bretrayal, family,ESP, murder, suicide, drugs,  government agents.  The characters were interesting and I really liked  Sherlock and Savich even though they were secondary characters.  I felt  like they were most believable.  I want to read "The Target"  which I understand is a story that "stars" them.  I think what  turned me off about it was toward the end where Mac, Sherlock, Laura, and  Savich were kidnapped. As they fight their way through the rain forest they  end up on a resort beach.  It was a little too weird. That is where I lost  a little respect of the author.   It is action packed though everyone is  constantly on the run trying to solve the mystery at hand which turns out  to be more than just the disappearance of Mac's sister.    If i did it  all over again this might not have been the first book I read of hers.  I  have since read "False Pretenses" which I was very inpressed  with.
