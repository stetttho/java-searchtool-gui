 I loved every detail and felt like I was part of this town.  I liked the faery tale effected she used.  It is like telling a loving tale within another story.  I could not wait until the characters found their TRUE love  with the a little help from a faery king.  I can hardly wait for the rest  of the series. Nora Roberts never fails to keep me entertained.  I would  have no problem reading it again before the next book comes out.
