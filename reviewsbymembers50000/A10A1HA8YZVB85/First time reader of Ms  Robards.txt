 This is my first book by this author.  I felt that it was fairly easy reading.  I thought it was going to be a little scarier than it really was.   Her two main characters (Olivia and Seth)and their relationships were  very well developed.  I liked the idea of them all becoming a family again.   I liked the lesson Seth taught his daughter Chloe about how everyone is  different and it is not nice to tease others.   Her development of the  secondary characters was not as well done. In the first 30 pages or so you  are introduced to an entire family ( a entire step-family that the main  character has no real relation to) by name and then they dont appear to be  mentioned again until later.  I struggled to remember what the relation  was.  The poor grandfather remains in a semi-coma state the entire book. I  thought that it was annoying that he was mentioned constantly but never had  a real converstaion with anyone even at the end after they found out he  would recover.
