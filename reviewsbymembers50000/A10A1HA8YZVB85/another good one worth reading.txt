 I will admit at first when I started reading I was worried because it appeared that it was a little choppy.  What I mean is there were very short chapters introducing different characters in a day to day diary format.  When I first started I thought there was not enough development in the eary  stages.  Then I realized she was going to continue writing about a  particular day and make a new chapter for each character and expanding on  them.    Nell's huband Adam is involved in a boating accident that costs  him his life as will as several others.  Each person has a motive for  getting rid of the other.  The regret of him dying so suddenly is that she  had a fight with him about her running for Congress.  Adam's stated concern  is that Nell is at the beckon call of her grandfather a former Congressman.   But is there more to that concern?  That is where the mystery begans.    I really enjoyed this book, I am however a faithful reader of Mary  Higgins Clark so I am always tempted no matter what anyone writes about her  books to go ahead and read it. I have never been disappointed.. most times  I think it was well worth my time to read it.
