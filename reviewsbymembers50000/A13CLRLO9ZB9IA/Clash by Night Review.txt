 A brief synopsis: Amy Carlisle is a barren woman who finds a little piece of joy in running a daycare. Since she is unable to bare children, the children she tends to become her surrogate children. A extreme right-wing groups decides to send a message to the government, and Amy finds herself along with her children the plot of an extremist attack. In seeking revenge on the ones who hurt her and her children, she finds that she may just be turning into a monster herself. Wow, I really enjoyed this story. It was nice to see the story of the Crow with a female hero. I also like the premise of a motherly love that brings back the character rather than the love for a spouse or a lover. I think this is currently my favorite in the line of Crow books. Williamson describes scenes with a jarring vividness. I was even touched to tears in a couple of the scenes.  He did an excellent job at showing how a mother's love and anguish. You could literally shape Amy's feelings-her rage, her love, her suffering-with you hands. Amy's a character that mothers and young women can relate to. She's a nurturer, but she also holds a gritty edge that makes her "cool". He also did a good job in combing the element of hate and politics into his story, giving it a gritty fill. I found it hard to stomach all the hate that flowed from the antagonist. My only complaint is that ending seemed a little rushed, but the twist of events at the end really made up for the seeming rushed finished.
