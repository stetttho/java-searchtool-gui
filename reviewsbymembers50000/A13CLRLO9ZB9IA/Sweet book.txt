 I read this book because I liked the movie A Walk to Remember. Actually, A Walk to Remember was really the book I wanted, but after I couldn't find it in the bookstores, I settled for the rescue. It wasn't a bad book, and it wasn't a book that I would say that I'm going to cherish forever.  The story was interesting enough to keep me interested. It centered around a single mother who's son has a hard time learning and comprehending language, and a contractor/firefighter who's father died tragically making way for the "I'll-never-love-a-woman" promise. The characters were horribly cliched. He stuck the two lead characters in traditional male-female roles that. It even got a little corny in places, but the story was interesting enough to keep me reading. The author did a very good job at portraying a mother's love and determination to help her son. It was a sweet story that tugged at the heartstrings, but don't expect to find anything deep and profound here.
