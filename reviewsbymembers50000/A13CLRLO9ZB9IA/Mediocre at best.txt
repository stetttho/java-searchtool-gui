 A brief synopsis: Sass goes to Paris for work (and also to get a little vacation time in). She never expected to run into her ex in the most romantic city in the world; even worse, she never expected herself to fall for him all over again. But is her heart ready to accept that he's a changed man, or will he break her heart again.  Honestly, I didn't enjoy this book as much as I hoped I would. The reason for this was because I couldn't connect to the characters. Most my time was spent thinking, "Who talks like this when telling their girlfriend about an ex?" I also thought the plot was a little contrite, but it was consistent, and that's the important thing. I liked the premise for the story. The characters had potential to make me love them, the love scenes were very sensual, and (like I said) the plot was consistent. However, there seems to be this formal tone that left me feeling "cold". This was my first book by this author, but I won't let the cold formality of it sway me from reading more of her work.
