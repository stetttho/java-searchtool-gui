 This is the 2nd part in "The Diaries of the Family Dracul" trilogy, which is written in the same format as Bram Stoker's Dracula. This story takes place 25 years after the first novel. Arkady is still trying to find a way to destroy his uncle, Vlad, and release his family from an age-old covenant/curse. I thought this book was great, better than the first. While I found myself wishing something interesting would hurry and happen in the first book, I didn't have that problem with this book. The action was fast-paced and tinged with a dark urgency, and I couldn't put it down because I was so anxious to see what happened next. My only real gripe with this book was the "twist" it takes in the end. I thought that was somewhat contrived. It seemed to come right out of left field as if the author was really only putting it for a shock value -- especially considering that vampires supposedly taste the "truth" in the blood. However, it didn't hinder the story, and it definitely does give you a bit of a shock. Anyhow, I thought the book was better than a 4-star rating, but not quite a five. Definitely another good addition to any vampire lover's collection.
