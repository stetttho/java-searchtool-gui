 I've never read a book by either of these writers, so I figured why not get the best of both worlds by reading collaboration novel between the two. I've heard that both women are extremely talented, and I guess I should've thought that decision through. I just didn't particularly like the heroine, Jamie Swift. She seemed very childish in a sense. Useless cursing and annoying wit seem to be her weapon of choice. She's headstrong to the point of stupidness. The main hero, Max Holt, wasn't too much better in my opinion. He was far too perfect. His only weakness seemed to be women, which he didn't seem to have a problem getting. Apparently, this guy knows everything from astro-physics to whatever else their is to know. Oh, and let's not forget, he's a black belt in Karate and has a talking car he had specially designed.  The only saving grace for this book was the humorous story (assassins, and poachers, and wrestlers, oh my!) and the other more colorful characters, which accounts for the three star rating. This book is good for light-hearted humor with a tinge of action.
