 This is one of my favorite books. I've probably read like a thousand times seriously. This a coming of age story (is there a trend in my reading?) of an African-American girl, Tracy Ellison. Tracy is one of those girls who used what she has to get what she wants. She knows how to manipulate situations to her advantage. Along the way, though, Tracy learns some very valuable lessons about life. This was such a cute book. There are many serious themes, but a lot of the things Tracey went through I can remember going through with my own friends. In fact, Tracy reminds me of one of my best friends, Nikki. This books revolves a lot around young sexuality and the love of material things. Tracy grows up feeling jealous and sorry for her friend Raheema who has no interest in boys and wants to make something of her life. Tracey however does mature and learn that there are more things to live than material things.  Tyree did an excellent job of making me love and hate Tracy. His prose was realistic, and a lot of the vernacular he used was true. Excellent story.
