 I just recently bought and beat this game, and I've been asking myself, "What the hell took me so long to get this game?" My boyfriend (I'm a girl gamer) rented Max Payne when it first came out for Playstation. I watched him play it for a while, didn't understand the addiction, and didn't think anymore about it. Recently, I purchased an Xbox, and Max Payne was one of the first games I bought. From the opening scene, I was caught. Max Payne is a must for gamers who enjoy noirish style action/rpg games as opposed to fantasy-style games. It has that gritty feel to it that can actually put you in a somewhat somber mood. The storyline isn't the deepest of storylines, but it has a nice solid feel to it. He's a man on a mission; you won't forget that. You'll get an array of weapons ranging from a lead pipe to --my personal favorite-- a sniper rifle. You interact with a colorful cast of villians, but the gunplay does get repetitive. Here are a few reasons you might not enjoy Max Payne: - I'm a blood and gore type gamer, and while there is blood in this game, it isn't as realistic as it could be in my opinion.  - Some of the voice acting is downright awful. - The game isn't all that challenging even on hard. (New York Minute is a different story.) Overall, I enjoyed playing Max Payne. It filled the need to shoor stuff. If you're having a bad day, nothing's better than playing Max Payne and taking out your frustrations. :)
