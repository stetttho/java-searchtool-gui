 Young adult horror. Shari Cooper dies one night while at a party. She doesn't realize she's dead until the next day when her family acts like she isn't even there. Her death is ruled as suicide, but she knows she was murdered, and she sets out with the help of another ghost, Peter, to solve her murder. Considering other young adult horror writers who were writing around the same time, this was a good novel despite some corny elements. Yes, it was very cliched. Yes, it was cheesy at points. But it was complex, was original, and definitely a page turner. Pike was also very good at displaying emotion.  You don't feel cold toward the characters. You may even find yourself remembering feeling these same feelings for people in your life. Definitely something that I reread (once again) in the future.
