 I figured I'd better go ahead and write my review of this book since I'm about to pick up the sequel to it. I loved this book. This is the book that started it all. Since Bridget Jones's Diary swept the globe, many writers have tried to "borrow" the premise, but nothing compares to the book that started it all.  I read the UK edition, so I was thrown off a little by the weight thing (which is in stones in the UK edition), but I got that all cleared out. Bridget Jones is a 30-something, single woman who's hoping to make a change in her life. She wants to smoke less, lose weight, and find the man of her dreams. She chronicles these hopes in her journal, and the result is hilarious.  This book is just a bit of light reading, and anyone woman, regardless of age or nationality, can relate to many of Bridget's age. Bridget is funny, smart, and cheeky.  She has a complicated relationship with her mother, and she has a complicated relationship with men. She gives her friends advice that she doesn't take herself, regrets not saying what's really on her mind, and cooks horribly. She's easy to relate to, and she's real. I will admit that there was a part near the ending, the scene where her mother got in trouble, that seemed a little farfetched, but it can be a overlooked. There isn't much more to say about this book except it's fast paced and amusing. And now, I can't wait to get started on the second book.
