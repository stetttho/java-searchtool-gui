 Usually, I avoid books of this nature. Not because I don't care, but because it's usually the same whining drivel I can read in any "political" book. However, Michael Moore surely knows how to get an opinion across, and he knows how to do it with humor and satirical wit that makes people take notice. And that's what made me read this book. Honestly, I couldn't put this down. I finished reading this book in the span of one day, and I was shocked, appalled, offended, and wanting to do something about the state of things. In "Stupid White Men", Moore has combined his biting wit with statistics and sources. You find a collection of essays written about everything from the 2000 election to Mother Nature's systematic plan to obliterate the gender that's seen as a threat - men. Moore questions race relations, environmental causes, school systems, Democrats (Bill Clinton was the best "Republican" president we ever had, you know), the prison systems... whatever bothers him. He presents statistics and sources while retaining that biting sense of humor. Yes, he is trying to entertain, but his main goal is to educate. I found myself silently agree with most of the things that he said in his book. I was outraged at some of the facts he presented (such as the activities that many of our nation's cabinet members are partaking or the need to drill for oil in some of our nation's national parks). Moore is very passionate about his beliefs. You can literally see the sarcasm or urgency dripping from some of his words.  This book isn't for everyone. Some people may feel that some of his ideas are farfetched, and some may not appreciate his humor. He'll make you laugh, and he'll make you angry, but above all, he'll make you think. That's one good reason to at least read this book. He will give you something to ponder on - even if you don't agree with him. mortal_belleza
