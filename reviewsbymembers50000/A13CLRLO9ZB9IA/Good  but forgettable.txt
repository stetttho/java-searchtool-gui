 Young Adult reading. I watched this movie at the end of August. I didn't realize that it was based on a book until Banned Books Week rolled around and I saw it on the list. So, I went out searching for this book.  Basically, a group of teens plot to play a prank on their tight-ass English teacher. They didn't expect him to end up dead. I'm sure we all imagined wanting to get rid of a teacher that we didn't (or don't) like. These kids did. Though, his death wasn't part of the plan (at least not to most of them). This is typical YA reading pre-the teenage angst revolution. There isn't much character development and many of the characters fall into cliched roles such as the popular cheerleader and the mousy A student and the straight-edge class president.  However, this really is an intriguing story for the simple fact that we do want know what will happen when they kidnap their teacher and then once the worse case scenario has happened, we watch as they fall into a spiral lies and deception. I'm glad that I watched the movie first or else, I would have totally hated it. If I watch a movie before I read a book, I don't feel as disappointed in it as when I read a book and then watch a movie. Anyhow, this book differs in many ways from its movie counterpart.  Good, but like most young adult books of that era totally forgettable
