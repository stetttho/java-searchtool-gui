 Mia Thermopolis is a ninth grader living in Greenwich village. She thinks that her life is pretty normal -- despite the fact that her mom is famous and her dad is rich. She still struggles with school, hangs out with her friends, lusts after boys.  Then she finds out that her dad is really a prince who's unable to have anymore children, making her a princess and the sole heir to the throne. Most girls would be thrilled to hear that news, but Mia isn't happy about it at all. She figures life is already hard enough without adding princess duties to the mix. I saw the movie first and thought I would give the book a try. It wasn't a bad book. It was cute, funny, and lighthearted. This is the kind of book that takes your mind away from your troubles. Despite the fantastical element of Mia being a princess, Cabot manages to catch teenage life pretty well. She even knows what "cool" words to use and how to use them.  You find yourself rolling your eyes, laughing, and snorting at things that happen in the book, and that's the fun part of it. You react to the situations presented. All-in-all, this was a cute book. There were some things that irked me, but, overall, I enjoyed it.
