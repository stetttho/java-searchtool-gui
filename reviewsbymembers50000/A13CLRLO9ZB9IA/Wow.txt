 I purchased an Xbox solely for this game. At first, I thought Shenmue (on DC) was a pointless until I actually took the time to sit down and play the game. I found that it's highly addictive, and while it was very tedious, I actually enjoyed the  fact that it wasn't just about fighting. I was anxious for the sequel to come out, but after reading the rather lukewarm review of the game in Xbox mag, I wasn't sure what to expect.  Once I got my hands on a copy, Shenmue II proved to be a praiseworthy sequel. There are still some of those tedious tasks that people don't like, but there's also more for you to do. Working is now an option rather than a necessity. (Thank Goodness!) The gameplay is definitely longer than the first Shenmue, providing you with three new cities to explore and a whole new cast of characters to interact with. The people on Shenmue II aren't as clueless as the people in the last one (if you know what I mean). There's more fighting. You can even make your money solely through fighting (or gambling). Personally, I think the graphics in the game are beautiful and definitely makes for an even more enjoyable experience. All in all, I think this game is the perfect combination of fighting and investigative work. The storyline is enthralling. I give it 5 stars!
