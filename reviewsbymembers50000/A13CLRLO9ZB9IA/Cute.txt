 This is the continuation of Bridget Jones's Diary. It starts four weeks after the end of its predecessor. Bridget is still the same calorie counting, self-help book guru that she was in the last book, now she is in a thriving relationship with an adult male. But of course, things can't be that easy. Once again, Bridget tries to figure out her relationship with the man she loves, her parents, her peers, and co-workers.  Honestly, I thought Bridget lost some of her bravado. That doesn't mean the book wasn't good, but I always saw Bridget being a little "stronger", if you will, that she appeared in this book. Fielding also had a field day making fun of self-help dating book (cheeky satire at best). Bridget and her friends were more obsessed than ever with them, and it did get a little annoying at times. Although I like Bridget, I had to agree with a statement that was made in the book about wanting a person who knew their own mind instead of relying on what self-help books tell them they should do. And I didn't think this book was nearly as amusing as the last. I wouldn't say these books are laugh out loud funny, but they do make me smile a majority of the time. Can't wait until the next one comes out. I'm still interested in seeing how things end for Bridget.
