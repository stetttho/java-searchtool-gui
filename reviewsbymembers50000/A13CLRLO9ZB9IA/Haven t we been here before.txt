 I know this book has gotten rave reviews, but I fail to see where it differs from other material on the same subject aside from, "BUY MY FITNESS PRODUCT TO HELP YOU!" Yes, this book is motivational and encouraging, but being an avid reader of fitness books I didn't see much that I didn't already know (such as the myths about women and weights) or hadn't read for free (the myths about aerobics) on the internet with the same informative detail and wisdom. And I just don't agree with the whole "many of us need supplements to lose weight." That doesn't settle right with me and can be seen as discouraging by someone who doesn't have the money to spend on "supplements."  But the book isn't all bad, as I've said. The writer is inspirational, and I do like the fitness portion of the book. I agree with his portions over calorie theory. His diet doesn't work so much for me, but it's great for others. I'd recommend this book for people who don't read as many fitness related things as I do and want to get into shape. For those who do feed on fitness books like me, there are much better books out there.
