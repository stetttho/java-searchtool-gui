 A brief synopsis: Rose Larabee is a single mother, who's husband has died not too long ago. She's also still recovering from a heart transplant and is working part-time in a small bookshop. She receives a valentine in the mail, and although this shouldn't seem weird, it isn't addressed, and this bothers Rose. Little things start to happen and while Rose is suspicious, she thinks that she's just overreacting. Over the next couple of weeks, Rose finds herself the object of someone's mad obsession. I went into this book expecting the typical "whodunit" mystery, but I came out of this pleasantly surprised. It wasn't a fast-paced thriller (in my opinion). The pace was a sort of saunter, dropping clues here and there while keeping the reader interested. The characters were lovable. I found myself really caring for Rose -- even relating to her in some aspect. Once the story was over, I found myself surprised (as I  mentioned before). The "villain" was the last person I suspected.  The only thing that irked me about the book was the tense it was written in. I'm not use to reading a story that uses present tense (as opposed to the usual past-present tense that most writers used). I found it hard to get into this story at first, and it distanced me away from the story in certain places. That's only a minor grievance, though. As you continue through the book, it becomes less and less of a problem. I'll have to look into more of Ms. Straub's work.
