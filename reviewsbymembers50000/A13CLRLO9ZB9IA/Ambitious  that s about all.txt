 The story of Vittorio's turning in 15th century (Renaissance) Italy. Vittorio di Riniari's family is killed by a group of ruthless vampires, but he is "spared" by the beautiful Ursula, which as with all Anne Rice books pretty much sparks a love-hate relationship between Vittorio and Ursula. Of course, this all leads to Vittorio being hellbent on getting revenge as well. I admire Anne Rice wanting to write a different story that has nothing to do with Lestat and the gang, but this was just horrible. It seemed promising from the opening, but then fizzled and died into verbose trash that seemed to lose its focus as well as it's entertainment value. It's obvious that she was trying something new (as her writing was a lot wordier than usual), but she failed to impress me with this novel. There are other redeeming qualities for the novel, such as her accurate description of the time period, but other than this, this is a book that can be skipped and dismissed in my opinion. Ambitious, but that's about all it is.
