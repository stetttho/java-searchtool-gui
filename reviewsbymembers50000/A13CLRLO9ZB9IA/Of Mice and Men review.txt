 Of Mice and Men is the story of two men - George and Lennie. George is small and smart, and George is big and mentally challenged. George and Lennie are about to start working on a new farm; they had to leave a previous farm because Lennie got in "some trouble". Lennie has a preoccupation with things soft and pretty, which lands him in pretty big trouble.  This book didn't immediately draw me in from the beginning. I thought the beginning was rather monotonous, but the pace quickly picks up when George and Lennie arrive on the farm. I found that this book is a beautiful portrayal of human compassion. George says that his life would be much better without Lennie, and perhaps it would be, but still you can tell that he cares very much for the gentle giant. George isn't the only example of "human compassion". You have Carlson who's probably on the extreme uncaring end. He's one of those people who feels that a life isn't valuable anymore once you're of no use. There's also Slim who's very kindhearted. He believes that you can tell if a person is good or not just from their manner of acting. Then, there's Crooks-the cynical stable hand-who likes to believe in the worse of men rather than the best.  Also, Steinbeck did a very good job getting his point across using mostly dialogue. There is precious little description in this book, but that's okay because most of the emotion of the story is conveyed through dialogue.
