 1928. It was a good summer. Too bad it wasn't a good read. I'm surprised I even made it through this book at all. This book follows 12-year-old Douglas Spaulding during the summer of 1928. Yes, Ray wrote it, but there's no book burning or aliens in this book. It basically focuses on Doug's self-discovery. I love Ray Bradbury's stories, but this just killed me. I'm originally from a small town, so I know how Doug felt when the summer rolled around. Running through the grass barefoot, picking grapes, tasting the first ripened blackberries of the season, I experienced it all as a child, and while that brought back many fond memories, the story itself did not have the ability to capture my attention fully. Ray Bradbury has a beautiful poetic way with his writing, but most of the time, it seemed like he was using his vast knowledge of dictionary words to fill pages rather than relate a story to the readers. There doesn't seem to be much of a plot. It's just a series of events put together with some pretty words. I found that huge chunks of this book was largely uninteresting and tedious to get through. I know many people will disagree with this. Many people enjoyed this book, and that's cool. But for me, this book was just a killjoy. This was more like a chore than an enjoyable reading experience. This book made me remember a lot of good times back home. I even called an old childhood friend after reading this book, but I honestly don't see myself picking this up again. It was a nice book to make me relive my own summer memories, but that's about it. Perhaps, this is one of those books that I have to read more than once to fully appreciate. At least I found some great new adjectives to use.
