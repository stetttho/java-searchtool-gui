 When I first received the Gamecube for Christmas, my first question was, "What's this purple cubed thing?" Of course, I had heard about the GC, but I hadn't planned on purchasing it until I really had the chance to look into more infor about it. I'm a big fan of Nintendo systems, and I've been buying them for years, but I wasn't sure what the GC had to offer me.  This is a gamer's console. Yes, it looks a little comical in nature (a purple cube... that's cute), and the games being advertised with the system might have seemed a little childish  (Luigi's Mansion?). Don't let that fool you though. This console is for people looking to game. It doesn't play your favorite DVDs or your music. Instead, Nintendo offers you crisp graphics and enjoyable gameplay.  I think Nintendo is sticking to it's roots and keeping a firm control of games and characters that have made their consoles popular over the years, BUT more and more games are being made for this system (Silent Hill, anyone?). This console has such titles as Metroid, Silent Hill, and Resident Evil available for play, and these are not what one would consider "childish" games.  Also, this system is geared to suit everyone's gaming needs from children to teens to adults. That's a plus in my book. Playstation and Xbox (both of which I own as well) seems to have the older gamer in mind (The average gamer is 28 after all) and tends to forget that children do play these systems. I don't think Nintendo has forgotten that. That's one reason it will remain a favorite with me. If you're looking for just a valuable gaming experience, this is definitely a good way to start.
