 This is definitely an improvement for those of us with small hands (and maybe even those with not so small hands). The original controller was definitely a pain, but I made do until this controller came out. To me, this size and design allows me to better control a character in some games. This compact design also makes it easier for me to press buttons quicker if needs be (think QTE in Shenmue II) instead of reaching a mile away to reach a button. I don't even use my original controllers anymore, but it's nice to have them for back up or as an option for friends. The 4 star rating comes from these minor gripes with my controllers: The rumble on my controllers sounds like a mini-earthquake and rumbles twice as hard in my hands as the orignal did. This can sometimes be distracting, and it might just be my controllers. The analog sticks are sensitive and the buttons don't seem to be sensitive enough. Overall though, I think this is definitely an improvement.
