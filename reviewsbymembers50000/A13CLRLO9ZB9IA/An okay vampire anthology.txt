 Firstly, the book wasn't bad, but it wasn't exceptional either. Its claim of being "erotic" are a little premature. Sure, some of the stories are sexy, but not too many are erotic, and some are just borderline crude (as in bad sex crude, not stimulating crude). I even had to skip over one story (but I came back to it eventually) because it was just that bad.  There are some exceptional stories in the book such as Gaiman's short story and Brian Hodge's novella The Dripping of Sundered Wineskin, but most of the stories are only mediocre, and while they're not completely horrible, they're nothing to call home about. If you collect vampire stories as I do, then this isn't a bad addition to the collection, but if you're looking for good vampire erotica, I suggest looking elsewhere.
