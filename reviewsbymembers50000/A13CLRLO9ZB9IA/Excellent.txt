 I thought I would go ahead and write a review of this since this is one of those books that you don't necessarily read from front cover to back cover. You're more likely to skip around in a book like this. That's what I've been doing, skipping around, reading what interests me most. I am a long time fan of anything vampire-related. I read my first vampire book at age 11, and I haven't looked back since. Since then, I have encountered many legends, myths, and beliefs about vampire. This book puts many, if not all, those beliefs in one source. You learn about vampires from different regions of the world from A-to-Z. Vampires aren't the only preternatural presented in this book. You also learn about d'loup garou (werewolf), demons, dhampirs, protective stones, etc.  My only gripe with the book is this. The sections dealing with how vampires are made was a little sparse in my opinion. I did like how he used the lore that different countries believe regarding the making of a vampire, but he only mention in a passing paragraph how a vampire is made due to a bite because there seems to be a lot of different beliefs on how that works as well. All in all, though, this is an excellent book. Very informative and definitely entertaining.
