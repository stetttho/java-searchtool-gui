 This book revolves around 26-year-old Patrick Bateman, a successful Manhattan yuppie. He seems normal enough in the beginning of the story, but soon the readers come to realize that Bateman is more than just a little psycho. I liked the movie way better than I liked this book, but the book was... addictive. This book was just awful. I think I've said that 1,000 times now. This book was so awful I had to keep reading it. It was mesmerizing. It was like looking at a car crash. It's horrible, but you can't stop looking.  The obsessive name-dropping and label-whoring annoyed me to no end and the intricate detail of shallow habits was enough to kill me. But I had to know what was going to happen. Add a very anticlimatic ending and feeling of "What's the point?" after it's all over with. I confess that I also skimmed over some of the gorier scenes because it all become redundant and not very shocking after a while. Honestly, I can't think of anything or anyone I actually liked in this book. Reading about pretentious rich people usually doesn't render very many likable moments.  There was one scene that made me die in fits of laughter, and now, I can't remember what it was. Damn, it was the one scene that made me smile. Anyway, this is one of those books that you get something out of with each read. I plan on rereading it in the (distant) future. I feel like I've probably missed small details, and perhaps, I'll enjoy this more in the future.
