 First, let me start this review off by saying that I am not a Final Fantasy fan at all. The only one I could actually get through without being bored to death is FFVII. When this game came out and I read about the wonderful blend of Disney and Squaresoft, I knew I had to play it. That's an interesting combo. The games was refreshingly fun and original. You fight as Sora with two Disney characters (Goofy and Donald) at your side, and I was even happier when I saw my two favorite FFVII characters Cloud and Sephiroth.  Basically, this starts as a hack-and-slash game. You hack and slash the enemy and they die. As you move on, strategy does become an essential part of your journey. It's all in real time combat instead of turn based which made it rank even higher in my book. The levels are colorful, but I felt there just wasn't enough of them. There are even optional bosses who are insanely hard -- namely The Phantom and Sephiroth. There are additional sidequests, so it isn't all just straight-laned to the end. You're able to substitute Goofy and Donald for different characters depending on what world you're in. That means when you're in Neverland you can take Goofy (or Donald) out of the game and put Peter Pan in. There are many FF and Disney characters present in the game. This game is cute, addictive, and plenty of fun. My only gripe is there wasn't enough stages, and even with sidequests, you finish the game relatively quickly (or at least I did). Definitely 5 stars.
