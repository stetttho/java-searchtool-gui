 This is a book of short stories written by Ian McEwan. In a sentence, this book wasn't very good. McEwan's style is engaging, but these stories are not very well-executed in my opinion.  I think McEwan was trying to be original and shocking, and while there are many "original" ideas presented, the stories themselves are lacking and leave you with a feeling of cluelessness.  As far as shocking goes, this isn't shocking. In fact, some of the ideas seem a little contrived, but I guess everyone starts from somewhere.
