 Understand, I don't play Wraith. I read it for the background, which I find extremely interesting. So I can't help you on the subject of rules, game balance, whatever. But I can tell you something of the quality of this book. Perhaps the most suprising thing, right off the bat, is that this is a soft cover. Generally, one does not expect deeply disturbing images to leap from the pages of an oversized floppy book. Consistantly, White Wolf has challenged that assumption, and this is probably the best example everywhere. When you open it, you will find a two-page black and white image. This image is one of the most haunting pictures I have ever seen. Countless thousands of men, women, and children stand on the shores of a river. Garbed in prisoner stripes, heads shaven, they wait, some standing in edge of the water, some with their arms raised in supplication. There are so very many of them. There is a single small boat, with a single ferryman, ferrying them one by one into the afterlife. The magnitude, the idea that death is never wholesale, that it is always, always a personal matter, is message enough to be worth the purchase price. This book is never trivial. It is never "fun". It draws immensely from history, and makes it very clear what is fiction, and what is drawn from a history far darker than that found in any fiction. The background is superb, the infomation interesting and vivid. Places described are disturbing and realistic. Characters make sense, plots seem feasable. For many who read this, this will likely be a first look into the subjects described. It is much more intense than they may be used to. It is recommended for "Mature Audiences", and while I think teenagers should read this exact sort of thing, I think care should be taken that they be aware of the seriousness of such a subject. This is the sort of book that will remain on my shelf,long after the game system fades into obscurity. Castle Wolfenstein, this is not. Indra
