 Ok, so you, like every other person in the world, have played one of the earlier Sim games, and now you are wondering if you should shell out the cash for this one. Well, here's some info. On the plus side, the graphics are great. Zoomability from far far overhead (aircraft height) all the way to where you can see individual cars. Different kinds of vehicles (police cars or fire trucks during an emergency, different kinds of airplanes), multitudes of different buildings, lots of nice little graphical things on the buildings all add to the experience. Ability to make streets that run on the diagnals, not just NSEW, is very very nice. The music is every bit as catchy as always. On the down side: There are only a couple disasters. No monsters. You'll get really tired of seeing the same fire, tornado, earthquake, UFO, whirlpool disasters. Majorly boring in that respect. Very liniar. Play twice on a similar map, the game will feel pretty much exactly the same. Too hard, for a lot of people. Too boring to learn, for some. Despite the many many buildings that _can_ show up, you will very very often wind up with tons of identical buildings. Wheee, talk about boring. And it gets slow if your computer isn't a monster. I have a decent system, and I can see the lag. Who wants to turn off the music, or turn down the graphics, though? Without those, the game would suck. If you loved the earlier ones, and you have a powerful system, and are really into obsessive nit-picking detail, buy this. If you aren't one of those people, maybe you should buy someones used copy. Personally, I play it sometimes, but it could have been better.
