 I'm a big fan of the "dummies" line of books. Generally, they offer both an extremly rapid and comprehensive introduction to a subject and a handy reference that you can use to look up things as you become more experienced. This one seems to be the exception, at least for the experienced user. You should buy this book if you have never sold anything on ebay, but are fairly internet savvy, and are looking to try auctioning something(s) off. For you there is a brief look at many many concepts that you will have to understand before you can sell something successfully. You'll find hints, pitfalls, and a step-by-step explanation not only of the process of selling, but also of the rest of the sale: taking pictures of your product, describing it, pricing it, shipping it, and how to ensure you have a happy customer. You should not buy this book if you have successfully sold something on ebay. Better than 80% of the book you will already know, the rest you can learn standing in the aisle of the local bookstore, skimming. I'm a little suprised, since the "dummies" books almost always seem to have a lot to offer, even when you understand a subject fairly well. I guess this was just a painful exception.
