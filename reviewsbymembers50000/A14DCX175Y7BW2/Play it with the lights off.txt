 Clive Barker is the master of horror. This game brings his works to the computer, and does so in a way that does his name justice. If you play this game alone, in the dark, no lights on, you will be scared.  It is set in an incredibly detailed, beautiful, magnificent mansion in Ireland, and the landscape, architecture, theme, feel, are all stunning. They put so much effort into this game, it comes with a softcover, high-graphics book/diary, complete with bloodstains. Nice touch. The plot line is articulate and interesting, if a bit linear. The monsters aren't smart, but they have a habit of sneaking up and scaring the life out of you. They also have a habit of moving with deceptive speed. You see them, think you have a bit of time before they get to you, and wind up with a lot less time then you thought. Time after time I've gotten swarmed. Keeps you on the edge of your seat. The story is set a little after World War I, and has a great "old time" feel to it.  To the best of my knowledge, this is the first game that considered either a) using both hands to carry weapons and such and b) how many rounds you have chambered at a time. Fire a couple rounds, you have to decide whether the 2 bullets left in your gun will stop the next opponent, or whether you need to reload your gun. Stop to reload, you might be at the mercy of something nasty. Attack with a gun that isn't loaded up, you might not stop it. Makes a player think. Possibly a bit too graphic for the young or faint of heart. Lots of carnage, lots of creepy art. The harder levels are exactly the same as the easier levels, with less health and ammo. So play on the hardest level. Why spoil it for yourself? You'll like this one.  Indra
