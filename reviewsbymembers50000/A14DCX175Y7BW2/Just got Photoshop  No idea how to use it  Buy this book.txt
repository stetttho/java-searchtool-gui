 Photoshop is an incredibly powerful tool. It is industry standard for imaging professionals, and is by far the best image-manipulation software out there. But, all that power comes with a pitfall: if you don't know what you're doing, it is pretty much impossible to get Photoshop to do anything worthwhile. This book is the solution. I've always been a big fan of learning to do something by fiddling with it, not reading about it. I'm the sort of person who throws manuals away (I suspect a lot of us are). For me, this book allowed me to very quickly (4 hours of reading) reach a level of understanding where I could use Photoshop to produce results. But months later, when I got puzzled by something (like histograms, or color manipulation, or printing), I'd crack out this book and find an explanation. Quickly, easily, without hassle. And that may be the motto of this line of books. Quick, easy, without hassle. If you got a copy of Photoshop with your printer, or you've got access to a copy but don't know how to use it, buy this book. You'll be fixing red-eye, cropping, and saving for web in an evenings easy reading. That said, if you already use photoshop, go browse the magazine aisle. You don't need this book (stay away from the photoshop bibles, too. If you needed them, you would already know).
