 I have the Nikon 995, and possibly the only problem I have with it is that it won't show you how much battery life you have left. It shows full, half, and empty, which really doesn't tell you very much. So, I wind up spending a lot of time stressing over whether a "half charged" battery was 30% full, and going to run out, or 80% full, and going to last the whole shoot. Save yourself the worry, buy a second one. This battery is a quick recharge (about two hours) and a long life. With the Nikon 995, you should have 110 minutes of use with the LCD, or days of use without it. I kid you not, the battery is good for days of continuous use if you operate without the monitor. Buy a spare battery, keep one charging at all times. Never worry about batteries again. Be well, Indra
