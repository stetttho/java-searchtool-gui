 . Clinical psychologists Bernheim and Lewine present a balanced picture of the various schools of thought regarding schizophrenia. They present the medical model, the moral model, the sociological model and the antipsychiatry model. They present various scientific explanations regarding the biochemistry, personality traits and environmental stress factors believed to be operative in schizophrenia. They also discuss the various methods employed by psychiatrists and clinical psychologists for treating schizophrenia, including shock therapy, drug therapy, family therapy, milieu therapy and psychoanalysis.
