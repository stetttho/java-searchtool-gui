 . I decided to take charge of my own life and become my own physician, after having been victimized for years by ruthless, incompetent professionals, most of whom did me more harm than good.   Although I have suffered what may very well be irreversible nerve damage as a result of "mood-stabilizers" WRONGLY prescribed to me by VA physicians and UCLA professor/physicians, I have since found that by applying the principles of sound nutrition one can prevent disease, both physical and mental, and HOPEFULLY restore one's health, both PHYSICAL and MENTAL.   What I have discovered is that prescribed mood-stabilizers, antidepressants and neurolpetic drugs do NOT stabilize the nervous system, they DESTROY the nervous system, the immune system and the cardiovascular system, a condition now recognized as Neuroleptic Induced Deficit Syndrome (NIDS). I now realize that those physicians who prescribed the drugs that nearly killed me were not even TRYING to help me. They were intentionally exploiting me and slowly killing me (and others, no doubt) for their own financial gain!  Author Ronzio's 30 year career as a biochemist and his professional writing skills have made Encyclopedia of Nutrition & Good Health an easy-to-read, comprehensive and indispensabe reference book (all 486 pages) for understanding the biochemistry of the human body and the principles of sound nutrition. Nutritious food and regular mental/physical exercise, not prescription drugs, is in my opinion the ONLY way to achieve sound mental and physical health.  I was able to obtain an excellent used copy of this book at a reasonable price from Amazon.com, even though the book is listed as "unavailable."
