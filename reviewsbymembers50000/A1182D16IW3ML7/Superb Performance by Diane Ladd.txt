 . The day 25-year-old Susan Nolan, who was adopted soon after birth by loving parents, meets her biological mother Edie (played by Diane Ladd) she thinks she has found the one thing that is missing from her life. She is dead wrong!   Edy has spent a goodly part of her adult life in a mental institution, where she was placed by a judge for allegedly endangering her child, a fact she does not reveal to Susan.  Diane Ladd's performance in this is blood-curdling, yet heart-wrenching, thriller is superb! The other actors also give superb performances. The writer-editor deserves a Best Story award. The director deserves a Best Director award. The producer deserves a Best Producer award. Had this film been produced by The Hollywood Film Kingdom instead of by Canadians, it no doubt would have taken many Academy Awards and Diane Ladd might have won Best Actresss of the year.
