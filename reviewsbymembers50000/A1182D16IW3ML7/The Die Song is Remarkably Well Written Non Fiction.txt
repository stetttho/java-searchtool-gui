 . This well written book by Donald T. Lunde and Jefferson Morgan provides valuable insight into the mind of mass murderer Herbert Mullin, a popular Santa Cruz high school athlete, voted "most likely to succeed" by his classmates, and who designed a small government tourist information bureau building prior to being diagnosed with schizophrenia and being convicted of murdering eleven people, mostly strangers.  Mullin had been introduced to LSD and marijuana by a high school classmate, James Gianera, following graduation. Gianera and his wife were two of Gianera's murder victims.  Incidentally, LSD, which was created by pharmaceutical companies in order to "treat" schizophrenia, and used by U.S. government psychiatrists to treat psychiatric patients, can actually can TRIGGER full-blown and lasting symptoms of schizophrenia in individuals previously exhibiting NO symptoms of schizophrenia. It is also known to exacerabate symptoms in individuals already diagnosed with schizophrenia.  Incidentally, numerous non-schizophrenic individuals treated with LSD in experiments conducted under the auspices of the CIA later committed murder or suicide, facts that have been revealed since the publishing of this book by Mr. Lunde.   Although Mullin was diagnosed with schizophrenia by psychiatrists prior to committing his first murder, he was nevertheless sentenced to prison for murdering eleven people.  The book provides excellent insight into the criminal justice system and how it interlocks with psychiatry.  Once again, a remarkably well-written book. Author Lunde worked with Mullin and researched his background during his trial.
