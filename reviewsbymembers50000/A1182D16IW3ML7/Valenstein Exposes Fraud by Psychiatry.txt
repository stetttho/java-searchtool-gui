 . The book is well written. Dr. Valenstein articulately exposes the fraud of psychiatric medicine by revealing how mainstream psychiatrists and the pharmaceutical companies exploit and harm psychiatric patients by prescribing neuroleptic drugs. The benefits of such drugs, according to Valenstein, are greatly exaggerated and the harmful effects are minimized. Stress can indeed cause neurological changes in the brain. However, according to Valenstine and other experts, the brain can be restored to normal only if the environmental or situational causes of the stress are removed, not by psychotropic or neuroleptic drugs! Psychiatrists who treat their patients with drugs are not helping their clients. They are exploiting them!  Dr. Valenstein has gained my respect for having the courage to reveal to the world knowledge that most exploited psychiatric patients gain only the hard way, often when it is too late, after they have suffered irreparable nerve damage [caused by the pharmaceuticals] resulting in behavior resembling Parkinson's disease.
