 . Joel Norris, Ph.D. has presented indepth biographies and intelligent commentaries on eleven people who committed multiple murders, including George Jo Hennard Jr., the son of an armed forces orthopedic surgeon, who drove his pick-up truck into a Luby's Cafeteria in Texas; Daniel Rakowitz, the son of a Texas deputy sheriff, who chopped up his female roommate in their Lower East Side New York apartment; Vietnam Veteran Arthur Shawcross, the mild-mannered man who loved his wife, yet killed prostitutes; and Laurie Wasserman, the disturbed daughter of an Illinois businessman.  Norris's commentaries on the cause of anti-social behavior are a valuable contribution to the fields of behavioral science and criminal justice. Highly recommended reading for any student of human behavior and for anyone working in the fields of mental health and criminal justice.
