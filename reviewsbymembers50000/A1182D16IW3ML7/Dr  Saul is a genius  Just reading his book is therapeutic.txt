 . Doctor Yourself: Natural Healing that Works is well-written. It is a comprehensive text, written by a biologist, teacher and experienced consulting specialist in natural healing.  Dr. Saul has provided common-sense healthy, natural alternatives to traditional medicine, including megadoses of niacinamide (vitamin B3), moderate exercise (both mental and physical)and transcendental meditation, for treating schizophrenia and psychosis, depression, insomnia, ADHA and alcoholism, as well as diabetes, arthritis and other ailments.   Saul's style is refreshing and humorous. He is courageous in standing up for what I believe to be common sense! He is courageous in taking a firm stand against the use of DANGEROUS neuroleptics and other psychotropic drugs in the treatment of schizophrenia, depression and other forms of mental illness.   Introduction is written by Abraham Hoffer, M.D., who pioneered the study of using niacinamide in the treatment of schizophrenia.  Just reading Andrew Saul's book is thereapeutic! His sense of humor is infectiously healing!
