 - The book is well written and very interesting. Norris does biographical studies of Henry Lucas, Charles Manson, Bobby Joe Long and Leonard Lake, and examines the parental neglect and horrendous violence, some institutional, that they and other "serial killers" experienced as very young children and as adolescents. Interestingly, Manson himself was never accused of or found guilty of having actually committed any of the murders that his "family" or gang were charged and found guilty of, although he was charged with planning and ordering the executions of those innocent people that were murdered by his followers. Norris presents evidence of both emotional abuse and physical abuse that these men suffered throughout their childhood, largely by their own parents.
