 - This is masterful analysis of Christ and Christianity. If my Sunday School teachers at the Presbyterian church and the Episcopal church had made the story of Christ as interesting as author Jack Miles does, I perhaps would have had a clearer understanding of Christianity than I did have. Whether you are a true believer, an athiest or an agnostic, this is a piece of literature that will enrich you mind, and perhaps your life!
