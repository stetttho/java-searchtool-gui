 . Norris's book, "Serial Killers," provides the reader with the results of numerous scientific studies. Conclusions indicate that: 1. Damage to the temporal lobe can cause the victim to experience hair-trigger violent reactions against persons perceived as threats, commonly recognized as "startle reactions." Startle reactions are common to serial killlers, as well as to individuals diagnosed with PTSD.  2. Psychomotor epilepsy, which can result from ALCOHOL and/or DRUG DEPENDENCY and which is not necessarily detectable with an EEG, is also common among serial kilers and individuals who commit episodic violence. Victims of psychomotor epilepsy commonly experience misperceptions of their environment and amnesia, no memory whatsoever for their behavior, which may or may not be violent, during a seizure. 3. Damage to the hypothalamus, whether as a result of repeated head trauma or a a birth defect, can destabilize the hormonal system and short-circuit the brain's activity to measure real or imagined threats. An example of this short-circuiting is the "startle reaction," characterized by a scream or jump, which is a largely primal brain reponse. The individual with damage to the hypothalamus is more likely to be startled (and jump) in response to a loud noise, than are other people.  4. In a home in which there is not adequate parental nurturing and role modeling, the child does not learn how to exercise control over his primal emotions, and as an adult is thus often unable to cope with perceived threats by others and sustain healthy interpersonal realtionships. Norris's book, "Serial Killers," is a valuable tool to enable society, teachers and parents to understand and possibly prevent the development of episodic violent behavior in children and adolescents. It is also a valuable tool to enable those working in the criminal justice system to better understand the pyschobiogenics of those who are charged with violent crimes.
