 - David Duke's "My Awakening" is the best and most comprehensive book I have read explaining the history of Judaism and the role of The Jewish Nation in the the world today. It is a book that should be on the bookshelf of every scholar. It is well-written, well-documented and easy to read. Duke  utilizes the writings of Jewish scholars and leaders, as well as quotes from The Torah and The Talmud to document his own observations that Judaism is a doctrine of Anti-Gentilism, a well as of Jewish Supremacism.  Duke reveals that he has been wrongfully labeled "anti-Semitic" merely for pointing out the elements of Anti-Gentilism inherent in Judaism. In this regard Duke himself appears to have been a victim of character assassination by The Jewish Nation. When you read this book you will realize that Duke himself is neither Anti-Semitic, nor a racist. He presents well-supported evidence that racism has its origins in ethnocentric Judaism and that slavery was institutionalized by ancient Jewish law as revealed in The Torah.
