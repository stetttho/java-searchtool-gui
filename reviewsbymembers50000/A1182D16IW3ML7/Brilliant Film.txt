 - "Frailty" is one of the best modern-day gothic/horror films ever made! If you like Poe-style drama in a modern-day Texas setting, you'll like this one. Suspense all the way! One twist after another. Bill Paxton displays his brilliance as a director and actor. Luke Askew, Jeremy Sumpter, Matt O'Leary, Matt McConaughey and Powers Booth are equally brilliant as a superb supporting cast of characters. I've viewed the film a dozen times so far, and each time I view it I realize more and more what a craft of genius this film truly is! And a budget film at that! For anyone interested in writing, directing or acting, this is one to study. Or for anyone just looking for escape!
