 Full of surprises,  this is a book I bought as a gift for someone, and then I liked thumbing through it so much that I bought myself a copy too. The book lets you "tour" real homes around the country, but it also provides lots of decorating advice and in-depth info on the collectibles shown in the homes. The book has everything from Fifties kitsch to fine antiques and shows everything from modern style to traditional. It's all about collecting and then decorating with what you love (versus decorating to fit someone else's idea of what's hot at the moment). A fun and funky book for anyone who loves their "stuff."
