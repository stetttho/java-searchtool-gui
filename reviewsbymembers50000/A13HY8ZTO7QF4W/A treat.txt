 I figured this book would be full of ideas, and it is. I love it, and I know I'll use it for a long time to come. What surprised me a little was how absolutely beautiful the book was just to flip through. I felt like my blood pressure went down as I flipped from page to page. This is a sumptuous book with such lovely pictures and such practical ideas. I really like the fact that the book has so many little and non-crafty ideas I can do quickly .
