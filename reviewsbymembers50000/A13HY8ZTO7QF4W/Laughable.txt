 I love some of the stuff in the rooms in this book, but I don't love the rooms. I so agree with the idea of breaking the rules (if they ever existed -- my mother, of all people actually says they didn't, and our home was a wild mix of styles and stuff). But I don't agree with creating a mess, which is what this book is. I'm as tired of the Pottery Barn look as everyone else, but that's no excuse for creating a cluttered mess of a room that is anything but stylish or harmonious or comforting to be in. I like rooms that stimulate, but what I see in this book is just sort of frenetic and uncomfortable to my eyes.
