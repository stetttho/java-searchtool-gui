 I just got this new book and I love it. I'm still going through just to look at the pictures but I've already marked a couple of sections I want to go back to as we redo our living room and bedroom. The book seems to have covered every decorating question but it's worth it for the photos alone. It's also a bargain. It's heavy and way more than 400 pages.
