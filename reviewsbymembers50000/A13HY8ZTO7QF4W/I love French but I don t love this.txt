 I love French style but I don't love this book. I think Mr. Faudri has his French and English mixed up. I think the rooms look like an odd mix of breeds. I also don't care for the fact that the rooms pictured in the book have a terrible amount off  furniture and accessories in them. It's too much and the result doesn't look authentic but self-conscious, in my opinion.
