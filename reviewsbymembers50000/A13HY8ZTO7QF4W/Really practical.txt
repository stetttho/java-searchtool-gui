 I started thumbing through this at a friend's house, expecting it to be a sort of picture book for the coffee table. It is filled with gorgeous photos. Once I got into it, I found I kept stopping because there is so much practical,  useful, helpful material here. It isn't just about what you see in the photos because the writing is about general decorating ideas (or "principles") that go beyond the photos. Everywhere I looked, I saw decorating ideas and practical information. That's why I ordered my own copy. A great book.
