 I  love Trading  Spaces, so I was thrilled to find another Trading Spaces book on the market.  I'm glad I bought this, but I'd give it a C- compared to the others.  I was hoping that even more of Ty's funny personality would shine through in the book, but it didn't. The book doesn't quite make it as a good how-to manual because it isn't detailed enough. The book doesn't quite satisfy me as a Trading Spaces fan because there isn't much evidence of the show in Ty's book. The book is kind of odd in its approach. I love Ty  but I was disappointed in this book.
