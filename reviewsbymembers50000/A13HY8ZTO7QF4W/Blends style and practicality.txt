 Finally.  I found a decorating book on color that blends style and practical advice. I like the Q&A approach, and there is  more than one answer to every question, which is a unique feature in my opinion. The book has gorgeous pictures but real life advice also. It's an idea book I like flipping through but it solves problems too. The examples must be from real homes and I like that aspect. Highly recommend this one for people who want to put more color into their houses.
