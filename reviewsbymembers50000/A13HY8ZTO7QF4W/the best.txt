 I have worn out my copy of this book and given it to all my friends on birthdays, for weddings, for college graduations, and on and on. It's a classic. I found that there is another edition of this out now too. Did not see it on amazon but found it at a bookstore and just got a copy. It looks  great also. Timeless information plus hundreds of color photos of real homes.
