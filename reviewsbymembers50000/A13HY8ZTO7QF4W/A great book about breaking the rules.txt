 This is a great book about breaking all the so-called decorating rules. This book shows one do-your-own-thing home after another, each filled with its own unique collectibles. There's everything from fine (and pricey) Italian glassware to mid-century modern and tramp art and colonial treasures. And more. There is a lot in the book on how to decorate with and display collections. An interesting book packed with great photos and information.
