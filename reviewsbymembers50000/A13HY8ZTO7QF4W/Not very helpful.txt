 I can see that this book would be a nice little reference for designers or students of design. However, it is obviously aimed at the rest of us who are simply decorating our apartments or homes. For that broader audience of ordinary people, this book is not very helpful. I agree with the reviewer who said this is a dictionary or encyclopedia but not a decorating book. There is no help or advice here. The book is filled with one design term after another with little definitions. Frankly, I don't care about that information and find it worthless, to be honest.
