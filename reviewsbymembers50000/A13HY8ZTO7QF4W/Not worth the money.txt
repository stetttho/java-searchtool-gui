 I grabbed this book based on the title even though I knew that I didn't like the picture on the cover. I am sorry I bought this. The cover photo says a lot about the book. I mean, a room with one ottoman in it? That is livable? That is luxury? This is some decorator's idea of how people should live and how they should define livability. In other words, this is superficial and shows rooms that seem to be created for show instead of for living in.  In this day and age, I'm offended by that.
