 This book looks and feels like the Trading Spaces TV show. If you love the show, you have to have this. Behind the scenes  pix are good but what I really like are thte shots of rooms from the show. I can spend time enjoying rooms that went by too fast when I watched them on TV. The book is as fun as the show.
