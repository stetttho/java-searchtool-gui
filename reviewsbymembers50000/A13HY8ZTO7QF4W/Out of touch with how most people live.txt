 Christopher Lowell doesn't seem to get the way most people live or the kinds of homes most of us live in. I agree with the reviewer who said that  there are some good ideas in this book but that they are nothing new. And the kinds of rooms shown in this book don't look typical of suburbia today. They look worse. Somehow,  Mr. Lowell has missed the mark on this one.
