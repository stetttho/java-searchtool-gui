 The Haunted Mansion film is not as bad as some will lead you to believe. Actually The Haunted Mansion is a throwback to movies  like William Castle's original 13 Ghosts (1960) and Don Knotts' The Ghost and Mr. Chicken (1965). The ghosts play it straight and dead serious and leaves the comedy to Eddie Murphy and family. There are also many scenes that reference Disney's theme park ride. Such as the singing busts, the ballroom waltz complete with a ghostly organist, and the hitch hiking ghosts even get their cameos. The story is very simple. A nice family is trapped overnight in The Haunted Mansion, trying to find a way out. There is also a subplot that deals with reincarnation, and a 122 year old murder mystery. A really fun movie. My favorite scene: The Gothic Mausoleum. Rick Baker has produced the best rotting, skeletal walking corpses I have ever seen. Seemingly straight out of a 1950s EC horror comic. So if retro horror comedy is to your liking you will love The Haunted Mansion movie.
