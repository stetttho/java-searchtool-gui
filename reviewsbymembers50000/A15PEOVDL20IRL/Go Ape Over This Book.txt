 The Legend Of The Planet Of The Apes By Brian Pendreigh is right up there with Eric Greene's Planet Of The Apes As American Myth, and almost quite ae scholarly. Pendreigh's book uncovers the REAL reason why Edward G. Robinson did not become Dr. Zaius. Moments of unintended humor, such as the author being shut out of Charleton Heston's limo pick up, due to the actor's need for leg room, with the author following behind the limo on foot. The small, yet interesting color photo section contained many behind the scenes photographs I have never seen before. For example I have never seen a photograph of a miniature of Ape City. The wonderful thing about this book is that the author  did his homework by backing himself up with named sources. Mr. Pendreigh showed a real appreciation for his subject matter. This book is great for either the casual Apes fan or The Keeper's Of The Faith. Personally I could not put this book down. Thank you Brian, great work!
