 No matter what pre-cautionary steps a director takes remaking or "re-imagining" a revered classic film such as Planet of the Apes (1968), everyone is going to compare the original to "the new improved" version. You must also take into account the times, and social issues that gaps the original and the remake. Planet of the Apes (2001) seems to be making a anti-gun political statement. Whereas Planet of the Apes (1968) dealt with racial issues among numerous others. Since the new Planet of the Apes was produced pre-911, there was'nt that much happening enough to make much of a story about. Heck, this new Planet of the Apes could have had a anti-smoking message instead. All the classic Apes films storylines were then, current events derivative. So, for me Planet of the Apes (2001) did'nt have a whole lot to say.   Mark Wahlberg was badly miscast. Then again I can't think of any current actors today that could match up to Heston's stature as a spokesman for mankind.    Planet of the Apes (2001) was beautifully photographed, the special effects were dazzling, and of course Rick Baker's Apes makeup was terrific. All eye candy with little else going for it.   No matter what "innovations" or "re-imagining" new Hollywood comes up with on the "new and improved" Planet of the Apes series, I'll remain a loyal admirerer of the originals.   Who knows, maybe the next installment of the Apes series may have a anti-obesity message centering on the Orangutans as the lead Apes characters.
