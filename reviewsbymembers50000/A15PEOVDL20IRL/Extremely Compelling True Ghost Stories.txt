 Haunted Places, The National Directory is one of those books that once you get started reading is difficult to put down. For example, do not read the section about Tennessee's Bell Witch alone late in the evening unless you don't have to be at work early the next day. These stories contained in this book  are genuinely creepy and will keep you awake late into the night. Better than coffee. This book is everything a good true ghost story book should be. Enjoy.
