 Who cares what anyone says negatively about Larry Buchanan's films. Personally this is good cult movie entertainment. One cannot properly critique a "cult movie" like mainstream films. Either you appreciate this art form for what it is or stay with regular fare. If you like Ed Wood type of filmaking get this DVD.
