 When I was a kid way, way back in the late sixties to the early seventies I never failed to catch a great Price film on the late night Creature Features. This book is hard to put down. Dennis Meikle does'nt white wash the Master of Menace, nor present him in any unfavorable light. All of Price's successes and failings are told here in a very respectful manner. As a  matter of fact there were some parts of Price's life I did'nt want to know. This is the story of a great actor the likes of whom we will never ever see again. Well illustrated. A really excellent book.
