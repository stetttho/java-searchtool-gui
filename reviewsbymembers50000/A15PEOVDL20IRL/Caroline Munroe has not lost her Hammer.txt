 I will be completely honest with everyone out there about this film. Caroline Munroe, ex-Hammer Films (Dracula A.D. 1972 and Captain Kronos Vampire Hunter) babe is in this godawfull mess so I just had to buy it. Caroline has a really small part in this film as a psychic fortune teller but she is still beautiful. Nice to see her again. No, this film is not all that great I admit, but it is a heck of a lot better than House of the Dead. Tons of nudity and blood abound in this film though. I predict that someday this film will achieve some sort of small cult status among some gorehounds out there. Look what time did for Plan Nine From Outer Space.
