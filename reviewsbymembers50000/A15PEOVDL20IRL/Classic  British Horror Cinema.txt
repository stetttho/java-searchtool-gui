 First of all The Skull, (Amicus, 1965) is not a Hammer film. The Skull has a few of Hammer's alumni, such as Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee (in a small role), Patrick Wymark, and Michael Gough. The Director Freddie Francis directed a few Hammer Horror shockers himself, so The Skull can easily be mistaken for being a Hammer film. The Skull is adapted from a short story by Robert Bloch (Psycho) called, The Skull of The Marquis deSade, which originally appeared in Weird Tales back in the late 1940's. The Skull is a very interesting little film, highly recommended to fans of sixties British Horror Cinema. The Skull's cast of players alone tells something of the quality of this Amicus Films production. Get The Skull before it gets you.
