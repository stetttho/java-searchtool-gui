 I found this documentary, Hollywood Ghosts and Gravesites to have exceeded all my expecations on the subject. The stories told here are not new, just interesting. Just seeing all these old Hollywood studios and movie star haunts was worth the cost of the DVD itself. The longest section of this documentary is the gravesites segment. This DVD clocks in at about 61 minutes. Very well done and excellent production values. Every self respecting star grave hunter should own this DVD.
