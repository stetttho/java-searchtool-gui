 Mark Nesbitt's series, Ghosts of Gettysburg (five volumes), consists of some of the best paranormal journalism I have ever read in years. These books actually kept me awake nights. I have never been to Gettysburg, Pa, but Mr. Nesbitt makes you feel as if you are there, complete with all it's colorful history, and it's hauntings. Mr. Nesbitt seems to be neither a skeptic or believer, he lets you decide. Don't let the small page count of each volume fool you, there is a lot to read. I can hardly wait for volume six.
