 The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra proves that THEY can make em' like they used to. This movie actually feels and looks like it was made around 1961. This movie was shot in black and white and filmed in Bronson Canyon, California where many other B-Monsters found a hospitable home while trying to conquer the earth. Even the musical score sounds like the stock library music B-Movie filmmakers used in those days.  So if you love Plan Nine From Outer Space (1958) and Catwomen on the Moon (1952) then you will really enjoy this film.  In this Special Edition DVD of The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra you get:  1) A Technicolor 1940s Ub Iwerks cartoon "Skeleton Frolic"  2) "Obey The Lost Skeleton!" making of featurette.  3) Two separate audio commenteries. The Director (Larry Blamire) and Crew. And a very funny Cast commentary.  4) "Q and A at the American Cinematheque". Quite interesting.  5) Full color blooper reel.  6) "Virtual Skelectables". A Imaginary collection of early 1960s Lost Skeleton bubble gum cards, games, drinking glasses and box cover art of a "Aurora Model Kit" of the alien mutant monster from the Lost Skeleton movie. Stuff you will never find on EBay.  7) Last but not least, a excellent retro style Lost Skeleton trailer.  I really enjoyed and appreciated "The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra". Check it out and ENJOY.
