 Great classic stuff here. In my mind Lon Chaney Jr. was always my favorite Wolfman. You really feel sorry for Lawrence Stewart Talbot being cursed with lycanthropy. In this set you get:  1) The Werewolf of London (1935)  2) The Wolfman (1941)  3) Frankenstein Meets The Wolfman (1943) By the way is actually a sequel to both The Wolfman (1941) and The Ghost of Frankenstein (1942), continuity wise.  4) She-Wolf of London (1946)  5) a 45 minute documentary, Monster By Moonlight. Pretty much a history of Universal's Wolfman mixed with actual Werewolf lore.  6) Tom Weaver does commentary on a separate audio track of The Wolfman (1941). Extremely interesting P.O.V..  7) A neat peek at Van Helsing's homage to Universal's classic Wolfman.   All in all I really enjoyed this set. I just can't wait until Universal raids their Atomic Age Monster vaults like this. Til' then, ENJOY.
