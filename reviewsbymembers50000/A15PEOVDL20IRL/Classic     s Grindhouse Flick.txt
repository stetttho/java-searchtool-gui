 This a rather enjoyable blue movie from the mid-1960s shot in rain silver black and white. Featuring a great jazzy, upbeat Lounge soundtrack score. Nothing graphic here, however, all the girlie scenes were shot in Technicolor. Dialogue is nearly non-existent. This film is obviously another take on The Immoral Mr. Teas or Lucky Pierre style of grindhouse film making back in the early to mid 1960s. Sit back and enjoy.
