 When it comes to Poverty Row horror classics of the 1940s, King of The Zombies has to rank right at #1, personally that is. Yet King of The Zombies is not really "horror", it is actually a comedy with Mantan Moreland as the TRUE STAR of this picture. The Roan Archive DVD edition of this film is beautifully restored to crystal clarity. Other DVD versions of this film I have seen were either too dark or the source material was of a bad VHS transfer to disc variety. Now, enjoy the film.
