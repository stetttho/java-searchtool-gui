 I simply cannot wait for Lost Highway to hit the DVD bandwagon, but unfortunately, I must. The film is a enigma, since that is where it's true beauty lies. A film with a plot with no plot. Robert Blake's Mystery Man, is he a devil, or a twisted Jimminy Cricket? The cool thing is the film explains nothing, in which the Mystery Man is anything you want him to be. Creepiest film moment: The Cell Phone Scene. If you are looking for a movie that you can watch repeatedly and find something different with each viewing, Lost Highway is the way to go.
