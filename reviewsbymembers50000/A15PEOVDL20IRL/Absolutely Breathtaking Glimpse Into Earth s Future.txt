 To put it simply, if you enjoyed the Walking With Dinosaurs documentaries you'll love The Future Is Wild. Luscious photography, and terrific cgi mixed with live action effects. In this future of the earth depicted here, mankind is long extinct. Earth has returned to it's primitive paradise. Strange and stranger new life forms have emerged. Such as giant landwalking squids, monolithic turtles, and carnivorous fish that literally electrifies their prey. And many strange vistas. Many of today's leading scientists were consulted for this documentary to present their views of earth's future. Extremely entertaining. If you are looking for something truly out of the ordinary, The Future Is Wild is your ticket. Enjoy.
