 This simply has got to be one of the best Tarzan films ever made. Yet I can't help feeling that this Tarzan film is merely a great prelude of what could have been a great series of more Tarzan films. Christopher Lambert was excellent as Tarzan/John Clayton and Andie MacDowell looked beautiful as Jane (dubbed by Glen Close). The scene of the jungle explorers traveling down a African river via tramp steamer reminded me of Disney World's Jungle Cruise ride exactly. Beautiful cinematography and Rick Baker's ape effects were fantastic. This Tarzan film seems to take place around the late 1890s - early 1900s, so the attention to period detail was very well done. So if jungle adventure and romance is to your liking, check out this terrific film. Enjoy.
