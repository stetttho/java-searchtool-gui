 I found this book to be written in a very basic, generic writing style. Much better books have been written on this subject in a much more interesting way. No new information here I have'nt read elsewhere. This book should have been titled "Hollywood  Book of Death For Dummies" or something. I highly recommend this book for the Hollywood graveyard beginner. Enjoy.
