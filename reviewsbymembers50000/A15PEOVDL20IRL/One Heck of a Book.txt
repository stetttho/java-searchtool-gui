 Ever since I was a child in the early seventies I have always loved Nancy Garden's supernatural themed books. Devils and Demons is very interestingly written and still scary to me  at age forty, as it was when I was lucky thirteen. I don't know if Ms. Garden aimed her readership toward adults or kids, since her writing is so scholarly, and well illustrated. If you want a book about Devils and Demons that you simply can't put down, get this book, and have a heck of a good time.
