 The Erotic Mister Rose is one of those grindhouse films very much in the style of The Immoral Mr. Teas. The story here is of a one Mr. Rose on his life's mission to stamp out anything to do with smut or porn, until he is one day touched by Satan to forget his mission and just go ahead and enjoy what smut has to offer. Relax about the Satan bit, this is a comedy. The film  was shot in black and white and color. Also included on this DVD is a forty minute documentary of the history of 1960s adult films, plus four trailers of other grindhouse flicks available from Guilty Pleasures. Enjoy.
