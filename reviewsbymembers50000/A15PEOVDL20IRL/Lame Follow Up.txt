 Murders In Hollywood seems to be a lame sequel to Hollywood Ghosts and Gravesites. The only reason I gave this DVD two stars is for the fine narration and opening scene of Hollywood as it looks today. Otherwise this is merely a slideshow of still images reproduced badly. The crime scene photos appear to come from whatever books on Hollywood were available during production of this documentary. There are no new revelations here, or anything you don't already know about Filmland murders. Production of this DVD seemed to be extremely rushed. Delta Entertainment is capable of much better product than this. Come on you guys.
