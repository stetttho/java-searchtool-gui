 Peter Pan (2003) is one gorgeously produced film with lots of real heart put into it. One of those rare films where the dazzling special effects actually takes a back seat to just a great classic children's story to be told here. No corny musical interludes (where you've just got to hit the fast forward scan button) are to be found here. Jason Isaacs portrayal of Captain Hook has a excellent Basil Rathbone flavor to it. Mr. Isaacs also portray's Mr. Darling to equally great effect. I really enjoyed this movie. The DVD also features a alternate ending to see what happened to Wendy all grown up. Tons of "making of" extras. Sadly, no Director's commentary.  I could go on and on about my admiration for this film. Til' Then, ENJOY.
