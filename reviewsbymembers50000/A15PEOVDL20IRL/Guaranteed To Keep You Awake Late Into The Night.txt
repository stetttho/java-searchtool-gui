 Universal plans to re-release Ghost Story on September 7, 2004 just in time for Halloween. Most likely this re-release won't have any extras, although we can always hope. I have always enjoyed this film and although the story line does'nt quite gel with the book's, who cares. This movie is genuinely creepy. Anyway, all of us fans of this film can start the countdown. Til' then, enjoy.
