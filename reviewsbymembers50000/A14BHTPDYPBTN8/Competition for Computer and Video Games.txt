 My 11 year old son got this for his birthday, and I figured it would be another dust gathering board game he'd never look at again (Scrabble Junior was one of these).  The gross brain was what first grabbed him (if you're 11 and male, it has to be gross). The fact that it lit up and made noise meant that it had enough technology to hold his interest.  It has questions he sometimes can answer, which makes him feel smart, and it has questions he sometimes can't answer which means he's learning something. In addition, you sometimes roll to a position on the board where you pull a "no brainer" question that is, in effect, a dumb joke like, "Who is buried in Grant's tomb?" They're stupid enough to make him groan, which is what an 11 year old looks for in a joke. He and another 11 year old boy have been playing the game for hours with thousands of dollars of computer equipment and games two feet away.  Enough said.
