 While I like reading about times past, I've never been thoroughly sold on the way most historical genre fiction is written. Books by authors like Anya Seaton or Philippa Gregory that other people swoon over generally leave me cold. I prefer classics, like A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, or I Claudius, where the writing and the story are a level above the usual.  So I read this expecting to sigh over improbable melodrama and stilted dialog. Instead, the first page made it clear that the book was very well-written, so I kept going with interest. The story had me hooked. In some ways, and I'm not sure why, the action scenes and story twists kind of reminded me a little of Outlander. The characters are sympathetic and generally well-developed, the action scenes are exciting, and the story never flags. There were times when plot twists were a little improbable, but I was totally along for the ride and never sighed once.  My only gripe - and this is a personal one (I've complained about this before with other books) - was her use of French without translations. (If the author is reading this: I would have liked very much to know what the French characters were saying to one another.)   But like I said, that's a very personal gripe. I don't like to be kept out of things. It didn't really detract from the story much (though of course I can't be certain). And it didn't occur so often that I felt as though huge chunks of the book were missing.  As other reviewers have said, this is a ripping good yarn. That's the best way to describe it! It's about two women from vastly different backgrounds who team up and become fast friends because they share a common goal: freeing two young men from a terrible English prison during the Revolutionary War. If you're able to put it down, it will constantly bug you to pick it up again and get on with it!
