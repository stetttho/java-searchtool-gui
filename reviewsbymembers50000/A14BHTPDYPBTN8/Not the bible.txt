 I just received the book, and on reviewing it liked the layout, the conciseness, and the usefulness of its content. It suits my purposes. For those reasons, I'm giving it 4 stars.   However, a quick perusal made me suspect that I might need to consult another reference whenever questions arise. I know the book was written 50 years ago, and perhaps English grammar usage has changed - or perhaps the editors missed a spot. But I flipped through the book and came upon a ghastly (to me) error. If you look up usage for "get," "got," "have gotten," the book states that "have got" is preferred, and displays "have gotten" as an error. Seeing it in a book about technical writing is cringe-inflicting.  Excuse me, but there is no "have got" in proper English grammar. You either "have" or you "got"; not both at once. The correct form is "have gotten." So I suppose we need to be on the lookout for archaic content that wasn't weeded out in later editions, or colloquial rules that don't apply in the US -- I know that's a habit the British HAVE GOT. I checked a British dictionary, and OFFICIALLY the usage is the same as in the US...but we use the correct form in America.   On the other hand, Americans always place punctuation marks within quotations whether or not they logically belong there (the book got that right) because ". and ", caused problems with old printing presses. We never moved past that, while the Brits did, and their treatment of quotations makes more sense. So it all evens out. (Someone should write a book on comparative English grammar, in my opinion, just so we don't get confused after reading English literature, or listening to the BBC say, "The group were..." or "The family were...")  So, I like the book, but that one flaw makes it just a little suspect to me. I'll always have a second reference nearby.
