 I think this book replaced The Mommy Club as my favorite by Sarah Bird. It's a definite two-time read, but I'm saving it for later so I can savor it. Bernie, like most of the author's heroines, isn't quite mainstream. The only place in the world where she fits in is within her nuclear family, which travels around the world because their father is in the military.  Her sister, Kit, is beautiful, popular, and walks into any group of people expecting to be adored - and is. Bernie watches this her whole life, not knowing what Kit is talking about when she says "Making friends is the easiest thing in the world."  Bernie, on the other hand, has never had a friend except for their family's servant, Fumiko, years ago in Japan. There's a mystery surrounding her, and it affects her family because it was at the time Fumiko was sent away that Bernie's parents began speaking to each other through the children: "Tell your mother-", "Tell your father-" Nobody mentions Fumiko's name again. Given a second chance to find Fumiko, Bernie travels back to Japan as the partner of a bad comedian, who makes her bleach her hair blond, wear tons of makeup, go by the name Zelda, and dance to Peter, Paul and Mary in go-go boots that are two sizes too small. Bernie hates Peter, Paul and Mary. The story, like most of Sarah Bird's stories, is hilarious and poignant all at once. And in this case, it has to be her best yet.
