 This book is funny, different and moving. Mothertime is a story about an alcoholic ex-beauty who neglects her children. After one disasterous  Christmas, the children decide they want an actual, maternal mother - a  real mother - so they trap their mother in a sauna where they hold her  hostage for months, take away her booze and cigarettes, and make her wear  flowery feminine clothes. Throughout the book, the author tricks you into  feeling indignant, and satisfied that this horrible mother finally got  hers. Then the book's ending takes you completely by surprise (I pride  myself on seeing things coming - I didn't see this at all). It stops you  short and opens your eyes to some reasons people are they way they are, and  reminds you that we don't always have the right to judge.
