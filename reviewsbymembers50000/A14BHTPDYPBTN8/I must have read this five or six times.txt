 This is a book that I bought years ago when I was looking for something trashy and escapist. I think it was the cover art on the edition I bought that led me to believe it would be a typical historical bodice ripper, or something of that sort.   Instead, it was a book I kept going back to again and again because of the character development, the writing and the plot. I really connected with the characters and the story.  The author separates the book into sections, changes viewpoints from one character to the next, and explores things like "Virtue" and "Justice" through the eyes of whichever character is focused on that issue. Throughout the book, though, the main character is clearly Janna, the family matriarch, and each of the characters rotates around her and her life over the course of decades.  The switch in character viewpoint is not distracting at all, in fact, it increased my sympathy for everyone in the book. I had my favorite (the neglected and unloved child Jan-Yves - the one focused on "justice" - who grew up to be funny and delightful), while other people I know who read the book had theirs.   It's an easy enough read to work well on the beach, but it isn't a throw-away book at all. And it certainly isn't trashy. It's absorbing throughout, and I highly recommend it.
