 I read this book twice because I loved it so much. Shay Garrett, living in the 1970s, somehow switches places with her grandmother after looking into a mysterious mirror. She then finds herself living a half century before her own birth. She inherits her grandmother's life situation, her marriage partner and her destiny, and has to live that life instead of her own. Regretting how little she paid attention during history class, she miscalculates the start of the Great Depression, but otherwise has (from the perspective of her new contemporaries) an eerie ability to "see the future", including the future of her own mother, to whom she gives birth, but with whom she never had a good relationship. She's also brought with her the "loose woman" attitudes of the 1970s, and finds she has philosophically more in common with the town prostitutes than the "virtuous" townspeople and has to struggle to tone it down. In the meantime, her grandmother finds herself in the future, living as Shay. She's brought with her turn-of-the-century innocence and bewilderment over things like indoor plumbing, and has to cope with a world completely different from the one she was raised in. While I truly loved the story, my only complaint was that the storyline for Shay sent back in the past was far better-developed than the storyline for Grandma Bran brought into the future. Even though Shay was the primary character, I was left feeling let down that the story had so little to say about Grandma Bran's experiences. I was almost bewildered when the book was over, thinking: "Yes but..." I also never got a clear picture of the relationship between Shay and her mother. I knew they never got along and never had a good relationship, but never really understood why that was - I was just supposed to take the author's word for it. Aside from that, I definitely recommend this book.
