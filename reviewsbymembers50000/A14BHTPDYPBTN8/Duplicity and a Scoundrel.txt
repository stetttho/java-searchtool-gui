 I remember watching an evening news magazine once about two women married to the same man who was leading a double life, with two families. Then I saw this book, remembered the story and was fascinated by the premise. What kind of people DO that?? This is a wonderful story about a guy who tries to have it all, two families, two lives, and the people he deceives. The story will keep you on the edge of your seat through to the end. There are lessons to be learned, but enjoy yourself on the ride! You'll love this book!
