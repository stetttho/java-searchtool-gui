 I love John. Truly I do. And Tape 1 was good. But there is NO WAY you will meet your guides using Tape 2.  John lulls you into a meditative trance - very similar to hypnosis, if not the same - then "betrays" you when you get there. It's as though he was under the wire, racing to get the tape completed before his time in the studio was up. So you're laying there in your trance, more than happy to cooperate, and there's no possible way you can formulate the images he asks you to because he doesn't give you a chance before he races on to something else. And the thing about being in a hypnotic trance is that you are overly sensitive to things like that. So you can't simply ignore them and move on. You get "stuck" on the fact that you've left an image behind that he asked you to "see". Another thing that bothered me was that he asks you to breathe deeply counting to six, then doesn't keep track of rhythm of the count himself. So if you count to six in the rhythm he first demonstrates, you totally lose him after the third breath. That's another example of something that gets you "stuck". You're breathing in when he's telling you to breath out. So I would recommend these tapes with reservations. They're very good for relaxation, but you may find that's all you get out of them.
