 Spite Hall is a book about a bitter man who gets even with...the world? No telling... by standing in front of a car in an intersection, and allowing it to hit him. By doing this he proves...something. Or not. But no matter.  The elderly woman driver who hits him is fraught with guilt, and apologizes by sending pies. So begins this little fable about bitterness, friendship and ultimate redemption.   The book is a gem, and gut-bustingly funny, particularly if you are a fan of high-end, John Gielgud (the butler in "Arthur") type wit. Every character - and "character" is the word - is well-drawn, recognizable and hilarious. The writing is superb. It's a two-read book (though I'm preparing for read Number 3).   If you're looking for a book you can't put down, and will really love, this is the book! I give it my very highest rating!
