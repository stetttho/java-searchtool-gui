 I would actually say 3 1/2 stars.  The author is very clever, and I really appreciated the humor in the book, which sometimes is laugh-out-loud funny. I got about halfway through, however, and wondered where the story was going. There really isn't much of a plot - an obese psychic takes on an unpleasant young assistant, and they go from psychic fair to psychic fair, interacting with other psychics and some lowlife spirits who are "airside", and who torment them "earthside" with pranks and hilarious dialog. The assistant, Colette, is verbally abusive, and the psychic merely endures it good-naturedly. You never really feel as if you understand Colette and why she feels she needs to be so mean. And you never understand why the psychic, Alison, hired her and put up with her.  The point of view switches back and forth from Alison to Colette. Then, ccasionally "she" says something, and you're confused over which of them "she" is - some of the writing needed touch-ups for clearer point of view. You also have unfocused musings by Alison that go on and on without doing much to either develop the character or give strength to the plot, nor do they add to the humor or the pathos. So I think the book might have been better with a little trimming and a little tighter focus.  All in all, it was a good read, but not (in my opinion) a great one. However, I enjoyed it enough so that I probably wouldn't hesitate to read another book by this author.
