 What I liked most about the book, besides the fact that it's VERY well written, is the way in which the author managed to depict female characters in more realistic depth than most male authors typically manage.  It was also interesting how he developed the character of a child molester - ALMOST to the point where you feel sorry for him when the town has a knee-jerk reaction to his return from prison. He and his mother are repeatedly hounded by an obsessed retired cop who stalks him and torments him throughout the entire book. Then the author reminds you that the guy is truly sick. He gives no answer to the problem - there is none, really, under current laws - but despite your revulsion toward the character, you have to admit the author handled him deftly.  The book follows a group of suburban housewives (and one househusband) through the course of Summer 2001. The main character - although the book switches from one point of view to another - is Sarah, the bisexual wife of a man who orders used panties over the Internet, and is obsessed with the woman, "[...] Kay", who provides them. Meanwhile, Sarah is obsessed with the "Prom King", a househusband she meets in the park. It isn't inspirational drama so much as a snapshot of lives, personal dreams and personal problems.   It was an easy read, completely engrossing, intelligent and slyly humorous. I highly recommend it!
