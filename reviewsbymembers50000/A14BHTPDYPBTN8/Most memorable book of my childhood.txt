 When you have kids, you start racking your brain, trying to remember what you loved so you can present them with a book you KNOW they'll love too. Loretta Mason Potts was one of the first that came to mind. It's the story of a girl Loretta Mason, who finds a magic portal into another world where she's treated like a princess. She refuses to go home to her family and insists on living in the Potts house with another family because their house contains the portal. Her mother goes to see her every day, but doesn't mention her again to the other children, and can't think of anything to do about the situation except pay the Potts family to keep her. The story really revolves around her younger brother, who is the main character, and who finds out that he has an older sister (Loretta) by accident. What's great about this is that you can hand the book to an 11 or 12 year old boy, and watch him get sucked into the story without any concern that it might be a "girl" book because of the title. As the mother of boys, I truly appreciated the fact that it appealed to both genders. The book is hardcover with no dust jacket. The price may seem high to someone who has never read it, but anyone familiar with Loretta Mason Potts will (like I did) simply purchase it without question, grateful that you FINALLY found it after decades of wishing you still had a copy. Then hand it to any of your children, boys or girls. It's still weaving magic 50 years after it was written.
