 This is an awesome movie, I've never seen anything like it!  When was the last time you saw a movie that had the peasants singing 'We Will Rock You' at a jousting tournament?  When was the last time the royals danced to David Bowie?  When was the last time you saw a movie so fun, refreshing, meaningful, and funny as the movie 'A Knight's Tale'? During 'A Knight's Tale' you will laugh, cry, and cheer (for the knights!).  The acting is great, I was very impressed with Heath Ledger and newcomer Shannyn Sossamon.  The battles manage to be extremely exciting and fun to watch without all the blood and gore you usually see.  The costumes and music are great!  Most people think that a movie set in medieval times with modern music will be stupid or cheesy. I thought this myself when I first saw it, but the music works itself into the movie surprisingly well! I liked how the main character (Heath Ledger) was a really honest and kind man who had good morals.  You really don't see that too much in heros nowadays.  This movie also has a great message.  I've seen 'A Knight's Tale' twice already in theaters and I can't wait until it comes out on DVD!
