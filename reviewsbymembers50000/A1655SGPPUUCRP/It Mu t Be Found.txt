 What an exhilarating, visual feast Luc Besson's 1997 sci-fi extravaganza "The Fifth Element" is.  And what a mess.  This tumultuous cinematic experience, starring Bruce Willis and Milla Jovovich, combines unapologetically hokey science fiction (often blatantly ripping-off "Brazil" and "Blade Runner") with quasi-religious undertones, and garish French New Age visuals courtesy of legendary couturier Jean-Paul Gaultier.  This mind-boggling film veers from being impertinent to silly to exciting to downright stupid.  Perhaps this can be explained by the fact that writer and director Besson originally wrote twenty-two years ago when he was sixteen.  And I sincerely doubt that he changed a word of the script since then.  Although this movie is literally dripping with eye-popping special effects, they're all hung on a scatterbrained plot that is literally incomprehensible.  The plot, what there is of one, is your basic "cab driver saves the world from a big flying ball of evil using magic rocks" story, with Willis as the cabbie in question and a sorely out of place Gary Oldman as the business tycoon who wants the rocks for himself. And while lots of things blow up, most of the film is just plain boring and idiotic, especially Chris Tucker's performance as Ruby, an indecipherable, somewhat disturbing intergalactic Dennis Rodman-esque talk show host.  Yes, you read that correctly.
