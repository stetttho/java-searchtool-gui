 And here I was thinking that it couldn't get any better.  I mean, really, how could Age of Mythology possibly get any more interesting, exciting, addictive, and fun?  Well, the long-awaited "Age of Mythology: The Titans" does just that.  It is, simply put, AMAZING!  Everything you loved about Age of Mythology is back, but this time it's all BIGGER and BETTER. The new culture, the Atlanteans, adds tons of new myth units, cultural attributes, god powers, maps, buildings, upgrades, characters, gods, heroes, and the deadly Titans which can overpower all other units if created and can be created by all cultures.  You can even play around with time!  The new graphics and music help to enhance game-play to a level not previously reached by Age of Mythology.  Ensemble Studios have also polished basic aspects of the game.  The new "repeat build" button will continue to supply you with units as long as long as you have the resources.  If found this to be very helpful as I got to concentrate on other aspects of the game (such as destroying all enemies) instead of constantly commanding "create new unit" every time I lose one. The new campaign dwarfs that of Age of Mythology.  It focuses primarily on the Titans and is so incredibly involving that you can easily play for six hours without noticing.  The story is much better and the scenery and construction of the various landscapes is far more detailed and realistic. This is a 5 star game that isn't to be missed by fans of the original Age of Mythology or the Age of Empires games.  It's all well worth your money, I assure you.  Once you pop this CD into your disk drive you'll open the door to hours, days, weeks, months, years of exciting new game-play.  Don't miss it.
