 "Death is just the beginning." ~Imhotep Max Allan Collins does an excellent job in this movie novelization of 'The Mummy Returns'.  He manges to bring the excitement and adventure from the movie to the pages of his book.  Max Allan Collins has a lot of description here and you can picture each scene so vividly in your mind, it's almost like watching the movie again!  'The Mummy Returns' is filled with the same wondeful wit and humor in the first novel, Evie is my favorite.  She cracks me up!  One little thing that I have to throw in, I think that people love 'The Mummy' series so much because it's really original and funny and takes place in very exotic places, places that most of us only dream about going to. I suggest reading the novelization after you see the movie (which makes sense).  It's an awesome action adventure movie and not to be missed!
