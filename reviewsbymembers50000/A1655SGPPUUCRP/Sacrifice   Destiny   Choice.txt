 Just when I was beginning to consider boycotting the endless stream of painfully bad sequels pouring out of Hollywood ("The Matrix Reloaded", "The Matrix Revolutions", "Shrek 2", "Alien vs. Predator", "Princess Diaries 2", "Ocean's 12", "Scooby Doo 2", "Barbershop 2"), in swoops "Spider-Man 2," the latest comic-book-turned-smash-hit-film-franchise featuring the everyman's superhero, Peter Parker/Spider Man, played perfectly by the versatile Tobey Maguire.  And guess what, "Spider-Man 2" is even better than the first one!    Picking up where the smash-hit "Spider-Man" left off, audiences are treated to a truly pulse-pounding, involving story complete with a few tear-jerking moments, breathtaking special effects, solid acting by a solid cast including Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, and Alfred Molina, and astonishing action that doesn't compromise the quality of the film ala "The Matrix" sequels.  This is an intelligent, touching, and wonderfully-paced film that really threw me for a loop as I realized just how powerful a movie based on a comic book series could be!  I loved the way director Sam Raimi takes the trademark quote from the original, "With great power comes great responsibility" and weaves it in as the very soul of this film.  With such a powerful core, "Spider-Man 2" focuses on all the right aspects of the young Spider-Man, connecting him beautifully to the audience and really drawing us into his psyche.  This is what separates "Spider-Man 2" from most action films out there right now.    "Spider-Man 2" won't just awe and excite you; it will take your heart as well.
