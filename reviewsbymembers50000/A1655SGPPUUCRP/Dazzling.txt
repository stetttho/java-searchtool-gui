 Celine is one of the best singers out there!  She doesn't need to be glamorized and madeup in order for her CD's to sell.  They sell because she she has a great voice and sings with a lot of soul.  This is Celine's best album yet.  It includes some of her biggest hits (all *excellent* songs) and a batch of new songs (there was one big hit out of them, 'That's The Way It Is', which is a beautiful song!).  This was a great finale for Celine.  She stepped out of the music business on a (very) high note.
