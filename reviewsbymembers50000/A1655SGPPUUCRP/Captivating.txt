 When I first heard the 'K-PAX' score during the opening titles of the film, my friend and I both agreed that this was a score that we had to have!  The score is very new age and modern sounding.  This score really helped to enhance and set the mood in 'K-PAX', so naturally this music has a lot of heart and feeling in it.  I was very impressed with Edward Shearmur, who is relatively unknown.  The only other score done by him that is available is 'Wings of the Dove'.  I hope to see his work more often after this triumphant score.  My personal favorites on this score are 'Grand Central', 'Good Morning Bess', 'Taxi Ride', and 'Coda', but all the tracks are wonderful!
