 After listening to this amazing soundtrack to "The Lord of The Rings: The Fellowship of The Ring". I just know that the movie will be good!  The whole soundtrack has a mystical pagan sort of feeling.  I wasn't enitirely sure that Howard Shore could do something like 'Lord of the Rings', considering he usually does scores for films such as 'The Score', 'Silence of the Lambs', 'The Cell', 'Dogma', etc.  I would think they'd want to go with John Williams on this one, since he's defintely proven his ability to do fantasy scores with 'Haryy Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone'.  Well, I was pleasantly surprised with Howard Shore!  This is a excellent soundtrack, ideal for a film such as 'Lord of the Rings'.   This music has a great way of setting the mood.  I've heard numerous movie critics comment on how wonderful the music was and how it was extremely helpful in setting the mood.  Critics don't usually bother with commenting on the score, so that tells you something; this must be a good soundtrack!  Some of my personal favorites on this soundtrack are 'Concerning Hobbits', a very ubeat and magical piece.  'Many Meetings', 'The Breaking of the Fellowship', 'The Rings Goes Sounth', and others (that I just can't remember) are also my favorites.  Actually, it looks like the whole soundtrack is my favorite! When I heard that Enya would be recording two new songs for the 'Lord of the Rings' soundtrack, I went nuts! Enya and 'Lord of the Rings' seem like a perfect match!  The music in 'Lord of the Rings' is just the kind of music that Enya does best!  Her beautiful voice will defintely match the intrigue, magic, and mystery of 'Lord of the Rings'. 'May It Be' is another beautiful song from Enya. Her voice is gorgeous and the lyrics are magical, just like 'Lord of the Rings'. The orchestration is just fantastic, no wonder 'May It Be' is the number #1 download on Amzon.com!  Enya's other song on this track 'The Council of Elrond' is pure magic.
