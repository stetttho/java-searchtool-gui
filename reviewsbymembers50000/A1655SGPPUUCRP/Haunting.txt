 This soundtrack will be remembered!  The music is so haunting, yet beautiful and peaceful.  This music is also extremely emotional and lets you visualize scenes from the film when listening to it.  I know everyone got sick of hearing 'My Heart Will Go On', but it really is a great song.  Remember the *first* time you heard it?  I know we almost all fell in love with it then.  James Horner did a great job on this dazzling soundtrack!
