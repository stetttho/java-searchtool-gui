 'Ever After' is one of the best adaptations I've ever seen!  The traditional Cinderella story was modified a bit, all the while adding entertaining side stories, wit, humor, and beauty.  Drew Barrymore shines in her finest performance ever!  The scenery and sets are so elegant and mystical, they make you really feel like you are there.  The story is so delicate and beautiful, it's really a masterpiece.  I was also very impressed with Anjelica Houston and Dougary Scott, three cheers for them! 'Ever After' is a charming adaptation of the classsic Cinderella story, a must see.
