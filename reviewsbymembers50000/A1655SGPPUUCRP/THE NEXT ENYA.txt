 Believe it or not Spaeth is right up there with the likes of Enya, Lorenna McKennit, and Secret Garden.  I don't understand why Spaeth hasn't been getting more recognition for his amazing music.  I'm impressed with Spaeth more than I've ever been with any other artist!  "Horizon" is yet another one of his beautiful pieces filled with emotion and beauty.  I can't say enough good things about Spaeth!  We should all try to support this thriving young artist by purchasing his stunning CD, "Cobalt Blue", or run the risk of not hearing more of his deeply stirring and spiritual music.
