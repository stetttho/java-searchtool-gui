 Howard Shore is sure making a name for himself with his work on "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy.  Shore came from virtual obscurity to become one of the most popular composers today.  "The Fellowship" and "The Two Towers" were both stunningly beautiful scores, earning Shore an Oscar.  Yet both scores were rather similar to each other, as if they belonged on a single CD.   Good news to all film score buffs, the "Return of the King" is quite different than the previous two scores.  Shore creates new themes (and uses some of our old favorites such as "The Fellowship" theme), a darker tone, uses diverse instruments, and expertly blends delicate vocals from Renee Fleming, Viggo Mortensen, Sir James Galaway, Ben del Maestro, and Billy Boyd into the music.  All of these elements combine flawlessly to make an emotionally powerful and involving symphony on such a grand and epic scale that it literally takes your breath away.  Listening to this music helps you to relive the wondrous film experience and, I warn you, it will bring tears to your eyes! Annie Lennox's "Into the West" at first seems out of place in a fantasy film, with a guitar strumming in the background.  Fortunately, it actually ends up working beautifully in the film when it plays during the credits.  The lyrics fit the film perfectly; I'm guessing that the song was, indeed, written for the film. Some of my personal favorites on this CD are "Hope and Memory", "The Steward of Gondor" (Billy Boyd's vocals are astounding), "The Return of the King", "The Grey Havens" and "Into the West", though all are simply divine!  Unlike most scores nowadays, you can actually listen to the whole CD all the way through without skipping a song because of the high caliber of the music.   Bottom line: the best score of 2003; a phenomenal achievement in cinema music!
