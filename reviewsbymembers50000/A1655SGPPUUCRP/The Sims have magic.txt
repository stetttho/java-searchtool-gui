 "The Sims Makin' Magic" expansion pack is by far the best addition to the world of The Sims since "Hot Date", which introduced the whole concept of leaving your Sim's house.  This game is bursting with tons of new game play options. First of all, your Sims can have magical powers now!  You can create spells and charms that can do everything from do the dishes to make your Sim a celebrity!  Once you perform a spell, it is unlocked in your new, very useful family spellbook.  There are tons of spells and you can travel to the all new Magic Town to make MagiCoins (needed to purchase certain magical ingredients), buy everything from Dragon Tears to Faerie Dust, perform, charm snakes, barter, duel, take rides in a funhouse, complete quests for vendors, and much more.  You can even adopt a dragon!  After a certain number of spells have been cast in your house, magical rewards begin appearing in your yard such as a beanstalk, crystals, and gnarled roots. Your Sims can even bake their own food now!  Nectars, pies, cakes; yummy!  There are also many new objects that can assist you in your culinary development.  There's the family cookbook (in addition to the family spellbook), a butter churner, honey maker, a baker's oven and nectar press.  You can now even grow grapes and elderberries in your garden and then make nectar out of them to either sell or store in your new nectar bar. In addition, there is of course, many new pieces of furniture, plants, NPC's (I love the new skeleton maid), interactions, floors, wallpapers and skins.  There's also a great option for those especially magical Sims; an opportunity to move into an old house in Magic Town!
