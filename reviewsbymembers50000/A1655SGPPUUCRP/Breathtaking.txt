 Hans Zimmer had a lot of pressure on him with the 'Pearl Harbor' score after composing the legendary Golden Globe winning score for 'Gladiator'. His work on the two 'Gladiator' soundtracks brought him critical acclaim and the 'Gladiator' soundtrack is now considered by many to be one of the best scores ever composed. Well, that certainly is a lot of pressure! Hans Zimmer does indeed live up to 'Gladiator' with this beatiful, heartbreaking and breathtaking score. From tender love themes such as '...And Then I Kissed Him' to the dramatic and pounding themes during the attack ('December 7th'), 'Pearl Harbor's' soundtrack triumphs in every possible way.  Faith Hill does a lovely job with the romantic 'There You'll Be'.  My only problem with this song is that it tries a little to hard to be 'Titanic's' 'My Heart Will Go On' by Celine Dion. My personal favorites on this soundtrack are 'Tennessee', 'Brothers',  '...And Then I Kissed Him', 'Attack', and 'Heart of a Volunteer'; though all of the pieces are excellent.  'Tennessee' is the emotional and reoccuring theme to 'Pearl Harbor'.  'Tennessee' reappears in 'Brothers', '...And Then I Kissed Him', 'I Will Come Back', and I believe it also occurs in 'Heart of a Volunteer'.  I absolutely love the dramatic 'Attack', which appears in the film when the Japanese are plotting their attach on Pearl Harbor.  The beat is absolutely addictive and you find yourself having it on repeat for a very long time...  'Attack' gives me a strong reminder of the 'Gladiator' soundtrack.  Some of Hans Zimmer's other notable pieces of work are two 'Gladiator' soundtracks, 'The Lion King', 'Hannibal', 'Driving Miss Daisy', 'As Good as it Gets', 'Rain Man', and 'Crimson Tide'.
