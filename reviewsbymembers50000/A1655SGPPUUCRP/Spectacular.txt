 'The Patriot' is fantastic, a truly great film. Heart-wreching and moving, but still packed with action, this movie is sure to keep all audiences entertained! Great acting by Mel Gibson and the young Heath Ledger. Mel is really an amazing actor. He can go from being a war hero in 'The Patriot' to be an egotistical jerk in the comedy 'What Women Want'! Heath Ledger was great, he fit his role perfectly. The sets, costumes, and historical information is excellent. The dialogue and script is smart, emotional, and suspenseful. One of the best movies of the year, excellent...
