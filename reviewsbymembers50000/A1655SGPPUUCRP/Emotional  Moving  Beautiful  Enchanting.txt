 Wow!  After 'Paint the Sky With Stars' I didn't think that Enya could get any better.  Well, she can!  'A Day Without Rain' is a beautiful mix of new deeply moving songs from Enya.  This a fantastic CD, the orchestration is unlike anything I've ever heard before.  The lyrics are so perfect, it makes you want to cry.  Enya's voice is light, sweet, beautiful, and haunting.  She is such a gifted singer.  Everything just goes together in this CD, I love it! Some of my personal favorites on 'A Day Without Rain' are; ~A Day Without Rain~  A beautiful mix of sounds and emotions. ~Wild Child~          Catchy with a great beat.  Love this song (one of my favorite songs!!!) ~Only Time~           The beautiful and emotional theme song   from the film 'Sweet November'.  This song is for everyone, even pop and rock fans will enjoy it.  Let me just say, I wanted to see 'Sweet November' after hearing this song! ~One By One~           Just adore this song!  Sweet and   meaningful.   ~Lazy Days~            Catchy and upbeat, this is the perfect song!  Lazy Days is also one of my favorite songs!  Perfect.
