 It's an unusual and wonderful thing when a book as magical as 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone' can have a sequel be just as good, if better than itself.  'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets' defintely live up to its predecessor!  JK Rowling is obviously one of the top authors out there right now, if not the best.  She is most defintely my favorite author right now!  Rowling produces another sweeping magical adventure in this second installment of the hit series.  The same wit, humor, description, suspense, and magic is still there.  I'm guessing that it will always be there after reading the fourth book and discovering it to be even better than the previous three.   The plot is great in this one!  I really love how the whole storyline has matured and become darker and more mysterious, generally becoming more fit for teenagers and adults.  Children can still enjoy the Harry Potter books, but adults and teenagers will simply love the new maturity in Rowling's writing!
