 This is a fantastic addition to The Sims and Livin Large!  Now you can have a REAL party!  The new party objects are awesome!  You can have themed parties and use the costume box to dressup everyone at your party.  There are just so many new neat things to do!  It's amazing how far 'The Sims' have come since the original.  I can't wait for the new expansion pack 'Hot Date' to come out in the fall.  That should be *really* cool!
