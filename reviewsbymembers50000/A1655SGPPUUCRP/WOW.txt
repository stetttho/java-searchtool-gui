 After hearing this CD, I decided that U2 is defintely one of my favorite music groups!  This is a really amzing CD, there is not one song that I skip over when I listen to it, which is a very rare thing!  All of these songs should be on the next 'Best of U2' CD!  The feeling in these songs and the thought-provoking lyrics make this a very heartfelt CD.  Every one of these songs has a meaning and a lesson to be learned.  A lot of these songs tie in with the events of September 11th, and are very comforting to listen to (New York, Grace, Peace on Earth, When I Look at the World).  The hit single 'Beautiful Day' soared on the charts way up to number one!  I really love this song.  It's very upbeat and uplifting.  Perfect to listen to if you're having a rotten day.  'Elevation' was also a hit.  It first received recognition after being in the summer blockbuster "Lara Croft: Tomb Raider" and appearing on the soundtrack in a remix form.  'Elevation' has really interesting instrumentation and awsome lyrics (as usual).  'Walk On' and 'Stuck In A Moment You Can't Get Out Of' offer honest lyrics and U2's insight on life, they're really great songs.  'Wild Honey', 'In a Little While', and 'Kite' are also excellent songs.  This by far U2's best CD to date, go on, buy it!
