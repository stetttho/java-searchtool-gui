 I love this game!  I've spent countless hours building my very own Roman Empire and downloading other people's empires from fan sites.  The graphics are great and you can learn a lot about the Roman Empire from playing this game.  The best part is you *really* get involved in your city, you control everything, unlike Sim City.  That's why I think Caesar III is much better than Sim City. You can start a career and work your way up to the title of Caesar or you play a scenario and not have to worry about being promoted.  In your career, you have two choices each time you get promoted (after the training levels).  You can take a dangerous province which has many invasions and battles.  Or you can choose the peaceful province which either has none or a very small amount of invasions.  Both are balanced out in difficulty, so the dangerous province is not necessarily the hardest province.  The peaceful usually has more obstacles and higher standings that need to be achieved in Rome in order for you to be promoted. A great game!  This game is such a bargain at it's extremely low price!
