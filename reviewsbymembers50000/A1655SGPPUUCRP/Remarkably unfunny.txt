 There's a reason only 8% of critics liked "Stealing Harvard" [...].Not only is it unfunny; it's also crude, boring, and downright stupid.  I know I know it's a comedy and therefore it's entitled to be brainless and gross, right?  Not so!  John (Jason Lee) turns to a life of crime to pay for his niece's tuition for her first year at, you guessed it, Harvard. Elaine (Leslie Mann), John's girlfriend, also wants him to pay $30,000 for the down payment on a house that she desperately wants.  The truly horrid Tom Green, for whom this whole mess of a movie seems to have been written for, plays John's dim-witted buddy, Walter P. 'Duff' Duffy.  Walter's lone purpose in life seems to be messing up John's own life.  And if the pitiful plot isn't enough of a deterrent for you, let me just alert you to what you have to look forward to.   A rich guy (Dennis Farina) has an unfortunate fetish that involves forcing men to dress up as his dead wife and then taking their picture.  We even get to see the photo album of his victims.  Yep, it's true.  The worst thing is, the filmmakers seem to pride themselves in this pathetic little bit of "comic genius" and show it over and over again throughout the film until even the teenage guys in the theater stopped laughing. Don't even get me started on Tom Green.  The man has no talent and what he does is not comedy.  It's stupidity.  Jerry Seinfeld is funny.  Bill Cosby is funny.  Sorry folks, Tom Green is not.
