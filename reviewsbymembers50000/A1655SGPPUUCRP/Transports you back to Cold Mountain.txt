 "Cold Mountain", an extraordinary piece of art in its own right, is greatly improved by its soundtrack.  This wonderful soundtrack really creates the atmosphere of the South during the Civil War era.  Fans of the accomplished Gabriel Yared (The English Patient, Message in a Bottle, Sylvia) will want to pick this one up as he composes the score.  Numerous songs are provided by Jack White, Oscar-nominee Alison Krauss (who sings my favorite songs on the album), Tim Eriksen, Riley Baugus, and more.  Though I must warn you, this soundtrack is definitely not for everyone.  Some of the songs work well with the film (11. Christmas Time Will Soon Be Over - Jack White), but definitely not on their own.  In addition, many songs on here are bluegrass, country, and folk; genres that are often parodied and ridiculed by mainstream music fans.  However, if you enjoyed any of the music in the film, this is the CD for you.  Unlike many other soundtracks which shall remain nameless, every single piece of music in the film is included on the soundtrack in its full and complete form. FAVORITES:  4.)
