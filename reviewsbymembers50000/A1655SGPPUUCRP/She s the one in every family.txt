 Joy, (Katie Holmes), the black sheep daughter of a dysfunctional family invites her cancer-diagnosed mother (Patricia Clarkson), father (Oliver Platt), siblings and grandma over to her apartment for a home-cooked Thanksgiving meal with her new boyfriend (Derek Luke). The family does not go willingly because of past conflicts with Joy.  This film follows two parallel narratives, one following the family's emotional journey on the way to Joy's, complete with numerous painful recollections of Joy's troubled childhood and the second is Joy's Odyssey getting the food for dinner cooked.  A basic premise, yes, but it is remarkable what writer and director Peter Hedges (About a Boy, What's Eating Gilbert Grape?) does with it.   "Pieces of April" delicately deals with the serious issues of cancer and broken families by adding subdued humor in a tasteful manner.  I appreciated how Hedges managed to make the movie humorous without cheapening the subject matter.  All in all, I was very touched by this film and it would definitely make a perfect holiday film for the family with the message of appreciating your loved ones. Katie Holmes was very impressive; this is, by far, her best performance to date.  Who knew the doe-eyed little teen queen from "Dawson's Creek" could pull of a darker, more emotionally-layered character so well?  The always-wonderful Patricia Clarkson is very passionate and powerful in her portrayal of a cancer patient and a pained mother.  She does not overplay her role, which easily could have come off quite cheesy in the hands of a lesser actress. The film's short running time of 75 minutes left me wanting more; a rare and wonderful occurrence considering most films nowadays tend to drag towards the end.
