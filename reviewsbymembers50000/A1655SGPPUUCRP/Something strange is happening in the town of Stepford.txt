 In this 1975 screen adaptation of Ira Levin's novel, Katherine Ross and Peter Masterson star as the married couple who trade the big-city hustle for the serenity of a small Connecticut suburb;  Stepford.  This is a town in which perennially chipper wives dutifully tend to their husbands' every need, feverishly clean their houses and swoon over their children. The new women in town (Ross and Paula Prentiss) try to discover what's behind this domestic bliss, and their confrontations with the various townsfolk are what make the movie such a creepy, truly spine-tingling blast.   "The Stepford Wives" provides audiences with some fairly interesting social commentary and cautionary feminist undertones while maintaining a satisfying level of suspense, and if nothing else, makes the pathetic 2004 remake look like precisely what it is; garbage.  After the disastrous remake, I really appreciated director Bryan Forbes' distinct story focus and his careful building of suspense.  It was wonderful to be able to watch an intelligent thriller that doesn't rely on special effects and blood for thrills and chills!
