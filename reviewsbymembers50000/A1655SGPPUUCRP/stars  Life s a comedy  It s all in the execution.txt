 The "Whole Nine Yards" is a mildly entertaining and passably enjoyable affair.  It neither exults nor repels, neither makes one laugh uncontrollably nor cringe; it just is.  There is nothing about this film that in any way distinguishes it from the sea of hit man/mob comedies floating around.    And let me say this, if it weren't for Bruce Willis and his wonderfully funny performance as the sensitive hit man, Jimmy `The Tulip' Tudeski, "The Whole Nine Yards" would've been a complete disaster.  Willis, even through some of the weaker scenes, elevates the performances of his costars (Matthew Perry, Amanda Peet, Natasha Henstridge, and Rosaana Arquette) and the overall quality of the film with his powerful star presence.  Honestly, I expected more from this film.  More laughs, to be precise.  When you have a film and its whole premise is ridiculous to begin with and with each scene gets progressively goofier, one expects some serious humor.  As things get sillier and sillier, the laughs slowly drift away until you are left stone-faced during the intended "hysterical moments" of the climax.  A disappointment.
