 Jamie Blanks' 2001 "Valentine" is a recycle bin of a ridiculous psycho-killer plot seemingly pasted together from several previously made films, predictable "boo!" moments, character stereotypes, bad jokes, stale dialogue, and unoriginal killings.  Not that I actually expected much from this movie, coming from Blanks, responsible for 1998's "Urban Legend" and starring a bevy of Hollywood C-listers including the dude from "Angel", David Boreanaz, Denise Richards, Marley Shelton, Jessica Capshaw, and Katharine Heigl.  In this horrendously bad faux-horror flick, we start off at Valentine's Day 1988 when a bunch of nasty girls make a poor geeky kid, Jeremy's, time at the V-Day school dance absolute hell for him through rejection and embarrassment.  Fast-forward to 2001 when the girls from the dance are now being tormented by a psycho-killer (obviously Jeremy) and slowly killed off in successively dumber and unoriginal ways.  The execution of this stupid-yet-still-had-some-potential-to-be-scary-script is simply awful.    Where is the suspense? Where is the empathy (or at least interest) for any of the characters?  Where is just an ounce of intelligence, people?!  I know that this is a slasher flick and you're supposed to suspend disbelief to a certain extent, but this pathetic plot soon degenerates into an utterly ridiculous mess that will insult your intelligence if you are anywhere over the age of ten.
