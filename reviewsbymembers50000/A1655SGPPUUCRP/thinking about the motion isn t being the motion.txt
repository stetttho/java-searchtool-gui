 Robert Altman's eloquent, alluring "The Company" is the kind of artsy film that leaves mainstream audiences somewhat nonplussed.  Its nonexistent storyline is, in fact, one of its greatest strengths if you are simply willing to be open to a film that does not fit the constraints of traditional cinema.  Altman's documentary-style direction shows us the whimsical world of ballet, a world utterly inaccessible to the majority of the population, as an emotional, meticulous art that yields breathtaking results.  We never learn much about the characters (Neve Campbell, Malcolm McDowell, and dancers of the actual Joffery Ballet of Chicago), yet this works in the film's favor as we are compelled to keep watching in hopes of learning a bit more about each of these fascinating people and exactly what compels them to sacrifice so much for their art.  Filmed with the complete cooperation of the Joffrey Ballet of Chicago from a script based on a story cocreated by former dancer for the National Ballet of Canada, Neve Campbell ("Scream"), and Barbara Turner, the film's "story" is really just a backdrop to the stunning dance numbers and rehearsals, as well as snippets of the dancer's lives, shot in a documentary-esque style.  Therefore, it never falls prey to dance clichs or melodramatic moments as it has the good sense not to get in the way of the astonishing look the viewer has into what it takes to be such a dancer.  I cannot say the same for such films as "Center Stage", which was a painfully earnest and ultimately ridiculous attempt to show us the "real world" of dancers.  As stated by Altman upon completion of this masterpiece, "The Company" is a heartfelt Valentine to the dancers who dedicate their lives to ballet as well as to the elegant art itself.
