 "Tears of the Sun" manages to successfully distinguish itself from the long line of recent military flicks.  To me, this film is everything that "Windtalkers", "Behind Enemy Lines", "Hart's War", and "Pearl Harbor" should have been.  "Tears of the Sun" is bursting with fine acting, stunning cinematography, a beautiful score, a moving script, and realistic combat that, mercifully, isn't mind numbing. When the democratic government of Nigeria collapses and the country is taken over by a brutal military dictator, Navy SEAL Lieutenant A.K. Waters (Bruce Willis), a fiercely loyal and hardened veteran is dispatched on a routine mission to retrieve Dr. Lena Kendricks from a Catholic mission in a remote village where she is caring for victims of the endless civil war.  However, when Waters and his elite squadron arrive, Dr. Kendricks refuses to leave unless he promises to help deliver the villagers to safety at the nearby border. If the villagers are left behind, they will be at the mercy of the massive rebel army. Waters is under strict orders from his commanding officer Captain Bill Rhodes (Tom Skerritt) to remain disengaged from the conflict.  As Waters and his men witness the brutality of the rebels first-hand, they are moved by Dr. Kendricks' cause and place their lives at risk by agreeing to escort the villagers on a perilous trek through the dense jungle to the safe ground just past the border. The reality of this serious issue in Nigeria is quite frightening.  When I was watching it, I sat back and thought "Wow.  This is really happening to people.  It's not made up."  The veracity of "Tears of the Sun" makes it significantly more affecting than it would have been had it been a fictional story.
