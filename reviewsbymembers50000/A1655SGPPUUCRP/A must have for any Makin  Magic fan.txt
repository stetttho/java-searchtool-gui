 "The Sims Makin' Magic: Prima's Official Strategy Guide" is a great buy!  It's chock full of useful tips and information and a must-have for any Makin' Magic fan.  The first half of the book is a basic recap of the original "Sims" for anyone who doesn't already know how to play ;-)  The second half details "Makin' Magic", everything from how to raise your dragon to spell lists to dueling tips.  I found several sections especially helpful... A chart listing all the spells/charms and cookbook recipes and their ingredients was especially time-saving as I no longer had to keep running back to the family spell book/cookbook to check ingredients.  The descriptions of each spell are also listed so you know what to expect and don't end up blowing your hard-earned MagiCoins on ingredients for a spell that doesn't even help you that much.   This strategy guide is also packed with tips on how to complete quests, how to win a duel, where to find rare ingredients, info on magical rewards, funhouse designs, how to hatch a friendly dragon, and a helpful general guide on how to begin your highly rewarding magical career.
