 "A Perfect Murder", inspired by the great Alfred Hitchcock's "Dial M for Murder", boasts a first-rate cast and not much else.  Directed by Andrew Davis ("The Fugitive", "Collateral Damage", "Holes"), based on the "Dial M for Murder" script by Frederick Knott,  written by Patrick Smith Kelly ("Don't Say a Word"), and starring Michael Douglas, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Viggo Mortensen, one just has to wonder how such talented people could churn out such a mess of a film. I had no empathy for any of the characters in this film.  I felt very detached from all the characters in this film and thus didn't really care what happened to any of them.  This eventually leads to boredom, as it did in my case. 	Boredom: another thing that plagues this film.  In a desperate attempt to make things more interesting, the writer throws in a bunch of twists and turns that failed to shock or interest me in the least.  Frankly, this film got downright tedious.  During some of the more "suspenseful" sequences, I often found myself checking my watch.  No good. 	The sole redeeming factor of this film is the trio of A-list actors we get to watch.  Michael Douglas is pitch-perfect as a scheming, greedy businessman.  The eternally elegant and ethereal Gwyneth Paltrow is mesmerizing to watch and brings a little bit of light into this otherwise dark film.  And then we have VIGGO (Mortensen, that is).  Incase you've been living under a rock for the past few years; we all know and love Mortensen as Aragorn in "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy.  Though Viggo had been in many films prior, this is probably the biggest role he'd ever had in a mainstream film at the time.  It's fascinating to watch the man who, in probably only a few months, would be on his way to New Zealand for the role of his career.
