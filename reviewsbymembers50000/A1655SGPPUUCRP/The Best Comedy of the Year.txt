 Simply put, 'Shrek' is an *amazing* movie.  It has wit, humor, heart, intergrity, morales, lessons, positive messages, etc.  'Shrek' is a very unique comedy as it is enjoyable to both young and old.  Kids get a fun and cute warped fairy tale, while adults get a deeper meaning about acceptance of one another.  The humor 'Shrek' is just fantastic!  'Shrek' mocks Disney movies, The Matrix, Riverdance, and more!  The mocking isn't malicious, just cute and *hilarious*! Cameron Diaz, Mike Myers, and Eddie Murphy are amazing!  Their voices really bring their special characters alive.  The animation is fantastic!  The soundtrack is upbeat and fun with a few songs by Smash Mouth.  The 'Shrek' soundtrack is defintely a personal favorite of mine.  The DVD is just spectacular with the most special features, games, and bonus materials that I have ever seen on a DVD!  Just fantastic!
