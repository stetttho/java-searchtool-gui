 What a fantastic original score!  You really get your money's worth as there are twenty-eight beautiful and amazing tracks.  From the beautiful and haunting 'Hooves' to the country themed 'Angus', this soundtrack works beautifully in step with the film.  Listening to this amazing score brings you back into the world of 'The Horse Whisperer'.  Thomas Newman is defintely a composer to watch for!  He has composed music for crtitically acclaimed films such as 'The Shawshank Redemption', 'The Green Mile', and 'Little Women'.  Among all of these amazing scores, I think 'The Horse Whisperer' to be the best.  My personal favorites are 'The Whisperers', 'There Was Snow', 'Runaway Meadow', 'The Rhythm of the Horse', 'Hooves', and 'End Title'.  It's hard to pick just a few favorites.  This score is really just amazing, you have to get it!  The film is one of the most moving and touching films I have ever seen, so you should see that as well and see how the score flows amazingly with the movie.
