 'Lara Croft: Tomb Raider' is defintely my favorite action film.  After seeing it twice in theaters, I decided that I had to get the movie novelization.  I really loved this book.  You get a little more description and more dialogue than in the movie.  The relationship between Lara and Alex West is explored a little more and there is a bit more action.  The novelization stays right with the movie, nothing is changed.  The colored pictures fom the movie in the middle of this book were a great bonus.  This is a fun and exciting read and if you loved 'Lara Croft: Tomb Raider' anywhere near the amount that I did, you'll be sure to love this book!  You will enjoy it even if you haven't seen the movie!
