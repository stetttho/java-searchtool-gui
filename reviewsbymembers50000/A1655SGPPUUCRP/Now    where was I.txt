 Christopher Nolan's "Memento" is a groundbreaking film that shocked audiences when it was featured at the Sundance film festival in 2001 and has since gone on to stun audiences worldwide.  For such an intriguing film, a good score was integral to create overall appeal and success. David Julyan has created a haunting and moody score for "Memento".  Being a film score buff, I noticed the amazing music during the opening credits and before I was even five minutes into the movie, I had already decided to purchase the soundtrack ASAP.  I was not disappointed. The soundtrack is very diverse; it features snippets of dialogue, songs written "for and inspired by the film", and the score.  The music helps to create the dream-like, uneasy atmosphere so essential to "Memento".
