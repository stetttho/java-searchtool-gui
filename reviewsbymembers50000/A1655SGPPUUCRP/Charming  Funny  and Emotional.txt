 Have you ever wondered what would of happened in your life if you had made different choices?  'The Family Man' centers around Jack Campbell (Nicolas Cage) a Wall Street mogulwho leads an empty and superficial life.  On Christmas Eve, he is presented with the oppurtunity to see what would of happened in his life if he had stayed with his college girlfriend, Kate. 'The Family Man' manages to be funny and sweet, but also very moving and thought provoking.  Nicolas Cage is excellent in this movie, as well as Tea Leoni.  They had great chemistry and were very convincing.  Cage was especially funny when adjusting to his new life of changing diapers and working at a tire outlet instead of living in his spotless New York apartment working on Wall Street. Anyone who has ever thought 'what if' (which is all of us) will enjoy this charming and sweet comedy.
