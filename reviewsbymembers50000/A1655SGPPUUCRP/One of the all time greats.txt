 As far as I am concerned, the best original scores ever written are 'Gladiator', 'Last of the Mohicans', 'Titanic', 'Star Wars', and of course, 'Braveheart'.  This breathtakingly celtic score is sure to capture your imagination and take you away to Scotland.  James Horner makes great use of bagpipes, harps, and some other folk instruments.  'Bravehearts' score has a wonderful natural feel to it, as if this music could have really been there during the story. James Horner is most well known for his Academy Award Winning score for the critically acclaimed 'Titanic'.  If you enjoyed the 'Titanic' score, you'll love this.  The same drama and emotion is present and you may be faintly reminded of the 'Titanic' score after hearing this.  Remember, 'Braveheart's' score came before 'Titanic's'! James Horner creates some absolutely stunning and memorable themes here which are reused throughout the score.  From the tender and emotional 'A Gift of Thistle' to the upbeat and dramatic 'The Battle of Stirling', James Horner manages to set the mood with his compositions.  These pieces are all abosolutely stunning, you won't find yourself skipping over any of them as you usually must do with scores!  I usually choose a few favorites when reviewing a score, but I find that I cannot with 'Braveheart's!  If you have not seen the film, YOU MUST!  And YOU MUST purchase this stunning piece of work, one of the finest scores ever!
