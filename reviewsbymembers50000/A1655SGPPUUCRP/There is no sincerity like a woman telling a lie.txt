 "Indiscreet" is a shockingly weak film considering the utter star power involved with this project.  You have legendary director Stanley Donen, the man behind such classics as "Singin' in the Rain", "Funny Face", and "Charade".  You have a jaw-dropping wardrobe of gorgeous evening gowns courtesy of Christian Dior.  You have Ingrid Bergman, one of Old-Hollywood's most beautiful, talented, and scandalous actresses.  And then you have the immortal Cary Grant; need I say more?  Simply put, "Indiscreet" should have been utterly fabulous.  Instead, it's utterly average.  Bergman plays Anne Kalman, a famous actress who falls utterly in love with a charming NATO diplomat, Philip Adams (Grant, of course), who also happens to be a married man.  And that's about it for the plot.  The true weakness of this film is indeed in its simplicity.  While simplicity is often the understated power of so many Old-Hollywood films, this is not one of them.  As Anna and Philip fall even more in love, I found myself just waiting for the expected "relationship killer" to happen that will separate the love-birds and thus  pave the way for the inevitable "I love you!" grand finale.  Though the romance is indeed charming and takes full advantage of the charms and chemistry of Bergman and Grant (my absolute favorite actor of all time), "Indiscreet" is, in the end, a standard romance with absolutely nothing that differentiates it from the scores of romances already out there.
