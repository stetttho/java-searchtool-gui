 Wow! The legendary John Williams does it again with this magical score to the instant classic film 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone'.  You hear this score and just know that it's John Williams, he's just such a wonderful composer, the best film composer out there in my opinion.  The music here is just so magical and sets the mood for the film perfectly.  One of the first things my friends and I said after seeing the movie was "Wow, that was a great soundtrack, we have to get it!".  Well, I had already purchased the soundtrack, as soon as it had become available infact.  I trusted John Williams enough to buy this soundtrack without hearing any of the music yet.  I was pleasantly surprised! John Williams's magical theme song (Prologue) reoccrs constantly in the score.  Often it is incorporated seamlessly into other tracks, making for a beautiful, magical, and highly original score.  My favorite track is defintely 'Prologue'.  I just can't get over that magical theme!  'Harry's Wondorous World, 'Christmas at Hogwarts', and 'Entry into the Great Hall and The Banquet' are also some of my favorites, but all of the tracks are wonderous!  With nineteen tracks on here, you get well worth your money!  The packaging is lovely and comes with a free poster of Harry and Hedwig, his owl.  There are other colorful and high-quality pictures in the booklet.  You get a free soundtrack collector's card with a chance to win Harry Potter items.  There is also a lovely little note from Chris Columbus in the booklet about magic, the film, and the score, which I just loved reading.  A must own!
