 "Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle" is one of the most boring, mind-numbing, dim-witted and utterly pointless films I've seen all year.  Being a fan of the first film, I was first in line to see it.  I left the theater thoroughly disappointed.  All the freshness, cuteness, and, shall I say, "funness" that made the original so likable is gone.  And what is with Demi Moore?  She had about 10 minutes screen time yet somehow managed to become the "main attraction".  The woman is just so horribly smug, arrogant and downright vain that it shows in her performance and therefore made her insufferable to watch.  Hey, maybe that's a good thing seeing as how she was playing the villain and all. Cameron, Lucy, and Drew are no longer charming and adorable as they were in the first film.  In "Full Throttle", they come off as obnoxious, slutty, and stupid.  I actually found myself rooting against the angels! :-O  Bill Murray does not reprise his role as Bosley and is instead replaced by Bernie Mac.  In my opinion, Murray's wit and lovable personality brought some much-needed humor to the original and without him; "Full Throttle" really lacks any actual humor.  In addition, the script/plot is silly and predictable, the action sequences are cartoonish and stale, and the special effects are tiresome.  The only positive thing I have to say about "Full Throttle" is that Justin Theroux has the most amazing six-pack I have ever seen.  Or was it an eight-pack?  A ten-pack maybe?
