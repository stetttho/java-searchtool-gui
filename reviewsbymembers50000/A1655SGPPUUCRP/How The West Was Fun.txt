 'Maverick' is by far the best western movie ever!  Fast paced, action packed, suspenseful, and funny (very funny), Maverick keeps you on your toes and leaves you screaming for more! Mel Gibson kicks butt (literally) as Bret Maverick, a handsome, slick and roguish card player trying to win enough money to enter the biggest card game of the year.  While trying to win some dough, he meets the scheming thief, Annabelle Bransworth (played by Jodie Foster).  I love Jodie Foster in this movie, I never knew she was such a comedian! 'Maverick' is a witty, charming, and hilarous western comedy.  A must-see.
