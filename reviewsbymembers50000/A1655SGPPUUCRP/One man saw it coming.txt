 Alex Proyas' "I, Robot" is an exhilarating, entertaining, fast-paced thriller starring the effortlessly charming Will Smith and the beautiful Bridget Moynahan ("The Recruit", "The Sum of All Fears").  The story is fairly preposterous, involving, you guessed it, robots and their attempt to take over the world.  And of course Smith's character, Detective Del Spooner, knows that these robots are evil and no one will believe him.  The script is based on Isaac Asimov's book of short stories and co-screenwriter Jeff Vintar's (along with Oscar-winner for "A Beautiful Mind", Akiva Goldsman) original script, "Hardwired".  In this world of 2035, robots have come to play a vital role in the lives of humans, doing everything from bartending to laundry for their "owners".  The world is simply teeming with them and their numbers are soon to increase with the largest shipment ever of robots, the NS-5's.  Even though they are programmed to be incapable of injuring humans or committing a crime according to "the three laws", Detective Spooner is convinced they are up to no good and even tackles a robot he believes to be robbing a woman when he is actually rushing her an inhaler.  The three laws are:    1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.  2. A robot must obey orders given to it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.  3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.  This is definitely a fun film that I enjoyed immensely.  The whodunit script will keep you guessing and on the edge of your seat right to the end.  If you're willing to suspend reality for a few hours and not think too hard about what you're watching, I think you'll really enjoy "I, Robot".
