 "Mean Girls" is an above-average high-school comedy; nothing more and nothing less.  SNL alumni Tina Fey provides a sharp, witty script that made critics and audiences alike roar with laughter.  Teen superstar Lindsay Lohan is fantastic and further proves to us that her delightful performance in "Freaky Friday" was no accident.    The cast is great and the humor is abundant, but I really felt that the script was way too standard for such an intriguing premise and lacking in all-out satire.  In addition, a lot of the humor was definitely aimed towards the pre-teen crowd and was way too silly for a film that heavily depended on satire.  I mean come on, how many farts and gay jokes must we endure?  This low-brow humor really surprised me, coming from Tina Fey and all.  I felt that it really lowered the overall effect of the film.  It's definitely not a good idea to combine satire and slapstick humor; a film is either one or the other, not both.  And what was with the ridiculously corny ending where everyone makes nice and are happy?  All in all, "Mean Girls" is an enjoyable 90-minute flick.  It certainly has its moments, but I came away feeling let down that a film with such great potential and promise didn't quite fulfill it.
