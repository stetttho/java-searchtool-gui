 'Age of Empires II' has been named on many many PC top ten lists, and for good reason too!  Simply put, this is just an amazingly fun and interesting game.  'Age of Empires II' will take your breath away, it's a must own for any PC gamer, or even someone who's never played a computer game!  Anyone will love this. There are many levels of difficulty, which is excellent.  Once you master one level or strategy, you can change the settings (and certain characteristics in the game, such as what type of terrain you get, which makes all the difference).  You must manage any one of thirteen civilizations, ranging from the Turks to the Vikings.  Each civilization has it's own unique benefits and drawbacks and their own style of buildings and armies.  You collect natural resources, advance through ages by meeting requirments in your stockpiles, create workers, explore, conquer, build an army, make allies, engage in trade and battle, and so much more!  The graphics are some of the best I've seen in a strategy game and always keep you involved with the game.  You can also choose certain types of games.  A campaign game involves a certain sort of goal (like escorting Joan of Arc to the king).  Their is a death match game, where you duke it out with other empires, and so much more.  There is a delightful training game which involves the famous William Wallace teaching you the basics of the game, I found this to be extremely helpful.
