 This is a great book!  Very different from all of those superficial magazines that don't give you any real advice on living your life.  'Soul Searching' is well written, well researched, well organized, has cute drawings, and gives great advice.   'Soul Searching' has great variety in its subjects.  Sarah Stillman talks about karma, philosophy, religion, creating sacred spaces, feng shui, aromatherapy, yoga and massaging, spa treatments, relaxing and meditating, visualization, journal writing, dream interpretation, hobbies/passions, etc.   Any young girl can benefit from this refreshing book on how to find your soul.
