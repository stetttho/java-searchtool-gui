 Director Peter Webber makes his film debut with "Girl with a Pearl Earring", a lush and visually beautiful film about famous Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer's inspiration and creation of one of the most celebrated paintings of all time.  Featuring an inspired cast of Scarlet Johansson, who plays Griet, the servant girl whom inspires Vermeer to paint his masterpiece, Colin Firth as Vermeer, Tom Wilkinson, and Cillian Murphy and showcasing some of the most astounding cinematography and art direction I've ever scene on screen, this is truly a film to behold.  It is visually stunning, virtually a painting in movement and is simply breathtaking to behold.  The atmosphere is so perfectly created by the lavish sets, intricate costumes, enchanting lighting, striking cinematography, and beautiful music that one cannot help but be impressed by the amount of effort that went into creating this piece of art. Unfortunately, "Girl with a Pearl Earring" suffers from a severe case of "high on style, low on substance syndrome".  All in all, not much happens in this film and along with the sparse dialogue, it soon becomes difficult for audiences to stay interested; despite the abundant visual radiance of the film.  The story simply lacks a driving force that would have kept it flowing and viewers interested.  Therefore, it, regrettably, plods along at an excruciatingly dull pace.
