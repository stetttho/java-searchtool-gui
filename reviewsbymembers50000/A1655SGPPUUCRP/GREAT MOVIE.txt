 Did you know that this movie is based on a *true* story?  This terrible storm really happened to theses people, which makes 'The Perfect Storm' unique and emotional.  Not many movies based on a true story are this good.  I left the theater crying for the people that this happened to.  It made me feel refreshed to see this movie and learn about the fishermen and what happened to them. First of all, George Clooney and Mark Whalberg were excellent, as well as the rest of the cast!  It must be hard work to act like one of those fishermen.  Actually, one of my favorite parts of the movie was seeing how these fishermen lived their lives and acted around each other, it was fascinating! The special effects were pretty impressive!  The storm recreation was so good that it made you feel like you were really in the storm and experiencing what they experienced.  That is defintely the sign of a well made film. The DVD extras are great!  'The Perfect Storm' is an essential to any DVD collection.  You won't be wasting your time or your money if you buy this DVD!
