 This was one of the best adaptations ever for a Jane Austen novel!  This movie is much different than the book, but still follows the same storyline and character relationships.  The main character, Fanny Price is much different than the book.  In the book she is quiet, polite, and shy.  In the movie she is strong, independent, and spiritied.  I personally think that the movie's personality for Fanny fits her better. This movie is charming and elegant and still managed to throw in tons of humor!  I love it when a movie has the ability to do that!  This movie boasts a strong cast of young actors before they were well known including Frances O' Connor (Artificial Inteliigence), Alessandro Nivola (Jurassic Park III), and Jonny Lee Miller (Dracula 2000).  There are many other enjoyable young stars in this movie that bring heat to the screen.  Excellent!
