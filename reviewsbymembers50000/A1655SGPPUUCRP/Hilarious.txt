 This is a refreshing, cute, and funny family comedy which triuphs as a true original. Grard Depardieu is hilarious as the clueless French father of a rebellious 14 year old brat. I never knew he was so good at comedy! Katherine Heigl is excellent in the role of his daughter, but acts and looks like a 17 year old, not a 14 year old, which is why this movie is so funny!
