 From an upbeat song like 'Lady Marmalade' to a peaceful and quiet song like 'One Day I'll Fly Away', this CD *ROCKS*!!!  The songs are sooo original, I've never heard anything like them.  They all have really good beats and I'm VERY impressed with Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman's singing talents.  If you're looking for something fresh and unique, buy the 'Moulin Rouge' soundtrack (and see the movie, lol)!!!!
