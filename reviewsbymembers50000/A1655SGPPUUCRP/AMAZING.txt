 This is defintely the best Enya CD yet, all the songs are beautiful and quality songs (a rarity in CD's today).  Each song if new and fresh.  I usually would pick my favorite song and talk about it here, but I can't, I love all the songs!  You will not be disappointed if you buy this CD!  If you are new to Enya, I suggest you buy this CD first because it contains her very best work from previous albums.  If you are already a fan of Enya, buy this CD!  You will be pleased to find all of your favorite songs on one CD.  Enya continues to amaze and dazzle me with her music!
