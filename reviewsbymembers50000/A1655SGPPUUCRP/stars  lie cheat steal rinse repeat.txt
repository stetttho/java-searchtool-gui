 I first must say how thoroughly disappointed I was with "Matchstick Men".  It could've been great; with Ridley Scott (!!!) directing and Nicolas Cage, Same Rockwell, and Alison Lohman starring in a film about the always-entertaining topic of crime, "What could possibly go wrong?" I thought.  A lot.  Ridley Scott is an amazing director, yes; he directed my favorite movie of all time, "Gladiator".  However, when it comes to movies about humans plus a relatively wordy script, minus high-voltage special effects and sets, Scott seems absolutely at a loss.  His clumsy, impersonal direction never lets us truly identify with the characters or their plight.  And maybe that's not such a bad thing since these flimsy, paper-thin characters adapted from Eric Garcia's novel by Nicholas and Ted Griffin are hardly worth getting to know.    It is through no fault of the actors, though.  Cage, who is, for me, the sole reason to watch this movie, is delightful, funny, and charming as an obsessive-compulsive con man whose relentless housecleaning is put to a rest only by his reunion with his long-lost teenage daughter (Lohman).  I really enjoyed watching Cage throw himself into this role and truly become his character.  Cage provides "Matchstick Men" with some much-needed humor and a bit of spark that is surprisingly lacking for a Scott-directed crime-caper that, in the end, commits the ultimate crime of being boring.
