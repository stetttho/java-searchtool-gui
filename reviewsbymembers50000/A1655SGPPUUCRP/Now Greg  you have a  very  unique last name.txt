 "Meet the Parents" is a surprisingly funny film bolstered into the top ranks of modern comedies by the two standout performances of Robert De Niro and Ben Stiller.  There's never a dull moment in this laugh-a-minute comedy from director Jay Roach of the "Austin Power's" franchise and screenwriters Greg Glienna and Mary Ruth Clarke, who also wrote and starred in the 1992 short film of the same name. Gaylord `Greg' Focker (just you try and say that last name without smiling), played to the max by the comic talents of Stiller, is head-over-heels in love with his girlfriend, Pam (Teri Polo).  After a failed attempt at proposing marriage, Greg learns that if he intends to marry Pam, it is important to first OK the proposition with her father, Jack (De Niro).  Pam's sister's wedding seems a perfect time to talk with Jack, so he accompanies Pam back to her parent's house.  What ensues is a fantastically funny film, basically about the trouble and misunderstandings Greg endures for his love for Pam. The awkward dynamics between De Niro and Stiller's characters make for the most side-splitting moments of the film.  Upon having first viewed this movie several years ago, I can still clearly remember Greg's notions of milking cats, Jack's "poetry reading", the urn, the polygraph, Greg's prayer, the Speedo, Focker...  Those who have already seen "Meet the Parents", (and who hasn't?) are probably fondly reminiscing upon these positively hysterical scenes right now. "Meet the Parents" certainly isn't cinematic art, folks.  The screenplay is predictable, at best.  And maybe some of the jokes didn't strike a chord with every audience member.  However, this film greatly succeeds at what it is; a comedy.  I will most certainly be first in line to see "Meet the Fockers", slated for release in December of 2004.
