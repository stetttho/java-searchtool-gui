 "Johnny English" is a surprisingly funny spy-spoof starring the hysterical British comedian Rowan Atkinson (aka Mr. Bean).  Being a fan of the British TV series "Bean", I was curious to see if Atkinson could break out of his role as the inherently childish Mr. Bean and carry an actual full-length film with his antics.  I'm happy to report that yes, indeed he can!   Yes, the plot is stupid, but it provides Atkinson with plenty of opportunities to work his magic.  Unlike many "comedies" nowadays, most of the jokes in this film are actually FUNNY and don't cause you and your movie companion to look quizzically at each other, wondering whether or not THAT was actually supposed to be funny .  Some moments truly made me breakout into hysterical laughter.  Let's see, there's a tie getting caught in a sushi bar roll around, Johnny mistakenly taking the staff of a hospital hostage, the Archbishop of Canterbury's rear end being exposed on national TV, Johnny (again mistakenly) disrupting a funeral service and dancing atop a coffin which he believes contain the crown jewels, the French jokes...  And that's not all ;-) If you're looking for a good time at the movies, or rather a family-friendlier version of Austin Powers, try "Johnny English".  It's relatively inoffensive, funny, and highly entertaining!
