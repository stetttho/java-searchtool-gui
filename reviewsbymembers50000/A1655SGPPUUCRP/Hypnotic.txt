 'The Beach' soundtrack is one of my favorite soundtracks ever!  I'm a movie soundtrack and score collector and let me tell you, I've never heard anything like this before!  After hearing that the song 'Spinning Away' by Sugar Ray was on this CD, I decided to buy it; I wasn't expecting much from the rest of the CD.  Was I ever happy with what I got!  All of the songs on here are amazing, I never skip over any of them.  The songs all have a certain feeling to them, a certain style.  Kind of exotic and foreign; and very unique.  It's really amazing, you have to hear it to believe it!  The songs are all so intriguing and mysterious sounding, you almost feel hypnotized by them!  I put this CD on in the car the other day and everyone was like, "Wow!  What is this?"  Impressive. *~Snakeblood~ Love this one.  Very energetic and mysterious. ~Pure Shores~ Nice, great lyrics. **~Porcelain~ Moby's best song and one of my favorite songs ever!  Has a great muggy feeling.
