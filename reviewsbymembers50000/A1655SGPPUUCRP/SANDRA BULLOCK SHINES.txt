 This movie is funny, smart, and well acted.  Sandra Bullock is one of my favorite actresses, she just has this likability that's hard to resist, lol.  Even though this movie has a lot of humor, it gives you a serious glance inside the life of an alcholic.  I loved the acting, the story, and the smart dialogue.  See this movie, it rocks!!
