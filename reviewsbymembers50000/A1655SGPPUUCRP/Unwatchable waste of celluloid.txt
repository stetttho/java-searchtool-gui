 What a mess this film is!  I honestly cannot think of one positive thing to say about "Black Knight".  Martin Lawrence, who can be amusing at times in other films (...), comes off here as obnoxious, crass, and desperate for laughs.  The screenplay appears to have been written for the sole purpose of allowing Lawrence the maximum amount of time to act like an idiot.   The premise of the story had potential.  Young, stupid man from 21st century is transported back to medieval times and must deal with culture shock and different way of life before finding a way to get back home.  A familiar premise, yes, but there could have been some funny moments, at least enough to make "Black Knight" watchable.   However, with Lawrence at the helm, this film takes a nosedive into rude, crude, uninspired humor.  As usual, Lawrence focuses on racial humor and tired sexual jokes to garner laughs (he got none from me), making "Black Knight" an unwatchable waste of celluloid.
