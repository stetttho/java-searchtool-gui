 This is a beautiful soundtrack with a great variety of music with a celtic flavor.  The songs are are all very emotionally moving and quite mysterious, like the movie.  This music has the power to take you back to the Arthurian time and relive the experience. 'The Mystic's Dream' by Loreena McKennitt was a great addition to this soundtrack.  She has such a lovely voice!  'I Will Remember You Still' by Aeone was also quite nice.  Overall, this soundtrack was a magical experience for me and will be for you too.
