 "Center Stage" tries desperately to be an entertaining, insightful look into the world of ballet dancers, but fails miserably.  The acting by almost all of the actors is wooden and laughably bad.  The dialogue is ridiculous without an ounce of believability.  The dance sequences, which, if well-done, could have made this film so much more enjoyable, were dull and overly flashy. As for the story, think of every clich you've ever associated with the dance world and I guarantee you'll find it in this movie.  Let's see, we have the Young, Beautiful Dancer in awe of the big city who falls in love with a hot star dancer.  Then we have the Arrogant Girl ("I am the best goddamn dancer in the American Ballet Academy. Who the hell are you? Nobody") with an eating disorder and problems with her mother ("It's your dream... and it means more to you than it ever did to me").  And then there is the Rebellious Dancer with an attitude who refuses to conform to her instructor's direction.  Lastly, of course, we have the Cute, Thoughtful Male Dancer whom Young Beautiful Dancer is secretly in love with.  Yeah, okay.  If this sounds interesting to you, you may enjoy this trite little soap opera set against the glamorized backdrop of the American Ballet Academy in NYC.
