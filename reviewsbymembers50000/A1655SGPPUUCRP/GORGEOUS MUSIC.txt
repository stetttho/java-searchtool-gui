 I abosolutelt loved the movie, and I love this soundtrack!  The songs are all so peaceful and well orchestrated.  I can't really explain how beautiful this music is!  I'll just say that if you liked the movie, you'll like this soundtrack.  Or even if you didn't like the movie (how could you?), you will like this!
