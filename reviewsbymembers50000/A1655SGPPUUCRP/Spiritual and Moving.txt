 Wow, where did Spaeth come from?  I'd never heard of him before seeing this download available on Amazon.  "Celtic Legend (Tribute to 'Lord of the Rings')" feels as though it belongs in the "Lord of the Rings" soundtrack.  The melodies are as beautiful and touching as any top New Age artist (Enya)!  "Celtic Legend" also reminds me of James Horner's score for "Braveheart" only because of the stunning piano work and dramatic themes.  I cannot wait to purchase Spaeth's CD, "Cobalt Blue".  This is an artist to watch for!
