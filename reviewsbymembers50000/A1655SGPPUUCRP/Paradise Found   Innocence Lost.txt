 "Trust me, it's paradise. This is where the hungry come to feed. From mine it's a generation that's circles the globe and searches something we haven't tried before. So never refuse an invitation, never resist the unfamiliar, never fail to be polite and never outstay the welcome. Just keep your mind and suck in the experience. And if it hurts, it's probably worth it."  --Richard in "The Beach"   	Danny Boyle's electrifying, seductive, adrenaline-laced thriller "The Beach", based on Alex Garland's smash-hit 1998 novel of the same name, is a truly fascinating and exotic film.  Though considerably different than the book, meaning that much of Garland's message (think "Heart of Darkness", "The Lord of the Flies", and "Apocalypse Now") is left out here in favor of a more "sexy" storyline, the alterations work on the screen.  The audience, unless they've read the book, won't know what they're missing and will take the movie for what it is; an intense, tantalizing thriller starring the perfectly cast (and perfectly gorgeous) Leonardo DiCaprio with a killer soundtrack and breathtaking cinematography.  Though I have read the book and consider it to be amongst my favorites, I appreciated the film for what it was.  The themes so prevalent in the book regarding man's descent into insanity through isolation and what one will do to protect their utopia; are hinted at.  However, in the end, a much less satisfying explanation is thrown at us, making "The Beach" not nearly as potent or disturbing as the ingenious novel.
