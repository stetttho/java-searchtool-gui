 ...and then the knife whistling past her ear. . . " At the ripe old age of 38, Audrey Hepburn proved that she had aged like fine wine in Terrence Young's "Wait Until Dark", for which she earned her fifth, and last, Oscar nomination.  Despite obviously being based on the long-running Broadway play; as the majority of the story takes place in an apartment and there are few characters; it translates surprisingly well onto screen and is remarkably intriguing and suspenseful.  Alan Arkin, who plays one of the vilest villains of 60's cinema, Richard Crenna, and Efrem Zimbalist Jr. make up the stellar supporting cast and all turn in excellent performances. The sheer terror "Wait Until Dark" inflicts upon its audience comes from the filmmakers ability to place us in Suzy's shoes.  The very idea of being blind and trapped in an apartment and horribly alone even though you are in one of the most densely populated areas of the world, just plains scares me.  The nail-biting climax has some truly classic moments in it (who knew Alan Arkin was such a gymnast?) and will stick with you long after the film is over. As always, Audrey is simply perfection.  Charming and beautiful even in the most unflattering situations, she yet again proves her star power.  The constant distress and anguish Audrey portrays onscreen is achingly real, and unfortunately, not very far from the truth.  She was suffering from anorexia and marriage troubles with the producer of the film, Mel Ferrer, throughout the entire shoot.  One can only imagine how draining it must have been for her to be required to be screaming and crying the whole shoot while dealing with these problems.  Her Oscar nomination was most certainly deserved!
