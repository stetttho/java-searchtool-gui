 This is an excellent album with a great variety of beautiful and spiritual songs.  Enya is the best New Age artist out there!  I would of given it five stars, but considering her music now (which is AMAZING), this album isn't quite as good, which is fine!  My personal favorites from this album are Cursum Perficio, Storms in Africa, and Orinoco Flow.  This is quite an impressive array of music, and to think that this was only her second one!  WOW!  That shows talent!  Make sure to check out her newest CD, 'A Day Without Rain', it's beautiful.
