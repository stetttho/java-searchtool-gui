 If I need my mood uplifted, I go staright to my 'Bring It On' CD.  All the music is very bouncy and cheerful.  There is a great variety of songs by a number of different artists which makes this soundtrack interesting and fun. The smash hit 'Mickey' by B*Witched is defintely my favorite, it's really refreshing and perky.  A few other notable songs on this track are 'As If' by Blaque, 'See Ya' by Atomic Kitten, and 'Anywhere USA' by P.Y.T.
