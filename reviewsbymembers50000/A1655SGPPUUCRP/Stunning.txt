 "Black Hawk Down" boasts one of the most unique and emotionally stirring soundtracks/scores of the year.  Ridley Scott collaborates yet again with Hans Zimmer to produce a score to match even Zimmer's legendary "Gladiator"!  I've never heard music like this before!  Zimmer blends African vocals and instruments along with modern techno beats to create some stunning work.    Hans Zimmer quote: "I wanted the music to portray two tribes.  One was a techno tribe, which is America.  They have all the technology.  The other tribe is ethnic instruments, which is the Somali world.  These two tribes collide, and music is what shows the gulf between the two cultures." I totally agree with this statement.  While listening to this score, I could visualize the Americans and Somalis colliding; it's a very powerful experience.  Zimmer's work brings emotion and feeling into a score written for a film about war, which is amazing!   Hans Zimmer quote: "Black Hawk Down is not a score about the patriotism or war or its bloodshed.  It is about the bond that war creates in the men who are swept up in it." Hans Zimmer pegged my feelings on this score exactly with that quote.  Note: the quotes from Hans Zimmer are all included in the booklet with the CD. I also feel a need to mention #11 Gortoz a Ran - J'Attends, performed by Denez Prignet and Lisa Gerrard.  it is quite simply one of the most moving pieces of music that I've ever heard!  It beautifully blends Prignet's and Gerrard's voices together with some beautiful instrumentation in the background.  It sends shivers up my spine.  Whenever I listen to it, I feel as though I'm looking up at the stars, it's amazing.
