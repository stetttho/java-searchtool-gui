 There's really not too much to say about this movie.  It's extremely funny and enjoyable to both men and women.  I liked how the women got to kick butt this time instead of the men.  Very 'Girl Power' oriented movie.  This movie had a cool plot, good effects, great fight sequences, good music, humor, and great acting by Cameron Diaz, Lucy Liu, Drew Barrymore, and Bill Murray.  This DVD also had tons of great extras.  Three cheers for 'Charlie's Angels'!!
