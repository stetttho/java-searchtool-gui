 The "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" Movie Poster Book is an excellent addition to any Harry Potter fan's collection.  The posters are high quality; slighltly glossy, nicely sized, and has a clean and crisp finish to the photos.  Many of the posters are collages, which I really liked because they are done in such a nice way.  My entire household (that would be three younger sisters and two parents) all love Harry Potter, so of course we all ran out to get our own copies!  I suggest saving this booklet (or buying two, the price is great), because it will defintely become more valuable as the years go on since Harry Potter is destined to be popular years from now!
