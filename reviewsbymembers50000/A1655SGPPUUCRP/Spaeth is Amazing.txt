 If you haven't already, download Spaeth's other two songs, "Celtic Legend" and "Horizon".  Oh yes, don't forget to purchase his absolutely stunning CD, "Cobalt Blue", which measures of to the likes of top New Age/Easy Listening artists like Enya, Loreena McKennit, Clannad, and Secret Garden!  Don't believe me?  Download this song and see for yourself!  "Unity" (and the rest of Spaeth's music) are simply some of the most dramatic, spiritual, deep, and moving pieces of music I've ever heard!
