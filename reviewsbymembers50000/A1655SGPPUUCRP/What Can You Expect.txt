 Well, I didn't go into this movie with high expectations, which is udnerstandable considereing the pathetic plot.  I left wondering why I'd even wasted my time on this piece of garbage.  'Josie and the Pussycats' resembles the Spice Girls music flick with a similar plot 'Spiceworld'.  Both movies are dumb, dim-witted, badly acted, and follow a weak script.  It's a shame, Rachel Leigh-Cook, Tara Reid, and Alan Cummings are fantastic actors.  They should be embarassed to have appeared in something like this!   'Josie and the Pussycats' is obviously geared towards younger kids, so maybe I wasn't suppposed to like it, but I at leats should have enjoyed SOME of it!  My eight year old sister and her friends love this movie, so I recommend it for anyone under the age of nine years. I'm a movie lover, so it's hard for me to truly dislike a movie.  Now it's saying something when I say that I hated this movie!  The one star is for the great music!  Too bad it was wasted on a movie ...[like] this.
