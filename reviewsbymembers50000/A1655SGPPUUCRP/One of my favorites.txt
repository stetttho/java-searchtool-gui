 'American Beauty' has the most involving, original and moving score of the year! Thomas Newman, the composer of scores for such films as 'The Horse Whisperer', 'The Shawshank Redemption', 'In the Bedroom', 'Little Women' and 'The Green Mile' does it again with this score; the likes of which you've never heard before! When was the last time you heard instruments such as tablas, detuned mandolins, bird calls, dulcimers, ukuleles, banjos, etc all blended together flawlessly to form some breathtaking pieces of music?  Even if you have not seen the film 'American Beauty', you will appreciate the subtle beauty of this score.  The themes are haunting and memorable.  I find myself unable to choose favorites on this score, all of the pieces are so amazing!  "Dead Already" (the main theme) is often reused in later pieces, soemtimes in subtle ways, sometimes  in apparent ways.  Many of these pieces are rather dream like, almost as if they came from a dream.
