 especially in the aftenoon..."  I began watching "Love in the Afternoon" with the intent of watching only half of it that night and then finishing the rest the next morning.  At two hours and ten minutes, I felt that would be simply too much schmaltzy romance for one night.  So I pressed play.  A half hour passed.  Then another.  And another. And another.  And then the painstakingly gorgeous final ten minutes that will be ingrained in any true romantic's memory forever.    I was so incredibly enchanted by this delightful bit of old-fashioned romance.  This is a love story that, at least for me, has stood the test of time.  The bittersweet beauty of this love story rang so true with me.  I was utterly astounded that I found myself relating to a love story that was intended to have taken place nearly fifty years ago in Paris.  The essence of love has obviously not changed over the years, no matter how drastically the world we inhabit has changed.  Billy Wilder, the man behind such classics as "Sabrina", "Some Like it Hot", "Sunset Boulevard", and "The Seven Year Itch", directed and co-wrote this timeless romance.  Starring two of Old Hollywood's greatest stars, Audrey Hepburn and Gary Cooper, this film is flawless.  It is marvelously filmed, contains a bounty of witty dialogue, and, most importantly, at its core is a surprisingly relatable and realistic romance that is perfectly set-up, executed, and finished in true glorious Old-Hollywood fashion.  "Love in the Afternoon" is not to be missed by anyone looking for a romance that really "gets" what real love is and realistically depicts the pain and joy of it all.
