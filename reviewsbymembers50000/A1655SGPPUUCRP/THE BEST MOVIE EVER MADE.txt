 This is my absolute favorite movie of all time!!  This movie is NOT just a stupid action movie, it is MUCH MUCH more!!  The plot, acting, script, music, scenery, effects, directing, etc were all the BEST that I have ever seen!!  I bought the soundtrack (the music is AMAZING!!) and the DVD after I saw it for the first time at home with my dad.  I had no idea that a movie could be this good!!  Russell Crowe is my **FAVORITE** actor and he does a magnificent job in this film!!
