 There's no question about it, 'Say It Isn't So" is the worst film of the year.  Maybe even of the decade!  This film is so uninspired and pathetic.  It's not funny either.  Most of the humor is so repulsive it would only be funny to a few horny teenage boys.   The characters are MISERABLE.  You end up hating them instead of emphasizing with them.  There are many scenes where the director is obviously trying to convey some emotion and feeling, but you hate the characters so much that you end up cheering.  Oh, and forget about character development, there's absolutely none to be found. Believe it or not, "Say It Isn't So" is plain old boring most of the time (yes, even with Heather Graham prancing around in hip huggers and bossom baring tanks).  Chris Klein talks as though he's on drugs most of the time (who knows, that may have been on purpose) and therefore says his lines with such a monotonous tone that you want to scream!  The plot is so boring and NEVER EVER motivates you or excites you in ANY way.  You end up not caring what happens to the characters. Another thing that really bugged me about this movie were the quick jumps between events.  For example, Klein's character is shipped off to Mexico on a plane while he is unconscious.  The next time you see Klein he is back in America wearing a sombrero.  How does he get back??!!  The director doesn't even bother to show us.  I'm guess that at this point in the film he'd just about given up.
