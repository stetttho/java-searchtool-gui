 Actually, this is one of my favorite books!  Don't be scared off by the length of this one, it's all for the better (and don't rush this book, or you'll miss things!).  This book went into such detail (not pointless detail), I feel like I know Harry a lot better now.  The plot was EXCELLENT and suspenseful, I can't wait until they turn this one into a movie, hehe.  I must say that little kids might not enjoy this one as much as teenagers, probably because this book deals with more sinister elements than the previous three (death, betrayal, violence, etc).  My 10 year old sister read this book and she didn't like it as much as I did.  She still liked it ofcourse, but I LOVED it!  Can't wait for #5!
