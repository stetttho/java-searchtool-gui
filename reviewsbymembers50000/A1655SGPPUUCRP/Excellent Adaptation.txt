 I love Jane Austen and her time period, so of course I loved this movie!  The sets, costumes, acting, music, and story are all beautiful and enchanting!  This movie is a timeless love story and will be remembered for generations to come.  Kate Winslet and Emma Thompson were perfect for their roles, I was very impressed.
