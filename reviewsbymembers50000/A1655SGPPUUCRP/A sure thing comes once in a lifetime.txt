 but the real thing lasts forever."  Rob Reiner's classic 1985 teen comedy, "The Sure Thing", features one of John Cusack's first starring roles as Gib Gibson, an early performance by the very young and beautiful Daphne Zuniga as Alison Bradbury, and a bizarre appearance by Tim Robbins in one of his first films as well.  Though this is a movie of firsts for its soon-to-be-famous cast, the story is not particulary original nor inventive.  In fact, it is downright predictable.  Within the first five minutes, you will know exactly how things are going to end up.  Yet the beauty of this film is the sweet, funny, romantic, and old-fashioned ride that it takes in order to bring you to that oh-so-predictable ending.    This is a film that has exquisitely stood the test of time.  As a matter of fact, if you hold it up to the majority of romantic comedies churned out by Hollywood during the 90's and onwards, one will find that this is a truly charming film.  Modern romantic comedy hits such as "She's All That", "Down to You", "10 Things I Hate About You", "Head Over Heels", and "Never Been Kissed" provide excellent juxtaposition to the near genre-perfection of this film.  Alison: What are you doing? Gib: I'm going to bed. Alison: Not with me you're not. Gib: I'm not going to bed with you, I'm going to bed in a bed you happen to be in also.
