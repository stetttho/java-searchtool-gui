 Great effects and fight sequences, but a silly and unbelievable plot.  Tom Cruise was cool and he had great chemistry with Thandie Newton.  I was even more impressed after watching the making of 'MI2'.  WOW, they put DAYS into some small scenes just to get perfect effects.  I was also shocked that TOM CRUISE did almost all of his own stunts, which are VERY dangerous (walking through fire, having a knife a half-inch from his eye, falling from the top of a very high platform and landing four inches from the camera, doing risky motorcycle stunts, etc).  I  must admit that I disliked this movie the first time I saw it, but after seeing it again, I actually liked it!  ALMOST 4 STARS
