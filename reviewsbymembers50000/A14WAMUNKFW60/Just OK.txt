 I bought this system for my newborn daughter because....like other reviewers have mentioned...I liked the color and the fact that it had a cupholder.  This was not the right reason to buy a stroller obviously.  5 months later this is what the system looks like..... - 2 of the 4 hubcaps are missing, they fell out sometime the first month.  -the plastic tray on the stroller (not the parents cup holder but the childs)has fallen off at least 2 dozen times.  It is not securley attached to the stroller at all but simply "snaps" onto the stroller.  Be aware that the infant car seat latches onto this plastic tray!  Although the tray never fell off with the car seat attached, I think it would be possible. -the child's foot rest also fell off once early on.  Since my daughter is only 5 months, I never even bothered to put it back on. -the plastic pieces have numerous scratches from the stroller being "collapsed" on asphalt. -the carrier seat is in good conditon. OK, OK...so I'll admit that I'm hard on strollers.  I have an SUV and am constantly throwing the stroller in and out of a tall car.  It seems like a stroller should be able to withstand a beating though.  This isn't the worst stroller sytem in the world but I wish I would have paid an extra $50 even $100 for something better built, more sturdy.  As a new stay-at-home mom, we're broke and so I'm stuck with this stroller for now :-(
