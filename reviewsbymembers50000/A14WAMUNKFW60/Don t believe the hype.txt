 I've owned this iron for 7-8 months now.  At first I loved it and didn't mind paying the "higher" price for it.  Now I have some regrets.  The iron totally leaks when you add water to it and when it's sitting upright on it's base.  Once it starts steaming and the iron is horizontal it doesn't leak as much.   Surprisingly the iron doesn't get hot enough to remove wrinkles from cotton clothes even when it's set on high.  I'm only realizing this now since I've always used the steam function(which always gets all the wrinkles out) until like I said above, water started leaking everywhere.  I thought I was buying the best product to make my ironing chore easier.  I was wrong.  I'm guessing that all the 5 star ratings came from reviewers who rated it within a week or so of purchase and who hadn't truly experienced all the problems yet.  And/or from reviewers whose other iron was really, really bad...making this one look good in comparison.  I'm rating the iron a 2 instead of a 1 b/c despite the leakage, I love that the steam quickly gets out wrinkles.
