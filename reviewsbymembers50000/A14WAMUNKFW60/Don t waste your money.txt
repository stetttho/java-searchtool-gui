 Take my advice, bite the bullet and pay for a second phone line.  This sytem is a piece of junk.  I tried to install the system a dozen times with no success.  And yes, I closely followed every step in the directions.  I called RCA for help and learned that "environmental factors" may be causing the system to not function properly.  These environmental factors could be flourescent or halogen lighting and surge protectors.  Well,  I have a big flourescent light in my kitchen and live in a new house where all my outlets are "protected".  They should put this info on the outside of the box. UGH...what a waste of time and money.
