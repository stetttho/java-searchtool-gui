 I have a toddler so cleaning floors is an obsession with me.  I totally love this product.  My wood laminate floors look and feel so clean and without using any harsh chemicals.  My tile floors were also sparkling.... although I still had to get on my hands and knees to clean the grout.  I only have a few design complaints: the unit is a bit on the heavy side. Although I love the sturdy feel of it, it takes some energy to push around.  The cord is a bit too short, I had to replug it into 3 different outlets to get my kitchen and family room done.   I'd buy the product again in a minute.  Things I love:  this mop comes with 2 mop cloths which are easily laundered in the washing machine and the machine is ready to steam clean within 30 seconds of plugging in. Like other reviewers, make sure that you change the cleaning pad once it becomes soiled (and it will no matter how clean you thought you're floors were) otherwise it's like pushing a dirty mop around, also make sure you sweep or vaccum your floors thoroughly before mopping.
