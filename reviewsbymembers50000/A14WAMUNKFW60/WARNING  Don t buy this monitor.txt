 Bad, bad, bad reception from every room in the house.  Color monitor only works if the room is fully lit (what baby sleeps with the room fully lit) and then doesn't even come close to the quality on the picture on the box.  I also had major static when using even just the audio part of the monitor.  I unplugged every wireless and electrical device just to make sure it wasn't interfering and nothing improved.  At best, I got a super grainy picture that was interrupted every 30 seconds with 10 seconds of fuzziness and major static.   This one is getting shipped back ASAP!
