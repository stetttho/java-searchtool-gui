 Because my lil guy outgrew this carseat after just a few months.  The seat is very deep and narrow which early on seemed like a good thing.  It provides a newborn with more support etc.  But my only slightly chubby boy soon needed a crowbar to get out of this seat.  He had no wiggle room whatsoever and began to protest being put in it.  So after a few months we switched to a Graco metrolite which is wider and allowed him to wave his arms around.  On the plus side, it's a really nice looking carseat with quality fabric.
