 Gate is pretty sturdy when pressure mounted caps are tightened sufficiently.  If not tightened enough the gate will tilt or may even tip over when you step on the paddle. Hint:  Don't lose the little plastic screw driver/wrench thingie that they give you.  This makes tightening a lot easier.  One needs to put a lot of pressure on the paddle to open the gate (easy for an adult, hard for a kid).  My 6 year old nephew still can't open ours, although at his age he can climb over it quite easily.  The upside, this gate is super easy to install, doesn't involve drilling into walls etc.  The downside, this gate only works on flat surfaces and has to lay flush with the floor for it to work.  We have rounded moulding along the bottom of our hallway so we had to purchase another gate for this area.  Also, the pressure mounted caps have peeled the paint off in areas.  The area you walk through is a bit narrow when compared to the swing gates.  This gate was a bit pricey after we added the 2 attachments (sold seperately) that we needed. Also, we've had to remove our hand's free gates several times when moving larger items from room to room.
