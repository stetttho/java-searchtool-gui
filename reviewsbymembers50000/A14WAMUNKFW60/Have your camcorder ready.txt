 This is worth the money.  I purchased the ultrasaucer for my daughter 7 days before she turned 4 months.  Her first reaction to the toy was PRICELESS!  She coo'ed and laughed and jumped like I had never seen before.  I only wish that we would have caught the moment on tape.  Beware though, my daughter quickly grew overwhelmed by all the bright colors and toys and had to be taken out after 5 minutes or so.  We let her check out the toy from my lap for another 5-10 minutes.  I agree with the other reviewers who say not to leave your little one in the saucer alone.  It's very sturdy but quite tall and the seat is kind of big.  I placed a small pillow in the front and back of my daughter for added support.
