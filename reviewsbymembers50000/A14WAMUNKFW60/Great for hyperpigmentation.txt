 Although expensive, this product produces results while the other cheaper ones I've tried simply do not.  Every now and then I get a few zits which don't bother me really.  What bothers me is the dark spot that lasts months after the pimple is gone.  The oxygen peel drastically reduces the blotchiness and hyperpigmentation.  As soon as I rinse the stuff off my face I'm always amazed to look in the mirror and see the results.  This stuff does help keep your pores clean also.  I would recommend using this product every couple of weeks and DEFINATELY before a big event (pictures etc).  Basically you put a gel over your face and then add a hydrogen peroxide cream, the whole thing foams up, you wait 1-3 minutes (intense tingling experienced at times) and then rinse.  Some people say to 1/2 the amount recommended so the product last longer but I didn't really find it was worth it.
