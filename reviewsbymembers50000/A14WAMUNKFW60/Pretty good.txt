 This rail will prevent most kids from rolling off of a bed.  Beware though when using it with younger infants.  My 7 month old thinks it's the most interesting part of our bed and loves to climb it.  Once she got her legs caught (for a split second since I was laying right next to her) between the mattress and the rail.  The rail is not as high as I'd like it to be.  Since our beds have padded tops it seems like an acrobatic sleeper could still fly over the edge although no one has.  It was a tiny bit of a hassle to put together only because I did it by myself when the last step is more easliy completed with 2 people.  The mesh fabric is strong and sturdy...not cheap.  The design is cute.  I prefer the mesh to the hard plastic that some rails have.  All in all a good buy for the price but not perfect.
