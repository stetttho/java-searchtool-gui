 I agree with what many others before me have said....this carseat should not be used with infants, rear facing.  I bought this seat for my daughter before she was born and have used it only a few times since (it's a back-up car seat).  Since my daughter is only 16 -17 pounds she still needs to be in a rear facing carseat.  This seat is NOT STABLE in the rear facing position AT ALL. It shakes and moves all around even when the seatbelt is fit snugly around the base as directed.  It is also VERY BIG & VERY TALL and I drive a Ford Expedition!!!  The few times I've attemped to use the seat I've nearly bumped her head on the inside roof of the car trying to get her in it.  So far, this carseat has been a complete waste of money.  Hopefully it will become more useful once my daughter is 20 pounds and can face forward.
