 We read this book when my son was a couple months old.  My older daughter slept with us, had really irregular sleep patterns, needed to be nursed to sleep etc. I was determined not to put myself through this again.  I was weary at first b/c I was not willing to let my son really cry it out either.  Anyway, Weissbluth gave some good information on recognizing sleep signs and natural sleep patterns so that you get your baby to sleep BEFORE they are overtired.  This is important since an overtired baby is WAY more difficult to get to sleep and will actually sleep worse as a result.  So a baby that sleeps well and on schedule (naptimes etc) will actually sleep MORE throughout the day.  I had a hard time believing this.  How could more naps during the day = a longer sleep time at night?  Well to my suprise he was completely correct.  Good sleep leads to more good sleep.   Weissbluth's basic message is to "honor" your child's need to sleep and therefore schedule activities around nap times and avoid napping in the car and in strollers (since this isn't truly restful sleep).  Well rested babies are better able to absorb the   lessons they learn each day and are just happier.  He also says that babies who are well-rested are more intelligent and more easy going.  I found all of this to be true.  My lil guy rarely  crys it out since his sleep schedule is so regular.  If he does cry, it is only for a minute or 2 and is more of a sleepy "grumble" then a cry.  I only gave the book 4 stars b/c there was alot of information given that seemed to go against what he stated in previous chapters.  It was a bit confusing.  But his basic sleep program is brilliant.
