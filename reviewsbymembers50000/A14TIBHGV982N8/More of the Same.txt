 Don't Waste Your Time Just To Get New Liner Notes.  Ever since BMG purchased RCA years ago, the recirculation of Elvis' material has bubbled over. They are not giving us anything new - just the same stuff with different packaging. This way people will feel compelled to have new liner notes and pictures.   Of course, being business-only-minded, they want your money - nothing else. And, unfortunately people are giving it to them.  How many times do I need "Hound Dog" or "Jailhouse Rock"? If you have it once, then you have it - period. I would rather have Elvis singing "Bad Moon Rising" which he did in concert but hasn't been released, yet.  If you want to have Elvis' proper commercial releases then don't buy this drivel. Instead, get the boxed sets:  50's Masters 60's Masters Command Performances Amazing Grace 70's Masters  The only excellent releases by BMG (now Sony BMG) are "Tiger Man" and the "1968 Comeback Special." These mentioned cds will give you all that you need.   I do appreciate BMG trying to get younger fans to appreciate Elvis' music but enough is enough. And this is now more than enough.
