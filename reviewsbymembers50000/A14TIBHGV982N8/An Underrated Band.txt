 Being a professional musician I have many influences. However, no one more so that John Fogerty. Being in the most overlooked band of the late sixties, John is now being "rediscovered" and no better place to start than with his CCR days!  There are very few albums/cds that I can listen to from beginning to end and this is one of them. Not a filler to be found. From start to finish, John shows you why he has been around so long.  Under the shadows of the sixties more prolific guitarists: Eric Clapton, Jimi Hendrix, and Songwriters: Bob Dylan, John Lennon and Paul McCartney, John Fogerty is usually forgotten. However, after listening to his work on "Ramble Tamble," and "Who'll Stop the Rain," and pre-Clapton "Before You Accuse Me," you will not doubt that CCR was the best American band of the sixties!
