 "Cross This Town" which is really a mistitle of "Crosscut Saw", "Double Trouble" and "All Your Love (I Miss Loving)" feature great interplay between Eric and Otis.  "I'd Go Home" has Otis Rush as a guest. That may actually be Luther Allison doing that song. However, that is also the wrong title. The rest of the cd is decent live Clapton. However if you want better live Clapton get "24 Nights" or "One More Car, One More Rider." Also, the bootleg "Spiritual Home" has the best version of "I Shot the Sheriff" ever done.
