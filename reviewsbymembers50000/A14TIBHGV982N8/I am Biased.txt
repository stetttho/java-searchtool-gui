 I have had the pleasure of knowing John Walter for almost 20 years. I attended the CCD classes that he held at St Margret's School in Middle Village. I am also priviledged to have had John do some research for me on a relative that served in the Union Army. Not only did John take the time to research the information for me at the National Archives but he also led me to my great-grandfather's (X 7) gravesite! And he put together a brief history for me of the unit that my grandfather served in and all of the battles and skirmishes that they were in. This book is a fascinating. To know that there were so many Rebel dead buried a few blocks away!!! I can't wait until he publishes his next book on POWs at Fort Delaware at the Delaware River and the companion to this book about the Northern dead! Great work John!!! Always your friend. Chris
