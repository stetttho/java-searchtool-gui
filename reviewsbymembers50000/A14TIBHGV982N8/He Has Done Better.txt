  As a professional musician, I have an open mind about other musicians trying different ideas. After all, music is an art and like all art, it should change with the mind of the artist  It seems to me that Eric is becoming a victim of his age. Although he is 56 years old (as of March 30) his music seems to be affected by this. On Pilgrim he tore into "Sick and Tired", definitely not his best blues, but more aggresive than anything on this cd.  I see him as having the "Florida Syndrome": When a native New Yorker reaches a certain age (usually between 50 -60) that person feels the need to move to Florida. I hope Eric gets a boost of Ginseng and makes another album with the spirit of Journeyman. Even "Riding with the King" was a little disappointing despite the collective effort of B.B. King. It really goes to show that these two performers really need the response of a live audience to push them to the limits.  I gave this cd 3 stars mainly for him not being affraid to try something new. I hope that this is it for a while and we get into some heavy stuff.  This cd is lethargic. For new fans, check out Layla (of course), Wheels of Fire (Cream), and Journeyman.  For us real fans who have been following him since the Roosters: Get it for your collection anyway, it can't hurt. Besides, "Come Back Baby" is probably the gem of the recording.  PS: Eric, please, NO MORE DRUM MACHINES!
