 My parents took me to my first concet at the age of 4. The concert that they took me to see was Elvis at MSG. Now, only being four years old, I sure don't remember anything of the show -- although I have plenty of photos, including two backstage with Elvis -- that is why I went out and bought this cd. I was never crazy about Elvis' live material -- not a fan of live recordings at all -- and never really liked his post-1969/1970 work (some of it is great! Burning Love comes to mind). However, this album has more personal ties than anything. How many people can say that the first (or last) concert they went to was an Elvis concert?
