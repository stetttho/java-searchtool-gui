 Yeah, it's wonderful that a new generation is experiencing Elvis' one-of-a-kind music but why does BMG find it necessary (other than making money) to constantly repackage the same stuff over and over and over and over, ad infinitum? You only need 3 sets: The 50's Masters, The 60's Masters (From Memphis to Nashville), and The 70's Masters. That is all. Ever since RCA sold-out to BMG it has been horrible. If BMG wants to give Elvis fans something new how about cd's of unreleased music!!! I am dying to have a cd version of Elvis singing "Bad Moon Risin'" which he did in concert. Instead it's the same old, same old, just with new picture sleeves. BMG SUX.
