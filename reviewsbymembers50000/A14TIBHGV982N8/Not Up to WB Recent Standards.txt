 My gripes are with the quality of the movies - not the movies themselves. For the past few years WB has been releasing some special editions (Casablanca, Robin Hood, etc) that feature top-quality restoration and specials. However, it seems that this set was denied those touches.  All of the interview special features are very poor quality - noticeably high-contrast. The interviews themselves are poor with no archival interviews with Fred or Ginger. "Shall We Dance" is also poor image quality.  What was also lacking was "A Night at the Movies" feature which WB has been adding to all of their re-releases.  This set should have started from the beginning with "Flying Down to Rio" instead of films 4,5,6,7 and 10. Hopefully, the next set will finish off where this one missed.
