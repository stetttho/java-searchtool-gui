 If you have the original cd of "See the Light" you will notice that Arista has changed the version of "Angel Eyes" on this version of the cd. They have replaced the original album version with the far insuperior "single" version. I couldn't imagine why they would want to ruin the cd by doing that. Altogether, that is the only reason that I gave this cd 4 stars. The original album version of "Angel Eyes" contained an incredible solo on the outro that Arista has edited down by fading out the song at least a minute and a half too early. Too bad, that solo contained all of the passion of the song.
