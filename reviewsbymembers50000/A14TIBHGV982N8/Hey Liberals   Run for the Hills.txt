 You are going to see a lot of "1-star" reviews for this book, but don't be fooled. Glenn Beck -- whose radio show is out of Philly -- is truthful and honest -- which is why the liberals don't like him. The liberals -- many of them wrote those "1-star" reviews -- are starting to get scared. The liberal's theory is this: You are never going to be any better than what you are. You will always be poor and dependent on your government. You are to stupid to know what is best for you and your family so the gov has to show you the way. The Conservative theory is this: You will be better than what you are, however, you have to work for it, just like everybody else does. You and you alone know what is best for your family and the government has no business running your life. Nobody owes you anything; you owe yourself. Give me that theory any day!!! GREAT BOOK and even better talk show!!!! Liberals beware. The conservatives are going to take this country back!!! You can all go to Cuba and China. LONG LIVE GOD, The AMERICAN FLAG, and JUDGE ROY MOORE!!!
