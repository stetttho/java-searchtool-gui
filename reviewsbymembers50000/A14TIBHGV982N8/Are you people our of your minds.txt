 The people who like this version are absolutely nuts. This is pure destruction of a classic 1968 Elvis song. BMG needs to realize that Elvis no longer needs record sales to prove himself for he is the undisputed Performer of the 20th Century. There is absolutely no reason to start turning his songs into *NSTYNK style, no talent garbage. If Elvis never had another song on the charts he still couldn't be touched even by rubber-face Michael Jackson. Fans new and old show stick with the 3 boxed sets: The 50's Masters, 60's Masters, and 70's Masters, also Amazing Grace: The Gospel Recordings, and Command Performances: The 60's Masters Vol 2.
