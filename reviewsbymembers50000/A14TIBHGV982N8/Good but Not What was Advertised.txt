 I was really under the impression -- from the advertising -- that this was going to be "Let It Be" completely stripped of all the heavy-handed Phil Spector crap. Of course, I realised the inclusion of some songs (Don't Let Me Down) and the removal of some (Dig It, Maggie Mae) however, Get Back, Long and Winding Road, Don't Let Me Down, and Let It Be are clearly not the same versions that were on the original album or singles. The version of Long and Winding Road that appears on Anthology 3 is the same as the album version just with the crap removed. That is exactly what this album should have been. This would have been explained in the liner notes but there are none with Naked. I believe that is why there are no liners note because it would have stated that these are not the same songs. This is more like an authorized bootleg. There are thousands of hours of unreleased Beatles tapes and this is just a few from the original Get Back sessions. If you are a collector as I am you will notice these differences right away.
