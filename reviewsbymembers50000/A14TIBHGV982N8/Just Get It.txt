 First of all, let's get something straight: THERE ARE NO REPEATS ON THE TWO SETS! The others who've said that "What's Opera Doc?" are on both have obviously 1) not watched either set or 2) are confusing "What's Opera Doc" with "What's Up Doc?" It was also written somewhere in the reviews that "One Froggy Evening" was also on both -- wrong again fellas.  WB is smart. They are not going to release everything on these upcoming collections because they want us to buy their other remastered movies. For instance: If you want "Yankee Doodle Bugs" and "Yankee Doodle Daffy" you will have to buy "Yankee Doodle Dandy" with James Cagney. Also, if you'd like "Robin Hood Bugs" and "Robin Hood Daffy" you will have to purchase "The Adventures of Robin Hood" with Errol Flynn. Both are 2-disc sets and really worth the money if you like the classics. However, this is the only way to get all of the Looney Tunes', so far. Of course, not everyone is going to be happy. I wish that WB had included "A Hare Grows in Manhattan" to either set. Also, why not more Daffy or Foghorn Leghorn? Maybe in the subsequent sets. Still, this is just as good as part 1. And remember:  THERE ARE NOT REPEATS ON THESE TWO SETS!!!
