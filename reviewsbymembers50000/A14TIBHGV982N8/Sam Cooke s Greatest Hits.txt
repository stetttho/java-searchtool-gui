 How can you have a "Sam Cooke's Greatest Hits" and omit "Another Saturday Night"? The omission of that one song for the inclusion of songs like "Red Rooster" and "Frankie and Johnny" is the reason that I gave this 3 stars. Those songs were not chart-busters like "Another Saturday Night." Just a bad choice by RCA. It just shows that the companies want to you go and buy the greatest hits and the "other cd" that contains that one song that should have been on it to begin with! It is all about money and marketing.
