 This is one of the greatest Christmas albums ever recorded. The pairing of Johnny Mathis' beautiful voice with the uncomprimising arrangements of Percy Faith and His Orchestra are one of the greatest matches in music history.  Johnny's versions of "Sleigh Ride", "Winter Wonderland", "Silver Bells", "The First Noel", and "O Holy Night" are as much a classic as Bing Crosby's "White Christmas", Elvis' "I'll Be Home for Christmas", Nat "King" Cole's "The Christmas Song", and Dean Martin's "Let it Snow! Let it Snow! Let it Snow."  I can't think of a cd that says "Christmas" more than this one. Originally released in 1957, it is a timeless classic that should actually be passed on from generation to generation. Enjoy! MERRY CHRISTMAS and HAPPY NEW YEAR
