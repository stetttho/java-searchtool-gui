 Forget the Sinatra of Las Vegas, the Sinatra of Columbia, and the Rat Pack! This is THE Frank Sinatra! The best he ever sounded. Young, raw, confident! This set would get 50 stars if possible. To hear him sing with Connie Haines and The Pied Pipers - the interaction between them is superlative. Frank would never again capture the beauty of these recordings. This is like comparing the young Elvis and the Old Elvis - the young was the best. To complete your early Sinatra collection get the Frank Sinatra and Harry James recordings that are available on disc; 1939, the first year of his professional career 6 months prior to these recordings. Also of note are the V-Discs collection. GO OUT AND BY THIS BOX! You Won't regret it.
