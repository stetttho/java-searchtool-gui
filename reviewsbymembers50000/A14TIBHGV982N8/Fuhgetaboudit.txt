 These are the essential New York songs that should have replaced almost every song on this collection: 1) New York, New York (Frank Sinatra, Gene Kelly and Jules Munshin) 2) The Brooklyn Bridge (Frank Sinatra) 3) Lullaby of Broadway (The Andrews Sisters) 4) Forty-Second Street (The Boswell Sisters) 5) Take Me Back to New York Town (Billy Murray) 6) Streets of New York (Billy Murray) 7) Give My Regards to Broadway (Billy Murray/George M. Cohan) 8) Theme From "New York, New York" (Frank Sinatra)  This collection pretty much sucks.
