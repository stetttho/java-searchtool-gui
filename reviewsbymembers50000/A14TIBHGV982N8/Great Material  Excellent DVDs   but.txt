 ...the "but" is this: Why is Goldberg on this set? She is only there to chastise us for loving politically incorrect material. As a matter of fact, I'm glad that in this horribly left-wing, communist society that there are a few of us who don't mind watching these great works of art. And, since I have declared them as art they must now be looked at as such.  I just can't wait til WB releases "Bugs Nips the Nips" and just a word of advice to Warner Brothers; you'd be much better off using either Leonard Maltin or Robert Osbourne (from TCM) as the host!
