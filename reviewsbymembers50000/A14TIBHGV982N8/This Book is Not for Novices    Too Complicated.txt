 I am an Adobe Certified Photoshop user and member of the NAPP (National Association of Photoshop Professionals - http://www.photoshopuser.com) and a self-taught designer. So, I pick up things pretty quickly. However, I am a novice when it comes to Illustrator. This book is HORRIBLE for beginners. The complete lack of detail for the lessons is terrible. The author should stick to design and forget about teaching and writing books. It is difficult to find quality Illustrator CS books and this is definately not one of them. Stick to the Adobe Classroom in a Book series - even though their Illustrator CS books has some errors to it. I gave this book 2 stars only because it has great art in it. It was not for the quality of the lessons. This book sucks.
