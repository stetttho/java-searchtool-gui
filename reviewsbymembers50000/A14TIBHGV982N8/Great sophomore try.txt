 This is a good effort by The Jeff Healey Band to try to capture the essence of the band continuing from their first cd/album. Mark Knopfler's guest appearance on "I Think I Love You Too Much" is excellent as well as the late George Harrison's guesting on "While My Guitar Gently Weeps" which he originally did as a member of The Beatles. Healey's style is his own but you can see shades of Eric Clapton's original "Gently Weeps" licks on this version. "How Long Can a Man Be Strong" is this cd's "Angel Eyes" and although his singing is not as passionate the guitar playing certainly is. A much better effort than his next album would be.
