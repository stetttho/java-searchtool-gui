 I have had the fortunate opportunity to share the stage with this young man on a few occasions, as recently as March 13, 2005. He is a self-taught, incredible player. However, he has one thing that most semi-pro and even professional players do not have - SOUL. If you love the blues then do not hesitate to get this cd. Even better check out his web site at www.davegrossband.com and see him live!
