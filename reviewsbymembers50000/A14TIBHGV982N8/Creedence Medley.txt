 This is a medley of some of Creedence's best: Proud Mary, Lodi, Who'll Stop the Rain, Up Around the Bend... This is an import although I originally bought this in 1985 as a 12" album -- remember those!? It was released by Fantasy Records, which was Creedence's label, right after John Fogerty came out with CENTERFIELD. The B-side was "Rude Awakening #2" from PENDULUM There was another one put out by Fantasy about the same time called "Medley USA." It contained almost the same songs at about half the time (3:06). The B-side was "Bad Moon Rising." Nice to have it on cd for the collection. If you are a Creedence Clearwater Revival/John Fogerty enthusiast, pick this one up. It saves you the time of making your own medley.
