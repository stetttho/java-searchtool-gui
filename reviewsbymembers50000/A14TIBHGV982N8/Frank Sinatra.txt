 How could anyone think that Frank Sinatra would be on a cd that is titled "1935" let alone a Tommy Dorsey cd for 1935?  1) Frank (20-yrs old in 1935) was nowhere to be seen in the music industry yet. 2) Frank started with Harry James in 1939 (For only 6-months). 3) Frank joined with Tommy Dorsey and His Orchestra in 1940 (same time as The Pied Pipers).
