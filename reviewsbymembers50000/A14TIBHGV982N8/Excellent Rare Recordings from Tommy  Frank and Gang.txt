 This recording was a "Holy Grail" find which I had been trying to get for a long time.   It's an absolute must for any collector of early Frank Sintra or for a collector of Tommy Dorsey, or Jo Stafford recordings.  The sound quality is excellent. All I wish for was a better booklet which is why I chopped of 1-star.  If you want to add to your collection of pre-solo Frank-try to get your hands on this-if only for historic purposes. Since it's hard to get grab it as soon as you can.
