 I bought this cd only for The Marketts version of "The Batman Theme." This version of the song peaked on Billboard's Hot 100 on February 26, 1966 at number 17. The original TV version by Neal Hefti (his original is unavailable on cd however, he made a remake that is available) reached number 35 on March 5, 1966.
