 In this video, we are treated to the 1995-1996 season of amateur figure skating. Magic Memories On Ice III highlights one of the best seasons of skating, where Michelle Kwan is pretty much the focus here. In this volume, we see Michelle Kwan's rise to 1996 U.S. National Champion, and an unforgettable duel for the World Championship between her and Lu Chen of China, where Michelle ended up the victor. But there are also other gems in this video: Rudy Galindo's excellent skate to become national champion, Todd Eldredge's Gold Medal World performance, plus little caps from other international skaters. Actually, come to think of it, Magic Memories On Ice III showcases a lot of "firsts" for skaters, the previously mentioned winners as well as Russia's Irina Slutskaya's first European Championship. And the annoying commentary from Dick Button is practically deleted, replaced with the pleasant and only occasional word from Dick Emberg. Every skating fan should have this.
