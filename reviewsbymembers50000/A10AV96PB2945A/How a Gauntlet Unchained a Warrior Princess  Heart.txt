 In this delicious trilogy of unterror, we see the beginning of the end of Xena,Conquerer of Nations.Thus, the Warrior Princess is born.In an all-too-predictable plot of evil turning good,we are introduced to Xena and  her evil ways,how Hercules helped her see the error of her ways,and why she  now chooses to fight on the side of the angels(instead of with the angels  if she continued her misdeeds.)'Tis a must for all Xena fans,as you see her  origin somewhat,and if you currently watch the series, it's a fine example  of a character having evolved.
