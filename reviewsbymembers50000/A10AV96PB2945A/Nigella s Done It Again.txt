 Nigella's third book is a companion to her wonderful televison series "Nigella Bites". Divided into ten sections ranging from All-Day Breakfast to Temple Food, the recipes in this beautiful book are as fabulous and irresistible as Ms. Lawson herself. With gorgeous photography of food, the introductions to the recipes are pretty much taken from the show and almost quoted verbatim, so for those who haven't had the luxury of seeing "Nigella Bites", you're getting the gist of what makes the TV show wonderful right on the printed page just by reading this book. I think what's excellent about Nigella is that anyone can make her food, and it's divine food, unpretentious yet very gourmet, for lack of a better word. There is no fussing about ingredients, e.g., like one requiring white truffle oil or some other expensive ingredient that you'll only need a teaspoon of, to make something that once seemed intimidating. Her Lemon Risotto is unmatched, and the Chocolate Cloud Cake is heavenly. I could go on and on... And who'd have thunk about deep-frying candy bars, hmmm? Nigella's ice cream recipe needs no ice cream maker. And the Ham in Coca Cola is a MUST! And I whole-heartedly agree with the reviewer from Everett, WA about the 24-hour roast shoulder of pork. Nigella Lawson has redefined my love for being in the kitchen, and her mantra is that the kitchen is a place that you escape to, not from, a mantra that I adhere to. Even if you're not one for cooking, I urge anyone to get this book, if not for the recipes, but for the photos and the inexplicable stress-relieving tone of this volume.
