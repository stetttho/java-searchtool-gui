 How well do we really know Catwoman? Well, whatever your perception of her, Selina Kyle is redefined here in this wonderful collection of originally-presented-in-magazine-form tales of Catwoman. If you're not all that familiar with her (forget what you've seen in the movies, TV, and cartoons) this is a good starting point, and for longtime fans as well. Unabashedly told in the familiar Film Noir style, we see Selina Kyle forced to reexamine herself and her life, and a neat plot twist that coincides with her eventual evolution into a reluctant Robin Hood type hero. She's all too likeable from the start. Ed Brubaker's writing is great, all the while keeping a tone of suspense with occasional light-heartedness thrown in. And Darwyn Cooke's clean and bold art style complements perfectly Brubaker's story telling. All in all, this collection is a good stand-alone book for everyone and a must for Catwoman fans. (Oh, and check out "Selina's Big Score", written  and illustrated by Darwyn Cooke for a really cool "prequel" to "The Dark End Of The Street".)
