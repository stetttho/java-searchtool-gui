 There are two things that come into mind when I hear of  someone's sensitivity:one, that after a narcissistic injury has been done to someone,they claim that they're just "too sensitive", and  secondly someone who is just receptive to the feelings of others and tends  to be easily overwhelmed.The latter is what these audiotapes are about,and  very much makes us sensitive people grateful that we have this particular  trait. Rather than trying to help overcome our sensitivity,Dr.Aron provides  necessary information as to why we're sensitve and our place in the world.A  great self-help tool that doesn't instantly provide answers,but makes us  aware that what we really need to sustain ourselves is already there inside  of us.
