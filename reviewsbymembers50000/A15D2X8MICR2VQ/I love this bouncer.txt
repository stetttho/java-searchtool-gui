 We got this bouncer as a baby present and I am so glad.  My daughter is 6 weeks old and when I put her in the bouncer, I can actually get stuff done while she's awake.  She loves watching the lights flash and the music play.  The vibration mode is also a big plus.  It's so nice to be able to put her down without a major crying fit.  If you're considering buying a bouncer, I'd definitely recommend this one.
