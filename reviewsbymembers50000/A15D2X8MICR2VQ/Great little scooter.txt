 This was an un-birthday present from grandma and she got it right. :) My [...] has played with it every day since it arrived. It took less than 1/2 of an hour for me to put it together and is sturdy when completed. I only needed a phillps screwdriver in addition to the supplied materials.  There are flashing lights along each side, with an on/off switch for each set located on the bottom. The basket is nice and deep, perfect for a tag along doll friend or whatever your child needs. The base is wide and the scooter stands up well by itself, so far it's only toppled over when helped by my daughter.  I'm very pleased with this toy and I know my daughter loves it. I'd definitely recommed it for any age-appropriate child as a good starter scooter.
