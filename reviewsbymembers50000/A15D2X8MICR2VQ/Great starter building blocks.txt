 My daughter's had these blocks since she was around 8 months old. She's now 3+ and still enjoys playing with them. There's a good variety of different block shapes, as well as funky animals too.   I like how the blocks are designed to help little hands 'pop' the pieces together, and I think that the variety of shapes and creatures encourages creative building skills. They're also very durable, even after 2+ years of play, they still look like new.  There are actually 3 different bags of pop-onz for around $20, the regular set, an alphabet set, and a number/shapes set. My daughter especially likes the alphabet set, she likes stacking the letters as we sing the alphabet song.   All in all, we happy with this purchase and I'd recommend it for anyone whos child likes to build.
