 I picked this book up expecting something a bit more fluffy and light. I'm so glad I was wrong. It is not a 'happy' novel, and doesn't try to portrey it's characters as perfect, (which they are very definitely not).  The author's vision of a post-apocolyptic America is fascinating, mixing science fiction and fantasy without being awkward. I'm definitely looking forward to reading the next two books in the series.
