 My daughter adores this doll. From the moment we took it out of the packaging, it hasn't left her side. She loves the fact that she can dress the doll herself, without needing my help to pull on shirts or bottoms on/off. The doll comes with 3 interchangeable shirts and bottoms so she can mix and match different outfits, which she really enjoys. My only complaint is that it sometimes takes a bit of wiggling to line up the pegs on the clothes with the holes on the doll. All in all, for $10 it's good buy, especially with extra outfits available for only another $6 or so.
