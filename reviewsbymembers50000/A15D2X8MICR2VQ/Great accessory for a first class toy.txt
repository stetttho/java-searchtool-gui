 Another cute little addition to the Snap n' Style series. The hat fits well on the doll's head, the rainboots go on easy and stay on.  The outfit is only one piece so it's a bit easier for little hand to operate.   The umbrella is a cute accessory, but might need Mom or Dad's help to get onto the doll's hand. My daughter enjoys dressing her doll up and playing rainy day, so I think it's worth the $7 or so. The outfit helps add a nice variety to a very well-thought out doll line.
