 We received this as a present and while it has some nice features, it's rather noisy overall.  Our home is a two story and my daughter's room is directly below ours.  The monitor hums loudly and is very staticy no matter how low you turn the volume down.  Maybe it'd work better in a home where the recievers are farther apart.  It does however, pick up the lightest sounds from my daughter, you just have listen very closely.  The moving lights are a nice feature and work perfectly.  All in all, I probably wouldn't buy it, but as a gift it works well enough.
