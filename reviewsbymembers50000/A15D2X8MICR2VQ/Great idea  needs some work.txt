 We bought this on clearance at Target for $20 and for that price, it's about what I expected. My daughter loves this toy, but it's super messy, so it's definitely an outside only play activity.   Pros-      My daughter LOVES it. She'll play with it for hours if we let her. The little boy next door also loves it, it's the first thing he runs to play with when visiting my daughter.      The people are cute and sturdy, a good size for little hands.      The cover is a nice touch, especially if you need to 'lock' the toy or just keep the rain out.      The table is sturdy, even after taking months of abuse from my daughter it doesn't wobble at all.  Cons-      The castle is a joke, falls apart every time it's touched or brushed against. Definitely not up to normal Little Tikes standards.      The sand area is rather small and the walls that separate it from the water section are low so the sand and water mix very easily.      Don't believe the directions, you need a drill to put it together.        Overall, for $20 we're satisfied, but I think if we would have paid $40 or more, I'd of been more unhappy with the toy. It's a good concept, but needs a bit of tweaking to bring it up to what I expect from a Little Tykes toy.
