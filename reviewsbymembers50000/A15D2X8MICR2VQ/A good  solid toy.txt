 We received this free when we bought the playland climber, but I'd definitely spend the money on it if we had to.  My daughter's loved it from the moment I pulled it from the box.  She loves to sit in the center and rock herself.  You can also have the child sit on one end and push the other easily.  I also like the fact that no matter how hard she rocks, she hasn't tipped it over yet.  A good solid toy, no matter how many kids you have.
