 My daughter has this set for her Ericka doll and it's definitely a hit. The slippers go on easy and stay on, the headband stays on nice and tight, and the outfit is adorable. The teddy bear is a cute addition to the set, but doesn't always stay on the doll's hands.  I'd definitely recommend this as an addition set to the Snap n' Style line. My daughter enjoys getting her doll ready for bed at bedtime and I think it's one of the top sets in this line.
