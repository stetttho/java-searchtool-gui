 As first time parents, we bought this monitor because we were terrified of SIDS. It's been totally worth the money. We haven't had any of the humming or false alarms others have complained about.  I love how sensitive it is, and the feature that turns off the sound tick so you get just a green LED light flash every time she moves or breathes is perfect. We've been using if for 5 months, and so far the only time the alarm has gone off is when we've picked her up and forgotten to turn the monitor off. I'd highly recommend this monitor to anyone, the piece of mind it provides is priceless.
