 I bought this for my daughter because it looked versatile.  There's a good variety of features that should last for at least a couple of years.  The slide was taller than the other climbers I looked at which was nice.  Also the ladder opening and the slide don't line up, so that was a major point in it's favor.  It's very sturdy, no matter how hard my daughter jumps up and down, it barely moves.  It's also light enough that I have no problem pulling it around the yard by myself (I'm 5'O") to mow the lawn.  She especially loves climbing the rock walls all by herself.  The only downside is that there's really not enough room underneath to do anything but store toys.  Edit: We've now had this climber for almost 2 years and it's still as nice as when we bought. It was very easy to break down for our move to our new home, and very easy to reassemble once we got here, even without the directions. It's still very sturdy and gets lots of use from my daughter and the other neighborhood kids. My only complaint is that I have to watch carefully or the 8 and 9 years olds in the neighborhood will try to play on it when I'm not looking. :)
