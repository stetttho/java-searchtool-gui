 If I'd of realized how much my daughter would like this toy, I would have bought a long time ago. She will spend easily an hour or two taking these cars apart, putting them back together and 'zoomin' them around her bedroom floor. For under $10, they've been  a very good purchase. A very nice addition to her Mega Blok collection.
