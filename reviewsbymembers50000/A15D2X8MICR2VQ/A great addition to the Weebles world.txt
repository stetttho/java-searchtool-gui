 My 3 year old daughter recieved this for Christmas and has played with it every day since. She loves the slide features and the waterwheel especially, but seems to play with all of the accessories equally. It came with lots of extra Weebles and bikes (it was purchased at Sam's Club) so she has lots of characters to choose from.  The music is rather loud, but no more than the town set. Personally I think that's one of the reasons she likes it so much. It's a great addition to the other Weebles playsets and I sure she'll gets lots of enjoyment from it.
