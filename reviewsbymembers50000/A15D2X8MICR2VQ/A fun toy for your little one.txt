 My daughter loves this toy.  At first she just liked watching us play with it to make the noise and music.  Once she figured how to use the balls, she played with it for hours.  It's not as steady as I'd like, she's tipped it over once or twice.  Luckily it's light and plastic.  The balls are a good size for her little hands too.  Warning though, she loves pushing anything that will fit down the holes.
