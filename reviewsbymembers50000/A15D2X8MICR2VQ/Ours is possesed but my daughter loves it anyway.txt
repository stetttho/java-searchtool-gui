 First off this toy is LOUD. There's no on/off switch so the only way to turn off the racecar sounds is to take the batteries out. I think that the racecar sounds are rather obnoxious, but my daughter likes them.   It is very durable and once it was assembled, not one piece has broken off despite my 2 1/2 daughter's best efforts. :)   However, ours goes off all the time for NO REASON AT ALL! Seriously, there's been plenty of nights I'd hear it across the house in my daughter's room continously making noise over and over sitting in her closet. Needless to say it now 'sleeps' in the garage when she's not playing with it.   Other than that, it's a very popular toy with my daughter and the neighborhood kids. Even the 8 and 9 year olds across the street will play with it if she's playing with it outside. It's a simple concept, but maybe that's why it works.  There also seems to be a few differences with our version and ones previously reviewed. Our two cars are red and green, driven by a Snoopy dog look-a-like. I haven't noticed either car being faster than the other, so maybe Fisher Price fixed that problem? Also, her normal Matchbox cars fit the track (the exceptions being the fancier Ford Expedition and other larger Matchbox cars which are too tall and bulky).   We spent $9.99 for this at a Toys R Us store, so for that price I don't regret it, even if ours is slightly creepy.
