 My daughter's loved this from the moment I bought it.  She's had it in her crib for over a year.  Every night she'll turn it on and off, and just lays there for a few minutes relaxing with her 'fishes'.  Very simple for children to turn on/off.  There's also different settings so you can change the volume control and how much action is occuring.  I've given one as a gift at every baby shower I've been to in the last year.
