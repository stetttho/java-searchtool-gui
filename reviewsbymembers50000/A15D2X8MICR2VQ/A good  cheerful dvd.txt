 I bought the whole Baby Einstein set, (10 so far) for my daughter when she was 2 months old.  So far this one is by far her favorite of the ones for 18 months and under.  She laughs and talks to it, she especially likes the children's appearances.  I'd recommend it, especially if you can find the set, it's way cheaper than buying them individually.
