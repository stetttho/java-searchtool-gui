 It is a cute video and my daughter enjoys watching and dancing along with it. There's lots of cameos of the children in the audience (which my daughter loves). Also there's a good variety of songs, (many of which we were familiar with from Noggin).  Pros-      Lots of songs that encourage dancing and interaction with your child      Lots of screen time of the children in the audience      Simple songs and lyrics that my daughter can sing along with.      My daughter likes the simple animation and older bluescreen technology.      The audio on our tape is crisp and clear, no buzzing, humming, or any other noises aside from the concert.  Cons-      This is not what they show on Noggin, this is a taping of a concert from 4 or 5 years ago, and it is very evident.      The funky book that showcases the video cuts off about 30% of the useable screen. I would have preferred that the whole video be shot in full screen without the annoying black spaces around the edges.       I'm not too thrilled with the clothes Laurie and Susie are wearing, I'd have expected those dresses on a teenager going to a rave, not on the singers at a children's concert.       This video is only available in VHS, not in a DVD format. For $3 or $4 more, I'd rather have gotten a DVD.  Overall, I'm happy with the video and would recommend it for anyone who's children enjoy the shorts on Noggin. The things that irk me about the video, my daughter doesn't even notice, and it's her opinion that really counts. :)
