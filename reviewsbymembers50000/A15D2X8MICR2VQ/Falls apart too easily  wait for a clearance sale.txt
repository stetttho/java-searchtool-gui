 My daughter loves My Little Pony, but I'm very disappointed with this set. Every time she plays with it, the tracks come apart. Also, even when I securely 'snapped' the ferris wheel portion together, it just won't stay attached, it's always falling apart. The butterfly 'wings' that you use to hook the ponies to the ferris wheel are constantly falling off also.  It's very frustrating for my daughter, she loves it when it stays in one piece. Unfortunently it falls apart so often, that it's just not worth the hassle to constantly be putting back together.   A good idea, Hasbro just needs better quality control.
