 This toybox holds an amazing amount of toys.  I love the fact the lid comes completely off and it's so sturdy.  My only complaint is that the dividers come out so easily, my daughter loves to pull them out and hide them.  Very durable, and no sharp corners to bump into.  A good value for your money.
