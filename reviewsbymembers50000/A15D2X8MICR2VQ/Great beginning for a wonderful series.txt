 I first stumbled upon the Gunslinger in middle school and have been hooked on the Dark Tower ever since.  With it's gritty fantasy feel and an eerie undertone, it sets the reader on a spellbinding journey following Roland's quest for the Dark Tower.  King's stark descriptions of this world and it's people are totally amazing.  I highly recommend this book and the following volumes.
