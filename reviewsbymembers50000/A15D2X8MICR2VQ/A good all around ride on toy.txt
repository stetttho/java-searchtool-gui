 My daughter has loved this since the moment I put it together.  She has no problem rocking it (she's 18 months), but her favorite is to be pushed along outside.  I love the fact it's sturdy and versatile.  I'm sure we'll have it until it wears out.  Edit: My daughter is now 3+ and still LOVES this bike. She'll ride it up and down in front of the house with the 'big kids' on their bikes all day if we let her. The stickers have worn off and the plastic's faded a bit, but we're VERY happy with the quality and durability of this toy. Definitely would recommend.
