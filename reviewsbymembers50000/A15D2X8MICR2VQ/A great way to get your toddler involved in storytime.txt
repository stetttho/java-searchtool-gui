 I picked this up for my daughter b/c it was on sale and she loves monkeys. The story is bright and simple, very easy to follow along with. She loves taking the monkey apart and putting him back together in all kinds of silly ways. The pieces are very durable and come together very solidly. I love the fact that the 'book' form stores the pieces so compactly and out of the way. My only complaint is that the color changing aspect is only on the main body piece and only lasts as long as cold water is directly applied. Overall it's a very cute, affordable, sturdy toy to help stimulate a toddler's imagination. My daughter's had so much fun with it, I've picked up others in the set the save for a rainy day.
