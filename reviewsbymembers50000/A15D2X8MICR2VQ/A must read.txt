 I won't wax on and on about what a great read this and how well Martin writes.  Others have done so far more eloquently than I ever could.  I will say this is a definite must read for anyone who loves a well developed plot with realistic characters.  When I finished it, I had to go out and buy the next book that day.  What a pleasure to read.  Highly recommended.
