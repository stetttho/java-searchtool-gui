 My daughter received this for her 1st birthday.  Even though she was too little to make the car 'go', she spent hours opening/shutting the door and climbing in and out.  Now at 19 months it's still the first thing she runs to when we go outside.  She loves pushing it around the yard and going backwards by herself.  She hasn't mastered the frontward motion yet, but she doesn't notice. Definitely worth the money.  Edit: She's now 3 and this is still one of her favorite toys. She can spend hours 'driving' it around the back yard, chasing the dog. It's also a neighborhood hit, the other kids (5 and under) would play with all day if we left it out. :) Our next door neighboor actually had to go buy one for her son, he would cry every time he had to leave the car behind and go home. Still highly recommended.
