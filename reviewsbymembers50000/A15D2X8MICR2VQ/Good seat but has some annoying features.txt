 We bought this seat for my daughter when she was 8 months old.  Only the Evenflo Triumph and the Brittax scored higher in Consumer Reports but the first isn't as versatile and the second is very expensive.  I like the fact it's comfy with lots of padding and sits up high so my daughter can actually see out the window.  It is rather bulky, I drive a Rodeo and it just fits rear facing behind my seat.  Also, the latch strap that came with it didn't reach all the way around to my tethers so we used a longer latch strap we already had.  It doesn't recline much so I wouldn't use it for a baby under 6 months or so.  You're better off with an infant seat anyway.  My only complaints are that the straps do twist quite a bit, it's annoying, but manageable.  I just have to untwist them and arrange them before I go and get her to put in the car.  We didn't have much of a problem installing it in my car, however removing the infant headrest piece took FOREVER.  Overall I think it's a good, safe bet for a convertible car seat.
