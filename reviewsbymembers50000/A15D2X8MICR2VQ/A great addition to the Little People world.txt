 We bought one as a present for our niece, and decided to get one for my daughter since she obviously wanted her cousin's so badly. We've been very happy with this purchase. The animals are adorable and well made, a perfect size for little hands. She's thrilled by the fact that each type of animals comes in pairs, with an easily identifiable "Daddy" and "Mommy". She enjoys lining them up in pairs and idenitifying each type of animal, whether it's the daddy or mommy, and what color it is.  The ark is sturdy, and the removable lid makes it easy for her to put the animals in and take them out again. It's also a fairly good size and holds a fair amount of figures. The other two sets of extra animals aren't that expensive and add a nice variety to the selection of animals. The animals are also big enough and sturdy enough to hold up to a large amount of active play.  Overall I'd definitely buy this toy again. My daughter loves it, (so does my niece) and they'll both be enjoying it for years to come.
