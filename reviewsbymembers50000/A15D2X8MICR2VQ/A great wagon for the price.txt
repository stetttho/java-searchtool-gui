 We bought this for our daughter and so far couldn't be happier. The handle is long enough so that either Mommy or Daddy can pull it which is nice. My daughter also has no problem pulling it all by herself when she decides that her baby dolls need a walk outside. The wheels are wide and turn well, and the seats are low with high sides, so we're not worried about her falling out.  It took us less than 15 minutes to put together and the directions were simple. Our door also sticks when closed, but I kind of like that since it keeps her from opening/shutting it when she's being pulled along on walks. There are also two holes in the floorboard (which comes with removable plastic plugs) so that the wagon is easily drainable if it gets wet.   There's a good amount of storage under the seat for whatever my daughter decides just 'has to' come along for the ride with us. The seatbelts were easy to install, and easy to adjust. The cupholders are a great touch (they also hold Daddy's soda bottle/Mommy's water bottle very nicely).  Overall we're very pleased with this purchase and I'm sure she'll get lots more use out of it in the years to come.
