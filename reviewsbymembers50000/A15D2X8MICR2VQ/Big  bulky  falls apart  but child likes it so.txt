 For those reviewers looking to buy more baby ponies, you can also find the baby ponies packaged with an adult pony at Family Dollar, Dollar General, and other dollar stores that carry toys. They generally cost about $5 for the two ponies.  My daughter recieved it for Christmas and I'm glad that her grandparents only paid $19.99 for it, or I'd of been annoyed. It is cute and she loves 'flying' the ponies up into the clouds and having them ride back down the surfboard. She also loves the fact that it came with two baby ponies (peguasus Honolulu and earth pony Surf Star) and two adult ponies (Ribbon Wishes and Waterfire).   However, it's just too flimsy for normal child play. The juice bar won't lock down, the ponies are always falling out of the sky when the butterfly turns around and the signs and tree are too easy to remove once they've been placed in their holes.   All in all, I'm glad she got it for the ponies (so far this is the only way to buy those exact baby ponies) but I have a feeling it'll end up at a garage sale next summer. I'm just not impressed with Hasbro's playsets for the My Little Pony line so far.
