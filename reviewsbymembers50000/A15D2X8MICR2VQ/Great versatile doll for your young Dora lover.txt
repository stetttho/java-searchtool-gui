 My daughter got this doll for Christmas last year, and it's easily her favorite. She adores all things Dora, but this toy is definitely the most played with of all her toys.  I think the outfits are a little pricey, but if you shop around and wait for sales like the day after Thanksgiving, you can find them at a reasonable cost. We bought them all in one shot last year, and have been doling them out for special occasions. I like the fact the basic doll comes with a puppy, as well as Backpack and a storybook. Each outfit has a separate theme (with coordinating book) and they're constantly adding new outfits to her line, so you can pick and choose which you prefer. My only complaints is getting the shoes and hats to stay on, otherwise my daughter has no problems dressing the doll and getting Dora ready for her adventures.   Overall we're very pleased with this toy purchase and will probably have it for years to come.
