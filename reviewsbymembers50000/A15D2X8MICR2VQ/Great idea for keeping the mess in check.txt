 I bought my daughter these markers and fingerpaints after scrubbing crayon/marker lines off the wall one too many times. So far we've been very pleased. There's a good variety of colors of markers available and lots of different books/pads to choose from. She loves coloring pictures for grandma's fridge and I like that I don't have to search for colors on my walls.  The fingerpaints are rather soft and it's easy to get too much on a little one's fingers if they're not careful. You just have to show them how to carefully (and gently) rub their fingers across the top of the paint color rather than digging in. Also it does take a few seconds for the color to appear on the paper after it's been applied, so that takes a little getting used to.  These are also great for in the car, or when visting someplace where you don't want a mess. My biggest complaint is that the sets are  little pricey, but Toys 'R Us seems to have BOGO sales every 3 or 4 months and I stock up then. Overall we're very pleased with these sets and they make a nice addition to our crayon and marker collection.
