 How can you not love a book that starts with a lone soldier escaping from a secret government installation, carrying the end of the world as we know it in his body?  I re-read it at least once or twice a year, and every time I find something new.  It's totally addictive.  And I admit, when the SARS epidemic intially made headlines around the world, Captain Trips/Super flu was my first thought.  King's amazing abilities take you deep in a world where 99% of the population is dead and the survivors are being drawn into the ultimate war of good vs. evil.  Each character is so unique and real, you have no problem remembering who anyone is (rather amazing is a book of this sheer size).  King also cleverly ties this story into his Dark Tower series, as well as various other stories he's written with his Walkin' Dude, Randall Flag.  A short read it isn't (and definitely much better than watching the mini-series), but it's well worth the time and effort.
