 I bought this for my 2 month old figuring it would be versatile enough she can use it for a long time.  So far she likes the bright colors and the music.  She seems to enjoy following the bugs when they swing as we stroll along.  My only complaint is that it doesn't attach very well to her Graco infant car seat.  If you jostle it, it has a tendency to pop off on that side.  I'm hoping when she gets older it'll fit better on her stroller and carseat.  It does however fit quite nicely on her bassinet.
