 Although the books were smaller than I expected (about 2"x2"), my daughter loves them. The books are very sturdy, so is the carrying case and handle. I think she has as much fun taking them out and putting them back in the case as she does looking at them. She also loves to carry them from room to room pretending it's her bag.   A very cute item that I'd have no problem recommending to a friend.
