 This emmy award winning series picks up right where Attack of the Clones left off. In the course of one hour, audiences will have battle after battle thrown at them. There is small character development, nothing compared to what we get in Vol. 2 but there is some. Mostly this is one big action movie portraying many different battles during the clone wars. I found this whole volume to be very enjoyable. The animation style used is very captivating and never grows old because it is so rich in detail. The bonus features on this dvd are very nice to say the least, trailers, a making of, and  a playable xbox demo for Republic Commando. If you are a fan of Star Wars I strongly recommend this dvd for you along with Vol. 2 (which you can check out my review for) Both dvds together complete the story between Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith. Thanks for reading.
