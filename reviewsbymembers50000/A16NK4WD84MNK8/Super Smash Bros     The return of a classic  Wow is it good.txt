 Melee took many people by suprise as did it's predecessor, and like it's predecessor this game is totally awesome. Melee is very much like the original but on a way bigger scale. The graphics have been improved and look great. The controls are very tight and work basically like the orignal Nintendo 64 ones. Between the numerous characters in the game you will have hundreds of moves at your disposal. A couple new characters I really liked seeing where Young Link and Marth. The sheer amount of new stuff added to this game is overwhelming from the number of levels, characters, unlockables, moves. You will deffinently get your money's worth out of this title. Dont worry about it looking childish. This game is sweet. Trust me and all the other reviewers when I say this is a great game. Buy it for your GameCube. I strongly recommend it. Thanks for reading.
