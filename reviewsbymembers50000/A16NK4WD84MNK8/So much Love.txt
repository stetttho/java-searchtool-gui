 From Russia with Love marks Bond's fourth appearance on the Xbox since Agent under Fire. I'm happy to say Bond's latest outing is a much better game than Agent under Fire and Nightfire, which were both solid enough games. This only means that From Russia with Love is a very, very good game. I would rate it slightly below Everything or Nothing, Bond's 3rd game on the Xbox. This is simply because that game's graphics are a little better and I found there to be more diversity in the gameplay. However, like I said, From Russia with Love is a very sweet game. It offers you the ability to  customize your Bond by upgrading his weapons, gadgets, clothes, etc. There is a vintage, retro feeling that comes with playing this game. I felt like I had been transported into the very movie of the same name, although the game offers much more action than the film, the locations are all the same, as is the basic story. Sean Connery's voice acting is a bit raspy but it is good enough, better than anyone else could have done. The action, graphics, sound, and gameplay are all high quality. I stongly recommend this title to any fan of Bond games. To action fans, I'd say rent. As far as action titles go you could do better. But for fans of Bond, this title is great.
