 I can not help but be moved every time this music plays during the series. I bought this soundtrack about a year ago and it hasn't lost any of its emotion yet. Kamen created a beautiful score for Band of Brothers and for the most part, it can all be heard on this on cd. Sure there are a few minor pieces missing but when you have everything on this disc, who could complain? If you are a fan of the Band of Brothers series, I would recommend you buy this cd. It is deffinently one of the best soundtracks I have ever bought. What can I say, no matter how many times I listen to Band of Brothers, the music gets me every time. Thank you for reading.
