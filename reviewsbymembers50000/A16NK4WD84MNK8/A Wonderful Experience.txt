 I remember being blown away by all the great gameplay qualities of Medal of Honor when it was first released. I was caught up in the 'Saving Private Ryan' feel the game had. It was only until I began replaying the game more that I keyed into the music. WOW! It is nothing short of fantastic. Medal of Honor made me really appreciate the music behind the game. I just recently bought the cd and it is just awesome. As well as bringing back some old memories it also has a few hints to Frontline at points in certain songs. I bought this along with Underground. Medal of Honor is a great compilation of all the music heard throughout the game, so if you've played the game, you know what I'm talking about. I'm going to hopfully order the Frontline soundtrack soon, as I have been completely blown away by the beauty of this and Underground. This and Underground go great together but the stand out tracks in this album are Medal of Honor, Taking out the Railgun, Panzer Attack, The U-boat, and The Road to Berlin. The whole album is fantastic. Buy the whole Medal of Honor soundtrack collection. You wont be dissapointed, especially if you love the games as much as I do.
