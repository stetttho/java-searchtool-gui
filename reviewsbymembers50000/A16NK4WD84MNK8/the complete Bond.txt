 Ever since GoldenEye on the N64, good old 007 has tried numerous times to get back on track with a stellar game. Up until now they have met varying levels of success but all frail in comparison to EA Game's latest Bond adventure. Everything or Nothing is different from all previous Bond titles in that its a third person action title as oppossed to a limited first person shooter. Bond can do most anything you'd expect of him. He rappels, dives, punches, and drives assortments of vehicles while shooting through some very nice locations. Motorcycles, tanks, limos, helicopters, and of course your Aston Martin V12 Vanquish are all at your dissposal. Just make sure to keep them in one piece or you'll have Q all over you in a fit. The gameplay is very smooth and fluent. Bond can interact with most everything in his enviroment and use it to his advantage. The graphics are truly amazing and quite frankly, there aren't too many games that look this good. The game's character models look wonderful, like the real life voice actors such as Pierce Brosnan, Heidi Klum, Shannon Elizebeth, Willam Defoe, Judi Dench, John Cleese, and Richard Kiel. The action sequences are all top notch, worthy of the Bond name. There is a pretty extensive multiplayer component as well that supports 2 player cooperative missions. All in all there is no possible way to go wrong with this game. It is one of the best third person shooters avalible and is quite arguably the best Bond game since GoldenEye. Thanks for reading now go buy this game, you wont regret it.
