 On May 19th 2005, the Star Wars saga was deemed "complete" with George Lucas saying there will be no more movies. However, that does not exclude an animated television series. Return to the adventure of the Clone Wars in Vol. 2 of this emmy award winning series. Vol. 2 In my opinion is better than the first and that is saying a lot. There are only 5 episodes on this volume as opposed to the 20 on the first volume, but, these episodes are longer and more story driven. All together this volume runs an hour just like the first one. The bonus features on this dvd are also better than on the original season. The Lego short film "Revenge of the Brick" and several trailers have been included as well as a making of and now two playable xbox levels from Star Wars Battlefront 2. This volume of the Clone Wars reveals a few interesting things about key characters from the films such as C3P-0 and Grevious. We also see Anakin facing the Jedi trials. And finally, this season leads directly into Revenge of the Sith. Now the saga is complete. Buy this dvd if you enjoy Star Wars. This is as good as it gets next to the big screen flicks. Thanks for reading.
