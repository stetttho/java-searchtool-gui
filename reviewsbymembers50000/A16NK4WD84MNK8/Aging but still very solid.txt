 Nightfire was released in 2002 and still 4 years later it stands strong. It is not as good a game as Everything or Nothing but from a first person shooter's stand point the game is very solid. The vehicle levels are very good as well. Your V12 Vanquish and other vehicles like snowmobiles will provide for some of the best chases ever in a Bond game. The game is a bit too short overall but is catchy enough for the Bond name. The story is interesting and the multiplayer is pretty fun. I can say with a clear consciense that if your a fan of Bond or just an action fan, nearly four years after it's release, Nightfire is still a solid choice when looking for a new game.
