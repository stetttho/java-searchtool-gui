 Earlier this year, Brothers in Arms Road to Hill 30 amazed gamers with its incredible detail and historic acuracy. Earned in Blood doesnt carry such a wow factor as it is more of a continuation rather than a whole new game. This time around, Ubisoft and Gearbox put you in the boots of Cpl. Joe "Red" Hartsock. Your path meshes quite intricatley with the path you took as Baker in the first game. There are many cross over levels that bring back some lovable characters such as Desola, Allen, and Garnett. However, the levels are completely new, filling in the spaces between Hill 30's levels. Earned in Blood offers an assortment of new weapons, the FG-42 being the coolest one in my opinion. There are even new vehicles which are fun to see. Textures in the game have been improved significantly over the first game, but other than that minor change, Earned in Blood looks the same as Hill 30. There is no doubt in my mind that if you enjoyed the first game, this second chapter is very worth your money and time. To new comers of the series, just be cautioned, this game is very brutal at times and the harsh language never lets up. All in all, this is the most realistic WWII experience money can buy. Thanks for reading.
