 Lego Star Wars looked fun, sure. But I wasnt expecting a whole lot from this game. Wow was I mistaken. Lego Star Wars has proven to be one of the richest Star Wars experiences money can buy. The game allows you to play as over 30 different characters from Episodes 1,2, and 3 as you play through these respective episode's plots. The graphics and gameplay are nothing short of great. The humor in this game is hillarious as Lego characters who can not talk try to recreate classic scenes from the films. But then again maybe I'm just a huge Star Wars fan and the game isnt funny at all?....NAA! Trust me, this game is funny even when it is trying hard not to be. The Lego characters are just too dang funny looking I guess. After buying this game a year ago, I still have a lot of fun playing it and the fact that it is two player only extends the replayability. With the one year anniversary of Revenge of the Sith approaching, this game would make a great way to celebrate the prequel trilogy (if anyone other than me does that, lol) Buy this game if you are a Star Wars fan, you wont be dissapointed. Thanks for reading.
