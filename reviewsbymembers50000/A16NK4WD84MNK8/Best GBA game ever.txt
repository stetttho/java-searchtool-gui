 When I first played Mario Kart 64 I fell in love with it and played it day in and day out. When I heard a Mario Kart game was comming to GBA I had to have it. The graphics are great and the sound and music will blow you away. Best of all the fun dosen't stop after you beat it. You can win a new cup and a new racer, Waluigi. My favorite part of this game is the multiplayer racing, where you and up to three friends can duel in four battle levels or race in all the one player courses. this game is so awesome and I highly recomend it. Buy it for your GBA!
