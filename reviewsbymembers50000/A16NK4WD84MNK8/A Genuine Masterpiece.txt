 This album carries a hefty price tag but I assure you, if you are into classical music, or are just a fan of the Battle Royale film, this is for you. Every piece played in the movie has been compiled, well except the credits music, but thats nothing to me. The music in Battle Royale is fast paced, engaging, dramatic, violent, yet beautiful, and overall an excellent listening experience.
