 Here i am at my computer, listening to the Leon soundtrack for the second time today and I dare say Leon is one of the best soundtracks I've ever had the plessure to listen to. Eric Serra gives it his all and it shows. The melodies found throughout are very deep and meaningful. Leon IS my favorite movie and as a fan it was truely great when this cd arrived at my house. The 23 tracks on the disc are strictly orchestational and you wont find the song by Bjork or the final song by Sting, I suggest downloading LimeWire if you wish for those. Otherwise every little piece heard in Leon is on this cd. Highlights of mine are, Ballad for Mathilda, When Leon does his Best, and Two Ways Out. Every song is great but those ring especially true for me. If you enjoyed Luc Besson's epic film, this soundtrack is for you. Buy it, dont even hesitate. Thanks for reading and I hope you found this helpful.
