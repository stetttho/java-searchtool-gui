 Stephen Ambrose's Band of Brothers is a wonderfully written book. It is easy to pick up and hard to put down. I watched the HBO mini-series before reading this book and so much of this book was new for me, expanding on many aspects of the series. If you can't get enough of the series, read the book because it truly is more. There are more characters, battles, and sideplots. I've read this book twice and am considering reading it again very soon. Experience the real life saga of the men of Easy Company, 506th Reg, 101st Airborne. It is the best war book I've ever read. Thanks for reading.
