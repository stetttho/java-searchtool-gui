 lets face this topic first. The standards by which films are made in present day aren't as they once were back in the early 90's. I myself now have to laugh at some of the ridiculous stuff thats going on in the Ninja Turtles movies. No not the comedy, but say the second films lack of plot or the ever changing cast over the three films. HOWEVER! If you were a fan of these movies long ago when growing up, I beleive you will enjoy revisiting these films. The first film is great and today possibly could pass as a B film. The other two are great for fans, admitidly not as good as the first but at the same time, I feel today these flicks might have gone straight to video. Don't get me wrong. I love these movies. They are a part of my childhood and a part of me. Yet, I am saying the above to tell all film enthusiasts that these aren't "Great films" for film fans. They are for fans of the Turtles and as that, these films triumph. Recapture the magic of these films as they are now avalible in this DVD 3 set. and for the cost, I dobt see how anyone could possibly regret buying these sweet movies. Thanks for reading. hope it was helpful.
