 Max Payne on the PC was one of the craziest games I've ever played. I still play it once in a while for nothing more than its all out gunning madness. It truely was a visceral experience from front to finish, which came all too soon. That is probaly my biggest gripe with Max Payne 2 is that it is also somewhat short. Though, there is greatness to be found in this game. The is depth to be found in it's simplicity. The run and gun tactics make for one intense experince that you will easily want to relive. Graphically, Max Payne 2 on the xbox is pretty sweet. There are no reflective effects such as the ones found on the PC and sacrifices have been made in the explosion department, but its likely you wont notice. The game looks and plays too good to complain. The story is deep and lost me on a couple occassions, still this made me want to replay those levels. No matter what your reason, you will want to revisit this game even after beating it quickly the first go around. Xbox shooter fans, do yourselves a favor and buy this game. It is one heck of an experience offering some of the best graphics, rag-doll physics, and gameplay around. Highly recommended.
