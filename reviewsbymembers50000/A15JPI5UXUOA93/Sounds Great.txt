 Okay... I think everyone knows that this is Sarah Brightman's first pop album... It turn out well actually...! The songs in this album are all very enjoyable. Although the lyrics are not very well written (especially those in "Once In A Lifetime" and "When It Rains in America"), the arrangement and melody of the songs are wonderful. Sarah Brightman sounds cute in "Captain Nemo"... Although I don't really know what the song is talking about, it's still cute... Especially when she sings "Captain Nemo says Okay!".. He! He! "Ship of Fools" is perhaps the most relaxing and sensible song in the whole album...It is just a simple song actually...-- With just voice and a piano accompaniment. It leads smoothly into the next songs "Once In A Lifetime" which is more techno. "La Mer" is perhaps the most interesting song in the whole album.... It is first of all techno and it's creative. The opening sounds oriental...And it leads to a whole phrase of whispering by Sarah Brightman... Cool! The last track which is called "The Second Element 2" has the same melody as track 3--"The Second Element"... However, it gives you a totally different feel. While track 3 is more pop, track 15 is actually more country-like... And they have different lyrics. I bought this album just recently, 7 years after it was released! After listening to Sarah Brightman's "La Luna" I decided that I wanted to hear more of Sarah Brightman's pop... Therefore, I search high and low for this album. This album is not very avaliable in Singapore now, but luckily, I managed to find it at Borders (Singapore branch)...at a more expensive price... I can say that the pop is this album is better than the pop in Ms Brightman lastest album... So if you want to hear the better of Ms Brightman's pop... Buy this!
