 This album is simply fantastic! It reflects all Sarah Brightman's talents and ablities! "Time To Say Goodbye" is simply good. Singing with Bocelli is the highlight of this album. Although I don't really like the way Bocelli sings this song, it still sound great with Sarah Brightman using her pure voice. "No One Like You" is a very simple and slow song. However, the introduction is very refreshing. It sounds as if you're in a very mysterious and peaceful world. "There For Me" is very dramatic and romantic song. However, I don't particularly like the way the duet sounds. Jose Cura is simply drowning Sarah Brightman out in the chorus. This is an album having Sarah Brightman as the artist... Not Jose Cura! Maybe it got something to do with the recording...   "Who Wants to Live Forever" is a remarkable track. I personally feel that the orchestration is good and that Sarah Brightman sound like her real self. The song is very sad and Sarah Brightman is able to bring out the feel of sadness with a touch of innocence behind the voice. It's amazing! "Naturaleza Mueta" is another track that need to be praise. It is very tuneful and the chorus is powerful! What impress me most with this album is the tracks "Allelujah" and "O Mio Babion Caro". Sarah Brightman is really singing opera here! Although she screech at the last few notes in "Allelujah" (destroys the opera-ness of the voice)she still sounded great with the rest. Her running notes is even and clear and her feelings in the songs are correct! Time To Say Goodbye is really a great album... Listen to it and you will know :-)
