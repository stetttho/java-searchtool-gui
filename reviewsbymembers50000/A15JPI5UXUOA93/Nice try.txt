 Coco's voice is sexy and it's suitable for most of the songs. However, it is sad to say that among the 10+ songs, only about 3 is nice like "Do You Want My Love", "Before I Fall In Love" and "Just No  Other Way". The others songs sounds rather alike.... Just like Track 6  is just a variation of track 7... Not much difference, but it's a nice try  since this is her first time in the U.S. market. I think the people from  the U.S. maybe a bit prejudice against Coco because this is the first time  an Asian actually break into the U.S. music industry and people tend to  compare her with America's very own singers. Maybe wait for a few albums  later and she'll be as good as other singers in America....
