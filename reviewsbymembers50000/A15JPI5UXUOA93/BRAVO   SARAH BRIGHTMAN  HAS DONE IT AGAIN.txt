 BRAVO!  Sarah Brightman has done it again!  "Eden" is a terrific CD with songs of different genres like classical, pop and so on. The first track "In Paradisum" sounds like a Gregorain Chant and  with the background music (sitar and orchestra) Sarah Brightman sounds  refreshing and beautiful. The song "Eden" is somehow pop-like and  it has some kind of chanting in its background... This clearly shows  Sarah's ability to sing pop music. Beside singing original songs written  for her, she also sing cover version of "Dust In The Wind"  (Kansas) and "My Heart Will Go On" (Celine Dion). Another of my  favourite is Track 15. And that's "Nessun Dorma" by famous  italian composer Puccini. "The Last Word You Said" is also  another wonderful song. It starts off with the beautiful sound of an oboe  and it continues with the clear and touching voice of Sarah Brightman and I  suppose this song is the most romantic song of all the songs in this CD.  All in all this is a great CD and it will be a great loss if you don't buy  it. To end my review I would like to say SARAH IS THE BEST! :-)
