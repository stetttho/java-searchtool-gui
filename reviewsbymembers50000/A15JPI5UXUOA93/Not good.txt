 I am a fan of Sarah Brightman... But not so much after listening to this album... I had to be honest to say that this album is a real disappointment... Sarah Brightman's interpretation of "Ave Maria" is weak. Why did she sing this piece in an airy and tired voice when she could sing in a more operatic voice? It is the opening track and it, of course, spoils the whole mood... "Winter Light" in my opinion, is just an average track. Her voice  is sweet and gentle, but overall this track makes you sleep...ZZZzzzz... "Alhambra"... almost similar to "Winter Light" (in the way she sings)... Average... "Dans La Nuit"... Some operatic qualities in her voice... But not as good as last time... And as usual she sounds tired (and it seems that she is not concentrating on her song)... The new recordings of her old songs: "O Mio Babbino Caro"... The old recording is better... This new version has quite a few flaws: 1) Pronounciation (I think she was concentrating too much on her sound production that she forgot about her pronounciation...) 2) Sound production (It isn't too good although she seems to be concentrating a lot on it... It seems to straining... As if she is going to get a sore throat singing another line...) I am not saying her old version is flawless, but it was at least better than this one... "Pie Jesu"... Still the original one is better... I think her voice is fuller in the original version... This new one?? Her voice seems to be thin although the crystal clear quality is still there... Overall, this album is not very good... Not as good as her other albums... It you want to buy her albums, try "Eden" and those earlier...
