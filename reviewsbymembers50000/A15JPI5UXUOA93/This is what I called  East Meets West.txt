 "The Last Emperor"'s soundtrack consists of music that is really "East Meets West"...  Every track is special... You can hear chinese instruments, like the pipa and erhu, playing at this moment and then through smooth transition western instruments, like the violins, take over the melody... The melodys sound very Chinese in most of the tracks, while some of the tracks sounds really western... Good mix! What impress me most is the track entitled "Main Title Theme [The Last Emperor]"... It gives listeners an imperial China feel and it is really relaxing. Most of all, I think the music written for this movie is the best I have ever heard... You can hear lots of effort being put in writting it. It also sounds better than the soundtrack of "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" as it does not attempt to squeeze in any so called pop songs to destroys the whole effect of the soundtrack. Finally, the music here is what I really called "East Meets West"... Buy this soundtrack! You will be surprised at how the composer managed to mix eastern and western instruments together to produce such beautiful music!
