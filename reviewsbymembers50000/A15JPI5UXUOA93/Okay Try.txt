 Okay, I admit that Coco Lee can sing a bit better than Britney Spears... But I think that her voice is rather thin although she can sing all the "Ah"s and "Ee"s in R&B The songs in this album seems to be repeating itself... However,  there are some nice numbers like "Do You Want My Love", "Just No Other Way", "Before I Fall In Love" and "All Tied Up"... Other than that, the songs are just like variations of this or that tracks. Further more, most the songs in this album are in slow numbers except for the 1st track which is more exciting... The others can put you slowly to dreamland... As simple as that :-) People in Asia should not buy this album because it is not as good as her Chinese albums. Further more, since Coco Lee hit the U.S. market, she has become more cocky than ever. People in U.S. should buy this album because you would be able to hear a bit more better singing than Britney Spears.
