 Sarah Brightman is famous for her flexibilty in vocal style. One moment she can go pop, another moment she can go broadway and another moment she can go opera.  Although this album is all of Andrew Lloyd Webber's works, she amazingly presents all the songs in the different vocal styles. She did wonderfully for songs like "Phantom Of The Opera", "Music Of The Night", "Pie Jesu" and "Chanson D'Enfance". "Phantom Of The Opera" is a very unique song. Before she sings an opera melisma at the end of the piece, she is actually using her broadway voice! The song grips me and some credit of it should go to Michael Crawford who sang the duet with her too! He also sounds great! I had seen and heard Sarah Brightman sing in the concert for Andrew Lloyd Webber's birthday in a VCD. Her "Pie Jesu" sounded more trained and mature in the concert than it is in this CD. However, I still prefer the version in this CD because it is sort of an original recording of Sarah Brightman many years ago. It sounded more innocent, more sweet! "Music Of The Night" is thumbs-up! Although many people say that Sarah Brightman has a small voice, it is not true! She sounded all powerful in "Music Of The Night"! I bought this CD after hearing Sarah Brightman in a concert. She sounded good! And the CD is definately not a disappointment!
