 La Luna is yet another great album that Sarah Brightman has produced!    The first track is a rather meditative track which makes you  "float". However, it leads to the pop-like song "Winter In  July" which destroys the meditative effect. I would rather it lead to  songs like "Figlio Perduto" or "Hijo De La Luna" which  is more quiet and mysterious. But anyway, "Winter In July" is  still a great song with really catchy beat.  Sarah sounds the best in  tracks like "Scarborough Fair", "How Fair This Place",  "La Califfa", "Solo Can Te" and "La Luna".  Perhaps this is because she has make use of her beautiful and crystal-like  soprano voice. Personally, I feel the best of all the tracks is "La  Luna". Sarah Brightman is able to bring out the feeling of the song  which is simply breath-taking (and it ends with the song "Moon  River", isn't it?)! Wow! Overall, "La Luna" is a great  album ought not to be missed! Better get this album now people!
