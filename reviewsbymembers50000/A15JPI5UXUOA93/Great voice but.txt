 I personally feel that this album is much better than her  previous albums---"Voice Of An Angel" and "Charlotte Church". Charlotte Church does have a beautiful voice... Clear and sweet... But to me her voice is not yet the opera-type of voice ... She still need lots of practice. If you want real opera voice, try C. Bartoli or other more mature and properly- trained singers. Charlotte Church is still young and her vibrato is still uneven, especially on all those high-notes. I agree with most people that her voice quality is still of a boy soprano. The recording of the songs in this album are not of great quality... Charlotte Church sounds most of time... Muffled. However, songs like "Silent Night" and "The Little Drummer Boy" did turn out quite well on this album. These songs did bring out the good side of her singing. On the whole this album sounds boring... Irritating sometimes, especially when she sing those high-notes in "Ding Dong! Merrily on High"... They just come out suddenly and give me a great shock! If you want Christmas album, do not buy this one... But if you want to hear the voice of this young "opera" singer, buy it... Her voice is not great buy still enjoyable. 2 stars--- 1 for her sweet voice and 1 for songs like "Dream A Dream". 3 un-starts--- 1 more her un-opera voice, 1 for screaming for some of her songs and 1 for the bad recording!
