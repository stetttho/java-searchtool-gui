 Enya's music still sounds the same as before, but who says she's boring? There's no need for electric guitars and stuffs to make the music sound nice... If this is so, masterpieces from the Classical period would have been thrown into the bin right now...! Enya has not ran out of creativity. The album reflects Enya's unique personal style which she is persistant in throughout the years. Her sense of personal style is so strong that you can hear the music and say "Ah... That's Enya, right?" even though you have never heard the piece before! Personally, I think "Wild Child" and "Only Time" are the most beautiful tracks in this album. They are beautifully sang and the orchestration is good.  The other tracks are simply refreshing and heavenly. Listen to it and you will not be disappointed! Buy it!
