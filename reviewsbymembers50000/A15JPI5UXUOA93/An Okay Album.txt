 Alright, I wouldn't say that this album is bad because there is still nice tracks like "S' Wonderful", "Cry Me A River" and "The Look of Love"... Ms Krall sounded nice in these tracks as she manages to bring out the right feeling.... Other than that, I think this album is a disappointment... The rest of the tracks sounded quite boring. Ms Krall sounded tired and I couldn't really catch the melody.... Buy this album is you are really crazy over Diana Krall... If you're not and wants to listen to this album anyway... Just borrow this disc from a friend if he/she has it....
