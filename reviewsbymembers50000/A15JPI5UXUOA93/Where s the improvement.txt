 Charlotte Church still sounds the same... Cold and boring... After 3 albums, I expect this album to be a lot better, but after listening to it, I find it (still) a disappointment... Where's the improvement? I think the main problem with this album is the choice of songs. I think Miss Church would do better singing songs specially written for her (like a pop star?). Most of the songs she sing in this album have better versions, sang by more mature singers with better interpretation and techniques.  Her version of "Habanera" is especially weak. I would prefer it if she sings the original version of this famous aria... With notes and orchestral accompaniment exactly the same as the one Bizet had written. However, I don't think Miss Church would sound very good singing the original version either. Her voice is still of a boy-soprano quality which would not be strong and expressive enough for this aria which is demanding ---usually sang by more mature and established opera singers. She is trying to sound more mature here... But I think it wasn't that successful... Her version of "The Little Horses" is a bit too slow for me and the accompaniment seems too loud. I would like this track better if she did it a little faster. However, I still think that a singer which much lower and deeper voice would do this song better. :-) "The Laughing Song" is straining... Especially on those high notes!!! EEEEEKKKKKSSSS!!!! The more outstanding tracks (I think) are "Carrickfergus" and "Papa Can You Hear Me?"... Other than that, the other tracks just isn't too well sung to leave a deep impression.... I hope Miss Church's next album would be better....
