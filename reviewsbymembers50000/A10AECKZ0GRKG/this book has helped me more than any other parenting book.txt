 I disagree with the reviewer below. This book explains why kids act the way they do, it doesn't excuse their behavior or give them a license to sin because of it. I understand my children SO much better than before I read this book. They all know their temperaments and they can spot others' temperaments right away. This helps us understand people. It has helped me understand my husband where I didn't in almost 20 years of marriage. I understand my sister and where she used to offend me now I realize she just tends to be flaky. :) I could say so much about this book. I truly think every parent should read it. I like the one for adults as well.  Last but not least this book even helped me understand myself. To me this book isn't unbiblical. It helped me in all good ways. I know how to specifically pray for my children and them understanding why they are prone to do the things they do or feel the way they feel....it's all good. I can't say enough good things about this book.
