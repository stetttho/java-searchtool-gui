 Okay, I bought this at Target. Came home and decided to check Amazon for reviews. Freaked out. Thought of taking it back. However, I was in the mood for watching it right then so I decided to keep it and re-sell it later. On the first show, I saw a spot that was most likely edited. I was really looking, though, because of the negative comments that I had read here. Otherwise, I may not have noticed it. I then forgot about the editing controvery and we have now watched almost a dozen episodes and I haven't noticed any other evidences of it. The music may be different (I wouldn't have noticed) and the episodes may be shorter but they are still funny and worth seeing. We do not get cable in our home so seeing these old shows in reruns is not an option for my family and I really wanted my children to see these. So, I'm glad I bought this season and would recommend it to Cosby show fans-although obviously not the "purist" ones. lol...
