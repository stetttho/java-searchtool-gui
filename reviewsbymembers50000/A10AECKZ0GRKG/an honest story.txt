 I completely disagree with the negative reviewer below, whom I doubt has even read the book.  Carole had every right to share her story. Every story involves others, unless it's about a loner and a pond called "Walden." Give ME a break, reviewer. I might agree with you if this were another book on Diana, but this story is about a woman who suffered incredible loss, losing the 3 main people in her life all within one month during a certain summer. She has done nothing wrong in mentioning the "forbidden" names of JFK Jr. and Carolyn B. Kennedy. It's not like this was a book written by a housemaid or personal assisstant. I think it's amazing what Carole has lived through and I'm very happy for her that she's reclaimed her life. I believe her when she says writing this book was therapy for her. I know writing has helped me while recovering from a long chronic illness. I think this book could give others strength and undoubtedly empathy while going through losses of their own. If reading stories of the ultra private Kennedy clan bothers you then forego this book. Otherwise take it as the story of a young woman who suffered greatly but has lived to tell the tale. May others be helped by her experience.
