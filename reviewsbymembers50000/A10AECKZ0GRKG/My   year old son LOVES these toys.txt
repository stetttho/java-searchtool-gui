 I ran into Toys R Us on Christmas Eve last year to find another toy for my son (I wanted him to have a certain amount) and saw these on an end display. I bought a box, wrapped it, and put it under the tree. He absolutely LOVED playing with these. So did his siblings. They spent hours and hours for weeks making all kinds of cool concoctions. We have since added several more sets to our family. I came here today to buy a set for a birthday this weekend for a 13 year old family friend who still enjoys building things. Great toy!!
