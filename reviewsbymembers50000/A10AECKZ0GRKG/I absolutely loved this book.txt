 I had trouble putting this book down. I only did to make it last longer. Celia totally loved her garden. She wrote about the flowers she planted, the birds who came to visit, and her battle with slugs. How I pulled for her to defeat those slugs! This book had me itching to work in my own garden. I plan to read it every spring. If you find  it interesting reading about other people's exploits with their own gardens then you should enjoy this delightful book.
