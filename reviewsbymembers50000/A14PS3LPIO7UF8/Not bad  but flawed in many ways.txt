 I am a Sufi (Muslim mystic) who finds in quantum physics many ideas that do not contradict the belief system I accepted, and other religious ideas that are found in other traditions. When I watched WTBDWK, I found myself cross refrencing many of the concepts of Quantum Physics with what I read in the Qur'an, Hadith, and books like the Tao Ti Chieng. It was refreshing that these ideas are translated into terminology that is acessable to Western psychology and modern science.  The presentation had many favorable elements to it. I like CGI as much as anyone does; and modern cinematic styles are wonderful vehilces for artistic expression.  However, the movie did go too far in some parts. The dance number that arose from the alcoholic Bacchanalia the protagonist found herself in was as irritaing as it was ridiculous. At times, the movie's pacing went too fast, or lingered in places that seemed to overemphasis ideas to the point of irrelevence.   It was a great idea, and has redeeming qualities: but posesses serious flaws. Perhaps it will inspire another director to tackle the subject from a new and fresh perspective - as WTBDWK attempted to do and fell a bit short.
