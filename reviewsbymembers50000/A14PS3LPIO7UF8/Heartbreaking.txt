 Mr. Milkowski did a marvelous job of telling the story of "The World's Greatest Bass Player". It made me sad to read, though.  I gave this review the title "Heartbreaking" because I knew Jaco. We were not close freinds, but I used to run into him often; we both lived in New York City. Now, everyone who lived in NYC at the time had a "Jaco Story"; some outrageous anecdote of his antics. But I'd like to share something a bit different.  One night Jaco and I were hanging out in the Village. He and I were talking, mostly about music. But in the midst of the conversation, he told me "You know, I tell people that I like to party and take chances; but the truth is I wish I could give up drinking and drugs. But I don't know how". I didn't know what to tell him, and I don't remember how I replied; nor can I say what prompted him to say this to me.  Four years later he left town and never returned.  Despite his demons and his sickness; in addition to Jaco being an astonishing musician, he was, when he was "himself", a really nice and likeable guy.
