 The Sun at Midnight is the beginning of an historical phenomenon; Sufism indigenous to the USA. Galian explains Sufism and the Ahlul Bayt Mysteries in a way that is acessable to the unique psychology of the Western mind. He takes it further by offering, often in very subtle ways, practical applications of these spiritual concepts. He accomplishes this without severing the link with the history and essense of Islamic mysticism. This book came into my life in an interesting way. It was during Ramadan (the month when Muslims fast during the daylight hours). I was to meet with a freind and visit a mosque. We never hooked up. I found myself at Sufi Books in New York City. By coincidence (HA! HA!) Lawrence Galian was holding a book signing for the release of The Sun at Midnight. I hung out and spoke with the author. I was impressed with him personally. Then he read for the audience selections from his book. I was astonished. It spoke directly to my soul. I purchased a copy from him, and we'd remained freinds since.  The copies I bought from amazon.com were gifts to freinds.
