 it is hard for me to be completly objective about Meshell Ndegeocello because she's a close friend of mine. But I wanted to share a few thoughts about Dance of the Infidel. Meshell seems to be playing the role of enabler. Her role seemed almost maternal. She created a canvas, and presented some brilliant musicians with the oportunity to paint at will. All those who contributed are to be congradulated for an outstanding job. The thing that I get from this CD is that it is a seperate entity from her Spirit of Music enselbe's live performances. I attended several of their perfomances and each time they were unique. This CD seems to have captured a different vibe of the SOM. The live performnaces were a dance: the CD is a painting. I am writing this on 8/20/05. I spoke to Meshell yesterday and she's working on a new CD. I know nothing about it, but I bet it will explore uncharted territory, as has all her releases. Meshell is a beautiful and unique person. We are fortunate to have someone like her.
