 I gave this movie five stars because of the powerful example and accomplishments of Bruce Lee.  The fight scenes were an object lesson for anyone who apires to master something in this life. His abilities in this are almost superhuman, and clearly legendary.   The scene where he demonstrates the Art of Fighting Without Fighting is brilliant. It reminds me of a story when someone called Joe Louis a nigger. The man who insulted the great boxer walked away with no injuries, and when one of Louis' aquaintances asked why he didn't deck the man, Louis said "If someone insulted Enrico Carusoe (the great opera singer) whould he have sang him an aria?" In other words, the lout simply wasn't worthy of being the recipiant of a Lee style ass whuping. True artistry, true mastery!  I was personally impresed with the first scene wherein Lee's character spoke to his own master, and then to one of his students. In his comments are to be found a wealth of wisdom. I am a musician and I also teach music. I tell my music students to watch that scene: everything they need to know about music is in those comments: all else is detail.  All this seamlessly woven into an action / adventure film.
