 As I understand it, Coltrane could have taken some time to be interviewd. While I'd have loved to hear what he had to say, I am giving this five stars.  With all three selections, he is clearly conscious of the time constraints; yet the artistry is not in any way compromised. Impressions was great, especially with the duet between Trane and Elvin Jones. I've always loved Afro Blue; and he plays it beautifully. And Alabama makes you feel the pain that inspired the song; the reaction to the bombing of a black church in Alabama. One is especially touched by the look on Jone's face at the end of the song while Coltrane is making his statement.  What words exist that could describe the experience of listening to Coltrane, or watching him as he created his masterworks? His music is one of humanity's greatest treasures.
