 I bought this recording when it was first released. I don't remember what prompted me to do so, but after the first listen, all I could say was "Damn!" I still say "Damn!" when I think about it. In the realm of funk / neo-soul, nobody can touch Meshell. Nobody. What really sets her apart and is probably the subtle undercurrent of what makes her so special is her sincerity. Most artists hide behind their music. Meshell reveals herself. One listen, and you know who and what she is. Her inner heart is thrown into raw sharp relief, and the intimacy one experiences listening to her is painful, and makes you fall in love with her at the same time. The CDs that followed were all stylistly different; yet held true to the above description. Artists like her are rare, and a great treasure for humanity.
