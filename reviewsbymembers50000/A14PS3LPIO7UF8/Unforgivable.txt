 Don't pay money to see this. Wood Harris is not a bad actor; quite the antithesis. He made a heroic effort to portray a man whose persona, mannerisms, and "vibe" simply cannot be immitated. Kudos to Mr. Harris for his bravery. The director did a mediocre job bringing life to a badly written script. Granted, Hendrix' story had a great deal of tragedy; but I have it on good authority that Hendrix was also a lot of fun to be around.  The scene that described his death was not historicaly accurate: and I know people who were personally aquainted with Hendrix and were around when he died: and they told me what REALLY happened that day. The music was marred by the fact that nobody can play the guitar like Hendrix without sounding like someone trying to immitate him, and Hendrix' estate refused to allow them to use any of his original compositions. The glossing over of the music; which was Hendrix' greatest accomplishment, was truly irritating. All it was was sensationalism and Hollywood glamor: all flash and no substance - which does a great disservice to Hendrix' legacy, musical genius, and life. The whole thing made me sick.
