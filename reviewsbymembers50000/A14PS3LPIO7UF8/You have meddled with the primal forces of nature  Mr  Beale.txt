 Mr. Chayevsky has made, easily, one of the greatest contributions to the art of cinema; one that transcends mere entertainment and holds court within the realm of the social, psychological, and political. My fellow reviewers have been eloquent in pointing out the details, merits, and slight flaws within this movie. But what I am impressed with is how the film exposes the horrifying economic and social realities of our time. Ned Batty's brief scene in the confrence room with Finch's Beale character has proven itself to be frighteningly accurate in its decription of the disingenous oligarichal tyranny we live under today.  No video collection should be without "Network": nobody can afford to ignore this film.
