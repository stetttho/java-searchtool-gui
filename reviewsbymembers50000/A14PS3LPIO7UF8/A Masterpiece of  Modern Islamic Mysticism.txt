 This story has everything one could want. It in no way conflicts with Sufism and its spirit and beliefs, it is well written, moderatly fast paced, and thrilling and adventurous - something you don't expect from Sufi writings. One walks away from reading this book transformed. Mr. Karchmar is a genius of Sufi fiction. His work is among the newly forming stages of a tradition of Sufism / Islam in the West.
