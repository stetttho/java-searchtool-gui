 This is a comedy that is not the slightest bit funny. It failed to get so much as a snicker from me. The script could have presented all kinds of comdedic situations; yet it gave no character any depth and missed every single oportunity to exploit its own potential. The direction, insipid and uninspired. The acting, with the exception of Rip Torn, was amaturish and bored at best.   The cinematography wasn't bad, but got overshadowed by the inane and sophmoric script and acting.  Its so bad it could be used to punish incorrigable criminals: "You have been charged with two counts of armed robbery. I sentence you to watch Rolling Kansas".   Thomas Church should be physicaly punsihed for making this movie.
