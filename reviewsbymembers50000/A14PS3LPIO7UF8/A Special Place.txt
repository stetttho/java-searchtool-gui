 On an analytical level, Axis: Bold as Love was a landmark because Hendrix had mastered the art of using the recording studio as a musical instrument in itself. Techniques like flanging and backwards recording were new, but not unique to Axis: yet he took it to a level undreamed of. Hendrix' guitar playing was, needless to say, almost superhuman in its expressive ability. Beyond this, "Axis" is like a mythical magickal land I could visit at will. Just put on the headphones, press "play", and you were on a journey in a new world, and alternate universe where the commonplace was always a new experience, where the joy and anguish of life took on new dimensions, and where all possibilities and dreams were no longer out of reach. This is a special musical masterpiece.
