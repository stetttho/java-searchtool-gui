 "Alchemy in Middle Earth" illustrates how the great J. R. R. Tolkien wove Islamic and Judeo-Christian mystical symbology throughout the Lord of the Rings. I found myself re-reading this book several times. I am a Muslim and I made gifts of this book to some Imams (Islamic "ministers") of my aquaintance. They were all impressed with the content of the book and of the brilliant scholarship of both Tolkien and Shelton.
