 Adapting a Hesse novel to film is no easy task. In his introduction to Steppenwolf, Hesse said that almost no one under the age of 50 would understand the book; but cest la vie. I first read the book in my teens. I would come back to it several times through teh next three decades. It impressed me very differently each time.  Max Von Sidow is perfect as Harry Haller. An outwardly respectable man who is fighting a war within himself between his "human" and "animal" nature. He meets Hermine, the woman who helps him find some enjoyment in his life. A jazz musician named Pablo completes the picture, with his "refreshments" that permit Harry to enter the Magic Theater. Therein he comes face to face with all the repressed elements of his psyche; and after a series of crisis, comes to accept the whole of his being; and "Laugh with the Immortals".  There are some parts of the movie that are a bit dated. Some that are very very "German" for an American palete. Some that could have been done a bit differently (and it would be interesting to see how a talented director of today, with an appropriate CGI budget, could handle this). but all in all, it is a very good movie.
