 This album finished the stage of development Hendrix achived with Are You Experienced and Axis: Bold as Love. It brought all the monumental elements of his music, the masterful guitar playing and songwriting, and groundbreaking record production, to an appogee: and at the same time prepared the way for the next stage of his musical development.   Here, Hendrix defined the parameters of all music to follow him. His are the standards by which music, electric guitar playing, and record production must forever be measured. "1983, a Merman I Should Turn to Be / Moon Turns the Tides, Gently, Gently Away" is a mythological dreamscape that pushes all envelopes. In the space of 15 minutes he actually turned mankind into an aquatic creature! "Voodoo Chile" was more than a long bluesy jam. It contains everything in the blues pantheon, and is delivered with an intensity that challanges human endurance. And the lyrics were a mythology all their own. And songs like "All Along the Watchtower", Voodoo Chile (Slight Return)", "The Burning of the Midnight Lamp", and others show that he was still the master of the "pop" song form, while elevating it to the level of fine art.
