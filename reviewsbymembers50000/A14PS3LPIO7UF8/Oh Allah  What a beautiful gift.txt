 This is one of my "desert island" CDs. I could easily echo my esteemed fellow reviewers in describing this music's Tuarg roots. But all I will say is that this music is pure beauty. Pure peace. A journey through an earthly paradise. An experience of unutterable joy. One of humanity's great treasures.
