 I'm giving this 5 starts because its Hendrix.  I agree that the editing could be better. And it seemed like the first part of the concert Hendrix was struggling to get things going. But once he did, that was all she wrote!  I can't listen to his Star Spangled Banner without getting chills. In that moment, in that short piece of unexpected unrehersed music, Hendrix grabbed the whole of the USA by the neck, looked it in the eye and said "You broke your covenent with God, and your promise to your people!" Who else could have bore the weight of such a musical statement?  We should be grateful that a Hendrix once walked the earth. With all due respect to Beck, Reid, Vai, and others; when we speak of the realm of heavily amplified electric guitar, in the end, there is only Hendrix. There will never be another like him.
