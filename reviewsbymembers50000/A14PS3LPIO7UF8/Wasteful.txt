 I am in full accord with those who wrote nothing but invective for this film. I read the first four of Anne Rice's vampire novels, and found them to be brilliant. I also enjoyed the film adaptation of "Interview with a Vampire".  I watched "Queen of the Damned" several times. I compared it to the novels, and attempted to judge it on its own merits. I failed to find within it a single redeeming feature. Perhaps some brave soul with a decent budget, writers, and crew - not to mention the cooperation of Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, etc., will make new films that will do justice to Ms. Rice's outstanding artistic vision.
