 Don't get me wrong; the movie is great. The directing, the acting, the script, all first rate. A brilliant work. Its just too creepy! I was truly disturbed by it. I felt almost betrayed by the cast and director to some malignant plan that had manipulated my sense of expectation.  I saw it once. It'll be in my head until the day I die.
