 Ah yes, the Old Klopstikian Song of Love! Million Dollar Legs begins by placing Fields on the throne of an improbable country where goats and nuts reign supreme, the economy is in shambles, political hierarchy is determined by physical strength, and all the women are named Angela. From there, it weird. But the whole movie is ankle deep and head first in good clean fun, political intrigue, slapstick comedy, love, sexual inuendo, and athletic improbabilities.  "Oh father, they won't hurt him will they?" "Only for about two hours. Then they'll shoot him"  This movie is a masterpiece of comedy!! Why isn't it on DVD? Are those lawyers at the movie studios insane?
