 Lilith's Brood (a complilation of the three books in Butler's Xenogenesis trilogy) is a unique look at the nature of the human race. The Onkalis, a race of beings whose purpose is to genetically unite with all life forms they encounter, save and revive humanity after a nuclear war. They meet with all manner of resistance from humans who want their independence; but also meet with human colaberation in ways they didn't expect. One shining example of Bulter's genius is in the nature of the Onkali's technology. Every single manifestation of their technology comes from genetic engineering. They do not build houses, spacecraft, tools, etc.; they grow them. They design, using their own body chemistry, the DNA sequences that will cause organic matter to become what they need. Using things like metal or wood or plastic to build something is almost beyond their comprehension. They also inform Lilith that humanity has within it a self-destruct mechanism in the form of a genetic conflict between intelligence and hierarchy. I advise the reader to meditate on this, and compare the idea with your own impressions of the history of humanity. One final impression that I got was that there is no way that a man could have ever come up with this story. Only a woman could have imagined this. I say this because, in general, the main psychological difference between men and women (with intriguing exceptions) is that women work their will internally and process thoughts and emotions externally. Men are the exact opposite. Butler's story illustrated this in a subtle yet powerful way.
