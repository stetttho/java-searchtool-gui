 Yusef's ability to offer a perfectly executed musical note, one that resonates to the depths of your soul, is in itself evidence of the Creator's handiwork. His offering on this recording is sheer beauty. When Yusef plays a simple melody, he makes each note, each phrse speak volumes. When he plays "out", he is not like most who sound like they're searching for something: he found it. He knows what he's doing. A truly civilized nation would recognize him as a national treasure.
