 Darby Conely's characters and their interactions are a work of comedy genius. It is impossible for me to read "Get Fuzzy" without howling with laughter. Bucky Cat is a lunatic. Although we have a general idea that he is a semi-violent egomaniac with a twisted perspective, his actions and passions are absolutely unpredictable. One can't help but love and feel for Satchel the Dog. He's sweet and loveable and not very bright. Rob the human is caught in the middle of the interplay between these two.   I gave a copy of this and another of Darby Conley's "Get Fuzzy" collections to my mother when she was recovering from an operation to remove a cancerous tumor from her lung. She loved it; and it raised her spirit so much that it eased her recovery. Laughter is indeed the best medicine!
