 I can't add too much to the other reviews here: all of which, I must say, are very interesting, and from a great variety of perspectives and artistic sensitivities. However, I'd like to contribute something a bit different.  My favorite parts of this movie (indeed, all the "Lecter" movies) are the various dialogues that Hannibal Lechter delivers with those he interacts with. The Lechter / Graham conversations, while appearing like a fireside chat between James Dean and Aleister Crowley hinted at brilliant insights that Lechter posessed. Case in point: when Graham first visited Lechter in his cell. Lechter alluded to his imagination which was what they had in common and what seperated them from the other "poor dullards", and told him that "fear is the price of our instrument. It takes experience to master it".   Demented as he is, Lechter mastered his own fears and faced unflinchingly the consequences of all his actions. How many of us can honestly say the same thing?  That alone is worth taking the time to watch the film.
