 Those who were not around then cannot imagine what a shock Hendrix was. To everyone. He completly destroyed any and all ideas about what music was and what the electric guitar was capable of. He earned the undying love of the progressive minded, and the eternal ire of the close minded! What really boggles the mind is that despite the fact that he emerged "fully formed" as it were, and accomplished so much in only one album, he had, at the time of his passing, already outgrown what he'd done on Are you Experienced, and was headed towards more groundbreaking musical adventures.
