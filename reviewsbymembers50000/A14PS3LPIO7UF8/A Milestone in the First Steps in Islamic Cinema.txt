 Being an American convert to Islam, I was delighted that this movie had been made. When I first saw it, I was moved to tears. Granted, some elements of the production may seem dated now. But the overall effect, and heroic and herculean effort of producing such a movie to begin with, overshadow this small flaw. It is a classic in what will be a growing genre of Islamic cinema.  It also has the needed effect of demonstrating the true essense and humble beginnings of the religion of Islam: something that is desperatly needed in today's world.   I do volunteer work as an Imam (Islamic "minister") in the prisons in New York City. It is a tradition in some facilities to show this movie during Ramadan.  I read the reviews the preceeded mine. A complaint that came up is that Muhammad himself was never shown. One must understand that this is part of the essense of Islam in that it rejects idolarty in all its forms. To show the person of Muhammad would threaten the spirituality of the Message he was sent to give us. The director solved this problem in a very ingenous manner.   Perhaps in the future, some ambitious director will attempt a remake of this film. I eagerly anticipate seeeing it; as well as other dramatic (or comedic!) films made from the Muslim perspective.  I recommend this to everyone.
