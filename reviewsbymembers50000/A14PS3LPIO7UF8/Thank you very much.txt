 A truly strange movie. It has moments of hilarity, pathos, and unadulterated surrealism. Sometimes you scratched your head and said "What?" But that was part of the strange charm of the movie.  Campbell's portrayal of Elvis was great, his narrative of his abandonment of stardom beliveable in a twisted way, and the one-liners he used were memorable: e.g. "Its been two presidential elections since I had a boner like that". And Ossie Davis simply cannot put in a bad performance. Here, he's an old black man who belives he's JFK. His character is both sad, and at the same time inspiring.  This movie is not for everyone. Its charm apeals to a specific mindset. You'll either love it or hate it. There will be no middle ground.
