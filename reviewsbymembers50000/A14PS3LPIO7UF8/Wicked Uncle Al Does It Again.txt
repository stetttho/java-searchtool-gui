 I found the Confessions to be inspiring, irritating, tragic, and hilariously funny. Love him or hate him; Crowley was a unique individual whose accomplishments are not to be underestimated.  I was not bothered by the lack of magickal writing: after all, the book was never intended to be a textbook on magick. Apart from Crowley's racism and misogynism (he was, after all, a 19th century Britishman. He couldn't help it), he had a remarkably progressive and universal view. He did the best that he could. I delighted in the lessons that his strengths, weaknesses, virtues, flaws, follies and triumphs. One thing that he was was honest. Despite the possibility that he may have embellished the truth at times, he did so leaving the reader with the oportunity to see through him. He held himself and others to very exacting standards. At times I found myself laughing out loud at many of his anecdotes. They were my favorite parts of the book; especially when he was presenting himself as either the fool or "The Wickedest Man in the World": with his tounge planted firmly in his cheek. A good read. One of my favorite books.
