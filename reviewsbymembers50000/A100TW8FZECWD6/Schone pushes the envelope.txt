 The Lady's Tutor is not an adventure-oriented romance.  Its plot centers primarily on the discoveries Elizabeth Petrie makes about herself, and  subsequently about everyone in her life, as she searches for happiness.   Little by little, Elizabeth realizes that her surface wants signify deeper  problems in nearly all of her relationships.  She is a strong heroine who  decides that her lot in life is not enough, that it's okay that she not  only wants but DESERVES more from life--and she is determined to have it.   Better yet, she gets stronger as the story goes along.  Bravo to her!   Elizabeth is not the standard romance heroine:  she's older, married to  someone other than the hero, has children for whom she is a good, devoted  mother, and is only of average looks.  How refreshing to read about such a  woman! Ramiel is more of the traditional romance hero:  Handsome,  brooding, dominating, mysterious, and sexually, er...gifted, yet still  appealing, especially after he opens up his sensitive side to  Elizabeth. The gem of this book is Ramiel's mother, the Countess, who  refuses to hang her head in shame for surviving being kidnapped by Arabs,  becoming a sheik's concubine, and bearing him a child out of  wedlock. Robin Schone is one of the rare writers who can dish out a  scorching-hot romance with believable plots and characters.  Most of the  romance writers who focus on the sex in their books tend to let their plots  disappear or, worse, their characters become either unsympathetic or  one-dimensional.  Or, sometimes BOTH.  Schone does not make any of these  mistakes.  It's the best book she's written, thus far.  READ IT, READ IT,  READ IT!
