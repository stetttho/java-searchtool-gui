 Normally, I'm not a fan of Westerns, but something told me to give this  book a try when I saw it at the bookstore.  I'm glad I obeyed the  instinct. Painted by the Sun is about Shea Waterston, a traveling  photographer who is following the orphan trains west to look for the son  she gave up a decade before.  While setting up her camera to photograph a  hanging, she meets Judge Cameron Gallimore, who promptly throws her--and  her camera--in jail.  The Judge, however, has demons of his own, and he and  Shea recognize each other as kindred spirits. Elizabeth Grayson writes  beautifully about 1870s Colorado and a relationship between two tortured  individuals who are inherently decent people.  Cam's sister, Lily, his son,  Rand, and Rand's friend, Tyler, are well-portrayed.  Shea, especially, is a  wonderful character.  Unlike most romance heroines, she is no prissy,  helpless virgin.  Shea is pragmatic, self-sufficient, and experienced.  And  don't cross her, or someone she cares about, if she has her Winchester  rifle nearby! This is a wonderful book.  Read it!
