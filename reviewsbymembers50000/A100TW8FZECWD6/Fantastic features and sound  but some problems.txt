 The remote control for iPod is inspired. I love it, and use it all the time. It's fragile, though, and I've been through two of them, working on my third, in less than two years. I had the remote in my purse, dropped my purse, and a nail polish bottle falling on the remote caused the back cover to break off. Not good. The earphones have great, great sound, tremendous range, but... They are much too big for my ear canals. Wearing them for longer than fifteen minutes is painful. I'm investing in Sony earbuds for this reason. They tend to fit smaller ear canals better, and the EX-71SLB Fontopias definitely fit better, with their three sizes of bud covers. Can't go wrong there.
