 I ask myself:  How many times can Stephanie Laurens write the exact same story and still get published?  Obviously, she can do it six times.  This novel is just like Devil's Bride, which is just like Rake's Vow, which is just like Secret Love, which is...  Well, we get the idea.  Hero meets heroine, decides she's the one for him, she doesn't think so for most of the book, someone is murdered, hero will investigate but doesn't want heroine's help, heroine is bound and determined to inject herself into the action, heroine decides she likes hero after all, they have sex, hero marries heroine, murder gets solved, everyone lives happily ever after.  This is the plot of every Cynster novel. If it's not bad enough to recycle the plot over and over, the characters are always the same.  What's the difference between any of the Cynster men, or the Cynster women besides changing a few minor details?  Characterization is much more than changing eye color, or hobby. And I swear, even the dialogue in this book is the same as all the others in the series.  This is the conversation that every Laurens Hero and heroine have in every single book, for at least half of the book: Hero:  You will marry me. Heroine:  Never! Repeat until nausea is induced. Stephanie Laurens has a true talent for atmospheric writing and, sometimes, can actually display a decent ear for dialogue.  If only she would use it!  Writing by template is never attractive, and it only gets worse with each additional installment.  And to think that there will be MORE books in the Cynster series, which I'm sure will be exactly like all the others.  I could have just read Devil's Bride 5, 6 or 7 more times rather than getting more books in this series. Recommendation:  Buy Cynster books used.  Please send a message to all authors that only those who bother to be original with each and every book deserve our hard-earned money.
