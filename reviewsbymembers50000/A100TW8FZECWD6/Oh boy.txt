 This video NAILED the real election story, the story out there, for those who know how to read beyond headlines, and who learned to ignore TV news outlets, long ago. There were some things it could have gone into, but didn't, but it's a short. One can't expect in depth data from film. It just doesn't happen. Some corrections to Viewer in Midwest: If ANY absentee vote isn't sent on time, then it doesn't count. Period. I don't care if it's from the Almighty himself, or from a soldier. How about some of that personal responsibility that Republicans are always screaming about? As a former airman, I voted in elections in my home state while I lived far, far away. I knew what I needed to do, and the military helped with that process. Still, it is up to YOU to make the arrangements to get the ballot and send it back in a timely fashion, so that it will arrive ON TIME. And you don't bellyache if it doesn't work that way because YOU were too lazy to do it. As for Dems "starting" the craziness of the Y2K elections, of course the party leader would be there if doubts arose about the votes--that's his JOB. The Republicans made this a mess, in more ways than one, when THEY filed their crybaby lawsuits. Odd, since they don't want ordinary citizens filing lawsuits, but that's another point.
