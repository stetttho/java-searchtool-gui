 After rampaging through the first five novels in as many days, I was really looking forward to Hot Six, especially with that cliffhanger from High Five needing resolved.  I expected what I got with that, and that was one of the first disappointments of this book. Don't get me wrong, Hot Six is fun and funny, most of the time, but some of the humor seems a little forced and juvenile.  I didn't find the dog funny, much less all the references to his bowel movements.  YUCK.  I just wanted Stephanie to take him to the pound where he would (hopefully) be put to sleep. The plot dragggged along so much that this was the first Plum book in which I found myself skipping paragraphs, then pages to get to something more interesting.  About 3/4 of the way through, I finally skipped to the end. I find the love interest, Morelli, repulsive.  He's a cookie-cutter romance book type of hero, and his nickname for Stepanie, "Cupcake," drives me up the wall.  The sooner he's outta Steph's life, the happier I'll be.  Ranger has possibilities.  I do like how JE has been ever-so-slowly peeling back his layers.  With each book, he gets more fascinating. On the positive side, I simply adore JE's often brilliant observations about the Jersey mindset, like how Steph knew that the woman attempting suicide at the beginning of the book wouldn't do it when she was wearing a great leather jacket.  No, she'd give the jacket to a sister THEN jump.  These little gems of insight are what make JE such a delightful author to read, even when the whole of a book falls a tad short of the mark, as in this case.
