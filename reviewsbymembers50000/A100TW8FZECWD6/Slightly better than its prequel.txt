 Rejar from Knight of a Trillion Stars goes to Regency England.  In the  previous book, he was fun.  In this, his own book, he becomes as arrogant  and repulsive as his brother, Lorgin.  The heroine in this book, Lilac, has  several more watts of brainpower than Deanna, for all the good it does her.   Lilac is still more of a dim bulb than even the average romance  heroine. It's still okay to Dara Joy to humiliate and degradate her  heroines.  Dara Joy heroes always treat the heroine like a dog on a leash,  dragging her here and there, telling her what to do:  "Stand up, sit  down, good girl."  Dara Joy heroes also have a bad habit of constantly  telling a heroine that he just knows she lusts after him.  He knows all,  even if he's an alien visitor to earth, and the heroine knows absolutely  nothing, not even her own mind.  Protest any of this arrogance?  How dare  the woman do that?  What little protests arise from the females don't last  long and can easily be conquered with a leer or a sneer. If that's not  bad enough, this author thinks we're supposed to find it romantic when  Rejar rapes Lilac, but it's not. It's not enough for a hero in a romance  book to be beautiful, physically...um...fit, and sexually obsessed.  If he  cannot prove he's caring and loving, at least with the heroine, he's not  worth the paper he's written on.  Rejar had so many possibilities that he  never gets a chance to live up to--and that is a tragedy.
