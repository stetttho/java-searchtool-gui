 Like the other reviewers here, this album has a special significance for me. I bought it when I was immersing myself in classical music for the first time, and, even after buying other versions of both works from this album, I always come back to this inexpensive CD. The Serenade for Strings, particularly the Tempo di Valse, is conducted and played to perfection, and with heartbreaking emotion. How this piece hasn't found its way into countless costume drama movies is beyond me.  Ormandy's New World is likewise a pleasure. When it's loud, it's really loud--without drowning out any instrument, no matter how small, but when it's quiet it's so still you can hear yourself breathing to the rhythm. I've seen the New World performed live (a must!), but Ormandy's interpretation lingers and is, for me, always the standard of comparison.  This is one of the best investments a classicul music lover can make, and it is a must for someone coming to Dvorak for the first time.
