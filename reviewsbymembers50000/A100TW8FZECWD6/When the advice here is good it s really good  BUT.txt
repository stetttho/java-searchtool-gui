 When it's bad, it's really bad.  I agree with the first two reviewers that this book has too many "shoulds" that may not work for every writer.  I, too, found the concept of talking about writing to a trio of pretend writers very silly, boring, pretentious and wasteful.  Selfish as it sounds, I don't care about THEM, talk to ME--you know, the person buying/reading the book!  Ironically, one of the first articles is "Never Lose Sight of the Reader."  Too bad "Lady" Barrow forgot about that. One column in the book is about socio-biology (a.k.a evolutionary psychology) which I found extremely sexist and offensive.  While it purported to address why women read romances, I found none of its arguments convincing.  Apparently, the entire staff at Romantic Times subscribes to this highly controversial theory, because they frequently refer to it in the magazine and on the website.  Anyway, the writer of the column isn't a romance novelist or editor or publisher, I don't even think she's a psychologist (I think she may be a lawyer) so who cares what she has to say about psychology in romance books or anything else? This book shines when successful authors discuss the nuts and bolts of writing and getting published in the romance industry, when the various sub-genres are described and explained.  Read those and ignore the rest of it.
