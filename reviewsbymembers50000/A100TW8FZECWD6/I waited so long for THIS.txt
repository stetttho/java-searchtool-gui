 I love the Anita Blake series, but this installment was just plain awful.  Anita would decide to take some kind of action (usually saving one of her were-leopards), would take a step toward it, then detour for 50 pages to sleep with someone or wring her hands over her sexual morality or whom she might love, etc.  For it to happen once is unfortunate; repeatedly is unforgiveable.  Hamilton has never been the strongest writer in terms of grammar and style, but in the past she had a handle on plot and characterization.  Over the past two or three books, she's abandoned plot more and more, and her characterizations, though powerful, simply can't carry a book.  The publisher needs to seriously consider getting a stronger editor to rein in Hamilton before the series suffocates from egoistic bloat.
