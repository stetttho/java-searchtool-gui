 It's not very often that a romance writer dares to have a woman and man be FRIENDS first--best of friends at that, then lovers.  That alone made this book a worthwhile read.  I tire of all those bickering couples.  Lovers'  spats now and then are expected, but, really, the constant arguing to mask  quivering sensitivities does get old.  A good plot needs conflict, but  quarreling over the usual well-worn devices ("S/he is only using  me," "S/he doesn't/can't really love ME," etc, ad nauseum)  doesn't necessarily qualify for that. This book doesn't do that.  The  main plot revolves around finding out who has kidnapped the heroine's  brother, and why.  The answer really isn't a surprise to anyone who has  read the spy books of John Le Carre. The romantic plot conflict is very  real, and very understandable:  We're all thrown for a loop, to realize  that someone we THOUGHT we knew so well might have some traits, or secrets,  that we hadn't expected.  It takes some time to adjust, to get past the  feeling of betrayal, the feeling that we weren't trusted with certain  information, to trust again.  As is often the case, doubt leads to doubt.   It is how the lovers overcome all the havoc wreaked by so much doubting  that makes a story. Hugh and Abbie are able to overcome these problems  not for a reason as idiotic as being good in the sack together (although  they of course are), but because they have a stronger foundation than most  romance-book couples:  They are friends, first.  Thank you, Ms. Thornton,  for writing a romance book that makes sense, romantically speaking.
