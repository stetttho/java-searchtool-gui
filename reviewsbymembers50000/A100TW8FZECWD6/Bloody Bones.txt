 While Hamilton won't ever win any awards for her writing, in the technical sense, she is a great storyteller, and her characters are among the most vivid of any genre.  Anita Blake is probably the strongest heroine I've ever read, and she continues to grow as the series progresses.  Jean-Claude is the bad boy who is much more caring and vulnerable (emotionally) than he seems at first.  By this time, Jean-Claude and Anita ought to be set in stone, almost predictable, but they're not.  Even the secondary recurring characters have depth and are clearly defined:  Jason, Bert, Edward, Larry, Ronnie.  You feel like these are people you know. While this book isn't the best of the series, dragging out far too long and wrapping up too tidily, the scene where Anita stays with Jean-Claude at dawn merits 20 stars.  It is both heart-wrenching and horrifying, one of the most memorable scenes of the entire series. One thing that bothers me about all of Hamilton's books:  Tons of typos and other assorted errors.  It's almost laughable at times, and distracting as hell.
