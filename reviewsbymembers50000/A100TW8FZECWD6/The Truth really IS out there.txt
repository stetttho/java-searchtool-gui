 Another reviewer here says that France, Germany and Japan have higher violent crime rates than America, but the Interpol numbers simply do not bear that out. The per capita violent crime rate in all of those countries is far, far lower than America's. France alone would need another 1100 murders every year just to catch up with America on the per capita murder rate. Japan would need another 37,000 rapes just to keep up with our per capita rape rate. Germans would have to commit over 124,000 additional serious assaults on each other every year. No, we're not a violent society, at all. Germany and France are fairly equitable with us on theft, overall, but Mr. Moore wasn't investigating theft. He was investigating why we like to hurt each other, especially with guns. Thank you, Mr. Moore for providing a rare, candid and thought-provoking analysis of why we do that. I cannot wait for the DVD to arrive. Seeing it once, twice or 100 times is not enough to remember the message this film conveys.
