 After devouring The Lady's Tutor in one sitting, I just couldn't find a way to care enough about The Lover:  Not its characters, their relationship, nor the cause of Michael's dire rumblings about his past.  I  was so exasperated that I didn't finish the book.  Sure the sex is hot, but  that's not enough to sustain a book.  Go to any porn shop bookshelf for  proof of that. I, too, tire of the man as sexual teacher and the virgin  heroine.  At least The Lady's Tutor didn't resort to the latter.  The  Romance genre desperately needs some new ideas, some writers who will push  the envelope.  The Lady's Tutor was a book that did that; The Lover did  not.
