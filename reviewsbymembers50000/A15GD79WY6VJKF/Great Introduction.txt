 This book is a fun introduction to some of the world's greatest writers and their works.  It is both entertaining and educating. The whole "ranking" idea is a bit silly and seems to be an american obsession. Like all "rankings", however, it is quite subjective and not that important. The important thing is that its author provides insightful and meaningful introductions to many wonderful writers that make up an essential part of our shared cultural history. Approximately two to three pages are devoted to each writer and the high quality of the individual introductions is maintained throughout. The book is not too scholarly and not too general or simple...just right for the type of book one expects it to be.
