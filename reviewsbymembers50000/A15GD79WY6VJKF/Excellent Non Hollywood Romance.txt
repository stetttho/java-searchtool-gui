 This movie is a refreshing look at romance, very European (though American made) and with fantastic chemistry. The unique, funny, (pseudo-)intellectual conversation practically non-stop through the film is great and the characters are believable.  One would almost think that the actors were not following a script but were rather just winging it, discussing their real ideas and plans.  While there may be some kitsch "we are all stardust"...the character's reactions quickly correct any slipping from the reality of two young travelers infatuated with each other and with life.  The scenes of Vienna, in the amusment park Prater, the clubs, and mostly the scene in the cafe, are extremely true to life. With so much trash being made by American directors today it's great to see a little gem like this.
