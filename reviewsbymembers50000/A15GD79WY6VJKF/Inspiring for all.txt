 This little book is certainly one of the best-known and most popular in French literature.  Though at heart a children's story, it is rightly considered a classic in its own sense and is even found within respected French literary anthologies.  Its author, Antoine de Saint-Exupery, is also famous for other works of fiction ("Vol de Nuit" etc.).  Like the narrator in "The Little Prince," St-Exupery was a pilot as well.  He apparently crashed or was shot down flying as a WWII pilot towards the end of the war and was never found.  His likeness, along with that of the little prince and his pet lamb and the famous drawing of the elephant in the boa-constrictor, are all on the French 50 Franc note. The story can basically be split into two parts: The first part is the short introduction dealing with the narrator and his view of the world when he was a child and how adults could never understand the real meaning of things or perceive truth in the world--only the superficial and the usual.  This is generally one of the main ideas of the book; "blessed are the children...".  The rest of the book is the story of the little prince, whom the narrator discovers in the Sahara when he is trying to fix his downed airplane and is in fear of his life.  The narrator and the reader slowly come to know the prince's story and learn about friendship, love and truth in a touching way.  My favorite parts are those dealing with the prince's relationship with his beloved rose left on his planet and the prince's relationship with the wise little fox, who offers the prince his philosophical secret on life. I have not read the book in translation so I cannot comment how this or other translations compare.  Though considered a book for children, the French can still be a bit demanding if you want to try it in the original.
