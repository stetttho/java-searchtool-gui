 The basic premise of this novel is well-known, namely that a young Russian law student (Raskolnikov) commits murder. He does this out of pride, vanity, and in order to act on a napoleonic theory of society and history that he develops.  "Crime and Punishment" is a very dark novel that mostly deals with criminal psychology, psychology in general, and redemption.  One would think that the "punishment" in the title refers to Raskolnikov's self-inflicted psychological torturings from the pangs of guilt for his crime,  that he is "accepting his suffering" or "taking up the cross" to use expressions from the novel.  However, Raskolnikov never really seems to feel guilty or come to acknowledge his guilt; his tortured state of mind seems rather to be mostly based on an intense questioning of his self-worth in the recognition that he is not destined to succeed like Napoleon.  He is intelligent, selfish and vain. There are no "moments of wild humor" as claimed on the back-cover of my edition!  The novel does not really deal with crime and punishment in a legal or even a philosophical sense.  Those pre-law students who read the book looking to perhaps gain some insights relevant to their crim law courses in law school will most likely be disappointed in this respect.     I read the translation by Jessie Coulson in Oxford Classics and can recommend it.
