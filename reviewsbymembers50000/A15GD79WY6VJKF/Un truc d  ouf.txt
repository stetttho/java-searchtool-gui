 Despite some serious misgivings about perhaps in some way contributing to the sin of French slang spoken with an American accent, I must nevertheless praise Genevieve for her entertaining "p'tit bouquin." From my close contact with the Frenchies I've noticed that two ways to make an impression are: (1) achieve a perfect French accent, and (2) (easier) learn some slang. Even people fluent in school-taught French, who have read Moliere, Balzac and Proust in the original, cannot and will not understand much in French Films, TV etc. without a basic knowledge of French slang. It is much more present than in American English or in German. From the few books on this topic that I've come across, Genevieve's remains the best. She covers all the basics and throws in some witty remarks on French culture as well. Of course, one must first have a good background in French in order to eventually use the expressions here, especially since phonetic pronuciations are not given; without a certain level of proficiency one runs the risk of sounding like a foreign fool. But this book is also good precisely for figuring out when you've been called a fool (or something worse!) For those interested in expressions past the essentials, check out her other book: Merde Encore.
