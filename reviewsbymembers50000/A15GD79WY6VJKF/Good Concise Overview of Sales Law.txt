 This rather small volume presents a good overview of UCC sales law and is compact but not shallow. I was also impressed with its treatment of the CISG, which is often wrongly overlooked or barely treated in american books on commercial law, especially in smaller books such as this one. It discusses the CISG and explains the relevance of its provisions in comparison to Art. 2 UCC for the american lawyer/law student. As with its discussion of the UCC provisions, the interspersed treatment of the CISG is clear and compact. The authors distinguish some of the differences between the CISG and UCC, point out problem questions and uncertanties, and generally do a good job in succinctly explaining the essentials and more (I found some interesting arguments and perspectives) for both bodies of law.
