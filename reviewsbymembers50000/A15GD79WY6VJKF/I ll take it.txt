 Its great the WB is releasing these classics!  Of course, there are lots of great Looney Tunes that have not yet been released, and hopefully WB will release them all, continuing the Golden Collections.  If people here want to "bellyache" about what shorts are included and not, then let them.  We don't need cartoon know-it-alls preaching to us, so shut up.  Also, the absolute worst would be for WB to release shorts with stupid politically correct commentary, like Disney did with recent releases of some of its cartoons from the 30's and 40's...I mean really, are we really so afraid of ourselves now that we can't appreciate a WWII-era cartoon caricature of a "jap" or a "hun"?  WB should give us its best stuff, and that's a lot more than has been released yet, but at least it is being released and done right!  So thanks WB, and keep it coming!
