 This is one of the best books I've read on practical handgun shooting and handling.  Suarez writes well and demonstrates simple and proven methods.  It is important with handguns to learn the basics correctly and this book will set you on the right path.  You may also want to check out Suarez's "The Tactical Pistol", which deals predominantly with tactics and is for the more advanced operator.
