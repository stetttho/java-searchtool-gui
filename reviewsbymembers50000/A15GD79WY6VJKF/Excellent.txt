 I agree with the previous poster...this is a great book!  It informs, it shows you what's important, covers the basics and more, a book to read twice through.   A lot of gun writers just blow hot air, bragging about themselves or going on and on about their favorite style gun.  Ayoob is one of the best known gun writers and gun enthousiasts out there and I like his style.  I don't get the impression that he's pushing his ego, but rather that he is trying to show us what to look for, what to think about, what to consider with regards to handgun handling and shooting.  I don't agree with everything, but I learned a lot from this book and I'm not a novice to handguns.  Ayoob writes honestly and informs the reader as a genuine teacher and one who has much to offer and wants to offer it.   I recommend this book to anyone wanting a good overview of the basics and more on handgun handling, competitive and combat shooting, defensive ammo selection, concealed carry, handgun self-defense techniques etc.
