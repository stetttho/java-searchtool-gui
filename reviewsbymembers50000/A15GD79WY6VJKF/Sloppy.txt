 This book was originally written in French.  The translation is an abomination and the publisher, Routledge, has the nerve to nevertheless put it out on the market.  The publisher apparently thinks that it can simply include a list of the over 100 errors ("Errata") in the book and then expect the readers to repeatedly refer to this list and count the lines on the pages to find and correct the errors themselves! A blatent example of sloppy work and an attempt to cash in at the expense of the consumer!  I would not recommend buying this book in English!
