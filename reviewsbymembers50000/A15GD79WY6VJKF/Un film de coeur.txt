 In my opinion this is one of the greatest films ever taken from literature and easily one of Depardieu's most impressive performances. He is really astounding in this role. Apart from about two pages, the lines of the film follow the exact lines of Rostand's text, so basically the whole movie is in verse.  You can only really appreciate that if you are fluent in French since the subtitles do not quite follow.  This is a touching and exciting film about compassion, love, wit, sacrifice, dispair, filled with heart and extremely true to the original play.
