 This collection is the greatest DVD release of all time. The "Tunes" are beautifully restored and funnier than ever. The extras are fantastic, the selection of cartoons is great (they could have added my all-time favorite "The Three Little Bops"), buy this collection...it's worth every penny. And that's the end.
