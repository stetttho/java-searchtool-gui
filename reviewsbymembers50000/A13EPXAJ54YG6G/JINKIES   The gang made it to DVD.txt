 I've never been a huge fan of Scooby-Doo...except for this series...the ORIGINAL series. You'll find NO Scooby-Dum, NO Scrappy-Doo...NO crappy celebrities. This DVD collection should have been called "Scooby-Doo Where Are You! The Complete Series" because after these ran on CBS Scooby and the gang spun-off into "The New Scooby-Doo Movies" in 1972 and the many other equally bad series that followed. In this collection you get all 25 original "Where Are You" episodes. The bonus features are a complete waste of time...it would have been nice to have interviews with Frank Welker and Casey Kasem and maybe a gallery of sketches and storyboards. The bonuses are more to entertain the children viewing these DVDs (but isn't that what the show is for?). It's because of the bad bonus features that I'm giving this collection only 4 stars. The bonuses on The Flintstones were much better. All in all, it's a great collection and I recommend it. It's like a trip back into time...when you couldn't seem to wake up for school everyday...but you were wide awake every Saturday morning to see what tricks Bill Hanna and Joe Barbera had up their sleeves. Bravo Warner Brothers...keep these cartoon classics coming!
