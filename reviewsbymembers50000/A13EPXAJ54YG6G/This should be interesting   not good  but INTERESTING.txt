 as of this writing, these DVDs have yet to be released. I've NEVER been a fan of colorization (those dreaded Laurel & Hardy videos by Cabin Fever come to mind and make me want to puke)...but the beauty of these DVDs is you get a choice between color and B&W. 8 shorts in all seems pretty light (considering that 3 of them were already released on past collections), but at least they are finally releasing my all time favorite Curly short, 1940's "You Nazty Spy!" (I've always been a Shemp Howard fan, but there are a handful of Curly Howard shorts that I absolutely love). For fans of colorization I say have fun...I'll watch them once in color to see if colorization is as bad as I remember...then I will ENJOY them in the original B&W versions...keep the Stooges films coming on DVD and thanks for giving us the B&W option...throwing a few Joe Besser shorts on some future collections wouldn't be a bad idea, could help me appreciate Curly Howard a lot more!!!
