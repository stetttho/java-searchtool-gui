 When The Flintstones were cancelled in 1966, William Hanna and Joseph Barbera gave the stone-age family a giant send off with this full-length feature film. Fred Flintstone becomes a secret agent and travels through Europe to capture the Green Goose, all the while trying to keep it a secret from Wilma and the Rubbles. Seems like a long version of the TV series, but with better animation and better music. You'll have a Yabba-Dabba-Doo time!
