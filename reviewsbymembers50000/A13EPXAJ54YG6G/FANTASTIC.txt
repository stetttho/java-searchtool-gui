 I had never heard of this series until I bought The Young Ones on DVD and the first episode was included...I was hooked and was hoping for more...and here it is! This is by far one of the funniest British sitcoms I've EVER seen. It's a live action Looney Tunes cartoon...much more violent than anything The 3 Stooges did in their entire career. Buy it, you won't regret it.
