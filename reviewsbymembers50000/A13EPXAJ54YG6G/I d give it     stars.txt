 This is it, the only DVD collection you'll ever need. I bought them in the sets of 2 before the 14 volume set was available. They were the reason I bought DVD in the first place...my VHS set was getting worn from constant viewing. You get all 45 episodes, bonus trivia tests, fun facts about each episode, and profiles on the 6 funniest men who ever lived. So, order this set today and  have a few Crunchy Frogs and enjoy something completely different.
