 The wait is (almost) over. I say "almost" because we have to wait until June 15 to buy final film, "Love Happy" on DVD to complete the Marx Brothers film collection.  I have been waiting for this collection for years. I was lucky enough to get the first five Paramount films on DVD (before the idiots at Universal pulled them) and I couldn't wait for Ted Turner to get off his lazy, rich butt and release the MGM/RKO films (Thanks Ted, sorry about that). This collection will be a real treat for every fan of The Marx Brothers and the golden age of comedy....and now, Mr. Turner...a few other things you can release...we know you own the rights to MGM, RKO, Hanna-Barbera and Warner Brothers...so, how about... The films of Wheeler & Woolsey? The complete MGM Tex Avery cartoons? The Astaire & Rogers films? A complete set (year by year...including the banned and censored) Warner Brothers "Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies" collection (every cartoon they ever produced from 1930-yes all the way to 1969, I guess)? How about a little film called "KING KONG"? The Buster Keaton MGM films (especially "Spite Marriage" and "The Cameraman")? I could go on and on...and I'm sure a lot of movie buffs will agree with me and add their own 2 cents. This is great work with The Marx Brothers Collection...please keep the good stuff coming!!!
