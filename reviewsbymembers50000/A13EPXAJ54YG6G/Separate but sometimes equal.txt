 Which is better? The Simpsons or Family Guy? WHO CARES?! They both have their strengths and weaknesses just like any other series. I don't see why everyone compares the 2 shows...sure, Peter isn't very bright. sure, they have the same amount of children as Homer and Marge, both animated, both appeared on Fox...that's about as far as it goes. With The Simpsons, we're treated every week to the family's adventures...it has been kept alive all these years with clever references and great dialogue. With Family Guy, we WERE treated every week to one joke, the funny flashback, then another funny flashback. Sadly, it was a one joke show...but, amazingly, IT WORKED! I love both of these shows for different reasons. I love the Simpsons for its smart writing and A+ references and I love Family Guy for the times I want to give my brain a rest and just enjoy a stupid laugh with no thought involved.  I loved this DVD set, it sits on the shelf next to The Simpsons in perfect harmony...get over it people, they're just TV shows....enjoy them both, just stay away from King Of The Hill !!!
