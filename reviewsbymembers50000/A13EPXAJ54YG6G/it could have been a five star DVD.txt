 As I had said in other reviews, when Shemp isn't in the film, watch Larry. Although the films on this DVD are some of the best from the Curly period, I would have liked one or two Shemp shorts included. Now, if they would only wise up and release their two great war-time shorts (You Nazty Spy, I'll Never Heil Again) and start putting out (just to have a complete overview) the Joe Besser shorts. But, if you're a fan of Curly Howard, I highly recommend this DVD. Truly timeless comedy from the funniest men who ever lived.
