 I can't wait for this DVD. Sure, it was silly, unrealistic, had somewhat poor scripts and some less than brilliant acting (did you ever watch Star Trek?! at least Gilligan was intentionally funny)...but that's what makes it the classic it is today. This is one of my favorite guilty pleasures that will be hidden away and brought out when no one else is around...now, if they would only release all 116 episodes of The Brady Bunch...let the legacy of Sherwood Schwartz live on!!!
