 So far I've been very pleased with the Hanna-Barbera collections, but this is really a poor choice. There were 24 one-hour episodes of "The New Scooby-Doo Movies" produced, there are 15 on this set, what about the other 9 episodes? Will there be a second volume? Why didn't they just add a fifth two-sided disc and give us the complete series? BOOOOO!
