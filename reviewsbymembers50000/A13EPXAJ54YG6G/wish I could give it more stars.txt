 If you aren't familiar with the silent films of Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy, this is the best place to start. The first film on the DVD is worth the price alone, "Big Business" from 1929 (shot  December 1928, released April 20, 1929) is probably THE FUNNIEST FILM EVER MADE...the boys are door-to-door Christmas tree salesmen (not in July) who should never have rang James Finlayson's doorbell. Other highlights include "Do Detectives Think?" (1927) in which the boys wear their trademark outfits for the first time...the real treat is Fin's reactions to killer Noah Young. "Call Of The Cuckoo" (1927) is a fairly odd piece with Max Davidson trying to sell his house to get away from his neighbors (Laurel, Hardy, Finlayson, and Charley Chase)...Spec O'Donnell is the real stand-out in this film as Davidson's dim-witted son. "The Finishing Touch" (1928) is classic Laurel & Hardy, the boys as carpenters has never been better...also starring the great Edgar Kennedy. Also included on this DVD are two Stan Laurel solo shorts, "On The Front Page" (1926) very amusing. and "Hustling For Health" (1918) one of Stan Laurel's earliest films. The restoration for these films is amazing, all-in-all, this is a wonderful collection...don't just stop at volume one, all ten volumes are worth picking up.
