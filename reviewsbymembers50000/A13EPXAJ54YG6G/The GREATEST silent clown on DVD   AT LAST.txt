 At the time of posting this review, this DVD hasn't been released yet...but with a respected name like KINO producing this collection it has to be top quality! The Art Of Buster Keaton, Harry Langdon The Forgotten Clown, and the Arbuckle & Keaton collection that were released by KINO were stunning...and I'm sure that these new releases (Lloyd, Charley Chase, Stan Laurel) will be just as wonderful.    If you're a fan of Harold Lloyd, or slapstick comedy in general, you'll love the films in this collection. PLEASE buy this DVD...the more interest in it, the better the chances are that more collections will be released in the future. The films of Harold Lloyd MUST be seen by this generation and generations to come. They have, sadly, been collecting dust for far too long...thank you, Suzanne Lloyd for giving us a handful of your grandfather's work...PLEASE release more of the films, in these troubled times the world needs an escape and a good laugh...and no one can make us laugh harder than the master...Harold Lloyd.
