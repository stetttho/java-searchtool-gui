 This series deserves a better release than this one. I was very excited to see that this series was finally released...until I got it home. The picture quality was not up to DVD standards. Most of them look just okay, a few of them were dreadful. I haven't had any of the sound problems that I've read about on here. But the worst part is NO OPENING CREDITS?! what were they thinking? I want to see the pre-show teasers as I did in the 70s and I want to see the opening credits as I did in the 70s...ON EVERY EPISODE. Nice try, better luck next time...Michael Landon wouldn't have stood for this if he were still here.
