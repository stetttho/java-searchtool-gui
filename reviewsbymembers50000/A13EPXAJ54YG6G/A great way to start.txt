 Had this box set came out sooner, I would have bought it rather than buy them all individually. But as my title says, it's a great way to start your 3 Stooges collection. Relive all the classic Stooge moments with Moe Howard, Larry Fine (my favorite) and the amazing Shemp Howard...you also get a bunch of shorts with Curly Howard, too (just pay attention to Larry during the Curly shorts, believe me, it's better that way). My only problem with the entire set is the butchered version of "Three Little Beers" with a scene cut out (golfers discover that their golf balls are missing, Moe hits Curly on the head and from under his coat falls dozens of the missing golf balls...CUT! WHY COLUMBIA? WHY?!). Other than that, it's a great set...what are you waiting for? ORDER IT NOW, PORKUPINE!
