 I own the other Hanna-Barbera DVD collections and have mixed reviews for all of them (The Bad: generic end credits on all of them, censoring Jonny Quest, the title cards on The Jetsons, the lame extras on Scooby Doo. The Good: Original animation titles on The Flinstones (Rise & Shine) and The Jetsons (Jane, stop this crazy thing!), original commercials on The Flintstones and Jonny Quest). So, I can't wait for this set to be released. Top Cat was nothing more than an animated rip-off of The Phil Silvers Show, and, like the Honeymooners/Flintstones comparison, they both were entertaining...if this set is like the others, I know there will be both good and bad points, but has anyone released a PERFECT television DVD box set? Now, let's hope other Hanna-Barbera series aren't too far from being released: Ruff & Reddy, Huckleberry Hound, Quick Draw McGraw, Yogi Bear, Magilla Gorilla and some obscure ones like Inch High Private Eye, Wait 'Til Your Father Gets Home and Clue Club. Be sure to pick up season two of The Flintstones and the feature film The Man Called Flintstone coming out the same day....and thank a vet!
