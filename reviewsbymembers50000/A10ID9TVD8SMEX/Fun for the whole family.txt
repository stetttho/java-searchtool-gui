 I picked this up for my 4 year old (yeah it says 8 and up)...However, she can read and is a big PPG fan.  The only confusing part for her is figuring out the times on the tops of the cards...but she plays it with mom and dad, and we help her along.  We said to ourselves the other night, "this is actually fun!"  Most of the kid games are not, in my opinion.  This one is fun, especially if you like the Powerpuff Girls along with your kids.
