 My daughter got this from her Tia Susan for her 4th birthday.  Of course, she found it on the wish list at Amazon!  This is an adorable replica of a VW New Beetle, complete with flower vase.  By far, the most popular features with kids are the locking trunk and the seat belts.  My daughter also enjoyed decorating her "bug car" with flower stickers.  Now her Barbies can travel in style.  The only problem we run across is frequent locking of the keys in the trunk (shape of things to come?). This is easily solved by turning the car upside down and shaking the key out (can't do that with a real one!).  There was also a handy second key included with the car.  I wouldn't exactly call this educational, but I didn't want to bring the stars down!  It's a great toy, in a beautiful color!
