 I got this toy for a lot cheaper than this.  It is just adorable, but a very simple stuffed animal.  The fur is really soft, and Leona makes a perfect night night animal.  The designated reader cards are educational, but not that exciting.  It is so very cute if your child loves "Between the Lions."
