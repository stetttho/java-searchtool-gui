 My daughter got this kit for her 2nd birthday.  I thought she was a little young, so I put it up in my closet. I ran across it when she was 3 1/2, and it was a huge hit!  She enjoyed making puppets for everyone we were going to visit.  She was very creative, imaginative, and had so much fun.  Now I have started a list of supplies to replenish the kit, so she can continue creating amazing works of art!
