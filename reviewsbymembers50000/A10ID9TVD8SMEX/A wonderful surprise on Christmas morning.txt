 I picked this up at a great price on Amazon...It's not the most durable looking dollhouse I've seen, but it seems to be holding up just fine. The big plus for this is the charm.  It is just such an adorable depiction of Madeline's "Old House in Paris" that my daughter and I love.  There are a lot of people that comment that this is not durable/nice enough for the price.  The truth of the matter is, Barbie's Grand Hotel costs more than this house, and it's just a flimsy piece of plastic.  Granted, it comes with furniture, but it will be broken in a week.  Madeline's house is classic, and will last for years to come.  I was able to pick up most of the furniture on sale in addition to the house, so I probably spent $... or $... more than if I had bought .....  I think this was well worth the cost.
