 Monsters, Inc. was a big hit with our family, so I had to pick this book up for my 4 year old daughter (even though it's recommended for 6-8).  She loves this, and wants to play with it every day.  A few of the games are hard for her, but mostly, it's no problem.  She is a good reader, so the reading part is fine.
