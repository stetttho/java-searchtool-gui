 My main complaint is that it didn't come with brown play doh.  It tells you to mix red and green...but if you do that, then you don't have enough red and green left to make tomato and lettuce.  Luckily, we are at critical mass on play doh in our house, and we were able to make brown without sacrificing the other colors. The "tortilla" used for making burritos is a little too rigid to really make something that looks like a burrito...although my daughter doesn't seem to mind.  As far as she's concerned, this is a way cool toy!
