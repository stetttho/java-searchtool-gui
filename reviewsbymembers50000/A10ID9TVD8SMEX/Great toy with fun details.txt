 The only problem I can see with this item, is that it doesn't always latch well. Otherwise it is an adorable toy, with lots of accessories. It invites children to use their imaginations in many different ways. You can play house, take the camper for a drive, go boating, etc. This is a wonderful toy for girls and boys.
