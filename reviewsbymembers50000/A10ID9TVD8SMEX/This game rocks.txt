 Santa brought this game, and I don't think we've stopped playing since!  It is such a blast, and really brings the family together.  We were all so excited when my husband finally beat platinum on "Brick House" (it was our last one left that wasn't platinum) the other day.  It has a great variety of songs...new and old.  Another reviewer said there weren't enough new songs, and I disagree.  My friends' daughters (21 and 16) even commented on how many new ones there were (but they still chose to sing "Take On Me" from the 80's.  My 8-year-old and my husband have gotten perfect scores on "Material Girl."  In fact, my daughter loves all the old 80's tunes.   The only problem we've had with this game is that the arrows don't show up for the dancing.  We don't have a mat, but we tried it at someone else's house.  Anyway, I'm sure we'll get that squared away by the time we get a mat.  I cannot recommend this game enough!  Don't get the headset, the regular mics are better...be sure to get two for duets!
