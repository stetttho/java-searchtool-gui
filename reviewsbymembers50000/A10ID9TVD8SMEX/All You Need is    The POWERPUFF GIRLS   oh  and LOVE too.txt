 Awesome DVD!!!  I love the Meet the Beat-Alls cartoon when I saw it on the air...totally cracked me up!  Add in Mojo Jojo's commentary and you have a winner.  We love Mojo Jojo!  The mayor's commentary is also nice, as are the rest of the included episodes! I am an old crusty mom of 38 who enjoys watching this show with my 4 year old!
