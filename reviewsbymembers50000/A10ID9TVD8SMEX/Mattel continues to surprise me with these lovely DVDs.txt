 ...  I liked it better than Rapunzel honestly.  The Tchaikovsky music was beautifully played and accompanied by ballet.  The story was classic and lovely.  I am continually enchanted by the supplemental materials provided on these DVDs, and this was no exception.  There was a documentary following 5 or 6 teenage girls who are musicians and attend Julliard.  I know that my 6 year old worships teenagers, and these girls provided good role models and goals for her to aspire to.  There was also the ballet portion of the Special Features that took each dance and broke it down, naming the dance moves (porte des bras, pirouette, jette, etc.) and describing what is being conveyed by the dance.  When the first video in this series was released two years ago (Nutcracker), I honestly expected it to be junk.  I have been pleasantly surprised, and I am happy to let my little girl watch these movies that promote positive values, self-esteem, and creativity.  I often watch with her, as I find them entertaining as well.
