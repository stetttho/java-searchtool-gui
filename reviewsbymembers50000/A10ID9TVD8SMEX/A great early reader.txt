 I picked this up while on vacation for my 4-year-old daughter.  She is quite a good reader at this point, and enjoys reading this book.  It is written with easy to read language, but not to the point of being uninteresting for the child.  I am especially pleased that the featured character, Dizzy, is female.  This is sadly lacking in many children's books.  Look for "Wendy Helps Out" for an equally great book.
