 We had this same playyard as a hand me down from a niece.  Ours had ABC letters on the sides, so we called it "Cell Block A B C D." LOL  It is nice and big, and a good place to corral the baby when you need to.  Plus, it is big and colorful and they love it! Those other ones are so tiny that the baby does not want to be in there.
