 Of course, it helps that my name is Betsy! This was my first chapter book that I read in Kindergarten or First Grade...learning all about school with the other Betsy.  My 4 1/2 year old is just about to start Kindergarten, and is a great little reader.  I have been looking for a chapter book for her reading level.  We tried my old paperback of Stuart Little...which is a great story, but too many words she doesn't know.  I picked up my red fabric bound copy of "B is for Betsy" tonight to see if she could read it.  I sat down and read it in about an hour...brought back so many memories. It is in great shape (unlike Stuart, which has pages falling out), and I think I will start her on it tomorrow!
