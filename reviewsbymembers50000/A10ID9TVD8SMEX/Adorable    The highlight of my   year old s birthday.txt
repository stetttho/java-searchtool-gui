 This is very cute.  It comes with a lot of little pieces and accessories, and the house is open on one side, so be aware.  This doesn't close up to store the pieces.  However, it is just so cute! It has places all over that the Ham-Hams can sit (sideways even).  My little girl squealed "Oh this is so cute!" I guess that's what I'm saying.  It only came with Hamtaro, but extra Ham-Hams can be bought pretty cheaply at TRU. She got 5 Ham-Hams altogether, and is heading out with her birthday money to buy more Ham-Hams! Did I mention this was cute?
