 I had stumbled upon the vinyl album of "No Comprendo" back in the day when CDs were barely a blip on the musi-tech monitor (~ 1987). Back then, I had just gotten back from visiting France, and I was seriously craving sounds that were simply not a part of the local aural tradition. I had been overdosing on Indochine, and needed something edgier, more raucous, less bubble-gum.  Enter Les Rita Mitsouko's "No Comprendo," and my life hasn't been the same since. The hard-edged music still holds up, even after the blessed departure of grunge, and Catherine Ringer's voice was as multifaceted then as it is now. After all this time, "Les Histoires d'A" is still my favorite on the album because it really showcases her beautifully flexible and emotive voice. Bjork, watch out.
