 Although I enjoy reading reference books (yes, I need a life) I found this one to be rather dry. Acrobat is a powerful application and version 5 is actually quite fun to use, but I didn't find this book particularly insightful about things I didn't already know about Acrobat. Still, I refer to this book occasionally when I become forgetful, and for that I will keep this on my desk, at the ready. If you've tinkered with Acrobat and you're ready to become more of a power user, this book will get you up to speed with little pain.
