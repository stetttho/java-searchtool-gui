 Tonight I finished reading this gem and was immensely saddened that it had to end, albeit predictably as another reviewer noted. Still, what a lush, nuanced story, complemented with rich visual elements, providing a backdrop of artifact that actually serves the story rather than detracts from it. Though she can't really be compared to Nick Bantock, though they are both artists who can write well, Ms. Hodgson's latest seems to firmly ally itself with the genre most notably cultivated by the "Griffin and Sabine" series: visually pleasing epistolary with a twist of the fantastic. A most welcome diversion indeed.
