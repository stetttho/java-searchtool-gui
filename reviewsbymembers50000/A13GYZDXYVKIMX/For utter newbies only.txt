 Having had a blog for a couple years, I thought this book might offer some insight into blogs and the rationale behind them. Unfortunately, I couldn't finish reading this book so filled it was with cheerleading and the sort of handholding that would tick off my independent diva of a 3-year-old. Still, if you've never had a blog, don't know what one is, and are remotely interested in them, then this book can probably give you some good information. Otherwise, spend your money on something else more fun.
