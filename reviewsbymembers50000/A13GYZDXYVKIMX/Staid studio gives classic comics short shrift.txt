 Like most of the reviewers here, I have good things and bad things to note about this collection. The Good: My 7-year-old daughter loves to watch these films. She doesn't always catch the verbal play, but she really digs the sight gags. We've been watching these together since she received them for her birthday, and she's yet to tire of them. While I would prefer cleaner prints, I'm just glad to have these films -- history in a can, so to speak -- for my daughter to enjoy.  The Bad: By and large, the quality of these DVDs isn't that bad. Not great by any means, but serviceable. What I find particularly disheartening is the indifference of studios to the stars of their past -- the ones who made the studios relevant in the first place -- such that a "bonus feature" on this collection amounts to retro Today Show soundbites. The el-cheapo DVD of Chaplin's "The Kid" that I bought at Walgreen's had more bonus material on it, and that was just one disk in a plastic sleeve. This collection devotes one whole disk to bonus features for what...so we can remember how completely unattractive and aurally annoying Gene Shalitt was in the 70s? Pitiful.  I'd still recommend the collection because these films should be a standard in every library. But good bonus material provides context, and that context often engenders an appreciation for the films and their creators that can't be had from bios or period surveys.
