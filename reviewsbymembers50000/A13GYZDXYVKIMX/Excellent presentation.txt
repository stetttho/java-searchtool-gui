 Contrary to what other reviewers think, this version of the Nutcracker music is wonderful to listen to. Yes, it really is the ballet music played on toy instruments. So, it stands to reason that the sound will not be as "full" as that played on full-size orchestral instruments. However, if you've ever wondered how Schroeder could ever get Beethoven out of his little toy piano, this CD should help you divine the secret. Great addition to any Christmas CD shuffle!
