 After reading the reviews available for this title, I decided to pass on this book when it first came out. However, when I received it as a gift this past Xmas, I felt extremely foolish for allowing others to influence my decisions. Nick Bantock is my favorite of all modern authors because, after reading his work, I always feel a liberation from the "face value" of things, or ordinary-ness, and a return to thinking of things in terms of the plausibly extraordinary. "Capolan" is a superb vehicle for inducing this sort of thinking, and I know I will be using it often as the mental jump-start I occasionally need to avoid "coloring within the lines." "Yeah, yeah...but is it any good?" I've heard several people ask since I read this book. Well, that depends on whether you can appreciate things that could be, but more than likely aren't, yet still should be. Confused? Then buy the book and discover for yourself. For me, Bantock's books have always been about suspending one's disbelief from the rafters until it's blue and quivering, and "Capolan" is no exception. Thus, it's a wonderful book for me, and it's been a wonderful book for others to whom I've gifted it.
