 After having read & re-read this book over the past 6 months, I find this book an incredible resource to navigating the complex web of government assistance programs.  Of course, buyers of this book should be aware that the government is notorious for changing things around without telling anyone, so much of the book's information will either be incorrect or completely obsolete.  That said, it still provides excellent starting points for getting the information you need for your business. Keep in mind -- this book is an information resource; it does not get you approved for assistance and it does not do any of the work you need to do anyway in order to finance your business.  I think critics of this book are ignoring the fact that the author is a professional information broker and as such has done about half the work that you would have to do on your own to even get to the application stage of requesting government money.  Since most people have neither the time nor the patience to mine for gold within our bureaucracy, I'd say this book is a good deal if only for that. Just don't expect it to fill out the forms for you.
