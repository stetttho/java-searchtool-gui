 There must be no greater aphrodisiac in the world than the power to mess with readers' minds. I snapped up this book as soon as I heard it was out and, like the others before it, I will not let this one out of my grasp for a second. Of course, it was much too short for my taste -- or maybe I'm just reading faster. I wonder whether Mr. Bantock ever intends to bring this mind-bending tale full circle...like his other works, "The Gryphon" is exquisite to behold, but it can be most painful to read as the story still does not end as one habitually expects. And yet, that pain is a rather sweet one, full of anticipation the likes of which one might only experience in more intimate circumstances. I myself will be experiencing this sort of pain, as I joyfully read the book, over and over for many years to come.
