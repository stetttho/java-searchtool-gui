 Basically, this is a book of essays about weblogs, many of which I had read before, as well as read blurbs on other weblogs which linked to these essays. I felt rather let down by the book, as I had the impression that these would be heretofore unseen works by the First-Gen Blog Darlings. Perhaps the only people who'd get anything out of it would be rank newbies who just want to know what all this blogging business is about. People who are already "in the know" should probably steer clear and get "Small Pieces Loosely Joined."
