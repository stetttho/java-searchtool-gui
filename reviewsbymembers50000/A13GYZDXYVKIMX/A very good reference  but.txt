 For someone totally unfamiliar with Authorware, I thought this book rather confusing. I typically learn best by playing with software and using the manual to construct my own exercises. However, I knew Authorware was pretty complex so I thought this book would help. Well, it did help a little but overall I became quite frustrated with following the book's exercises. As I use Authorware I imagine I'll keep this book on my desk as a reference tool. But until then, I'll content myself with playing on my own.
