 I received this CD from a good friend, and I have yet to take it out of my CD player. It's a fun, rollicking romp of an album with lots of cheeky retro flourishes, tightly mixed and lovingly sung. I really wish they would release another album (or at least play my town sometime!) because they really are a great band with a terrific uncompromising sound.
