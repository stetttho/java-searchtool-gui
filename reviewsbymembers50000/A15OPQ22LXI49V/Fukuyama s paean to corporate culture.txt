 If by Great Disruption Fukuyama refers to the increase in crime, drugs, illegitimacy, divorce, he is talking about what is largely an underclass problem that has nothing to do with changes in corporate structure and  perhaps only a little more to do with the move to a service economy.  Fukuyama takes issue with the Contradictions of Capitalism conservatives  who argue that capitalism that generates its own counterculture like  modernism, or those like Charles Murray, who blame welfare for generating  "bureaugamy" and destroying the family. Fukuyama instead takes  the standard Straussian line, familiar from Allan Bloom (his teacher), that  it is all the fault of Nietzsche and German sociology, and that "hang  loose" is a thougtless Americanization of "Gelassenheit."  Please. But there is hope, and here sociobiology comes to the rescue. Human  beings by nature generate order, and the trust and responsibility necessary  for conducting business "spiritualize" capitalism and generate an  order that more than simply a draw on our dwindling Victorian reserves. The  destruction of authority is not a problem if the Great Disruption is  miraculously homeopathic and generates a new anti-hierarchal,  "network" structure that bears more resemblance to an  organizational flow chart than the kind of irrational bonds that are needed  to keep a family together or prevent people cutting in line at the 7/11. As  far as social theory goes, Fukuyama is a lite weight.
