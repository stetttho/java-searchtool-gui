 You know a book is not going to be any good when the chummy  acknowledgements run two pages, from copy editor to department head, but the problem is that Lear doesn't acknowledge his real debt, which is to Lacan, who wrote this book in 2 pages in the Ethics of Psychoanalysis, seminar VII. Lear attempts a Lacanian reading of the Nicomachean ethics, and uses Lacan to solve the problem of book X, or the philosophic life--is it inside or outside Aristotle's ethics? The philosophic life serves the same function as the death drive for Freud--as an "imaginary signifier" that stands in for a release from all care or worry--or, in the case of the death drive, the desire to live like a rock. Like the Lacanian objet a, it is either the fullness of being or the emptiness of a hole, which shimmers because it is unattainable. Perhaps the most interesting part of the book is Lear's attempt to apply a kind of psychoanalysis to the potential reader of the ethics, who reads to learn how to live his life, and is seduced by the image of the philosophic life, but which is Aristotle's way of letting us down easy: that life, and its happiness, is impossible. (But doesn't Aristotle say that no one really wants happiness, but wants the "serious life," the life of "spoude"?) As an interpretation of Aristotle, Lear is interesting but wrong: the philosophic life is not an elaborate seduction to sugarcoat the sad truth of an impossible happiness, but instead fits neatly the model that guides Aristotle throughout the Ethics, that of sight, the pleasant, constant, receptive activity of just looking around (see the beginning of the metaphysics). Recommended only for those who have read both Aristotle and Lacan, precisely the people who do not need this book (I read it in the bookstore).
