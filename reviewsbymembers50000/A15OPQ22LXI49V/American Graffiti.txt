 The first movie to have an ambient musical soundtrack (there is perhaps a word for that), much like the sound that would later announce the arrival of the storm troopers in Star Wars, Lucas makes a very funny film. The best scence is when the nerd in the movie is trying to steal some beer and is shot at by the store owner; perhaps what makes it so hilarious is the complete disparity between the act and its punishment. In the end, the greaser dies and Richie Cunningham lives and stays in Modesto, and Richard Dreyfuss flies away on a plane, still searching for that blond in the convertible. The greaser is reborn, however, in Happy Days as Fonzi, but Richie Cunningham gets to play himself again. How old is Fonzi? If he is old, then he is a very creepy, and if he is young, then he is terribly miscast. Either way, the working class greaser gets magical powers in his Happy Days afterlife: he can snap his fingers and the girls come running, or turn on the jukebox by hitting it just right. Otherwise he would just be a sad figure of pity, living upstairs in Mrs. C's attic, the greaser glory just so much motor oil. Better to die in a not-so-tragic accident at the end of the movie.
