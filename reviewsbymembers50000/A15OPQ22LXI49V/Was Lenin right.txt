 Furgeson makes an interesting remark at the beginning of the book, to the effect that the book can be read in conjunction with Lenin's Imperialism book to judge whether in fact "finance capital" is fundamentally imperialist and also conservative, or supportive of the restoration regimes. With that in mind, I can't say that I read the entire book, but the answer is, from the parts that I did read, a decisive no. The Rothschilds, the embodiment of finance capital (to use a quaint phrase), were not belligerent, in fact they would not support wars because it depressed the value of their bonds. That said, they did support wars, and did so by financing them, and you can't have a foreign war without borrowing money. Moreover, the family did support restoration regimes, for instance, by selling German bonds in London denominated in English pounds, extending the life of the ancien regimes by a few years. They also exercised a good deal of power because they developed a communication system (runners and pigeons) used by all of the politicians, hence they profited by being at the center of the information flow, and were able to last for so long and so profitably through arbitrage, for example, one brother would by a security in France and another would sell it in London, pocketing the difference. So Lenin was right, Rothschild and "finance capital" was remarkably powerful, but they were not essentially conservative (thought they did support restoration regimes) nor bellicose and imperialist. I do admit to skipping most of the rest of the book, but the genre of "economic history" mixed with a good deal of politics and diplomatic history is very interesting, and more power to Furgeson for pulling it off so expertly.
