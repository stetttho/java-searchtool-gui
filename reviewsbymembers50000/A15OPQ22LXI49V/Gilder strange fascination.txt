 Gilder wanted to title this book "Sam Beau" but the editors, he  said, wouldn't let him. It is doubtful to me that Gilder has any genuine  interest in the welfare of the nation's underclass, but he does have a  strange fascination with delinquency and depravity. Gilder is attracted by  Sam as some derelict version of genuine masculinity, and takes delight in  enumerating all of his failures and pinning the blame on the  well-intentioned liberals who put him there. More specifically, welfare  reverses the relation between men and women: the woman, as the welfare  breadwinner, supports the man, who lives off her income and becomes  dependent on the "welfare queens," moving from one to other when  they turn him out, impregnating each so that they will remain tied to him,  and avoiding work so that his wages won't be garnished. For the liberals,  he is a father so far as he earns money, and for the woman and her children  he is a father only in the biological sense. For the unemployed father  watching tv in the afternoon, masculinity can seem restricted to  nonconjugal sex (perhaps there is another word for that) and set-to's on  the street or in the bar. Again, this fascinates Gilder (or else he  wouldn't have written such a quickly forgotten book), and perhaps part of  the attraction is being a white man interloping in a largely black world.
