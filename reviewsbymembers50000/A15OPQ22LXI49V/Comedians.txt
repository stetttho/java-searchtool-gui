 One of the funny things about this book--it is, after all, about comedians--is that everyone in it imagines that the Americans are going to invade any minute, or if Papa Doc collapses. As unlikely as that seemed when I first read it, now you can reread it after the Americans really did invade, or at least occupy. The comedians are all refugees of WWII: Brown's aunt fought in the resistance and Martha is the daughter of a Nazi,and Major Jones fought in Burma, or so he says. Those are strange details for Greene to add, and they also screw up the chronology if the book takes place when it was written, 1965. The earliest the aunt could have been born is 1895, which makes her 70 and much too old to have a young lover, and even then she would have had to have Brown when she was 15 if Brown is to 55, even though he is supposedly 60-ish. The comedians follow the tragedy, and they all, except for the Tontons Macoute, have very bad timing. If you want to figure out the book, it seems to me that you have to know why Martha is the daughter of a Nazi--how or why could it matter? Why that almost gratuitious allusion? The comedians are somewhere between Europe, which they fled, and the US, which is about to occupy. They are like Jones, who tries to escape the Tontons Macoute by boarding a foreign vessel which is not exactly his home, either.
