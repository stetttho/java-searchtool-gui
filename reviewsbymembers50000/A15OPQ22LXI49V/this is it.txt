 I don't normally read contemporary fiction, except for Don Delillo, but I figured I would read Vonnegut because I think I confused him with Updike and because there was a Graham Greene blurb on the back. In any case, Vonnegut's black humour is mixed with a little too much knowing misanthropy for my taste. There are no sympathetic figures in the novel, which is roughly based on Shakespeare's Tempest, or at least set on the same island, San Lorenzo, but I could be mistaken. Official ceremonies, scientists, Indiana, and ambassadors all get the superior treatment from our narrator, Noah. The only sympathetic figure may be the scientist who built the bomb, but of course his childlike scientific play will ultimately destroy the world one way or another. Cat's Cradle would be a much better movie than novel, but only if it starred OJ Simpson and was turned into a slapstick comedy, because otherwise the black humour is just humourless misanthropy and the fantasy a tired device.
