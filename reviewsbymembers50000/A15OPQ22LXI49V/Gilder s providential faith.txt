 Most neoconservatives are Jewish, and the arguments have a style borrowed from Marxism; consider, for instance, the Cultural Contradictions of Capitalism, which pretty much sums up a certain brand of neoconservatism.  Gilder, however, has his own, distinctly Christian arguments. Capitalism is  for Gilder a festival in which you give and you shall receive. The  entrepreneur who wagers his time, money, and respectability on an  enterprise in which he could never know the outcome gives, and he is  rewarded, and in hard cash. Not exactly what Jesus had in mind when he said  "where your heart is, there your treasure lies," but there you  go. It should also be said that Gilder fundamentally misunderstands the  potlatch. The purpose of the potlatch, in which one tribe would in effect  "trade" with another by providing a large meal and gifts  (anticipating "gifts" in return), was not trade and the  acquisitiveness but in fact the opposite: a display of an indifference to  goods, through their destruction and wastage. Supply-side economics, by  beginning from production and not demand, understands the true engine of  growth is not government spending but the productivity of the entrepreneur.  The counsel of Smith, that we should rely not on the charity but the  interest of the butcher and the baker, is inverted by Gilder: the interest  of the butcher and the baker is their charity. Gilder's providential faith  consists of the spontaneous creativity of the entrepreneur in a  predetermined harmony with Moore's law and supply side economics  ("build it and they will come")whose ultimate incarnation  is--Qualcomm. Who knew.
