 ... This is Habermas' dissertation, but his writing is so poor, in English or in German, that it really doesn' matter. The book is a response, in my opinion, to Carl Schmitt, and  specifically to Schmitt's argument that the core of liberal democracy is  debate in parliament, that liberal democracy is rule by discussion (or, as  its called now, "political discourse"), but that that discussion  is now more real than painted flames on a radiator. Liberal democracy is in  fact the triumph of aliberal, private, hidden powers, who rule from the  shadows and through the true organs of power, the media, and through the  hidden power of the private vote cast in the illicit privacy of the voting  booth, where the bourgeois individual is free to exercise his worst  prejudices and basest motives. So argues Schmitt. Habermas gives an  interesting historical account of the rise of "Offentlichkeit"  (which translates into the all-too-easy abstraction "public  sphere," whatever that is), from the letters passed in the mail  relating the news from town to town, to French salons, to newspapers, to  television and radio. Habermas, like Schmitt, seeks to unmask the illiberal  powers lurking behind the good liberal prejudices, but he, like Schmitt,  mistakes liberalism for a debating society when in fact it is much more  sophisticated than that. Habermas needs to read the Federalist Papers and  the debates (!) at the constitutional convention to understand how little  the founders of one liberal democracy thought of the power of discussion.
