 Sar e Roma consists of Stevo, Branko, Goran, Bato and Hari -- that's all the CD tells us. They sing in Romany: usually solo male, sometimes female or group vocals. Instrumentation is mostly acoustic guitar with occasional darabuka, though they play tamburica on a few tunes. Much of the CD is continental Gypsy Kings-style music, performed with energy but not enough polish to be more than ordinary. Three songs caught my ear: Ushti and Baro Foro, two men's songs in Vojvodina style with Rom choruses, and Maljarkica, a pretty women's a cappella song with a similar semi-Magyar flavor. If someone told me this band was the tenth-best Rom cafe combo in Subotica, I'd believe them. If you're fond of Gypsy songs and aren't too picky about musicianship, it might be worth its modest price.
