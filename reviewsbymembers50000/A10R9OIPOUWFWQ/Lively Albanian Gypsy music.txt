 Rromano Dives is an Albanian Romany (Gypsy) band: two fine singers backed by accordion, clarinet, violin, quiet electric guitar, electric bass and dumbek (hand drum). All the vocals are in the Romany language. The lead singer, Astrit "Titi" Qermimi, is well-known in Europe for his smoky, soulful voice; young Marjeta "Chirikli" Jashari sings in a natural style more reminiscent of traditional Balkan vocalists than theatrical Romany singers. The band performs a mix of traditional songs and their own compositions, all in a pop-influenced but reasonably mainstream Romany style. This is not your father's Albanian village music -- it's 100% urban.  The band features acoustic lead instruments and a tastefully electrified rhythm section -- no turbofolk synthesizers or drum machines here, thank you. Many of the selections are dance tunes, including several good chocheks. My favorites: E Semesquiri Gili, the slow opening tune; Hajde Dudo k-o Bunari, a love song in 7/8; Basandutni, an instrumental chochek; and the up-tempo songs Malkondas Man o Devel and Godarav Sas. The band is tight and the instrumentalists are proficient. Accordionist Nafael Tsaka and dumbek player Jenuz Duka stand out, but clarinetist Bir Xhambazi and violinist Halil Xhaferaj contribute some fine solos, even if their intonation sometimes goes slightly astray. The material's great: lively, mostly uptempo, very accessible and delivered with feeling. If you like modern Balkan Gypsy music or Bulgarian wedding music -- Ferus Mustafov, Ivo Papasov, for example -- you'll like this CD. The emphasis isn't on a single virtuoso performer, though -- this is a closely knit ensemble playing bright, tight arrangements that probably go over well on the radio. I'd love to see these guys live.
