 This just might be the best recording of modern Rom dance music from the southern Balkans, and that's saying a great deal. Buy it. Ferus Mustafov is a superb sax and clarinet player from Macedonia. He performs modern Rom  (Gypsy) wedding music in a style popular across the Balkans today: hot,  fast, hard and loud, blending Slavic melodies, Turkish rhythms and the soul  of the Roma.  For the 14 cuts on this CD, he's backed by a tight 8-piece  band: 2 accordions, keyboard, electric guitar, bass, drums, percussion and  vocals. Ferus' chops are incredible: fast, intricate, heavily ornamented  melodies interspersed with wailing, improvised solos.  My favorite cuts:  Dada Sali, an irresistible Albanian tune, and Dikman, with a killer vocal  by Elizabeta Tapavac. Staro Chunovo Oro is lovely, and it's hard to stay  seated during Tikino. Fabulous party music -- crank it up!
