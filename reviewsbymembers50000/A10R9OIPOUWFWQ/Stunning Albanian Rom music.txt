 What a find! A Greek production of Albanian Rom musicians -- male vocals, clarinet, keyboard, jazz-influenced electric guitar, hand and trap drums, bass. Stunning melodies, great singing and excellent production values. If  you're into modern Rom music from Greece or the Balkans, add this to your  collection immediately. The music's a wonderful blend of Albanian, Greek  and Rom influences, with creatively updated chord progressions that might  raise a few hardcore purists' eyebrows. Selections include moderate-tempo  ballads and some hot shota dance instrumentals. The clarinetist's liquid  style reminds me of an earthier Vassilis Saleas; the guitarist is a cut  above any other Balkan Rom electric guitar player I've heard. If you're  after Albanian village music, look elsewhere -- this is a thoroughly urban  sound. Don't be put off by the New Age-y song titles. Good package design  and liner notes otherwise, but no lyrics or translations, alas. Overall,  I'd rate this band higher than Rromano Dives, and that's saying something.  Highly recommended.
