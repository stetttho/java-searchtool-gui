 An indispensable resource for English-speakers wishing to learn traditional Macedonian songs. Thorough, beautifully edited, respectful of tradition and easy to use (spiral-bound to lie flat on a music stand).  Highly recommended and well worth the price. The book includes voice and  tambura charts, lyrics (Macedonian Cyrillic as well as Latin alphabet) and  translations for 35 Slavic Macedonian songs, all attributed by performer,  village and region. I've played Balkan music for 20 years and have seen the  authors perform; they know their craft. The charts in this book are  meticulous and easy to read, and do a good job of explaining vocal and  instrumental technique, styling and ornamentation in terms that Western  musicians will understand. There's also a pronunciation guide, great list  of folklore resources, regional map, glossary and list of teachers (almost  all in the US). But (curiously) no photo or realistic diagram of a  tambura. The book comes with a cassette of properly licensed original  recordings of the songs, an essential tool for anyone learning the  material. To American ears, the music may have something of an Appalachian  quality, with piercing vocals and zither-like accompaniment. To fans, it's  gorgeous. A Macedonian tambura is a plucked-string, fretted instrument  with a small, teardrop-shaped body. Stringing and tuning varies, but is  often two courses of doubled strings, AA-DD, melody played on the D  strings, A strings droning or silent.
