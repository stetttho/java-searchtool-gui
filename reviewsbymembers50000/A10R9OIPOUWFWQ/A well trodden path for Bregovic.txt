 This is a fine recording, but unless you're a hardcore Bregovic or Kayah fan, buy his Ederlezi CD instead and save your money -- it's almost all the same material, with slightly different arrangements. Bregovic has been shamelessly recycling the same batch of tunes for a while now, using a new singer from a different country each time to mask the sameness of it all -- now here's his Polish installment. Hey, Goran! Isn't it about time you wrote some new songs?  Give Kayah her due -- she's got a wonderfully dark, fluid voice. The treat on this recording is Jesli Bg Istnieje, but it's not new, either -- most of the melody is just a reworking of Ako Ima Boga, a song he did years ago with Bijelo Dugme. If you're unfamiliar with these performers, this CD is a nice place to start, but if you've heard any of Bregovic's recent recordings, you'll find this one covering ground that's all too familiar.
