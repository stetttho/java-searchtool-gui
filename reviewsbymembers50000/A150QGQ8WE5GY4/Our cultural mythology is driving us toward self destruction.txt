 With the clever strategy of using a non-human animal (a gorilla) as his main character, Daniel Quinn manages to address very important questions about human beings and society. Indeed, he points out that if we are living  the way we are now, it is because of the myths we internalized throughout  our history. Thus, despite the fact that we are not consciously aware of  what these myths are, or that they even exist, they do influence our every  day lives. The main point of the book is to make us aware of our own  cultural myths by educating us about other world cultures that do not share  the same mythology. Quinn claims that the core belief of our culture is  something like this: "Man was meant to rule over the entire world, and  use all its resources for his own good, and this is the one right way to  live. However, there is something fundamentally wrong with human nature,  and that is why things are not going well for us." Daniel Quinn then  goes on arguing that it is this belief that is driving our species toward  catastophe, as human beings are using up the Earth's resources too quickly,  as well as destroying species they think are not useful to them, thus  putting in danger the fragile equilibrium of the web of life, which evolved  over many million years. Quinn brings us the positive message that there is  nothing wrong with human nature per se, and that what is leading us toward  self-destruction is only the mythology of our own culture, which we have to  change if we want our species to have a future.           It is a very  interesting and fascinating trip to follow Ishmael back in time to discover  the origins of our cultural myths as, if this book is a fiction for  practical purposes, it is remarkably well documented with real  anthropological studies and observations. Whether you agree with Quinn's  interpretations or not, you will look at the state of things from a  different angle, as you will then try to uncover why things we take so  often for granted came to be the way they are now. Something is going wrong  with the world, we all have this feeling deep inside us; it is now time to  know why and to do something about it! . . . .
