 Kamana One more than met my expectations (and I expected a lot already). It was a great introduction to the whole program and gave an insider view of what is going on at the Wilderness Awareness School. It is composed of two main trails. In the Awareness Trail, you are given exercises to be more attuned to the world around you by sharpening all your senses and paying attention. In the Resources Trail, you explore a particular plant or animal, learning about what to look for if you want to find or identify them and how they fit in the greater ecosystem. All of it moves at a good pace, is challenging, and makes you responsible for your own learning in a fun way. The whole thing is told in a very personal way and the stories shared are very inspiring. Jon Young is also a lot of fun to listen to in his tape series. I whole heartedly recommend this program.
