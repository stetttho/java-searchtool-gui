 This is the "official" sequel to Ishmael. Basically, it is  Ishmael revisited by a twelve-year-old girl. Although the first fifty pages  of the book will bore you to tears if you have read the first novel, it  deals with different issues and is definitely worth reading. Two main  problems are covered in this volume. First, Quinn asks a very pertinent  question: Why do we have to work hard eight hours a day, five days a week?  Has it always been that way? The answer is a sounding "NO!" Many  people are not satisfied with their life because of a job they don't really  like. Just ask people you know if they would stop working if they won one  million dollars. I'm sure most of them will say "yes, of course, my  job is not fulfilling, I'd rather do something else!" But, still,they  go to work every day just because they don't have the choice: no job means  no money, which means no food. However, Quinn points out that it was not  like that before food was put "under lock and key." That is, in  ancestral cultures, you just had to go grab the food you needed where you  knew you could find it. At one point in our culture, however, we produced  so much food with agriculture that we needed to store it, thus leading to a  new class of people: those who did not work in the field anymore as they  had to manage the way food was stored. These people found that life was  easier that way, and they soon realized that as long as they were in  control of the food distribution, they could take it easy by letting the  others work hard. And to protect this new "gold mine" they hired  guards, who thus also had the priviledge not to work hard as long as they  kept the food away from those who worked for it. And this is what led us to  the way things are now: a large class of working people who spend many  hours a day in an environment they despise, and a small class of priviledge  people who have a much eaiser and enjoyable life.           The second  point of the book is the one of education. Have you ever wondered why you  spent so many years of you life in school? Do you ever use just a tenth of  what you've learned? Did not it bore you to death to go over the same  things, over and over again? What our cultural myths tell us is that this  is necessary in a competitive society like ours to learn about many things,  and that repeating the materials is necessary for students to master  everything, as they don't seem to get it the first go around. Quinn first  explains why our education really takes that long, and then claims that if  students cannot learn the materials properly it is because it is not  meaningful to them. In ancestral cultures there is no formal education, but  it is fair to say that tribal children know much more about life than  "civilized" ones. Indeed, the education of the former kids is  made in context, just by observing what adults do. However, in our cultures  we are totally separated from the real world and thus we do not make the  necessary connections to really master anything. Meaningfulness of what we  learn is the essential thing we are missing; let's change this!
