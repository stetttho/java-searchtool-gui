 This is an extremely well written book, combining scientific seriousness with wit and humor. It is a wonderful introduction to the theory of natural  selection that gives strong insights about how and why certain traits, both  physical and psychological, have been selected for our genes to be passed  on from generation to generation. For psychologists in general it offers  the wonderful option to solve the nature/nurture conflict. Indeed, it shows  how it is the environment that selects certain genes, and then in turn how  our genes can influence the environment, leading to a new selection and  thus going full circle. Therefore, it becomes obvious that genes and  environment are entertwined for ever, and that it is their interaction that  makes us who we are. It is also a wonderful tool to understand how very  complex behaviors can be executed automatically (or unconsciously), either  for strategic reasons or because the number of variables to consider is way  too big for our limited consciousness to grasp. Indeed, haven't you ever  found yourself saying "I am not sure why I did that..." or  "I know it was stupid but I just could not help it..."?  Evolutionary psychology is trying to understand why we sometimes feel  compelled to do certain things, or why we are attracted toward certain  persons, even though we are not aware of the powerful forces behind our  actions. Among other things, the author presents compelling evidence about  why males and females are so fundamentally different psychologically, why  we feel love toward our offsprings and which ones we are likely to favor  over others, why and how frienships emerge, and the role of social status  in the search for a mate. Additionally, one of the most impressive things I  found in the book was the explanation of the emergence and purpose of  feelings. Indeed, feelings seem to be so deeply routed in our animal nature  that it is extremely hard, if not impossible, for us not to react in very  emotional ways in many situations. Evolutionary psychology offers a logical  way for us to make sense out of this fact, and provides insights about why  it is such a central part of us to feel outraged, humble, grateful,  indignant, proud, etc...           Do not expect to feel very good about  yourself after you read this book. Indeed, the author points out that the  most noble behaviors emerged for a very selfish end, that is, for our genes  to be passed on to the next generation. This is why the last couple of  chapters are dedicated to ethics. If you ask me, this part sounds way too  patronizing for my taste, and I would have been glad to draw my own  conclusions about what is to be done with the knowledge I acquired reading  the book. However, it is important to note that we evolved to be moral  animals; that is, we became able to be aware of unconscious forces and thus  to slowly learn how to master them. Finally, the author indicates that our  genes were selected in what he calls the 'ancestral environment,' when we  lived in small groups in a world where the word civilization did not even  exist. Thus, it allows us to understand why so many people either feel out  of touch with their environment or are considered deviant. In the past our  genes were selected for their fitness in a particualr environment and our  children were thus fit for it as well, as the environment remained  virtually the same. However, in our modern world where everything is  changing so fast, the genes that had been fit for hundreds of thousands of  years are now lost and clueless, and our ever changing environment is  leaving us no hope to ever adapt ourselves to it. It is obviously  impossible to go back to our ancestral environment for our genes to feel at  home again. However, we still can stop our mad race toward destruction and  allow human beings to once again feel like they are belonging to this  world.
