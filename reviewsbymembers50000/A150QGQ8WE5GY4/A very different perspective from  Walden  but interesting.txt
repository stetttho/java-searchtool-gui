 For those of you who do not know Skinner, he was one of the most famous  behaviorists in the history of psychology. Behaviorists believed that human  behavior is totally controlled by the environment and that our social  problems therefore come from "wrong" reinforcement contingencies  between our behaviors and the feedback we get from our environment. Thus,  Skinner wrote this novel to show how it was possible to build a good  community if it was based on the "right" contingencies of  reinforcement. This book shows how people can cooperate and have fulfilling  lives by simply working a few hours a day to keep the community  functioning, and then spend time on what they really enjoy doing. Skinner  also discusses very important issues. Behaviorists believe that different  individuals are interested in different things and also learn at different  paces. Thus, children need to be in an environment where they can master  their interests at their own pace, with a lot of personal attention  yielding to more and more independence with age. Skinner then illustrates  what such education would be like, with small laboratories being set for  children to experience many things and thus learn by seeing the  meaningfulness of what they are taught.           In short, Skinner tries  to recreate the workings of natural selection with behavioral engineering  methods. The argument is that human beings have stopped experimenting with  what works and what does not work. Our civilization has settled down in its  own ways, and now tries to fix its problems from the inside, blinded by the  false belief that civilization was the best thing ever made. Skinner argues  that there are better ways to live, and that to find them we need to  experiment with different things and find what works for everyone of us.  Although you might find a few of its chapters plain silly, or even scary  because of the "engineering" of behavior, this book is a great  read.
