 This is an amazing book, and you'll get banged up just as much as the main character along the crazy ride of rewinds and fast forwards. Prepare for a rollercoaster of emotions. This book made me stop and ponder, laugh out loud like I rarely do reading a book, stare at the pages in total disbelief, and madly leaf back to try to connect the dots. There is absolutely no way you can guess what the next page, or even paragraph, is going to say. Maybe because it's his first novel, the author has, in my opinion, tended to very slightly overrely on sex appeal and surprise. It would have been good without so much of it, although it doesn't really get in the way either. If you love Derrick Jensen's work, if you deeply despise western civilization and are ready to do something about it, you will absolutely love this book. In the end, I hope to see you at the beach. I'll be there. (...)
