 This is the second of Quinn's books. It is thus a deepening of the issues  discussed in Ishmael. In my opinion, this is the book that is the most fun  to read, as it was written as a thriller. However, I think Quinn went too  fast in writing it, and his arguments are not as strong and as developed as  they should be. It nevertheless remains a must-read if you liked the first  book. The main point of this novel is to make us focus on the issue of  population growth. Indeed, it might be surprising to most of us that the  human population is now doubling every thirty five years. It undeniably  represents a very big problem because, as the Earth's resources are  limited, we might not be able to support many more mouths to feed and  accomodate. Our present understanding of population growth is that we need  to generate more food in order to keep up with this incredible population  growth. However, nobody really asks the most important question: Why is  this poluation growing so fast suddenly, when it used to grow only very  very slowly just a few thousand years ago? Quinn, who works in  collaboration with Dr. Alan Thornhill in the Natural Sciences Department at  Rice University, proposed an interesting point: We have been confusing the  cause for the consequence the whole time! Indeed, making the comparison  with the arm race during the Cold War, Quinn makes us aware that people are  made of food, and that there would not be more people if there was not more  food. Therefore, we are the ones fueling this incredible population growth  by creating more food than we really need! This is very logical in terms of  natural negative feedback loops that we find in the wild; that is,  generally animals eat their food, which by consequence decreases, which  leads to a decrease in population, leading to an increase in food, an  increase in population, a decrease in food...etc... However, humans have  extracted themselves from this negative feedback loop, which promotes  balance, and have created a positive feedback loop, which is drawing us  toward the collapse of the fragile equilibrium of the web of life.            Quinn then moves on to make the distinction between salvationist religions  (Buddhism, Christianity, Islam), whose followers are passively waiting for  a miraculous Savior to come fix all our problems, and anismists, who are  people who are aware of the laws of nature and lead their life in  accordance to them. Thus, Quinn explains that when humans decided to  "take their life in their own hands" they tried to design laws  from scratch, which proved to be a disaster. Indeed, if natural laws  evolved over many million years so that they reflect what  "works," humans have been focusing on what is  "forbidden" to do. In consequence, humans have faced great  difficulties in trying to prevent people from doing what is forbidden,  leading to the incredible mess of our present judicial system, as well as  rebellious acts from the youngs who feel pressured to conform, so that we  are now facing a cultural collapse of values. Quinn nevertheless ends the  book on a note of optimism, as he says that instead of trying to implement  new programs that never work to fight our social problems, we should  instead adopt a new vision of human life within the entire community of  life, so that people get more of what they really want (a sense of  belongingness and fulfillment, for example) and stop acting crazy.
