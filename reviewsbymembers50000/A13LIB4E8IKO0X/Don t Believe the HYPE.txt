 The term "Don't believe the hype" never applied as much.  Are the people who are giving this album 5 stars smokin' *?!!  This is by far one of the worst hip-hop albums ever made!!  The entire album doesn't flow, beats are lame, (numerous samples including RUN-DMC tunes) lyrics have very little meaning and seem to have been only put together to annoy.  This album will make one want to go out and buy Rupaul albums!!  Except, even they were better than this!!
