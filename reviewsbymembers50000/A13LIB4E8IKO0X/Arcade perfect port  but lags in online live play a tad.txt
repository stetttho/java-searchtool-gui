 Xbox owners are finally able to experience the hype behind the GG series with an extended version the PS2 GGX2.  The xbox version features three characters that are selectable right off the bat (from a bale of selectable characters) that weren't in the PS2 version, one of which is an entirely never-before-seen new character as well.  Like Capcom Vs. SNK 2 EO, GGX2R is an arcade port with every single frame kept intact.  GGX2R also harneses some of the most beautifully-detailed 2d backgrounds and character animations ever seen in a 2d fighting game (only game that rivals in this aspect is the SF3 series).  Controls are fairly decent, though at times they can feel a tad unresponsive and rigid.  This mainly depends on the players preference on controller setting.  Overall, the controls are virtuos.   Unfortunatley, also like CVS.SNK2 EO, GGX2R lags in the online department (but not nearly as faulty as CVS.SNK2 EO).  Despite the developers working on hard to prevent this problem, there is STILL slowdown when heading off against opponents online.  There are times when the connection status will show "Excellent" and still have slight delay in play (slowdown).  Also, if the connect shows "bad" or "poor" you can forget it. The controls will be so slow to respond that it's nearlly impossible to pull off moves correctly.  However, this isn't an all time aspect, it just appears from time to time, so have no fear.  That said, GGX2R is a perfect port to an excellent 2d fighter, and with a price tag for under twenty bucks, you simply cannot go wrong.  A must have title, for any sincere 2d gamer.
