 Hip-Hop producer/vet proves to still be in the game with this top-notch, long awaited, anticipated sequel to his impressive solo debut "Soul Survivor."  This time around, Pete lays his rhyming skills aside to focus more strictly on his production. Several of the guest performers on the album are sub-mainstream artists, speakably Talib Kweli, Pharoah Monch, Slum Village etc., who each give avid efforts to shock and amaze.  Some tracks which feature the less known artists are plain out amazing, such as the ones featuring Leela James, Krumbsnatcha, and Little Brother.  For they present Pete at some of his best production to date.    One noticeable aspect that fans may witness is the abscense of Pete's DJ and mixing skills.  There are absolutely none found throughout the album (a huge aspect which  made Soul Survior 1 so memorable) so some Pete Rock fans (many of whom have grown fond of his mixing since the days of "Mecca & The Soul Brother") may find it as a shock to know that there are none in SS2.  Lyrically, the album is impressive (you'd expect nothing less involving the Soul Brother #1) with some dope rhymes.  The only tracks that I really wasn't feelin' were the ones with Postaboy, Dead Prez, and Jay Dilla.  The tracks featuring Postaboy & Dead Prez just sound too commercial for their own good, and lyrically aren't very impressive.  As for the track with Jay Dilla (Jay Dee) he makes as a great producer, but a not-so-great MC (check out his "Welcome To Detroit" lp to get a better understanding) the track is also fairly short, clocking in at around two minutes.  The track just felt rushed. All in all Soul Survior II (while productive-wise, not Pete's best work) is a decent follow-up to SSI and also a breath of fresh air aside from the mainstream hip-hop music scene.  Four Stars.
