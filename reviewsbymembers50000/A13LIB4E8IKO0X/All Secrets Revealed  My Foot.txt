 While following this guide will get the player through the game, it's not as polished as it's portrayed to be.  It's quite hard to believe that Prima let this atrocious thing out the door.  Usually Strategy Guides offer more than enough information for the consumer, that's not so the case as with this one here.  For starters, following this guide leaves the player at loss for several vital golden scarabs and live of the gods.  I noticed points in the game where I didn't follow the guide and ended up with a larger lifebar than what was compared at the time with the guides in certain points of the game.  The guide even has the nerve to have the player backtrack at times to collect life of gods and elixers that the player could have earlier on in their adventure!  Another huge flaw (and possibly thus far the worst) is how Prima didn't even bother to implement an enemy/boss encyclopedia description in the guide!!  Yep, so it's practically "no hold's bar" when encountering new enemies and bosses.  The player is basically left to figure out enemy strategies in the cold, in the thick of battle (Imagine buying a guide for an rpg game that didn't have an enemy/boss encyclopedia, that's how stranded the player is left with this guide).  It's also amazing how the guide gives the reader a brief overview on boss battle encounters for the Ninja Gaiden Trilogy, yet it offers absolutely no clue to the player as to how to access the three games (what on earth is up with that?!). Perhaps the guide wanted the players to try and think for themselves at some points in the game, however that's not what consumers pour out their hard earned cash to buy a guide for.  They buy them for precise information that is more than enough to get them through their game.  You'd do yourself better by simply downloading a complete walkthrough online than spending (money) on this thing.
