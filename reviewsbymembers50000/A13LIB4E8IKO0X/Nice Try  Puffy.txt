 Truth be known. BIG was NOT the king of Eastcoast hip-hop as much as he was credited for(or at least never on Puffy's label). The entire label is based on using premade samples from oldschool artists', that's not being original. Not only that, but lyrics lack substance horribly and serve for very little meaning. You can't consider yourself a king of hip-hop if all you're doing is biting off other artists' beats. Perhaps if BIG was under another label with better guidance, be could have easily been a much better artist, perhaps even be alive today.
