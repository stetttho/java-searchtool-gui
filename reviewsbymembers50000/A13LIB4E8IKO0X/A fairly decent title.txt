 Roswell Conspiracies for psx is based on the television animated series.  Originally planned as a N64 exclusive title, Roswell N64 got canned and was instead slated over to the psx.  The psx version doesn't ubset at all.  The graphics and huge atmospheres in the game are impressive (especially for a 32 bit system).  The opening theme music at the beginning of each mission adds a gloomy, spooky, and horrifying flavorful feel to the already quiet and secluded areas.  The sound effects (while not plentiful) are well done and sound similar to those of a "Star Wars" film.  The only major down to this title is weapon variety.  The special weapon/gun you gather during a mission is then discharged once you complete that entire mission.  Boss encounters also force you to use only the gun you start out with from the beginning of the game (the special weapons to which you gather in your inventory during a mission are not optional to use during boss battles, the time when you need them the most).  Other than that, Roswell Conspiracies psx is a solid title to have for anyone who favors action/adventure games, and for anyone who also likes challenging (but not too complicated) puzzles.  Highly recommended.
