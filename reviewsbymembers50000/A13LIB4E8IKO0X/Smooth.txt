 What can I say?  Dwele proves that he can ponder throughout the neo-soul crowd on his own, with very little commercialism.  The album starts off with a smooth interlude, then takes you off throughout the journey of Dwele.  His style alone puts him in a class of his own.  None of the "I was with your girl the other day" type of lyrics will be found within this album (Dwele's a clean artist with a very rich and smooth voice).  Production is top-notch (Dwele having written and produced about 95% of the album himself) and is a huge step away from the commercialized R&B which has flooded today's industry.  If you're looking for an original R&B artist who uses no samples from other artist's music, and produces and writes their own music, then Dwele is where you'll want to be.  Dwele is a talented impulsive artist, who has a bright future waiting straight ahead.  A needed breath of fresh air.
