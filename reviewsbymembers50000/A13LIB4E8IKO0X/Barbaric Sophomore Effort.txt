 It's quite hard to understand.  Murder Inc.'s Irv Gotti is a top-notch executive producer, right?  Why on earth is he relying on samples?!  This album is a failed attempted at showing off Ashanti's prowess.  After the huge success of her self-titled debut, fans were expecting more from the self-proclaimed "New Princess of Hip-Hop/R&B Soul," but sadly, she fails miserably.  Most of the songs contain samples from 70's and 80's artists, and the lyrics are just so...AVERAGE.  The only tracks which really stand out and show off Ashanti's potential are "Rock Wit U" and "Rain On Me" (then again, maybe it's that catchy background sample from Isaac Hayes' "The Look Of Love.").  There is absolutely no originality found within the album's content whatsoever.  Do yourself a huge favor by skipping over this one.  However, if you ARE searching for a decent sophomore album, you might just want to think about looking into Blu Cantrell's newly released "Bittersweet."
