 Lil Kim wants to be a hardcore rapper so bad, it's sad, because she's dead.  This album comes off much less aggressive than her last one(her best), and features too many superficial tracks to be considered taken seriously.  Kim repeats Biggie verses almost as if she penned them herself.  It's also a disgrace to women when she constantly nags that all women are about is: sex, money, and drugs (such tasteless words).  The guest appearances do little to move one also.  What on earth is 50cent doing on this album?!!  Recently 50cent dissed Kim, and she still puts him on her album.  Gal will do anything to explode once again, which will never happen, cause' she's dead!  I'm not tryin' to diss the Queen Bee, (I have mad respect for her as an independant women) it's just that someone with such energy should strive to create a better image for themselves.  If you're lookin' for TRUE female mc's who keep it real, check out: Mystic, Cha Cha, Bahamadia, or Lauryn Hill.  Their innovations will keep you moving.  Just not with this one here.  One Love!!
