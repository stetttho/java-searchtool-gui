 This is probably TLC's strongest comeback lp since "Fanmail", but it's not great.  There are some decent tracks which stand out to the group's original style, such as:"Girl Talk", and "In Your Arms Tonight".  The rest is pretty much average.  TLC will not produce another classic.  They're tired and worn out.  No more "CRAZYSEXYCOOLS".  They're dead.  This is possibly the best they are capable of.
