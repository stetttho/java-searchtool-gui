 Gunsmith Cats has been around for while, so one may automatically think at the top of their mind: "Oh no!  It's so old!  It may feel outdated watching now!" Have no fear! Gunsmith Cats settles the thirst of anyone to whom yearns for a solid anime series: new, creative, and intriguing.  First off, unlike most Japanese anime series and manga, this series takes full place in the U.S. (Midwest/Chicago)and revolves around a full cast of American/English characters (sorry, but no Japanese characters with blonde hair or blue eyes here). Rally Vincent and Minnie May Hopkins are two nubile female owners of a gun shop, so when they're called in to do investigations regarding the recent murders from an unknown organization, they quickly leap into action, ready for battle. A three-part episode series (running approximately around 90 minutes or so total on dvd) Gunsmith Cats is an extremely impressive attempt from Kenichi Sonoda at recreating the surburban areas of Chicago (there are actually Amoco gas stations spotted in the series from time to time).  Watching "Gunsmith Cats" may actually make a viewer forget that the series was actually done entirely in Japan.  All in all however, Gunsmith Cats is a very in-debt (though rather violet and explicit at times) action-packed series that should be able to break any anime fan's (looking for something more than just Japanese characters with blonde hair and blue eyes similar to that of "Yu Gi Oh," or "Tenchi Muyo") thirst.  Highly recommended.
