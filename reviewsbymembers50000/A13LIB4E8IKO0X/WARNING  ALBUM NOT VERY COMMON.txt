 When Common dropped "Like Water For Chocolate" back in early 2000, I didn't think an album could get any better from the Chicago native.  However, shortly after Electric Circus' release, I soon learned that perhaps I had thought too highly of Common as an MC.  What we have here instead of the smooth, rich, pure, instrumental beats and oldschool-type lyrics/vocals that we were all once used to hearing and adoring from Common, is a mediocre 13track contemporary lp, crammed with multiple guest appearances ranging from The Neptunes all the way down to Prince(Yes I said Prince).  First off, this album features a member from a rock/metal band by the name of P.O.D. These guys have no hip-hop credibility whatsoever!!  They're not rappers at all!! Secondly, the beats are just plain horrific.  Horrific to the point where you just can't take anything Com's saying seriously at all.  Thirdly, there are just waaay too many guest performances on the album.  Common only performs solo on about two tracks off the entire album. Which is sad, because it really takes away from his talent and ability as an individual.  I constantly found myself shaking my head in disgust and confusion instead of the gentle nodding I was once used to doing upon the listening of Common's older work.  I couldn't help but constantly question myself upon listening to this album, "Just what is Common doing?!!"  Just because hip-hop changes, doesn't mean that you have to change along with it. Keep it real!  When I discovered that P.O.D. and The Neptunes were involved with this album, I almost didn't buy it.  I'd wish I hadn't.  <sigh>
