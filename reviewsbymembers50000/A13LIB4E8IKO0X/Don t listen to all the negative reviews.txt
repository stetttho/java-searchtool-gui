 I'm baffled with all the negative reviews this game has constantly been receiving!  Critics constantly rant and rave about the game not living up the the potential of such games as Halo.  How on earth can anyone compare a lst person shooter to a 3rd person shooter?  Nowadays, it almost seems as though if a shooter doesn't play EXACTLY like Halo, then it's no good.  That shouldn't be the case.  Brute Force is twice as long, more challenging, better replay value, and has smoother/crisper visuals and graphics than Halo.  Besides, why would anyone want to play a cheap imitation shooter that plays exactly like Halo?  Let's just face the facts people.  If you like first person shooters, then play Halo and Half-life, and you if you despise 3rd person shooters then leave Brute Force alone and stop complaining of how it's either a rip-off of Halo or it's not as good as Halo, because BF is it's own game.  Try to accept Brute Force for what it is.  A darn good 3rd person shooter (possibly one of the best, if NOT the best out now).  One of the all time best around!
