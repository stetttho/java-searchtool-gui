 First off, if you're one of those fans of television music shows such as: TRL, Direct Effect, or 106 and Park, please disregard investing in this album.  This album is a true essential hip-hop classic.  Underground hip-hop from a ridiculously underrated underground emperor.  Royce's lyrics are extremely deep, and stay on one's mind for a mass amount of time.  Tracks such as: Rock City, Boom, and Life, will keep one embraced from start to finish!  Why great artists' like this do not get promo, while the less talented seem to hoard all attention and sales, really makes one wonder...  Regardless, this album is a complete masterpiece, and any fan of underground hip-hop or of great music not commercial(true and innovating in general), cannot go wrong with it.  Even the ones to whom may not even like hip-hop in general, may find themselves at home!! ...
