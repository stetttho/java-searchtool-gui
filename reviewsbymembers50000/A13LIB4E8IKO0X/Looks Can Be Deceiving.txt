 I only bought this movie because it had Nas featured on the cover of the dvd box.  It even stated "Starring Nas."  Later learning that Nas had very little to nothing to do with the film.  He is only featured in the entire movie for a couple of minutes, with a minor role.  This wouldn't be so bad if the movie was half-decent, but there is absolutely nothing unique or thrilling about the film.  The company that has developed the movie is committing a huge crime of false advertising.  Be prepared to see numerous 10 to 15 second cameo appearances from music superstars and actors.  So I guess this movie is just like 1993's "Meteor Man?"  Do not buy this movie.  You WILL regret it.
