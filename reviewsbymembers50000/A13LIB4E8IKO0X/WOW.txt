 Here's the plot of the film: "It's about a suit that fights."  WOW! AMAZING!  Mindboggling!!  Seriously!  Jackie Chan has fallen off notches from his usual acting course, since he's now acting in Hollywood.  In fact, as of to date, Jackie Chan is perhaps the worst martial arts actor out now!  Even worse than Steven Seagal!  The plots to his most recent films don't even make much sense at all! (The Medallion, Shanghai Noon/Knights)  Please!  If you're looking for a decent action packed Jackie Chan film, get "Drunken Master" (skip the sequel) or any of his movies before "Rush Hour."  It's just a sorry sight to see such a great actor fall off this horribly!!
