 In my most humble opinion, this is by far Enya's greatest work of art to date.  The entire album flows so smoothly and comfortably.  To say that there is a best track that stands above all others off the entire album is a sin.  Every single track is a marvelous work of art.  From the beautiful sounds of the flute, to the gentle stroking of the harp, it's all here.  Added to those elements are the pure, lauded, crooning vocals from the one and only, Enya (how can one go wrong?).  Some may overlook "The Celts" because of it's age (it may sound a bit outdated compared to current Enya works).  However, when all is said and done, "The Celts" comes off as a very substantial masterpiece from Enya with beautifully fused elements, and anyone who opposes to her music, is simply jealous of her gift-given talent.  A masterpiece.
