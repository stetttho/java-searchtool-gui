 When I first saw article reviews for Kung Fu Chaos, I was almost certain that it was a stupid game.  One day, a friend brought along with two others, this title over to my room to play on my xbox.  I almost wanted to smack him senseless for such imprudence.  However, after playing this game for five minutes with four players, I was hooked!  The game moves at lightning fast speed is extremely laughable along with entertaining. Gameplay never seems to slow down, and the game almost never grows boring.  Even playing a 1 player game is a blast, given the fact that the computer A.I. is so clever the player will be challenged to their limits.  By the way, the custom soundtracks system is excellent!!  The game takes full advantage of the custom soundtracks system, so the player never really needs to worry about hearing the same-old boring dull tunes.  After borrowing this game,  I quickly ran out and grabbed a copy of it for myself!  Anyone looking for gameplay debt similar to "Powerstone," needs to look no further.  Kung Fu Chaos has come to save the day!!  I can hardly wait for the sequel.
