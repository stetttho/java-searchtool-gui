 Hmm....what can I say?  After the success of the first film, Time Warner screws up with the sequel.  The movie is short, storyline is lame and dry, acting is horrendous(Paul Anderson the director of the first film was not not involved with the sequel) and the battles are way too comical.  The hugest ubset would have to be the villain "Shao Khan," a character to whom was once feared in the video game, is now considered a laughable punk.  Shao Khan in black tights?!!  Give me a break!  By the way.  How on Earth did the developers get Shao Khan looking the way he did in the first movie (the way he looked in the game) to looking like a puny punk in the sequel, hm?  .....um..got to think of something nice to say...Oh!  Well the effects are a nice touch, and Nightwolf is an intriguing character (though he is only in the film for about 5 minutes, maybe less).  Ending is pretty boring as well.  Another MK movie is being developed now, but if Paul Anderson is not the director behind the film, and if the storyline is tired and lame like "Annihilation," you can be expecting more of the same to arise in that installment as well.  sigh...
