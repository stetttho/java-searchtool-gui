 How anyone can give this title a solid 5stars is beyond me.  This title is by far the worst RPG game ever created!!!  "Time Stalkers" is everything gone wrong with an RPG, which had the potential of being a great title, if just a little more time and effort were put into the project.  Dungeons are randomly picked, (which can be an either good or bad thing dependings on one's preference) can only carry 5 items when entering a dungeon (only level 1 weapons can be carried inside a dungeon since your character is started at level even time they enter a new) , and worst of all if you're defeated in a battle guess what, not only do have to start the entire dungeon from scratch, but you're also started back at level 1 and lose all of strong weapons which you had gathered during your voyage!!  What were the creaters thinking?!!  Not only that, but the list goes on and on!!  Do not buy this title!!  I'll make you want to play NES rpg titles!!!  Which are better may I add, than this title!!
