 Cibo Matto bandmate hits with aggressive eerie tunes and heavy acoustic/electric jazz-laced melodies. The album goes from slow and melodic to speedy and fast paced when least expected. The top-notched production added with sensual vocals makes for a excellent listening experience.   The track "I Dream About You" is especially dazzling which features Cibo Matto bandmate Miho Hatori(very smooth and relaxing), and since there more than likely won't be another album from the duo for a while, this is more than likely the best fans can settle for.  The track alone proves that the duo can still work magic together as a team.  Other tracks such as "When The Monkey Kills" shows off Yuka's acoustic/electric jazz-based prowess, which are without a doubt impressive.   Nonetheless, Yuka's sophomore effort is a perfect fusion of different elements in music and has her once again shining throughout the underground scene.
