 Years ago...No...I never dreamed that it would end up like this.  How possible could this be?!!  Is this a nightmare?!!  No...a dream.  This is but all a bad dream.  The artist who brought us memorable classics like "Pieces of You," and "Spirits," straying from that style of music to bring us a boring mainstream hip-hop/pop experience?!!  This album sounds NOTHING like any of Jewel's previous albums.  There is just way too much hip-hop/pop influence here.  Yes, change is good.  However, if it means changing everything that I once loved and adored about you (style, lyrics, etc) then something just isn't right.  Christina Aguilera has also tried this mainstream hop-hop/pop image, and it just doesn't work.  Instead of the modern rock music that we were once used to adoring from Jewel, we're force to listen to this new hip-hop/pop Jewel, who comes off much more aggressive trying to be the next "Shakira."  Please! Jewel, revert back to your roots before you get tossed off the stage! We still love you thought!
