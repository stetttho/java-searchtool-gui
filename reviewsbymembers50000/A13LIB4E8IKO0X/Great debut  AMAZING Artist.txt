 A Majority of album releases of 04 have been somewhat....lacking in quality. However, not all hope is yet lost this year.  "Get Away From Me" has brought some more orginality back.  For starters, the artist (Nellie McKay) wrote, produced, and arranged the entire album.  She's a musician of various instruments (apparently) thus performing her musical prowess a majority of the album.  Nearly every aspect of "Get Away From Me" is live.  Live instruments, live vocals, live bands, you name it, and  I must confess that the entire fusion of the elemets sounds magnificent.  The album is a mixed bag fusing various styles, whether it be Mckay crooning to an oldies inspired song or her delivering silky-smooth rhymes flows through live instrmuents.  The only issues I can think to speak of is how the album is divided into 2disc when the lengths on each disc clocks in at around thirty minutes for a combined total of about an hour and and some minutes, and as we all know, the maximun a disc can hold is up to eighty minutes.  It could have been possible for both disc to be fused together, that way the listeners don't have to scamper back and forth from disc to listen to their favorite tracks.  However, all the tracks on both albums are equally amazing, so it really isn't a big problem.  Another complaint is the Parent Advisory notice.  Explicit Lyrics?  I've listened to non-Parental Advisory albums with more swearing that this.  Sure, Mckay slips up every now and then, but it's nothing serious enough to slap the entire album with an Explicit Lyrics notice. Those are the only major drawback I could think to complain of.  A lot of people look at Nellie McKay as being a young artist who still has a lot of maturing to do.  I just wish that people would really accept her for what she truly is, a magnificent musician.  The greatest debut of 04?   Possibly so, let's just wait and see what the rest of year holds for this talented artist.
