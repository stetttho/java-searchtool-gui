 Though amazon.com is marketing/advertising this as the long-awaited solo album from legendary Cibo Matto member Miho Hatori, this IS NOT she.  This is an album by a hip-hop/electronic artist/production group to whom appear to have absolutely no connection with the "actual" Miho.  Miho's two solo ep's (entitled: "Smokey & Miho" & "Tempo De Amor") can be purchased off this site.
