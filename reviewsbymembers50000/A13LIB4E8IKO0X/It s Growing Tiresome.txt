 Sean Carter claims he's living true to his roots, but his lps' tell otherwise.  BP2 is but yet another sign of Carter's failure.  He can't think past money, cars, and women anymore.  He insulted Jaz-O and lost him in the mist, and Sauce Money hasn't been down with the ROC in ages, which suits me just fine.  Jaz-O and Sauce Money are too good for the ROC.  For an artist receiving so much musical praise, he can (and should) do better.  On bp2, Sean Carter bites off styles ranging from 2pac down to Prodigy of Mobb Deep!!  He even tries a pathetic attempt at a Bone Thugs N' Harmony impersonation!!  It seems as though with each album Carter drops, he becomes lazier and lazier with his rhymes.  BP2 does very little to save face for this artsit(although I'm sure this album went Platinum and over before it was even released).  With the upset of Common's "Electric Circus," the huge disappointment of the Roots: Phrenology, and current plague of pop rap, (Ja Rule wants to become a pop star) the state of hip-hop is slowly dying off into oblivion. It's just a pity to see that some of the hip-hop greats: A Tribe Called Quest,  2pac, Digable Planets, X-Clan etc., aren't around to put these clowns in there place.  These pop rappers are a disgrace to hip-hop and must be stop!!!
