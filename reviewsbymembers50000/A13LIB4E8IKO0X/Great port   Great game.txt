 Well first off, let me just state that I hope that noone was expecting this port to be graphically superior to it's pc counterpart.  The graphics which the pc version harness could pass for next gen.  Besides, just how many console ports nowadays are graphically superior to their pc cousins in general (games of which were originally developed on the pc)?  With that said, the Xbox version of HL2 is phenomenal.  Of course the game's not going to look as graphically on par with it's pc counterpart (what games do, with some notable exceptions with titles such as FC:I & D3?) but you must remember that Valve build XB HL2 from the ground up with an entirely different graphics engine.  Even so, the game still looks graphically superior to a majority of the games out on the current gen consoles. The physics engine is still intact & looks wonderful along with the character models.   The only real gripes here are that there's some slight framerate issues, especially noticeable right after the game boots up when entering a new area or after saving your game (very brief, but noticeable).  There's also the lack of online play or even a multiplayer sequence.  This port isn't exactly like the RE4 transition from GC to ps2, as to where the later port gets a host of special or exclusive features (extra modes, weapons, missions etc.).  Though extra modes, weapons, multiplayer, and missions would have all been nice for the xbox version of HL2, the reality is that HL2's(gameplaywise) an exact replica of it's pc counterpart.   HL2 for xbox is a port developed on xbox for xbox owners (not pc), so if you've already experienced the game for pc, you might just want to steer clear & consider investing in HL2 Aftermath (for xbox version of HL2 is the same as the pc) for pc.  However, if you haven't already played HL2 on the pc, you'd definitely want to check it out for the xbox. You simply cannot go wrong with the experience that is of HL2.
