 ....Oops!!  I accidently purchased the fullscreen edition dvd of "Underworld" instead of the widescreen edition (actually the store where I purchased the dvd from only sold the fullscreen editions, and I didn't pay much attention to it, I was just so excited about finally purchasing the dvd, my mistake). Unfortunately, the fullscreen edition is a mere shadow of it's theatrical counterpart. Everything on screen looks so blown up, it's a hassle to decipher what's going on throughout the entire movie!  This may not seem like a big deal to those who are used to watching fullscreen films, but to those who aren't (and cannot bear to watch them like myself) please do yourself a favor and get the widescreen edition instead, in order to fully enjoy the feel of the movie as to it's theatrical counterpart.  Also, what's with the dvd packaging?  The dvd version of "Underworld" was supposed to contain two dvd's and a music soundtrack to the film, and when it arrives it only comes with the single movie dvd.  That's just plain laziness.
