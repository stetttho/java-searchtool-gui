 Now, I've seen some bad movies in my lifetime, but this one just takes the cake (right up there with Bram Stoker's "The Mummy").  Uwe Boll's perception of an ideal horror/action flick is putrid!  For starters, the film makes absolutely no sense at all (the best you'll get out of a storyline is the three minute read intro) & constantly jumps from scene to scene (one moment, Slater's on a plane, the next he's involved in a Taxi Cab chase/collision).  The battle sequences are downright laughable.  You'll frequently be seeing humans interacting with CGI monsters for the remainder of the film.   Come to think of it, the film doesn't have a single positive trait (except for when it ends) just a bunch of bloody-senseless action, comprised with CGI effects to supposedly live true to the game's original essence (or at least in Boll's lethargic eyes).  The film brings absolutely nothing new to the table & is simply painful to watch.   What's really baffling is how (after watching the behind-the-scenes footage) the film's producers actually thought they were crafting something phenomenal when developing the movie.  Slater himself stressed as to how much of a "Masterpiece" the film would expectedly turn out to be (the film was supposedly to place his ill-faded career back on the map) for he was very passionate about taking part in AITD.  Sadly, the film does nothing but add insult to injury to both his & Dorff's careers.  Avoid this film at all costs!  Only watch this film to decipher what NOT to do when making a film.  You've been warned!  It's a real shame.  AITD was one of the very first videogame series (if not the first) to construct "Survivor Horror," & this is the way it's rewarded.
