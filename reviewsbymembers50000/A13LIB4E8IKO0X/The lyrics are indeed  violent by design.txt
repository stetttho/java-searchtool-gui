 This album's a p.o.s.!!  Good beats gone to waste, that's all I can say.  It's really hard to believe that the group that brought the listeners great albums such as "Psycho Social," and "Violent By Design," could possibly ponder to this (no Jus Allah this time) if the track "Blood in Blood Out" isn't enough to convince you of the change, then perhaps the rest of the horrid lyrics from Vinnie Paz will.  I was appalled by his lyrics!!  "I like anything that resembles death.  I like David Koresh."  This guy went way overboard!  Stoupe's production is top-notch as usual, for he is an excellent producer (though many of the beats sound a bit similar, salsa-like) but once Vinnie Paz opens his mouth, he ruins the entire flow of the beats with his obnoxious lyrics. He speaks as if he's mad at the entire world, and wants every single living Christian to suffer pain (he speaks almost as if he thought he were a god).  What did Christians ever do to him to make his this angry? Hm?  "Hate you/Die!!/Hate You/Die!!!" That's technically all Paz speaks of on VOG.  What ever happened to rapping for Christ, and guiding mortals to the Holy Land along with fellow religious rap group Lost Children of Babylon? He's now contradicting everything he once spoke of.  After several minutes of horrid music listening, I quickly disposed of this cd, and vowed never to buy another Jedi Mind Tricks album again.  I strongly urge any JMT fan to do the same.  Seems to me that Vinnie Paz needs to spend less time hating on the Christian religion, and more at the gym.  "Visions of Gandhi?" Yeah right! More so, "Visions of Osama."  Stoupe, lose Vinnie Paz, then we can talk!!
