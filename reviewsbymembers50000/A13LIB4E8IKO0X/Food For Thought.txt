 Larrieux has finally returned, back and better than ever!  After four long years, her long-awaited sophomore solo album finally arrives.  It's obvious that within that timeframe, Larrieux was hard at work with "Bravebird," it shows all throughout the entire album, from start to finish.  With the exception of the "Infinite Possibilities'" "Weather" inspired opening track "For Real," the rest of the album has an entirely distinctive sound. This time around, Larrieux has implemented more acoustic guitar, piano, jazz, African vocals, percussion, strings(orchestra inspired) sounds throughout the album, aside from her previous effort. Each track has a distincitve sound from each other (hearing the disco-inspired track "Bravebird" shows off Larrieux's wide range of musical sound).  While her last effort focused more on neo-soul type sounds, "Bravebird" is entirely different.  Both lps are great and are in classes of their own.  Regardless, "Bravebird" is a wonderful follow-up lp.  Larrieux has once again proven that she doesn't have to be rollin' with "Groove Theory" in order to stay on top of her game.  A highly recommended album.  Just don't buy this album expecting it to sound excactly like her previous effort.
