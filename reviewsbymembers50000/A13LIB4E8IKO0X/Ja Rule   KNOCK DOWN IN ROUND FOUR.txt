 Round #4.  Ja Rule is knocked down instantly.  Every album he's dropped since his debut (Venni Vetti Vecci) has always fell off one notch below the one before.  "Venni Vetti Vecci" is incomparable, "Rule:3:36" was great, "Pain is Love" was FAIR, but the latest album "The Last Temptation," is poor and fails in it's entirety.  Perhaps some of the tracks off "TLT," are what were left over from "Pain is Love."  Ja Rule is down for the count.  Will he ever get up?
