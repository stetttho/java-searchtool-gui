 Can we please stop comparing "Dream of The Blue Turtles," and "Nothing Like The Sun" to other Sting lps?!!  Let's just face it.  Sting may never make an album as hot as those two.  Just like Paul Simon may never make anything as hard-hitting as he did in the early to mid 80s' with "One Trick Pony" and "Graceland."  Personally, I believe this is vintage Sting, and I expect this album to be "Sacred Love," not "Nothing Like The Sun Part 2," or "Dream of The Blue Turtles 2003."  So, just stop comparing, and let us all let Sting grow as an artist. This album has way too many hot songs such as: title track, Whenever I Say Your Name, and Never Coming Home.  Heck.  All of the songs are great, and the album will keep the listener embraced and interested for times and times to come.  Just because an artist doesn't come on the same way as they did in the past doesn't make their new and previous music dreadful (if it IS decent music with appropriate lyrics).  If you're a Sting fan, there is very little, to no, reason not to add this album to your collection.
