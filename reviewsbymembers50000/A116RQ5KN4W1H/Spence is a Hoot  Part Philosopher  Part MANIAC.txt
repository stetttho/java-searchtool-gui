 Spence does a wonderful job of framing what it means to "win" an arguement.  He makes an eloquent, I dare say nearly buddhist, arguement of his own for what it means to let go of the need to be right.  Pounding others into submission is not always helpful during arguements.  Rather it is the style (if not substance) of your arguements that win.  Slow at times, but a nice read.
