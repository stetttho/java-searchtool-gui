 I was delighted to reread these books with my adult eyes, as I had not read them since a youngster.  My favorite line in the Hobbit to parapharse was, "All of Bilbo's adventures had led him to this point, where he had to face the ultimate horror (Smaug the Dragon) alone."  There are points in all the books where the primary character faces an ultimate challenge alone.  It is a wonderful lesson and a great psychological truth, we all are ultimately alone.  It is the moments of merry making after overcoming the milestone fears that make life truly worth living.
