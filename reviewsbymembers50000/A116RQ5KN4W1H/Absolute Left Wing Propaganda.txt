 Well one of the reasons "there are no children here" is that there are no fathers here.  This book is explotative in both the children written about and the role of fathers in general.  Barely mentioned, the role of the father is fully dismissed.  Rather, society and lack of government intervention is blamed for all the problems of these two young boys.  There is no emphasis on personal responsibility nor is there an effort to offer alternative solutions for resolving the plight of similar youths.  In short, this is a maudlin, contrived attempt to emotionally manipulate the weak minded individual and duping them into believing that only gov. programs could possibly help.
