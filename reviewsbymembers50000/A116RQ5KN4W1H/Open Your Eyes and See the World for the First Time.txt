 I grew up pentacostal and the Apocalypse (as described in Revelations) was a very real event, about to happen at any moment.  As a child I never really expected to see my adulthood, "knowing" that the world would end.  Now of course, I see things slightly differently.  This book by Edinger is why I really enjoy Jungian psychology.  Edinger puts into perspective the beliefs of millions of conservative Christian Americans and helps you see it through psychological eyes.  I can now breathe a sigh of relief knowing a bit more about the apocalypse but still a little aprehensive knowing that many unconscious "believers" may create a self fulfilling prophesy by their own projections!
