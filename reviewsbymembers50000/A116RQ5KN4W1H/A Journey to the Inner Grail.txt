 Robert Johnson said it best, "We each have but to walk down the path and turn left to find the Grail Castle.  It's simply being conscious enough to know when the time has come to enter the Grail Castle."  I love the story of Perceival so very much.  Not only because it mimics so much of my own personal spiritual quest but also because of the hope it gives Western man.  We have only to ask the question to heal the Fisher King, not know the answer.  The question, "Whom does the grail serve?" is enough.
