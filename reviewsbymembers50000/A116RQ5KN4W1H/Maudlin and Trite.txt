 This "dictionary" is the very epitome of bad taste and misinformed poppycock.  Why on Earth do I need to see a picture of a dog (page 794--Norwegian elkhound) yet there is no picture of novaculite.  The definition of novaculite is so inaccurate as to boggle the mind.  The "dictionary" has "a very hard fine-grained siliceous rock..."  When any geologist worth his salt knows that novaculite is only a mildly hard, moderately grained rock of SEDIMENTARY origin, NOT siliceous origin.  Inaccuracies abound in this horribly written tricksy tome.  I suggest instead using the New World Dictionary instead.
