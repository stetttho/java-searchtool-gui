 Imagine for a moment that someone tattoo's a single word upon your forehead. You walk around and this is what people see. They sterotype you based on that single word. All that they think you are or ever will be is contained in that word. How would that affect you? The DMS-IV-TR and previous editions, are the "cookbooks" of the psychiatry and psychology world. However, often they are used to simply label someone with a diagnosis that is supposed to tell you everything you need to know about this persons psychological make-up. How absurd! As a psychologist myself, I find the diagnosis useful only as a starting point in helping the patient discover what may be a part of their problem. Some people find a diagnosis helpful. They get a "Oh! So that's what's been wrong with me all these years" kind of reaction. After that, I help the person realize that they are more than their diagnosis. However, this book is written from a "medical" model. I've often found that many so called "mental disorders" are Crisis' of the Spirit and soul and have little to do with a disease modality. Tread carefully when reading this book. Note that only one diagnosis (PTSD) has any suggested cause. The book simply describes a set of behaviors that are grouped together and given a name. It doesn't suggest any cause or cure. The book is limited by this respect.
