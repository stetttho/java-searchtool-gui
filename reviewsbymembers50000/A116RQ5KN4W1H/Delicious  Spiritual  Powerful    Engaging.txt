 I was first aquainted with Rumi and the delightful Coleman Barks at a Jungian retreat.  Rumi takes you into his inner world and his relationship with the divine (objective divine) and the divine spark he sees in others (most notably his "beloved").  I've read that it is impossible to translate Rumi's original sing-song ancient Persian into modern English, but Barks certainly does an eloquent job (at least that's what my Persian friends tell me).  If you would like to understand true depth psychology or understand the mysteries of love, this is the essential guide.
