 This book helped me create a "Womanizing" persona that empowered by previously sheepish attempts to seduce women. With the suggestions listed in this book, I became a seduction machine.  Why this book did not sell better, I'll never know.  It is sheer genius.  On occasion you can find copies in the bargain book bins.  But I usually snap them up and give them to male friends who are victims of heartache or an evil, manipulative woman.  Curiously, this book infuriates most women.  Overall, this book is exceptionally funny and gives the single man a whole new outlook on the better, smarter half of humanity.
