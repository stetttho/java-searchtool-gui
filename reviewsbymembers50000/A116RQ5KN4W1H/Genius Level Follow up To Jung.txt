 This book is an expansion and follow-up to Jung's equally wonderful book "Answer to Job." Edinger talks extensively about the evolution of Western man's idea of God. His "God-Image" (not God literately), but rather man's perception of God and how that has changed through-out the centuries. Edinger continues to strike a wonderful balance between scholarship and accessablity. Although, this book is by no means "lite-reading", it is a thoughtful book that the educated lay-person would find helpful, particluarly for those on a spiritual path.
