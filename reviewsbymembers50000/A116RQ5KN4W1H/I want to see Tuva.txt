 I first became aquainted with Richard Feynman during my Master's program.  During that time a professor of mine showed us a delightful NOVA documentary on Feynman.  There was a great interview with Ralph Leighton, Feynman's friend, and Feynman himself who became rather obessed with getting to Tuva.  Tuva was once a small independent country at the turn of the 20th century(and before) but later was taken over by the Soviet Union.  I love this book because it gives you a wonderful view of the genius of Feynman as well as his human side that other more academic books tend to leave out or dismiss.  As a side note, recently on a trip to Europe, I met a man who I swear WAS Richard Feynman, I even called out, "Dr. Feynman" and the man turned.  He pretended to speak no English and walked away from me.  Could Feynman still be alive and living well in Switzerland?
