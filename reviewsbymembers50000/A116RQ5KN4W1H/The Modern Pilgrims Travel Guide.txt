 One of my top things to do on my "fantasy list" is to visit every sacred site listed in this informative book.  I love the lay-out and ease of use of most "DK" books.  This book is particularly interesting in that it gives a fairly decent summary of each holy site.  It is a good beginning guide and may help to "spur" interest in a particular area that you can then delve more deeply into at a later time.  However, I thought they could have given a bit more information on some of the English sites.  They also tended to focus mainly on pagan sites.
