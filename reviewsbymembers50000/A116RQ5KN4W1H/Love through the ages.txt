 This book is not only a natural history of love, but also an important look at the psychological development of Western man.  Ackerman doesn't really delve into Eastern or tribal love rites (only briefly and then simply by conjecture at the beginning).  She does go in depth into the phenomina of Courtly Love.  I particularly enjoyed a few Greek and Egyptian love poems written thousands of years ago.  It makes one realize that even though technology advances, empires rise and fall, the fundimental nature or human psyche---particularly in regards to love, is a classic and timeless pursuit.  This book made me want to love more deeply.
