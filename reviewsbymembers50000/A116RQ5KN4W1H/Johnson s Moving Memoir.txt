 Robert Johnson was my first introduction to Jungian psychology.  His simple, yet profound little books (He, She, We, Ecstasy, et al.) impacted my life deeply.  In this his memoirs, Johnson relates a moving account of a life and all that it encompasses.  The suffering, joy, and those wonderful "grail castle" experiences.  If you are aquianted with Johnson's previous work, then this book will be all the more enjoyable.  However, it may be a good starting point into learning more about Johnson's previous, more scholarly work on Jungian psychology.
