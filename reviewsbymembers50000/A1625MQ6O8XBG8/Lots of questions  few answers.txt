 This book is useful if:  1. You are involved in designing a site that is solely information-oriented.  2. You want a counter-point to Jakob Nielsen, who really has some helpful information.  3. You have a boss who doesn't know anything about the web and you want back-up documentation for your decisions. Otherwise, this book has the following weaknesses:  1. Too many questions are asked with the answer being "we do not know why" and too many sentences beginning: "we believe, but do not know"  2. The goal was too specific: how well do users find information. This leaves out any websites designed for casual use, 'browsing', or entertainment.  3. The authors keep comparing apples to oranges. They do not usually take into account that some sites might have done better due to the type of content rather than the architecture or design.  4. There is no credence given to learned behavior (which, admittedly, Nielsen also gives short shrift).  5. It's just a TAD obvious. For example, "The better users could predict where a link would lead, the more successful they were in finding information." Well, uh, duh.  6. I don't agree with the model of testing. Users were given 4 questions they were to answer on each of 10 existing sites. Hypotheses were created from the results. However, none of the sites were amended to specifically address these hypotheses (unless, through some coincidence, the sites were updated during the process, and even then there was little before/after comparison).  7. The authors keep stressing throughout the entire book that web site usability differs from software usability. However, not once did they step back and think "maybe web site usability TESTING differs from software usability testing." While Jared Spool is a great speaker (having seen him in person, I was very impressed with his humor and intelligence), this book leaves a lot to be desired.
