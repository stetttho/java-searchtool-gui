 I am an artist and web designer, and use fashion magazines as fodder for both.  The edgier ones are much more inspiring, but they're also harder to find and much more expensive.  Vogue is a cheap magazine with tons of photography and ads (which, lets face it, are far more cutting edge than the editorial shots). It's not Nest or Surface or Dazed & Confused, but it is thick and it's just [$] an issue.
