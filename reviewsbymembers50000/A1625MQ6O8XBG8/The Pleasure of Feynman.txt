 This book is a great introduction to Feynman, though I would still have to recommend "Surely You're Joking..." for the novice.  That book was not technical at all, and exposed Feynman's joy in both learning and being a prankster.  The Pleasure of Finding Things Out is (slightly) more technical in places, but hardly difficult.  It is also much more well-rounded, allowing greater insight into Feynman, who was:  1. Smart as hell  2. Arrogant  3. Happy only when learning  4. Quite a storyteller (in every sense of the word)  5. Thoroughly unconventional The piece by Freeman Dyson was worth the price of admission, and led me to investigate his works (also highly recommended). I also think the very underrated Challenger Inquiry report was extremely interesting. Keep in mind, though, that many people I've spoken with really dislike Feynman's arrogance (one person said "he's just a jerk").  I personally feel he had every right to be vain, but over the course of four books, it does get tiring.
