 I will only be repeating what other reviewers have said, but if I could have just one book on my desk, this would be it.  I'm notorious for purchasing a new book each week on every aspect of information design and web development, but few catch my attention for longer than a week (yes, it's a vicious circle).  It is rare that I'll reference one after my initial read. However, Web Design in a Nutshell has not left my side in the 18 months I've owned it.  It was my introduction to CSS & layers, is a wonderful Javascript and HTML tag resource, and has just enough about Unix & CGI scripts to get me through. Let me put it this way: I refuse to lend this book out to people anymore, because I always end up reaching for it.  I'm thinking of purchasing a second copy exclusively for lending out.
