 Oh my god, what have they done?!?!?  They've messed with the great Underdog and ditched the very things that made the cartoon great.  No cliffhangers, no opening/ending credits, no Go Go Gophers!?!? What were they thinking? To top it all off, they try to pass it off as a good thing.  The Golden Books website says: "For the first time ever, Underdog segments have been seamlessly edited together into full-length episodes."  This is DVD, folks; you CAN have your cake and eat it too.  Get with it. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!  We have to let Golden Books know how disgusted we are with this pathetic attempt.  This DVD is a travesty; an insult to the memory of Jay Ward and Underdog. Will there ever be an Underdog like the one we used to know? To quote Sweet Polly Purebred: "Where oh where has my Underdog gone?"
