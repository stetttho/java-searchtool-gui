 When I'm working and need to grab a book to take into the bathroom, it has typically been something light and definitely not work-related.  The Stranger, maybe, or a Bathroom Reader.  However, ever since I bought "Usability for the Web", it's been my bathroom book.  I've already read it cover to cover, but opening it to a random page and reading for 10-15 minutes (or, what the heck, even 45 minutes) always gets me thinking of ways to improve what I'm working on.  As other reviews have stated, there is nothing groundbreaking about this book.  However, this is the ONLY book you will need on web usability.  In fact, this book effectively replaced my books on usability, design, and architecture.  All of which I read, and mostly enjoyed, but few of which I will ever pick up again. The design of the book is also very nice, easy to read and with full color throughout. Finally, responding to one critique, the authors DO reference outside sources throughout the book.  There is also a section at the back which includes additional references.
