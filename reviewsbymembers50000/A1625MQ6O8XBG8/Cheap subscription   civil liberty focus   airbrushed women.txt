 I've read Playboy (yes, READ) for years, and always enjoy it.  It's better reading than Maxim, FHM, and all those other "men's" magazines.  The interviews, the focus on civil liberties, the short fiction...  It's all good.  That said, it's VERY difficult to read this magazine.  Not because of the writing, but because of the pictures...  Where am I supposed to read it?  Not in the house with my 6-year-old daughter around; not on the bus; not (ahem) at work.  And it certainly looks bad carrying it into the bathroom.  :) Another negative...  Maxim, FHM, and Gear (in particular) have much sexier pictures.  Why is that? Overall, though, you cannot beat the price of this subscription for what you get. And to all those people who say "what kind of man reads Playboy," I'll tell you: A man interested in the individual rights guaranteed by the Bill of Rights; one who knows the difference between an airbrushed photo and the real thing; and one who proudly calls himself a feminist in a time when most women WON'T call themselves feminists.
