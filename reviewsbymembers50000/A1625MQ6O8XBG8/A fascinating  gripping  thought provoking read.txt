 I read this book two years ago, and still cannot get it out of my head.  While it is bleak, it is also inspirational.  I had given up on the idea of a modern 'novel of ideas' until reading this novel, which was somewhat cynically marketed as a thriller.  It IS a thriller, but in a deeper, more resonant way than a Stephen King or Tom Clancy. You know those movies that promise you a glimpse behind the facade, a chance at seeing things you haven't before?  Then, of course, the movie turns out to be a cheesy full-length chase scene?  This was almost the opposite.  A philosophical treatise in pulp form.
