 I would have given this 4 stars but there are only 36:14 minutes of music on this CD, and that's a rip-off. (And the music industry wonders why people download from the Internet rather than pay for the CD.) Okay, after the rant, I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed the songs. Bolton has a great voice for these classics.
