 This program freezes my Win98 system. Trying to get tech help is another waste of time and money. Since it freezes my system, I can't get through to their website for help. Try calling the 972 area code phone number printed in the manual, and you get a message that their phone number has changed. Call the new number and have to listen to a long message directing you to the website, then you are given a 900 number to call, and told it will cost you $2.95 per minute for help. Called that number and you get a recording that the call can't be completed as dialled. I have removed it and am now ordering Norton. McAfee should be ashamed.
