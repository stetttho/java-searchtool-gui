 Like most people, I formed an opinion based on media reports about this tragedy. An A&E Investigative Reports documentary pointing out inconsistencies in media reports made me re-think my assumption about the  Ramseys' guilt. I am now convinced that they did not do it. To add to the  tragedy of losing a daughter so horribly, they have been vilified by the  public. Read this book and you will have to re-examine your own  assumptions. This is NOT an OJ book - in that case, the evidence pointed to  his guilt. In this case, the evidence points to the Ramseys' innocence.
