 I installed this and it works flawlessly. I had previously purchased McAfee's anti-virus software and it froze my system (see the one-star review I wrote for that one). I originally installed this on my Win98 platform with no problems, and continue to have no problems now that I have upgraded my system to XP. This has saved me from having several damaging viruses downloaded.
