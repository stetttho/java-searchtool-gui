 A fascinating book..... I found it hard to put down. Reads like a mystery. The flu epidemic of 1918 was truly the "forgotten" epidemic, and anyone with an interest in history or medicine will enjoy this book. The  ending was a bit of a let-down, but this is a factual book, not fiction,  and we have to understand that we don't have all the answers yet.
