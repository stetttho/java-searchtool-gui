 I originally bought this book for a Vietnamese friend whose English is not very good. She wanted to teach her 11-year old daughter how to cook "American" food, but wasn't familiar with it. This book is perfect for both of them. For example, the ingredients are shown with a picture of the food item as well as quantity. So if the recipe calls for zucchini, there is a picture of zucchini - this allows my friend to do the grocery shopping (she knows zucchini in Vietnamese but not in English). It also includes an illustrated glossary at the back to help with terms such as "simmer."  I was so impressed with this book that I ordered one for myself, as well as Angela Wilkes' Children's Quick And Easy Cookbook for when my grandkids are old enough to use it! (Okay, the truth - I want to make some of the recipes now!)
