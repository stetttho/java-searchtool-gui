 I was 10 years old in 1962, and remember being terrified whenever a plane flew overhead, because I thought it might be a Soviet bomber ready to start WWIII. For years I never knew what caused this terror. Everything clicked when I watched this movie: the tense days during the stand-off, the newspaper headlines and Walter Cronkite on TV, the safety drills at school. This is a gripping movie, well-acted, with some terrific cinematograpy. You'll forget that you know how it's going to end. The Infinifilm features are a real bonus - what DVD should be.
