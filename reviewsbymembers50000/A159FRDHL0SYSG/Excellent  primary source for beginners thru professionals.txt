 Six stars! This is an outstanding resource for anyone who is interested in getting the best results from their digital darkroom using Photoshop and a good photo printer. This book is full of practical, not just theoretical, information - tips and advice you can put to work immediately. Grey writes in an easy to understand, straightforward manner. There are loads of full color illustrations and graphics. The book covers Foundations, Photoshop Set-Up (with good tips on getting the best configuration), Display (with recomendations on which monitors to choose, calibrating your monitor, etc.), Scanning, Digital Capture (with recommendations about digital cameras, managing digital camera color, etc), Optimization (including excellent advice and tips on making color adjustments), Output (this chapter alone is worth the price of the book), and Workflow. This book will save you time and money, and increase your satisfaction with your digital images (whether you start with film or a digital capture). I am a "confident amateur" photographer and found this book to be chock-full of information, and I have already started to use what I'm learning from it with excellent results.
