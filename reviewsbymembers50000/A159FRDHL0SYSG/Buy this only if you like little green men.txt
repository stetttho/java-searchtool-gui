 This set has a serious problem with color. It is impossible to get normal skintones, etc. on broadcast programming, and when I play a DVD, everything has a greenish cast. Plus, I went through 3 new VCRs before I finally figured out it was the TV! Either there is static in the audio when playing a tape, or wavy lines at the bottom (this was with 2 top-of-the-line new Panasonic VCRs, so you'd think they would be compatible). I am sending mine back. Update: I have now purchased a Sony XBR 32 inch flat screen HDTV and I LOVE it! Color is crisp and authentic and all home theater equipment works exceptionally well.
