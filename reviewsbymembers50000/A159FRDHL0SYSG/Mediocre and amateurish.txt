 This is the first and last Iris Johansen I'll read. I was expecting better. The plot is just silly and the dialogue is amateurish. This book reads as if it were written by an untalented high schooler for English class. Save your money, and read something by Janet Evanovich, Dorothy Gilman, Lee Child, Nelson Demille, or Dick Francis instead.
