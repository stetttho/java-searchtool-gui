 I am not a history buff, but I found this to be fascinating. I have a much deeper appreciation of what it took to build the railroads, and also where terms such as "the wrong side of the tracks," "a Chinaman's chance..." etc came from. I bought the unabridged audio version and listened while I commuted to and from work... I was sorry when it ended  will listen to it again. This is a must for any train fan or history buff.
