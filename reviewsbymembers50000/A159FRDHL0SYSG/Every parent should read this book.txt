 I got this book 15 years ago on the advice of a pediatrician, and used its principles. IT WORKS! The relationship that I have with my son, who is now 21, is proof of that. Even during his difficult teenage years, we were able to communicate in a positive way. I am so convinced of this book's effectiveness that I always give it as a gift to new parents. P.S. the concepts work in your other relationships also!
