 I love the features of this VCR, especialy the automatic commercial advance. The VCR marks the beginning and end of commercials and then automatically fast forwards through them on playback. A time-shifter's dream! I previously reviewed this as 3 stars because it was incompatible with my new Panasonic HDTV set. I found out that the TV was the problem, not the VCR. Now that I have hooked it up to my Sony XBR HDTV, I am very pleased with my purchase.
