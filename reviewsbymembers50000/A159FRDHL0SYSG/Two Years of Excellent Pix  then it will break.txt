 I have bought two of these. The first lasted exactly two years, then stopped working. I bought another one, because the pictures it takes under almost all circumstances are fantastic. It worked for exactly two years, then ....broke! Must be planned obsolescence. Anyway, I am now shopping for a Minolta or Olympus, which hopefully will last longer. I would have given this product 5 stars for picture quality, but have deducted two because of its lack of durability.
