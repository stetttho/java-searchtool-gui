 ...  I must ...  say that it contains some great music and brilliant playing (heavy on the funk side!!!). There is no track listing available, so here it is: 1.Better Half performed by Funk Inc. - 6:35 2.Got Myself a Good Man performed by Pucho - 5:42 3.Houston Express performed by Person, Houston - 5:51 4.Grits and Gravy performed by Kloss, Eric - 2:36 5.Hoochie Coo Chickie performed by Jones, Ivan - 5:22 6.Lady Mama performed by Ammons, Gene - 6:45 7.Hip Shaker performed by Spencer, Leon - 2:58 8.Psychedelic Sally performed by Jefferson, Eddie - 2:48 9.Soul Dance performed by Person, Houston - 4:11 10.Sure 'Nuff, Sure 'Nuff performed by Phillips, Sonny - 6:46 11.Sing a Simple Song performed by Earland, Charles - 5:42 As you can see, some of the stuff has not be rereleased on CD (take the Charles Earland tune for example). Otherwise it represents a nice cross section of late 60's/early 70's soul-jazz. My personal fav is the Pucho track, it sounds heavier than anything released this decade! You will find this overlaps with some of the 'Legends of Acid Jazz' series put out by Prestige, but I think this 3 volume set was here before those, so we can't blame BGP for it.
