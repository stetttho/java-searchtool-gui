 As my title says: mediocre. This album is just that, nothing new or extra pleasing here. This is a 2fer1 combining 'The Sweet Life' and 'The Cisco Kid' originaly released on the Groove Merchant label. The standout track is 'Inner City Blues' which you can find elsewhere, on a number of compilations, for example (Pulp Fusion comes to mind on Harmless records). There is a nice cover of 'Superfly', and the tune 'Cisco Kid' isn't bad at all either. But the rest is pretty forgettable. Try to seek out his 'Blue Break Beats' CD - it is much more adventurous and exciting - and pass this one on.
