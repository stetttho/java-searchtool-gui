 Good but lacks a little something. A little something called grit. It's there in 4-5 of the tracks, but the rest don't cut it. Best tracks are 'Butterfinger', 'Attica', 'Changes' and 'Purdie Good'. Some cool electric piano playing on these, and there are about 2 more tunes that you can like, the rest are cheesy fillers. Get Rusty Bryant's or Johnny Hammond's 'Legends...', they're much more satisfying, and come back for this later.
