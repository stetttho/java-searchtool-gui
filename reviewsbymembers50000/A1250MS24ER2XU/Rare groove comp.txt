 Probably everyone knows this: this is a rare groove comp put together from the vaults of the legendary Groove Merchant store. There is quite a variety of different selections on this CD. There is some warm bossa by the The Cals, music originally intended for jazz dance classes (Johnny Frigo's cover of 'Scorpio' where the heavy guitars in the original are replaced by a cool hammond on this version), a tune from a jazz play-along record (David Baker), the monster funky 'Akiwawa', Eugene Blacknell's heavy 'Gettin' Down', sweet soul-jazz from Cal Green with Charles Kynard behind the organ... and the list goes on. There is only one vocal track, and it's only OK (done by the West Coast Revival) and the track I like the least is 'Speak No Evil'. Both of the CD only tracks burn, especially the album closer 'Smokey Feeling' with its bouncing bass line and choppy drums. In case you find the samples they have up insufficient to make a decision whether this CD is worth your money (it is) you can get sound clips from all the songs in mp3 format on the ubiquity records website. My one and only problem: this is TOO SHORT! ~45min.
