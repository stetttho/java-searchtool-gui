 What? I thought this would rule! But unfortunatley, it doesn't. It's a poor CD, with some poor material recorded on it. Why? Because it's MELLOW. If you're loooking for hot, firey soul jazz, look elsewhere, check out Melvin Sparks' Legends of Acid Jazz CD, or Rusty Bryant's, but please, do not start with this one. I agree, 'The Son of Man', 'The Houston Express' and 'Give More Power To The People (For God's Sake)' rule, no two ways about that. But the rest? FILLERS! Seriously, there are better purchases to spend your money on.
