 This CD is a collection of all the Gaturs 45s and this is the first time there is a full length album released under their name. It is the great Willie Tee that sits behind the keys and he also takes over the vocal chores for a few cuts. The reason I gave this CD only 4 stars is not because of the GENERAL quality of the tunes. The 15 tracks can be clearly divided into two groups, the groovy give it all funk tracks and the much less successful ballad type songs. Of the 15 tracks presented here  (1. Booger man 2. Cold bear 3. Gatur bait 4. Nobody can be you 5. Hunk of funk 6. Funky funky twist 7. Wasted 8. Yeah, you're right 9. Concrete 10. Get up CD Bonus: 11. First taste of hurt 12. One thrill fool 13. Man that I am 14. I'm gonna make you love me 15. Sweet thing)  7-8 of them are keepers and the rest are throwaways. Which is a shame if you just paid 30US to get them. Highlights: 1-3, 5-7, 15. Everyone knows 'Gatur bait' and you can expect the same high quality from the other good songs. The music is fairly typical of New Orleans, organ/electric piano, funky bass and drums accompanied by funky guitars and a horn section. Somewhat in the vein of The Meters and African Music Machine. This album is recommended, but not an essential purchase. PS: Unfortunately they don't have a picture of the album cover up, but it's great! It is taken from a live appearance of the band.
