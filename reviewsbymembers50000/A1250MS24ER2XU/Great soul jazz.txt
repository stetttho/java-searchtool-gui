 I have to disagree with the reviewer reviewing before me: this music is great! Another best in the series (Melvin Sparks' Legends album being the other, and I guess Johnny Hammond's is just as good, not to mention Boogaloo Joe's, and let's not forget about Funk Inc's first two albums!). What, you never heard 11 minute soul-jazz vamps before? You're in for treat my friend! This is fun stuff. Check out 'Soul Liberation' or 'Home Fries' or even 'Lou-Lou'. Goodness gracious, groovin'! Other crew members that excel on this recording: Charles Earland, Idris Muhammad, Boogaloo Joe plus the other usual inhouse Prestige musicians. Rusty really is soulful on these recordings, worth the money.
