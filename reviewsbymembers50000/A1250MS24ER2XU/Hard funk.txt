 For those of us who like it hard and nasty this is a great treat. Whatever the editorial says, this is her second album, and just as great as her debut.  It includes Larry Graham on bass, Mike Clark on drums and several other fine musicians. Betty's vocals tend to get a bit tiring at times but I'd still say there is not a single bad track here. My personal fav is 'Get in there' and usually include it on all my mix tapes. The music has a real rock edge to it with wah-wah/distorted guitars, lots of funky clavinet, hard drums and driving bass. If you dig the Graham Central Station sound (The Jam, Water, Hair) you shouldn't be disappointed. Her debut is just as good as this here, and also seek out her third album 'Nasty Gal' if you can, it's worth it.
