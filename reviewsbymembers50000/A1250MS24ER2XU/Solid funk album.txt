 This is a little known band from Canada in the early '70s. They were on the same label with Kool and the Gang, and in fact they cover 'Who's Gonna Take The Weight' on this album. Otherwise this CD is pretty much in the vein of the Kool and the Gang recordings of the same era (Live at the Sex Machine, Live at PJs), with a somewhat shabbier musicianship. Don't let this scare you away though, they still rock hard, with some great grooves and some b3 lurking in the background on nearly every song. Highlights: 'Funky Granny', 'Funky Gene-ra-tion' and the instrumental 'Mama Said-Papa Said (Too Young To Marry)'.
