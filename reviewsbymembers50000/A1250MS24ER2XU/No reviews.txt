 It's hard to believe no one has reviewed this title yet as it is one of the best of the series. Perhaps that's why, most people just know that it is. The cover of 'Thank You...' is just great, so is the Kool and The Gang cover of 'Who's Gonna Take...'. Organist Leon Spencer is in a great form, just like drummer Idris Muhammad, trumpter Virgil Jones and the rest of this funky crew. There are only two mellow tunes: 'I Didn't Know What Time It Was' and 'Alone Together'. 'Dig Dis' is an exploratory little song, it's more jazzy than the rest of the CD. The remaining 60min is just straight ahead soul-jazz in the best imaginable way!
