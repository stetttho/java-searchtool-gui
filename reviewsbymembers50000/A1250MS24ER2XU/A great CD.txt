 I LOVE this CD! If you liked their record 'It's What's Up Front That - Counts' then the chances are you'd like this one as well. If you haven't heard it yet, start with that, and come back for this. Sure 'nuff, the Aware albums ('Lovesign' and 'Funk Pump') on which this CD is based on aren't as steady cool as their Westbound material, but due to the high volume of songs you can still find 50 minutes of music worth owning on this CD. The CD kicks off with 'Medley', a 10 minute funkrock freakout. Great! In the next two songs you're treated to two mediocre lovejams but then there you are, listening to 'Flies Over A Watermelon' which is great again. And this is pretty much the general pattern: skip, 2 or 3 great tracks, skip again, some more of the wonderful stuff, etc. You get the picture. The b3 player got an amazing style, he really burns on that thang! The rythm section lays down hard, driving beats like on 'What's Up Front That...', and their sound is the same as well. There is also a previously unissued track called 'Chicken Pox' which is rather funny, but not a great great song. Also included on the CD is 'The Munchies' which on the contrary is funny AND jammin'. Other songs to kill for are 'Magic Ride', 'Short Cut' and 'Riding High'. A niceone.
