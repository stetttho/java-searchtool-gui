 An early recording by the Fatback Band that originally appeared on the Perception Label. Why the album 'Let's Do It Again' claims itself to be a Bestof from the Perception years remains a mystery to me, since there are no tracks on it from either this or their other Perception album 'Feel My Soul'. This is a nice little soul infected CD from the time when soul was about to become funk. The main emphasis is on the horns, there are some keys to give a fuller sound. The drumming is a bit more varied than on the later Fatback recordings, and this I enjoy a lot. There are also some sweet soul tunes, like 'Gotta Have You (Day By Day)' and the seven minute 'Baby Doll'. The whole session is a party though and it's worth joining in. Funky highlights are 'Kiba', 'Nija Walk (Street Walk)' and 'Clap Your Hands'. Not an essential album, but if you have the chance get it.
