 Sugarman is back! He's got some goods in his bag. This is an amazingly funky release from Desco. This is the band's second outing, the first one was titled Sugar's Boogaloo, and I thought it was wicked as well. But this blows that away with way heavier jams. The tunes are still short (2:30-4:00), but damn, they're sweet! To those who are not familiar with the Sugarman 3 linup: sax/flute, hammond, guitar, drums. No slow songs, just heavy, heavy funk jams of the best kind. Nothing like the smooth new funk heroes (JTQ, Brand New Heavies, and yes, sometimes even the Greyboy Allstars), these guys are for real, they kid around not. All the songs are filled with cute little breaks, with one tasty lick following the other. The sound could be compared to what Lou Donaldson was sporting in the late '60s. Way cool, give it a listen.
