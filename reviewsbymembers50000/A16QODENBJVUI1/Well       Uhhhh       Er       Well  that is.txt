 I have a friend who runs a used record store.  From time to time, he would put the Shaggs on for his unsuspecting customers to hear.  After a few seconds, the music would arrest their attention.  Jaws would drop,  breathing would cease, the area around their chest would tighten, their  credulity would be tested, a vision of the abyss of eternity would open out  before them.   "Unique" is an overworked word.  Nevertheless,  this is without any possible question the most unique and unusual album in  the history of music.  Suggestion for an experiment:  buy it, put it on to  play at a party without warning your friends, watch their reactions.  Then  ask yourself, could anyother album in the history of music (music, not just  rock) have produced that effect?  I think not.
