 This contains the best of Chandler, if not all of it is the best of Chandler.  "Red Wind" is one of the most brilliant short stories not just in detective literature but in American Literature.  The last few paragraphs are unspeakably precious, and give more insight into Marlowe's character than any of the novels.  And the rest of the stories are fine too!
