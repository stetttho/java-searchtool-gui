 If you don't know Thin White Rope, this is a great sample of what they are all about.  Whether you will love or merely like them will depend on your reaction to the singer's voice (just like some people are bugged by Bob  Dylan's voice or Neil Young's or Tom Waits's).  An ex-girlfriend told me  that she loved the songs, but hated his voice. The TROUSER PRESS GUIDE  once said that if THE TWILIGHT ZONE had a house band, TWR would be it.  And  this is really strange music, but anyone who loves bands like Yo La Tenga,  Eleventh Dream Day, the Wipers, Television, and Galaxie 500 will definitely  go for this stuff.
