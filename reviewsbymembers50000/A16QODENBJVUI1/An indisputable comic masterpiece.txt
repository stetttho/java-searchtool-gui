 I have an official list of "The Three Funniest Novels That I Have Ever Read."  The three books are, in no particular order, Stanislaw Lem's THE FUTUROLOGICAL CONGRESS, Joseph Heller's CATCH-22, and John  Barth's THE SOTWEED FACTOR.  There were times in the latter, especially  near the end, where I had to pause repeatedly in my reading to laugh out  loud. But this book has much more to offer than just humor.  Barth, who  in his novels clearly reveals himself to be a student of the genre, strives  to write an 18th century novel in the 20th century, and succeeds  magnificently.  I believe that this novel couldn't help but delight any  serious reader whose possesses even the slightest sense of humor.
