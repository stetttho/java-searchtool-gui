 Make no mistake about it:  this book is less a history of everyday life in the United States in the Gilded Age than it is an encyclopedia of an astonishing range of facts about life in that period arranged around a  series of very general themes.  In a lesser book, this could be accounted a  flaw, but in Schlereth's case it is a virtue because of the quality and  pertinence of the particular bits of information that Schlereth pulls  together.  I felt I came away from the book not merely with a deeper  knowledge of what life was like in America around the beginning of the 20th  century, but a deeper appreciation for and sense of what life was like at  the time.  This was especially brought home to me upon reading SISTER  CARRIE by Theodore Dreiser shortly upon finishing Schlereth's book.  On  almost every page I remembered something from his book that illumined in  some way or other the events in that novel (which was published in 1900,  but set in around 1890). What I most appreciate about the book is the  sense that it was during this period that a way of life that most people  living today would recognize and feel at home with developed.  Most of the  conveniences that we take for granted--grocery and department stores,  electricity, the telephone, our particular forms of housing, indoor  plumbing, and a host of other services and products, all became prevalent  during the period covered in this book.  I urge anyone with an interest in  the deep background of life in this century a century ago to look closely  at this volume
