 I have mixed feelings about Heinlein.  I have been disturbed by some things I have heard about his politics, and he wrote what I considered to be one of the most overrated books that I have read:  STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND.  But on the other hand, I have read some other books that while I didn't consider them to be masterpieces, were definitely a lot of fun, such as CITIZEN OF THE GALAXY, THE GLORY ROAD, and STARSHIP TROOPERS.     But this is a great book.  Superb plot, fine characters, a unique situation, lots of action, and one of the best computers in sci-fi.  I may be iffy on Heinlein as a whole, but not on this one.
