 During the summer of 1997, I began reading extensively on the history of astrology.  This is a challenging undertaking because there are virtually no historically sophisticated treatments of the subject.  I turned to this one for help, and was sorely disappointed.  Although I am as sceptical about astrology as the author, this one is marred by the author's desire to debunk astrology rather than recount its history.  This is a problem with most books published by Prometheus Books.  But even the purely historical sections are not especially strong.   If a person is interested in learning more about astrology, I can strongly recommend Jim Tester's A HISTORY OF WESTERN ASTROLOGY, which is the premiere history of astrology in English.  Also first-rate is the section on astrology in Keith Thomas's extraordinary RELIGION AND THE DECLINE OF MAGIC, recently reprinted in a beautiful edition by Oxford University Press.  Thomas's discussion is restricted to 16th and 17th century England, but what is there is superb.  One other excellent book is Tillyard's THE ELIZABETHAN WORLD PICTURE, which deals not so much with astrology as with the entire intellectual apparatus of which astrology was an integral part.
