 Whether one otherwise adores or detests C. S. Lewis, this is a book every reader can love.  Arguing that the focus in reading should not be on whether a book is a great work or not, he insists what is important is whether a book is susceptible to great reading.  The result is that otherwise flawed and perhaps imperfect books (e.g., Toltoy's "Master and Man," with the previously unhinted conversion of the master at the end) can be read well, while others cannot.  Lewis was one of my earliest influences, and while I have over the years come to hold his religious works in lower and lower regard (I prefer Kierkegaard's passionate uncertainty to Lewis's smug confidence)I have come back to this one again and again for insight and stimulation.  Along with STUDIES IN WORDS and the Narnia books, this book is Lewis's masterpiece.
