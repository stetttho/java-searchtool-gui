 I give this book a mildly enthusiastic 5 stars.  My passion for the book is somewhat diminished in that his history is rather insular:  one learns a great deals about the thought of some of the central figures in the history  of astrology, but almost nothing about the historical or social setting of  that discipline.  For instance, a general knowledge of Greek science is  utterly essential in understanding the manner in which astology first  developed in the West.  Tester seems to assume a mastery of this  background.   Despite this, Tester discusses all the key figures in the  history of Western astrology from the Hellenistic period through the  Renaissance, and does so with depth and subtlety. It should be added that  this is a very scholarly treatment of the subject.  Anyone seeking a  popular history of the subject or anyone who actually believes in the  validity of astrology is likely not to find this volume to their liking.   But those who enjoy the works of authors like Frances Yates and Keith  Thomas, this volume will prove to be of great interest.
