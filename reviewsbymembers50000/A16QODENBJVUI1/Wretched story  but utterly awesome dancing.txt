 Of all the Astaire/Rogers films, this one features one of the very worst stories.  On the other hand, it features some of their greatest dancing.  "Let's Face the Music and Dance" is a movie unto itself, one of  the two or three greatest numbers they ever did together.  "I'm  Putting All My Eggs in One Basket" lets Fred show off his considerable  ability as a pianist (he was also an excellent drummer, as he showed in  DADDY LONG LEGS).  And the numerous other numbers help the viewer survive  the rather lame moments in which the movie trys to tell a story.  (For the  record, I love the stories of several other Astaire/Rogers films, including  THE GAY DIVORCEE and TOP HAT.)   So, if you love great dancing and songs,  by all means see this.  Just don't expect a good story.
