 OK, being as objective as possible, I know that PRESENT TENSE/TONGUE TWISTER is the better album/albums, but this one is very, very nearly as good.  Overall, the songs on the earlier albums were a tiny big stronger, a bit fresher, and a little more energetic.  That being said, my favorite Shoes song, "Torn in Two," with some of the coolest harmonies on record, is on this one.  And that alone gives this album a special place in my heart. Again, being as objective as possible, I know that there are better bands than the Shoes.  But over the years, I have to admit that I have probably listened to the three albums mentioned here as much as any others that I own.  And that ought to tell you something.  Music that you enjoy having as part of the texture of your life.
