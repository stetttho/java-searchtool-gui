 I find it exasperating that so few of Ernst Lubitsch's films are currently available in either video or DVD.  By any reckoning, he is one of the few absolute masters of the cinema (he even makes Andrew Sarris's list of  Pantheon directors).  A few of his best films (this one, HEAVEN CAN WAIT,  NINOTCHKA) are in print, but several others are not, while lesser films  like ANGEL, BLUEBEARD'S EIGHTH WIFE, and THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER are.   (A very fine film that Lubitsch began but was finished by Frank Borzage  because of Lubitsch's illness is also available, DESIRE, with Marlene  Dietrich.)  I have no complaint that these movies are available, but when  superior films such as ONE HOUR WITH YOU, THE LOVE PARADE, and, my own  personal favorite, TROUBLE IN PARADISE, are not, then something has gone  wrong.   I would also like to see MONTE CARLO, DESIGN FOR LIVING, and LADY  WINDEMERE'S FAN rereleased.   Ernst Lubitsch was the unrivaled master of  the film comedy, no less than Hitchcock was master of the suspense  thriller.  Both managed to transcend their own chosen genres to make  numerous screen classics.  We deserve access to all of his films.
