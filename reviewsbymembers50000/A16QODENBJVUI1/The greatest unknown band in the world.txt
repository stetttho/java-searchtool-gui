 Robert Christgau in the early nineties wrote an aritcle in which he claimed that the Mekons were the greatest band in the world.  Not greatest unknown band, just the best.  I wouldn't go quite that far, but having seen  them around 10 times (I live in their unofficial second hometown, Chicago,  where leader Jon Langford now resides--Leeds, England is their official  home) and owning nearly all their albums, I can attest that they are an  unjustly neglected treasure.  ORIGINAL SIN contains the entirety of their  classic album FEAR AND WHISKY, as well as a couple of other EPs.  It is  absolutely essential for any serious rock and roll collection (though that  is redundant, since if you have a serious rock and roll collection, you  already own this album). I must add that one of the great tragedies in  music at the moment is that their greatest album, ROCK 'N' ROLL is  available only as a hard-to-find German import.  If my memory serves me  correctly, Christgau named this his album of the year when it came out.   And this time he was correct.
