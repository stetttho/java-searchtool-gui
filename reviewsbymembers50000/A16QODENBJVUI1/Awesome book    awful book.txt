 Three stars doesn't quite sum up how I feel about this book.  I do consider it essential reading for anyone interested in Sci-fi or Cyberpunk, but that doesn't undo the fact that there are some utterly absurd elements  that undercut the aesthetic value of the book. First, the good.  I have  never read some a convincing picture of the future as world-gone-bad.   Though Stephenson doesn't spend any time really explaining how society got  the way it has, the way it has become is quite powerfully presented.  His  understanding of the way in which the Internet might develop reflects a  sense of vision and insight that would have done Jules Verne proud.  On so  many things--future weapons, potential subcultural groups, lingo and slang,  technology--Stephenson hits precisely the right note.  On top of all this,  he has a wonderful assemblage of characters.  For all of this, Stephenson  unquestionably deserves 5 stars. But SNOW CRASH also is one more example  of how things go wrong in sci-fi when there is any attempt to deal with  religion.  There have been, of course, many fine sci-fi novels in which  religion has served as an element.  The great classic A CANTICLE FOR  LEIBOWITZ springs to mind.  But when sci-fi attempts explain religious  phenomena or to bring it within the contenxt of imaginative analysis, it  invariably fails.  The extended and tedious discussions of Sumerian culture  and the highly speculative discussions of the history of religions were not  merely unconvincing and poorly founded on any of the historical record.   They were boring.  For this, SNOW CRASH deserves 1 star. So, I recommend  this book very highly.  But I do warn any potential reader that there are  several passages and chapters that mar an otherwise masterful work.
