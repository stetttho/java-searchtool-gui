 In case you are wondering, the novel it tied with is Dostoevsky's THE BROTHERS KARAMAZOV.     I have read this three times in three sittings.  In case that is not clear, I mean to say that I have sat down to read PRIDE AND PREJUDICE on three separate occasions, and did not get up until I had finished it.  I once stayed up all night long to finish it.   Actually, I read it a fourth time, aloud to my then 8-year-old daughter Elizabeth (who was delighted to find an Elizabeth in the book).  She liked it so much that she in turn read it twice.  Just one of the great, irrestible book in the English language.
