 One summer in college, I worked in a convenience store/gas station very much like the one that Dante worked in, so this movie brought back a flood of memories the first time I saw it.  I just this last week reviewed it for the first time since it came out, and I am delighted to be able to report that it was even funnier than I remembered it.   Now, this movie isn't for everyone.  I learned a long time ago that an awful lot of people don't like black and white films.  And a lot of folks don't like low budget films.  If either applies to you, just hold out for the next Hollywood blockbuster. For the rest of us, who love and appreciate Independent film, this is just a great flick.  There are a lot of really hysterical characters, funny incidents, and, most of all, awesome dialog.  In fact, the only thing that really happens in this film is people talk a lot.  Luckily, it is GREAT talk.   If you haven't seen this yet, do yourself a favor and do so.  If you have, but not recently, do yourself a favor and see it again.  I think you will be surprised how much you enjoy it.
