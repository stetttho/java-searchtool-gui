 When I taught a course on Animals and Ethics, I chose this volume over all others as my primary text.  While Peter Singer's ANIMAL LIBERATION first awoke my consciousness to the tragedy of the manner in which humans have regarded and treated animals, I found the philosophical underpinnings of his work (a form of utilitarianism) troublesome (for reasons I won't go into here).  On the other hand, I found Tom Regan's THE CASE FOR ANIMAL RIGHTS, to be far too Kantian.  Midgley discusses a wide-ranging group of philosophers, but doesn't overly attach herself to any particular moral philosophy.  As a result, she is less doctrinaire than any of the other major writers on the topic.  The book reeks of common sense, in the way that the English so often seem to have mastered.  Just a wonderful, unjustly neglected book.
