 What a super book!  There are multiple levels to this book, and one can love all or only a few of them.  On one level, the book is an analysis of the career of John Wayne the movie star (as opposed to John Wayne the private individual, though the two cannot be completely separated).  So you can enjoy learning about Wayne's days at Columbia pictures, or his relationship with Yakima Canutt, or the formative influence of Harry Carey, or Wayne's film with and connection to John Ford and Howard Hawks.  On another level, the book contains brilliant discussions on a number of the important films in Wayne's career, like STAGECOACH or my favorite Wayne and John Ford film THE SEARCHERS.  On another level, the book contains marvelous socio-political analysis of the function the concept of John Wayne plays in American life.  And on yet another level the book is an essay within cultural studies.  One has to admire the many areas and subjects that Wills handles with ease.   My favorite parts of the book were those that dealt with the mythmaking that went into the creation of "John Wayne," the symbol of everything  best about America and those dealing with his films and relationship with John Ford.  Although extreme fans of Wayne may be somewhat offended by some parts of the book (e.g., Wayne's stringent avoidance of military service in WW II and the misinformation about his early life, such as his being a potential football star felled by an injury, when in fact he was dismissed from the USC football team for not being very good), I think everyone will come away from it having a better sense not only Wayne's shortcomings but his very real accomplishments.  A fine book in every way.
