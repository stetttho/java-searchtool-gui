 Let me start by saying that I try not to inflate my ratings like so many on amazon.com, so this is actually a very positive rating.   Crosby presents no original research here, but he does do a marvelous job of pulling together the work of others to bolster his argument that it was the shift in Europeans viewing reality in quanitificational concepts rather than qualitative ones that laid the intellectual groundwork for their global expansion.  Fortunately, in presenting the work of others Crosby has an eye equally attuned to the more entertaining moments in the shift to the age of quantification as to the more crucial.  He is also a highly entertaining writer.  The result is perhaps the easiest-to-read work of pre-modern history that I have encountered.  Not heavy duty stuff, but an extraordinarily pleasant way to spend a few hours.
