 At one point I either owned or had heard nearly every Firesign Theatre album, and while they were a highly erratic bunch of boys (many of their albums are simply awful), at their best they produced the greatest comedy  albums in the history of recording.  Of their three masterpieces, this is  probably my least favorite.  Even better are the currently out-of-print  DON'T CRUSH THAT DWARF, HAND ME THE PLIERS (with the extraordinary SCHOOL  DAYS sequence and multiple incarnations of George Tirebiter) and my own  personal favorite, EVERYTHING YOU KNOW IS WRONG! (in which we learn such  important truths as "Dogs came from outer space!", "Our  forefathers used drugs!", and, of course, "Everything you know is  wrong!").  These are cultural treasures that someone ought to reissue  as a service to humanity.
