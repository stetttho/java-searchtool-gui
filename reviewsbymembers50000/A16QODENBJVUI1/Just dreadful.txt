 A bad, bad movie. Part of the problem was that whoever was responsible for the final form of the script (whether writer, director, producer, or studio) couldn't decide whether this was going to be a drama with comic overtones or vice versa. But even if this is supposed to be a sad film, it is sad without any redeeming aspects. Just a bunch of sad, unlikeable people. David Schwimmer's character is unbearably pathetic, Barbara Hershey's character is unbearable (and I have to add that I have always liked Barbara Hershey, so seeing her in this role was especially painful), Carol Kane as the mother is sad, and Schwimmer's friends are all superficial.  I think the makers of the film were trying to emulate Albert Brooks, but with slight problem of not possessing his deft touch. A profoundly disappointing film. Though I must add that Gwyneth Paltrow was much better than the rest of the film.  I kept feeling bad for her that she was stuck in some a poorly conceived film.
