 This album has repeatedly turned up in the top ten of lists of the  greatest albums ever recorded, and deservedly so.  It can be listened to on  so many levels.  Sometimes I will listen to it while concentrating on the  lyrics.  Another time, I will focus on Van's phrasing.  Another time on  Richard Davis's inconceivably great bass playing (this is arguably the  greatest performance on bass on any album ever recorded for a rock  audience, even if the bass player was a jazz musician).  This is an album  that simply reeks of genius.  Simply put:  a masterpiece.
