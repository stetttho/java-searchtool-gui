 B. Traven is unquestionably one of the most fascinating writers of the  20th century.  For decades nothing was known about him except rumor, and  his exact identity was shrouded in confusion and mystery.  It was not even  known for certain what language he wrote in (it turned out to be German).   When John Huston was making the film version of Traven's THE TREASURE OF  THE SIERRA MADRE, Traven declined to visit the set, sending a friend  instead.  After Traven's death the first known photos of Traven were made  public, and Huston recognized Traven as the so-called friend, who was using  yet another of his many aliases (of which B. Traven was but one).  Anyone  interested in learning more about the man who was the most mysterious  author of the century should consult Wyatt's THE SECRET OF SIERRA MADRE:   THE MAN WHO WAS B. TRAVEN. THE TREASURE OF SIERRA MADRE is a classic, but  this novel may be even better.  A man without a passport, a crime in post  WW I Europe, is forced to take a job on an ancient steamer (the narrator  suggests it was old when the Greeks and Romans ruled the Mediterranean).   The result is a nightmarish descent into hell and one of the most  unforgetable masterpieces of the century.
