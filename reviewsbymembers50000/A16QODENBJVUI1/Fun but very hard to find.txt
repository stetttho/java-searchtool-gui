 I utterly loved seeing this film under its original title, Q PLANES.  This is one of the least shown films that Laurence Olivier ever starred in, though in fact he actually plays second fiddle to the always remarkable Ralph Richardson, who plays Maj. Charles Hammond.  Though Olivier is dashing as always, Richardson pretty much steals the picture, which is par for the course, since he was one of the great scene stealers in the history of cinema.  This role was also important for being one of the primary inspirations for John Steed on THE AVENGERS.  Steed adopted both Hammond's garb and mildly bemused demeanor, and one can easily envision Steed's closet resembling precisley Hammond's, consisting entirely of dark suits of the same precise hue, bowler hats, white shirts, and, of course, umbrellas.  The actual story is vastly less interesting and fun than watching Richardson and Olivier act it out.  Valerie Hobson is fun as Richardson's sister, and she manages to keep up with the two leads.  What is astonishing about the movie is the topic given the political situation at the time.  The film was made during the time immediately before the onset of WW II in 1939 when it was obvious that war was probably inevitable.  To make a somewhat lighthearted film based on espionage concerning high tech planes is surprising indeed.  The planes, by the way, hardly instill much confidence when viewed from the standpoint of the Spitfires that came out about the same time.  As mentioned, this is a hard film to find.  I managed to find a copy in the extensive film library of a university I attended, and enjoyed a private viewing.  Hopefully it will be made more widely available on DVD shortly.
