 It is almost impossible to overpraise this album.  Tremendous songs,  clever lyrics, and extraordinarily cool guitar battles between Richard  Lloyd and Tom Verlaine.  Not widely known, but everyone that I have known  who was in a band (a couple nationally and even internationally known) was  a fanatic devotee.  Their influence on subsequent bands has been vastly out  of proportion to the number of people who know their music.  The album also  contains one of the best songs ever written about bad love, "Venus de  Milo,"  in which the singer laments that he "fell into the arms  of Venus de Milo" (for those who skipped art history, the famous  statue Venus de Milo has no arms).
