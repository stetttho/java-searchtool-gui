 This is a rich and complex novel, with a plethora of outrageous characters and plot twists. Any serious reader will be enchanted by the superb prose and the rich characterization. However, as a longtime Cub fan, I have to point out that in the spring of 1981 Harry Caray was not the announcer for the Cubs: he was still with the White Sox. The Cubs were sold to the Trib and in the fall of 1981 Harry was hired as the voice of the Cubs. The rest is, as they say, history.
