 This is not among my few favorite novels, but no one who is sensitive to great literature can fail to see the brilliance of this work.  In doing a bit of background work, I made the following discoveries: Virtually every  French writer of the late 19th acknowledged Flaubert as their model.  In  England, Thomas Hardy essentially tried to write Flaubertian novels in an  English rural context.  Later in England, D. H. Lawrence explicitly wrote  novels that were polemical to Flaubert, so that he wrote in reaction  against MADAME BOVARY.  In Russia, Tolstoy decided to write his own version  of the story of Emma Bovary, ANNA KARENINA.  In the 20th century, James  Joyce--who was proud of how few writers he had studied--confessed that he  had read virtually every line of Flaubert and himself tried to carry to the  furthest extreme the Flaubertian dictum of art for arts sake.  And this is  merely the tip of the proverbial iceberg. Is this the most influential  novel ever written?  I honestly don't know, but if one wanted to construct  a case for that assertion, a very, very powerful one could be made.
