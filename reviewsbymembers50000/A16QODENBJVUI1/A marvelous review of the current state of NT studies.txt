 As a former Biblical studies student (M. Div. from Yale Divinity School) turned philosopher, I read this book with the greatest of interest.  The primary reason I forsook my OT and NT studies was a despair at how  irrelevant and superficial and sceptical the entire discipline had become.   Despite the constant hawking of new discoveries and new breakthroughs in  Biblical studies, I felt myself as both a human being and a Christian  completely alienated from the vast majority of scholars working on the  Biblical materials.  (I should add that I gave up Biblical studies before  arriving at Yale, but I do believe that Brevard Childs is an exception to  all of this.  Had I not already been burned out, I would have profitted  from having studied with him.) Timothy Luke Johnson does an absolutely  marvelous job of analyzing how and where things went wrong in NT studies.   Had he just set out to criticize the Jesus Seminar (and easy  undertaking--the vast majority of important NT scholars on both the left  and right of the theological spectrum look askance at their efforts), it  would have been an entertaining exercise in debunking.  But what I didn't  expect was a balanced and incisive analysis of where things went wrong in  Biblical scholarship.   I do recommend this book as an important  corrective to the misguided and rather silly efforts of Robert Funk and his  cohorts, but even more I recommend it as an analysis of where things went  wrong and as a guide to how we might get ourselves back on track.  After  having plowed through tedious and uninsightful works by Funk, Crossan, and  Pagels in recent months, I found this book to be a complete breath of fresh  air.
