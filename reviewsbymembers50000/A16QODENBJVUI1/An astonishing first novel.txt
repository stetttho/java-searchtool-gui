 Although not to be compared with his major works, this is nonetheless a most impressive first novel.  Perhaps because he was already well into his thirties when he wrote and published it, the book contains all the major  themes that one associates with Conrad.  If one has not read any Conrad at  all, I would recommend going to his great masterpieces first (VICTORY,  NOSTROMO, THE SECRET AGENT, UNDER WESTERN EYES, HEART OF DARKNESS, THE  NIGGER OF THE 'NARCISSUS', or LORD JIM).  But for anyone who enjoys the  work of Joseph Conrad, this book can hardly fail to fascinate.
