 I have very mixed reactions to the writing of Irvine Welsh.  On the one hand, his use of Scottish dialect is astonishing and delightful, and his humor is unsurpassed.  He is also remarkable for bringing to literary light  a section of modern society (Scottish disaffected youth) that has been  largely neglected.  On the other hand, while he obviously realizes that his  characters are pathetic in the extreme, he work doesn't seem to be informed  by any essentially superior point of view.  He tags these folks as pathetic  losers, but doesn't seem to have any clue as to what they should be doing  instead.  And perhaps that is the point.  The best illustration of the  vacuous nature of these people's lives comes from the narrator of the  longest (and best) piece in the book ("A Smart C*nt").  He is  obviously a person for whom the phrase "Get a Life" was coined,  and he does:  he is addicted to reading biographies.  He does get a life,  in fact, many lives via his reading.  He just doesn't have one of his  own. A fun collection.  Obviously, in a work like this some pieces are  better than others.  But it is definitely worth taking a shot at.  I have  been inspired to go on to read TRAINSPOTTING (which I now am, and which I  am loving also).
