 I'm almost tempted to state that Belle and Sebastian might be the masters of the EP.  Certainly no other band that I know has put so much of their best work on EPs.  This was their first EP and I find all four songs on the disc to be irresistible.    "Dog on Wheels" is one of my favorite songs by the band, but even so I like "The State I Am In" perhaps even more.  Few bands ever have written such wonderfully melodic songs, and this is a prime example.  But there really are no weak cuts on the disc.  Belle and Sebastian are often compared to such performers as Donovan and the Smiths, but I have never heard anyone contrast them with Love.  But I defy anyone to listen to FOREVER CHANGES and the to the horns in "Dog on Wheels" and not hear a strong similarity.  Indeed, one of the few albums full of as many marvelous melodies is Love's great classic.
