 My daughter gave me a copy of this for Christmas (we have two sisters who look exactly like the cat on p. 37) and I've had a lot of funny both looking through it on my own and sharing with others which cats most crack me up.  The pictures are the thing.  I found the text a bit irritating and silly, but the pictures really speak for themselves.  The photos largely fall into two categories:  spontaneous photos and posed photos.  I personally would never take any of the latter.  My favorites here are, therefore, the spontaneous, unposed photographs.  I just don't enjoy cats dressed up or otherwise decked out.  My experience as a cat owner has always been that they really don't appreciate such antics.  Oh, I once knew a neighborhood cat who would climb up screens like the one on p. 103.  More than once he would scare people to death when they'd look up to see this critter seemingly hanging there in midair.
