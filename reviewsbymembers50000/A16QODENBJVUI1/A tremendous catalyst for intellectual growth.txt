 LIPSTICK TRACES is a tremendous brain expander.  We talk sometimes of "expanding one's consciousness," and of no book is that more appropriate than this one.  Marcus is not merely brilliant in what he  writes; he is brilliant in the artists and writers and works of art he  points you towards.  You will find yourself scurrying off to buy copies of  THE SOCIETY OF THE SPECTACLE, bootleg CDs of the Sex Pistols, and  hard-to-find copies of movies like 20 MILLION YEARS TO EARTH, and will find  yourself enriched by the process. But the main reason to get this book is  that it is a lot of fun.  Maybe I am weird, but I had none of the sense  that some of the other readers had:  that it is hard, that it bogs down,  that it is a slow read.  Maybe its all the Wittgenstein, Hegel, and  Kierkegaard I read in grad school, but I found this book to be an absolute  page turner.  I give it my highest recommendation.
