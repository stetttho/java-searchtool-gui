 As a book fiend, I have tried to afflict my daughter with as any books as possible growing up.  I bought her novels, picture books, pop up books, classics, contemporary award winners, and every other kind of book as can  be imagined.  But of all the books of poetry that I bought her, this  extraordinary volume was my personal favorite.  I loved reading it so much  to her that I bought a copy for myself, and it now rests on my bookshelf  between Whitman and William Carlos Williams (and just before that marvelous  lover of Blake, William Butler Yeats). These are not just fine children's  poems, they are fine poems.  I have sent copies of this to friends with  children, and close friends who are widely published poets themselves.  All  reacted with as much joy as I did.   (Must add that I find the 2 star  review below to be bizarre and incomprehensible.  This is not intended to  be William Blake, but poems written in homage to and in the spirit of the  SONGS OF INNOCENCE AND EXPERIENCE.  And in this the author succeeded  superbly.)
