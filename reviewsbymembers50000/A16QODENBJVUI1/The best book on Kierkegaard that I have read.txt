 During my academic studies I managed to read between 50 and 75 books on Kierkegaard, and along with Louis Mackey's KIERKEGAARD: A KIND OF POET, this was the most illuminating that I encountered.  This is a clear and penetrating study of both Kierkegaard's own work and the way that it can be used to address current issues in moral philosophy.  Should be on the short list of essential books for any aspiring student of Kierkegaard.
