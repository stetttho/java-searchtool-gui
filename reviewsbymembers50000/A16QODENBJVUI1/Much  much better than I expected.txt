 I find myself frequently renting videos in self-defense.  I have seen virtually every movie in my local video store, and I frequently find myself renting of the ones that I haven't seen, the one that I think I will dislike least.  That is how I rented THE RUNAWAY BRIDE. I had been scared away from this one because of the utterly horrible reviews from when it first came out.  I remember the film even made some Worse Movies of the Year lists.  By no stretch of the imagination is this movie deserving of such notoriety. I think two things hurt this film when it came out.  One, NOTTING HILL had come out a month or two earlier, and it was easily one of the best films Julia Roberts had ever done.  This one suffered somewhat by comparison with that much better film.  Two, the comparison with PRETTY WOMAN.  The latter is, by any criterion, a better film. But I think anyone expecting this film to be a shaggy dog of a movie will be pleasantly surprised.  It has a couple of major problems, the main one being a very weak script.  There are some good ideas in it, and the basic premise is a fine one for a light romantic comedy.  But overall the film lacks a sense of balance, and while other things might account for this (direction and editing, for instance), in this case the fault seems to lie with the script. On the other hand, the cast is pretty strong.  A number of the supporting characters were very fine, and Gere and Roberts were both quite enjoyable.   So, if you are like me, and have been avoiding this one because of the reviews when it came out, I would encourage you to take a risk.  Not as nearly good as PRETTY WOMAN or NOTTING HILL, it is nonetheless a quite enjoyable light flick.
