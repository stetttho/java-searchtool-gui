 Everything Wittgenstein scholars had been hoping that Brian McGuinness's biography was going to be but wasn't.  Valuable both for the philosopher and for the layperson who would perhaps like a better understanding of one  of the century's most important philosophers. Contrary to the one  reviewer below, the Bartley biography is one of the most notorious and  irresponsible biographies of any philosopher of the 20th century.  It is a  travesty of scholarship, and an embarrassment to anyone with an critical  eye.  It is no secret that Wittgenstein was gay, but Bartley tries to prove  (with no proof existing to this effect) that Wittgenstein engaged in a kind  of sexual activity of the most promiscuous kind.  His proof is of the sort:   some guy I ran into in a gay bar in Manchester said he knew a guy who  looked like Wittgenstein who liked to take rough boys out for a bit of fun.   In short, we are not told who these sources were, which means that they  cannot be further assessed as to reliability and veracity, not to mention  the fact that his depiction of Wittgenstein contrasts markedly with what we  know of Wittgenstein from well-documented sources.  Not exactly the kind of  evidence that scholars like to utilize in making their assertions.  The  Bartley biography suffers in equal parts from a lack of philosophical  understanding on the part of Bartley and a willingness to credit the  flimsiest sort of hearsay.   The Toulmin and Janik book is much better  than the Bartley (I am somewhat biased as I took two seminars with  Toulmin), but it is an attempt to articulate Wittgenstein's intellectual  and cultural background, and is more of a supplement to a biography rather  than actually being a biography. The Monk biography is wonderfully human  biography, which makes Wittgenstein come alive as a flesh and bone  individual.  I highly recommend it to anyone interested in Wittgenstein or  in 20th century philosophy.
