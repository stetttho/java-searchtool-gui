 After two decades of being the most underrated performer in all of rock music (one publication, after naming him the world's most underrated performer in the world for the sixth or seventh year in a row said that it  was the last year he would win; hereafter the World's Most Underrated  Performer would simply be The Richard Thompson Award), you would think that  this album would be better known.  Whenever critics are polled on The  Greatest Albums of All Time, this album invariably finishes in the top  twenty along with artists like the Stones, the Beatles, Hendirx, and  whomever.   Richard is without any question one of the great living  songwriters, his former wife Linda a singer of great purity and power, and  the crack band (formed by some of the best folk-rock musicians in Britain)  as good as it gets.  And although he always plays the guitar with the  greatest of restraint, Thompson really is the world's greatest guitarist.   This is especially apparent to anyone who has had the privilege of hearing  him perform live.
