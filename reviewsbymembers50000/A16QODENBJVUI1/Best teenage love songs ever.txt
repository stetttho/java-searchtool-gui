 I live in Chicago, and although I didn't learn about the Shoes until the early 1990s, I was lucky enough to see the Shoes perform 3 or 4 times in that decade.  Unfortunately, I don't think they perform at all any longer.  In part, it might be because the guys are all in their late forties, and the songs they all sang so magnificently were awesome anthems of teenage exhiliration and angst over the opposite sex.  I know of absolutely no band in the world that strikes such a perfect note of what it is like to be 17 and desperately in love with a girl. Musically, the Shoes were a throwback to the sixties.  The Beatles, the Kinks, the Raspberries all spring to mind as predecessors (and a successor would be Chicago's magnificent and tragically forgotten Green).  Unlike those bands, however, there is never a note of dissonance.  This music is smooth.  Perfect harmonies (perhaps because two of the singers are brothers--remember how well the Everly Brothers voices blended), sweet melodies, heartfelt emotion.  It is impossible to listen to this music and not feel catapulted back to junior high school or high school.   But though this is music about teen love, there is nothing of the sell out here.  The audience for this music, and the ones who might most appreciate the band, are those who are into a lot of pre-nineties alternative music.  If you are a fan of bands like Big Star and Television, you really need to know this band.   I just wish I could hear them live one more time.
