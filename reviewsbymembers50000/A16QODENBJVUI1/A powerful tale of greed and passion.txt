 AN OUTCAST OF THE ISLANDS was both Conrad's second novel and the second novel in a trilogy of books featuring Almayer (the first book being ALMAYER'S FOLLY and the third Conrad's final novel, THE RESCUE), who is a  major minor character in this one after being the major character in his  first novel.  This novel is not as strong an effort as the novels from his  major phase, but it is nonetheless a book of great power and wonderfully  illustrates most of the great themes that run through all of his books.  I  have a love-hate relationship with Conrad, because while I respond to the  marvelously depicted male characters in his books (his women are usually  implausibly stupid and cardboardish) and their conflicts with the universe  and each other, I find the world he describes as being a little too bleak  and the cosmos far too impersonal.  All of his characters are doomed to  ineffecual action, and their fates are determined by forces and factors  outside of themselves, or perhaps to some degree by motives within  themselves over which they have no power.  I do not like Conrad's universe,  but I admit the power of his creation. This is not one of Conrad's  greatest works.  It belongs in a tier immediately below his very greatest  works like NOSTROMO, THE SECRET AGENT, UNDER WESTERN EYES, HEART OF  DARKNESS, LORD JIM, and VICTORY.  Nonetheless, slightly lesser Conrad is  more rewarding than major works of other writers, and I heartily recommend  this novel (as well as his other books) to any serious reader.
