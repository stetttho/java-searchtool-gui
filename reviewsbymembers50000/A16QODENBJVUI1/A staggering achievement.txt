 Hyperbole rules in customer reviews, but I honestly believe that this is the greatest album ever released. It almost certainly influenced the history of rock and roll more than any other single album made, even more than SGT PEPPER. Why? The greatest influence on the Beatles after their initial fame was listening to Bob Dylan. The influence of the single "Like a Rolling Stone" by itself was staggering. (It was released as a single months before the album.) Upon listening to Dylan and this album/song, Sam Cooke wrote a masterpiece in trying to imitate him ("A Change is Gonna Come"), as did Otis Redding ("Sitting on the Dock of the Bay"). Both Lennon and McCartney abandoned the pop love songs that had been the staple of the Beatles success through 1965 to write the more complex lyrics found on REVOLVER and RUBBER SOUL. The moment this album was released the concept of what a rock song could do with words was changed forever. There are so many remarkable aspects to this album. The lyrics are so incredible as to seem beyond the capability of someone as young and uneducated as Dylan, full of deep cultural resonances and references while maintaining a poetic perfection. Every fan can name his or her own favorites: mine are the title song, "Ballad of a Thin Man," "Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues," and "Desolation Row," which manages to sum up the state of modern culture in one eleven minute song (which seems to me more and more as time goes by one of the great songs written by anyone in this half century).  It is hardly conceivable that any serious fan of music in general or rock in particular doesn't already know every second of this album, but if not, you must get it. On its own merits, it is one of the supreme cultural achievements of the century, and its massive influence on every single songwriter who grew up in its wake only makes knowing it all that more essential.
