 This very nice book is getting some undeserving reviews here for the simple reason that I believe the others are wanting it to be something that it was not intended to be. WHAT IT IS NOT is a preparatory book for the CCNA exam.  And if one reads the cover carefully, no such claims for it are made.   WHAT IT IS is an introduction to networking and internetworking for those who are planning to go on and study for the CCNA exam.  In other words, the book is intended to provide a broad grasp of networking for those who have not already been working in a network.  For instance, perhaps someone has been working primarily in desktop support, but wants to move into networking.  This book will provide an overview for them of what is involved in a WAN.   On these grounds, the book is a great success.  In the past year I have had numerous occasions to try to bring individuals who were not familiar with internetworking (specifically, managers and sales staff) up to speed.  I would have loved to have had this book available at that time.   I do think that the publishers have perhaps limited the market for this book by emphasizing the CCNA connection.  While it is a good introduction to networking for less experienced individuals planning to go for their CCNA, the book is one of the very best introductions to networking that I have seen, and is of great value to a wide range of potential users, most of whom would never go on to become a CCNA.
