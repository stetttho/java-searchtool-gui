 My feeling about reissues and anthologies is:  anything to get the band back in front of the past and present and future fans.  I'll echo everything the other reviewers have said.  A tremendous and tragically neglected band.  I will add a slight observation.  Whether you like the first couple of albums or the albums that followed those will largely depend on how you feel about Chris STamey versus Peter Holsapple.  I liked Chris Stamey but utterly loved Peter Holsapple.  So, for me, the two albums that followed the first two (i.e., the albums after Stamey left and Holsapple became the sole songwriter) were the better albums.  I would also like to strongly disagree with the first reviewer, for whom THE SOUND OF MUSIC is their best album.  I vastly prefer LIKE THIS to any other dB's album.  Just one great pop song after another, including my two favorite dB's song s("Lonely Is (As Lonely Does" and "Love is for Lovers") and their lone hit ("A Spy In the House of Love"--though it was a hit for another band, and not the dB's).
