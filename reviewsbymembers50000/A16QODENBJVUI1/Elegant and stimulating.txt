 Late Antiquity is not one of my areas of expertise, so I am approaching this book as a literate generalist.  That said, I found this to be a wonderful introduction to the subject.  Brown is a marvelous prose writer, as well as a gifted scholar brewing with interesting insights.  The only reason I do not give this book a 10 is that the book is sometimes short on explanation and detail, but then he does admit early on that the book is an essay rather than a systematic introduction.  A testament to how much I enjoyed this is that I immediately began reading Augustine's CONFESSIONS and Brown's acclaimed biography of Augustine.
