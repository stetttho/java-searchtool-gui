 I don't want to say a great deal about this book except that it is marvelous.  In one way it reminds me very much of another recent masterpiece, D. M. Thomas's WHITE HOTEL, in that you don't really know what  it is about until you have read most of it.  When you realize what the true  subject of the book is, the effect is jarring.  Beautiful.  And you learn a  lot about Flaubert as well!
