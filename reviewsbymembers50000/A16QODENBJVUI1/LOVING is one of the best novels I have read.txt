 I have read both of the three-novel volumes published by Penguin, and while I think even the worst of these is at least good, LOVING shines out as one of the best novels that I have ever read.  Set in Ireland during WW  II and consisting almost entirely of dialogue (no narrative voice worth  noting), it tells a poignant yet hopeful story of love in the upper and  servant classes of a country castle and estate.  The ending is one of the  very best that I have encountered, rivaling my other favorite endings  (BROTHERS KARAMOZOV, THE WHITE HOTEL, and POSSESSION). I had serious  reservations about the Modern Library list of the 100 Greatest English  Novels of the 20th century, but I was delighted to see that they included  LOVING. LIVING is not as strong as the other two books, but PARTY GOING,  while not the masterpiece that LOVING is, is nonetheless a very, very fine  book indeed.
