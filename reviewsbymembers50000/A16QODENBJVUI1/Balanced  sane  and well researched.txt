 At the moment I am nearing the end of William Shirer's THE RISE AND FALL OF THE THIRD REICH, and I have been struck by how much the historical claims made by Hitler reminds me of the kinds of claims made by Afrocentrists.  In both instances, all historical evidence is thrown out the window in favor of a fanciful creation of a history that never was.  The same holds true of those who would deny that the destruction of the Jews in Nazi Germany took place despite mountains of evidence that it did.  Lefkowitz expresses all of this when she writes in the Conclusion, " . . . by substituting myth for history [the Afrocentrists] open the way for other groups to invent their own histories.  Some of these new mythologies could harm African-Americans far more than Afrocentrist mythology could ever help them" (155-56).  Both Hitler and the holocaust-deniers are graphic proof of this.   NOT OUT OF AFRICA, however, is not a perfect book.  It is hideously repetitive.  This could either be because the author was trying to flesh what could otherwise have been a booklet out to book-length form, or it could be that the individual chapters were originally self-standing essays that have been married together to form a book.  Whatever the cause, this book, while short, could easily have been fifty pages shorter.  I also wish that Lefkowitz could have discussed Martin Bernal at more length.  Most of her discussion of Afrocentrism focusses on such intellectual mediocrities as George James.  If the best exponent of an Afrocentrist viewpoint is Martin Bernal, then I would have preferred to have seen more of a discussion of his work and less on James and Diop.   Still, this is an excellent book, and one that anyone interested in multicultural literacy, Ancient Greece or Egypt, or Black history should investigate.  It is also very clearly written and quite easy to read.
