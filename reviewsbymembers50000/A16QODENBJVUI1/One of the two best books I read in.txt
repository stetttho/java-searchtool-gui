 POSSESSED and Keith Thomas's RELIGION AND THE DECLINE OF MAGIC were my two favorite books that I read in 1997.  As a former grad student (Yale and University of Chicago), I can attest that the intellectual milieu was quite familiar and accurately treated.  What impressed me about the book was the way that it managed to get better and better as the story progressed.  And the last four pages were as good as I have ever encountered (only Henry Green's LOVING and Dostoevsky's THE BROTHERS KARAMAZOV had final pages that I loved as much).  I would recommend any serious reader getting this book immediately, but especially anyone who has had to trudge through grad school in the humanities.  A truly fine novel.
