 The ratings on this book are apt to be a poll on one's attitude towards Rush Limbaugh as anything.  And I will confess to detesting Rush Limbaugh, especially his distortion of facts and substitution of ridicule for rationale discussion.   Which leads to Frank?  Is Al Franken fair to Rush Limbaugh?  Does he engage in rational discussion when ridicule and parody will suffice instead?  Absolutely, and that is the beauty of the book.  Rush laid down the ground rules of how he would proceed and he and his fans have no grounds for complaint if someone uses those same rules against him.  Though Franken's jibes are not without substance.  It is hypocritical to berate constantly liberals for being anti-family when you have been married three times like Rush or have an affair with the wife of a colleague while you are married yourself, like Newt Gingrich.     Luckily, the book has merits above poking fun at fat chat show hosts or adulterous Speakers of the House.  It is funny.
