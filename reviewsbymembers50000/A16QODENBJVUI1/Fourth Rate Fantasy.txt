 I first learned about this book through various studies of cult and extremist political groups.  Because of its prominence, I decided that I would read it.  I was prepared to encounter a book with rather flaky social  and political underpinings that nonetheless might be a little fun, just as  RAMBO or RED DAWN can be fun apart from a great deal of silliness. I was  wrong. The only thing this book offers is a fictional embodiment of  inconceivably naive and intellectually empty beliefs and fears.  The  writing style is inconceivably wretched, the characters unbelievable and  cardboardish, and the plot boring and without suspense. Apart from  members of the extremist right, it is inconceivable that anyone deriving  any pleasure or enlightenment from this book.
