 First, although I adore this series, I would like to demur from the description of this series as a comedy.  Certainly there are many comic situations and laughable characters, but Powell's (pronounced POE-UHL, not  POW-UHL) comedy is intended less to make uslaugh than to make ussmile.  I  know many novels that are far funnier than this one, and if that were the  book's only virtue, it would not enjoy the status that it does. Above  all, this is a work that limns in almost tedious detail the interrelations  and interworkings of a segment of English society in the 20th century.   These first three books take you from the early twenties into the early  thirties.  Despite the series great length, there is nothing epic about the  scale of the novels except for the overall length of of the series as a  whole.  The scenes are all horribly mundane.  A party here, a dinner there,  a chance meeting in a bar, more parties, more dinners.  But as the parties  and dinners multiply, and as one social encounter builds upon another, the  series does indeed take on an epic quality. This new edition is far more  attractive than the old mass market edition of the series, but I do wish  that someone would have taken the effort to supply an appendix (perhaps to  the final volume) that would (as in some editions of Trollope and Proust)  explain who all the characters are and to whom they are related.  By the  sixth volume in the series, I began to find it extremely difficult to  remember precisely where each character fit in the social world as a  whole. The greatest virtues of Powell's series are his richly delineated  characters (of which there are at least fifty to a hundred who are to some  degree significant) and his marvelously elegant prose.  I believe that  anyone who loves novels would love this series, in particular those who  have enjoyed Proust.
