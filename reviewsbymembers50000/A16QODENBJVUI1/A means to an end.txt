 There is a very good reason to read this book, and that is to get to the rest of the Barsetshire series.  Although not much on its own, THE WARDEN is the prelude to BARCHESTER TOWERS, which is immensely entertaining.   So, while I cannot recommend THE WARDEN on its own, I heartily recommend the entire series.  Except for this first volume, all the novels are superb, culminating in what is easily one of Trollope's two or three best novels THE LAST CHRONICLE OF BARSET, which is one of the undeservedly neglected masterpieces in the English language.  Why is it neglected?  Because it is the final novel of a massive series, and few manage to make it all the way to the end.  Read THE WARDEN, but only so you can go on to the other novels in the series.
