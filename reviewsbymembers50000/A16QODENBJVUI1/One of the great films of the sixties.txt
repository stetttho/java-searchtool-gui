 It is great. All that needs to be said. But I would like to quibble with the Canadian reviewer who defends Janet Leigh's role. He or she uses the book to illuminate her role in the movie. That same character in the movie may possess more depth than the character in the movie, but that doesn't negate the fact that in the movie the character is poorly drawn and badly written. I wish that they had put the elements from the book into the movie. But they didn't. And her role (though not her performance--she had to make do with the lines she was given) does mar an otherwise almost perfect film.
