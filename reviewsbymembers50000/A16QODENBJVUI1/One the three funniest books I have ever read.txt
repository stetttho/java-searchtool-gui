 I am a list fiend.  I make lists of every conceivable form and fashion.  One such list is "The Funniest Books I have Ever Read."  This one makes that list, finishing in a three-way tie for first with CATCH-22 and John Barth's THE SOTWEED FACTOR (Jerome K. Jerome's THREE MEN IN A BOAT is next in the list).  The plot:  the future is a very, very bad place to be.  Inconceivable overcrowding, deplorable living conditions, shortages of every imaginable form.  How to cope?  Drug the world!  Social engineering and better living through the use of mind altering drugs.  Democracy and Socialism have given way to the government of the future:  Pharmacocracy!  The world isn't a better place; it just seems to be.  But when terrorists put LSD into the water supply at the 116-story Costa Rica Hilton during the meeting of the world's foremost futorologists, the thin veneer holding society together becomes flayed.   Lem has written three of my favorite books in the world:  this one, THE STAR DIARIES (also featuring Ijon Tichy--I believe in the original Polish these two were part of the same volume), and SOLARIS.  The latter is equally superb, but oddly enough, completely without humor.  It is almost difficult to comprehend that these works all came from the same writer.
