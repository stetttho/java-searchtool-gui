 For several years my daughter and I have made a habit of from time to time gathering all the candles we can muster, lighting them, turn off the electrical lights and reading one of the stories in this collection.   What Conan Doyle is to the detective story, James is to the ghost story.  These are not horror stories.  No gore is to be found, no monsters, no savagery.  One can find a subtle horror, a persistent sense that there are things in this world that we have either forgotten or never discovered.     If one has ever engaged in any historical research on the occult (which I have undertaken as an extreme nonbeliever), one will come across several ancient books and manuscripts in the field that were edited by M. R. James.  He was not merely the writer of perfect ghost stories; he was an authority in the field of occult beliefs and practices.  This concrete grounding accounts for much of the realistic feel to the researches of many of the characters in his stories.
