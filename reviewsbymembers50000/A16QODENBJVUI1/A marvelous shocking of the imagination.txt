 In DREAMER a hermit tells clinical dream researcher Jody Nightwood that she should consult a shaman about dreams, because the encounter with completely alternative views about her field of study could shake up her way of thinking and provoke new insight.  I think that is more or less what Jack Butler is trying to do with his readers.  This is a novel of juxtapositions:  of the mundane and ordinary with the occult and concealed.  Nightwood believes her world is common enough, but even as she gains new insight into the complexity of her own life, she has no conception of the complex drama unfolding around her.   This is a novel of many virtues.  Butler is a master of evoking a sense of place.  I have never been to Santa Fe (where the novel takes place) or even seen photographs of it, but from reading the novel I have an idea of what the city must look and feel like (it may be a wrong idea, but at least it is a very definite impression).  The city and its locale became much more concrete for me than the other great novel that I have read about Santa Fe (DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP).  And for all the fantastical elements in the book--CIA operatives, shamans, vivid dreams, vampires--he is at his very best at describing the most ordinary of events.  Sitting at home making dinner, going out with friends to dinner, meetings with relatives, meeting new people:  these were my favorite moments in the book.   Anyone interested in contemporary fiction owes it to themselves to read this book.  A marvelous read.
