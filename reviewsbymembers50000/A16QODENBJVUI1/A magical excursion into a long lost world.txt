 Willa Cather was a lapsed Protestant who wrote two of the greatest novels of the twentieth century dealing with Roman Catholic characters:  this novel and the even greater DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP.  This book is  many things at once:  a magnificent historical novel, a wonderful depiction  of an adolescent growing up, and a wonderful evocation of a world that none  of us can visit any longer.  I do not know what possessed this midwesterner  to write a novel about 17th century Quebec, but I am delighted that she  did.  I cannot recommend this novel highly enough.
