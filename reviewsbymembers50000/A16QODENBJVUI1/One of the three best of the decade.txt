 TO BRING YOU MY LOVE won virtually every Best Album award that could be  won in 1995 and won the prestigious Village Voice Pazz and Jop Poll (as  voted by several hundred top rock and music critics) as the Album of the  Year.  Polly Jean Harvey also managed the Rolling Stone Artist of the Year  Award on the basis of this album.  But the album is even better than that.   By any standard, the nineties has been one of the worst decades in the  history of rock, but this album stands as one of the glorious achievements  of the nineties, and PJ Harvey one of the few contemporary artists who can  stand comparison with rock figures from previous decades. All of these  songs are about sex and sexuality, and not a very healthy sexuality at  that.  Despite the title of the album and opening song, love and its  healing power is completely missing in these songs.  What is present is sex  as obsession, as compulsion, as an animalistic force of nature, as  destructive, inescapable, and irrestible as a tidal wave or volcanic  irruption.  The album could as easily have been titled, TO BRING YOU THE  PLAGUE.   But the power in these demonic love songs surpasses that of any  other artist working in the nineties, and represents an exceptional  achievement by one of the few creative artists working in popular music in  an otherwise bland and banal period of time.
