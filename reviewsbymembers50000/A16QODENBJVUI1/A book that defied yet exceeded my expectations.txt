 I had expected EXILE'S return to be more of a straightforward history of the Lost Generation, and was somewhat surprised to find instead a profoundly insightful, exceedingly well-written reflection on Malcolm  Cowley's literary generation.  As a result, many writers that we associate  with that decade, e.g., Ernst Hemingway, receive almost no mention, whereas  others, e.g., Hart Crane, get a considerable amount.  The highest praise  that I can bestow on this book is that in looking now at the poetry and  literature of that period, I feel much more at home in their world than I  did before reading Cowley.  A marvelous book in man, many ways.
