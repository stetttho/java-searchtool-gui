 These cartoons really make me hate the major networks.  The six episodes on this DVD are all quite original, very funny, and just very well done.  The really sad thing is that there are only six episodes.  Most cartoon series get better after a couple of dozen shows, since most need an opportunity to evolve and develop.  These, unfortunately, are frozen permanently in their semi-embryo state.  They are very fine just as they are, but if everyone involved with the project had been give more time, there is no telling how good it might have become. Cutting to the chase, absolutely anyone who likes either the movie CLERKS, cartoons that are not for kids, or Kevin Smith's projects will like these cartoons.  A lot.  And for Kevin Smith's fans, there are also on the DVD (not certain about the video) introductions to each episode by Jay and Silent Bob.  I thought they were a very nice addition to the DVD. Alec Baldwin did the voice for Leonardo Leonardo, and this reminded me of the novelty song that came out a few years ago:  "Elvis is Everywhere."  Well, sometimes these days it seems that Alec Baldwin is everywhere.  He is in regular mainstream movies.  He is doing voiceovers on cartoons (here, and also on the forthcoming FINAL FANTASY movie and the computer animated CATS AND DOGS).  Last summer my ex-girlfriend and I took her son to THOMAS THE MAGICAL TANK ENGINE, and Lo! and Behold! Alec Baldwin played the conductor.  And he does the narration for some of the Thomas videos.  In addition, a couple of times I turned on late night shows, and there he was.  I tell you, Alec Baldwin is everywhere!
