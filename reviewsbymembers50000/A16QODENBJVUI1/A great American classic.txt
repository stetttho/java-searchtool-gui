 I have to admit that I enjoy the novels of Willa Cather more than those of many of her American contemporaries, like Heminingway and Fitzgerald.  Perhaps because she primarily wrote books that were somewhat historical in  nature she isn't perceived as relevant as them.  For whatever reason, I  find her to be a marvelous writer, and although I have read almost a dozen  of her books, I haven't found anything that wasn't completely enchanting.   If you like this one, follow it up with the almost equally marvelous  SHADOWS ON THE ROCK.
