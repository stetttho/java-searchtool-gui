 This game companion certainly contains a great deal of useful information, and I would not dispense with my copy for anything.  But any AC player should be aware of its shortcomings before purchasing. First, the book  has no index, and that seriously lessens the value the book might have had  otherwise.  There are very, very many questions that I have had that could  have been answered much more quickly if there had only been an index.   Because this is an online game, if one is actually playing the game it is  rather difficult to take the time to flip through the pages of the book to  come up with the answer to a question. Second, it would have been helpful  to have more maps.  Maps of regions showing dungeons, life stones, portals,  points of interest would all have been of the greatest use.   Third, some  guide providing a better idea of how to navigate Negreth would have been  especially valuable.  A drawing akin to a subway map might have been easily  accomplished.  As it is, if you have to get from one town to another,  especially one that you have not been to before, it can be frustrating and  irritating to figure out to get from point A to point B. Still, the book  does contain a great deal of helpful information.  I have found the section  on monsters and their strengths and weaknesses to be valuable.  At one  point I realized that I was achieving no damage at all with my fire sword  on lime golems, opened the book, and saw that they recommended acid attacks  instead.  I switched, and went immediately from inflictng 2 or 3 points of  damage to inflicting 15-25.
