 I'll just add to what others have said:  this film is a heck of a lot of fun.  Ginger has never been more delightful.  Charles Coburn is his usual magnificent self (and gets off the movie's best line:  "I don't care  who the father is, I am the grandfather!"  And David Niven, who I have  always found likeable but inexplicably overrated, is much more agreeable  than usual.   Although my favorite Ginger Rogers films are those she made  with Herr Astaire, she would have been one of my favorites merely by the  quality of such films as this one and THE MAJOR AND THE MINOR.
