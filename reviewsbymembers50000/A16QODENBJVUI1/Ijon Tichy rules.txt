 My understanding is that the three books featuring space traveller Ijon Tichy were originally published in Polish in a single volume (THE FUTUROLOGICAL CONGRESS, THE STAR DIARIES, and MEMOIRS OF A SPACE TRAVELLER).  If so, I would insist that that has to be one of the ten greatest science fiction books ever published.  The highpoint of the Tichy tales is THE FUTUROLOGICAL CONGRESS, which is published as a separate book in English, but the stories in THE STAR DIARIES are very nearly as good (the remnants were published in the MEMOIRS).  Essential reading.  They come across as some demonic blend of Italo Calvino, Escher, and Groucho Marx.  Most sci-fi writing is deeply derivative from previous writers, but Stanislaw Lem is possibly the most original sci-fi writer of the past forty years.  I am one of those who believe that Lem should have received serious consideration for a Nobel Prize.
