 Every good library needs books that remind us of how many absurd things there are in the world.  This book manages to collect some of the worst LP covers in the history of the planet, almost all of them by performers you have never heard of or never want to hear.  I had heard of only about five or six in any way whatsoever (and that includes Nancy Walker, who I literally walked into on Washington Square once as we were both talking to people back over our shoulders--most remember her from RHODA and the commercials as "the quicker picker upper").  A disturbing number of the album covers were by Christian acts.  Many were just flat out strange.    It would have been fun to see some albums that featured awful covers but contained good music.  A good example of this is the Louvain Brothers gospel collection SATAN IS REAL, with featured the brothers cowering comically before a huge cardboard Satan (the disc contains their wonderful "The Christian Life," that Gram Parsons would perform, including his brief stint with the Byrds).  All in all, this is a great book either for making yourself laugh, for leaving around to make others laugh, or for buying for others a a gift.  I defy anyone to look through it with a straight face.
