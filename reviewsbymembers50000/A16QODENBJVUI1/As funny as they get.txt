 It is a tragedy that this book is out of print.  The first few pages of this novel are as funny as writing can get.  Those who only know Portis by TRUE GRIT would be shocked to learn that he is primarily a comic writer, and THE DOG OF THE SOUTH and MASTERS OF ATLANTIS are his funniest.  The scene in which the protagonists describes how he always wets the corners of his cocktail napkins so that the napkin will stay attached to the bar rather than stick to his glass and thereby make him look like a dork is priceless.
