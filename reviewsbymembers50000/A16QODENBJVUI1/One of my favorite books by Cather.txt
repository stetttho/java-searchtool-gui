 Objectively speaking, this book as a whole is perhaps not quite as excellent as some of her other books like DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP, but this nonetheless is one of my three favorites of her novels.  The book  consists of three parts, not all of them of equal strength (the only real  criticism of the book in the end is that the sections are not sufficiently  integrated with one another and that they do not quite balance one  another), but a couple of them containing some of her most powerful  writing.  A very, very good book.  Anyone who enjoyed DEATH COMES FOR THE  ARCHBISHOP would in particular like it.
