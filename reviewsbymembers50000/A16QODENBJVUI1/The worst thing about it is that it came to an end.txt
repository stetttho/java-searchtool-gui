 C. S. Lewis once wrote that one of the greatest services that literature offers is the opportunity to experience worlds and lives not our own.  This is rarely more true than with Powell's magnificent series.  I had come to  feel that Nicholas Jenkins's friends were my friends, and by the end I felt  almost as if I had experienced another life.   If one is willing to make  the commitment of time, I wholeheartedly recommend this superb series.  In  a hundred years time, it might be the single work that I would recommend to  anyone wanting to know what life in the 20th century was like.
