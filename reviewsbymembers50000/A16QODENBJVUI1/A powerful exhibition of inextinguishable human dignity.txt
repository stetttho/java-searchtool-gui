 This is the book I would send someone to who wanted to learn about human dignity.  This is not a book for blacks or whites alone, but for anyone who needs a graphic example of a human being refusing to respect himself and forego his rights as a human being.  Douglass's NARRATIVE was published during that period of time known as "The American Renaissance," and this work certainly stands comparison with the other great works of that period by Emerson, Thoreau, Hawthorne, Whitman, and Melville.
