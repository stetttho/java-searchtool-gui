 I put off reading this novel for years despite rave reviews from several literarily astute friends.  I simply did not want to read a novel about Lee Harvey Oswald.  But last fall I read UNDERWORLD, which I consider one of  the 4 or 5 greatest American novels of the past 50 years.  As a result, I  decided finally to give LIBRA a chance. The bad news is that it doesn't  come anywhere near the level of UNDERWORLD, which is an astonishing tour de  force.  Fortunately, it is still better than the vast majority of English  languague novels of the past couple of decades.  Any serious reader will be  doing him or herself a favor by picking up this novel.
