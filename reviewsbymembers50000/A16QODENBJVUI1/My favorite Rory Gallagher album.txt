 In the 1970s, I had a ritual for each new apartment I moved into (and as a student, I moved a lot).  The very first thing I would do was set up my record player, so I could listen to music while I unpacked.  For some  reason, the first thing I would listen to was "Souped Up Ford" by  Rory Gallagher.  That song was on another album (AGAINST THE GRAIN, my  second favorite Rory Gallagher album).  But this album was always my  favorite.  One killer song after another, from "Tattooed Lady" to  "Livin' Like a Trucker" to my personal favorite on the album,  "A Million Miles Away."  I love U2, but I find it tragic that the  godfather of Irish rock should today be so infrequently remembered.  Sure,  those who really, really are "in the know" about rock and roll  love his music, but those numbers seem to be dwindling.  But thank god his  albums are available now complete and on CD.   The three albums I like  most are this one, AGAINST THE GRAIN, and CALLING CARD.  Also really  interesting is his LIVE IN EUROPE.  Lots of interesting things on that one,  but I find it interesting beause on it Rory demonstrated an ability that I  have observed in only one other rock performer:  the ability to sing and  play a lead guitar line at the same time.  Most ace guitarists will switch  to playing rhythm while they are singing, only playing solos on the guitar  when not singing.  Gallagher and Hendrix bizarrely were able to do both.   The LIVE album proves that it was not a studio trick.
