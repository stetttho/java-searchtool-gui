 I am not certain that Willa Cather wrote anything that was not worth reading, but I do think this is the weakest of the ten or so of her works that I have read.  If you have read and enjoyed her other books, by all  means read it.  If you haven't read her at all, I would recommend instead  DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP, THE PROFESSOR'S HOUSE, or SHADOWS ON THE  ROCK, or her prairie books MY ANTONIA or O PIONEERS.  This book is a decent  book by a great writer.
