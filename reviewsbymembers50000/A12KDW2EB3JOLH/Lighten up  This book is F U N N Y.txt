 I think most of the negative reviews are from people whose tongue is not inserted properly in their cheek.Really, guys, who goes around COUNTING cliches and who can really catch every single one when it all comes dowen  to it. This book is full of wicked humor and a skewering look at fantasy  not to be missed.  True fans of any genre are the ones that can laugh at  it. This book is great because it tells writers exactly what cliches to  avoid and points out funny facts. (Come to think of it, when HAS a fantasy  character, a serious heroic one, mind you, ever worn socks? Tell me if you  know!) Read it, be prepared for initial indignation, then laughter then  get on with your life and for heaven's sake don't count how many times  these tired cliches have been used! It spoils all the fun
