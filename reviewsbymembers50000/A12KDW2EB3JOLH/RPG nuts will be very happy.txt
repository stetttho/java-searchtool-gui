 I play Role-Playing Games extensively and this is the one character making aid my role-playing buddies drool over. Need a name for a telepathic half-orc assassin? Skim through some of the more exotic sections and you're  sure to find something.  I also enjoy writing fantasy and this book can  be a great help in that department as well. I am no expert and would not  depend on it exclusively for a modern novel but for fantasy names it is  invaluable. This combined with a good baby name book can make an RPG  gamers life easier, especially when they are faced with the daunting task  of naming a Venusian ship captain with flashbacks and snakes for  hair. One complaint. Utter lack of Oriental names, there are all of two  that are listed in every baby name book. Other than that, one fun book.
