 Of course I understand that movies cannot help but be affected by the time period during which they were made but this movie is just too much. It is very clear that it was made at the height of the slasher flick craze and it shoehorned it into the plot of a Jane Austen novel. Horror novels of the late eighteenth, early nineteenth centuries were more about atmosphere and melodrama than fingers being sewn together (yuck) The fantasies of Catherine were completely out of place and gave no indicator of how a girl of her time period really felt. In fact, none of the preformances convinced me that these were regency people and not modern actors wandering around sets. This is also what I call a "staring" movie. That is, to build up suspense, the characters flash one another meaningful glances as though that is supposed to make us gasp at their emotional intensity. To me, it just looked like indigestion. I am not a stickler for historically accurate music (if I were, I would never enjoy ANY movie) but I found the soundtrack annoying in the extreme. With it's sax/guitar nonsense, it sounded as though it had been lifted from a daytime drama. I returned the movie and read the book, much more rewarding.
