 Like so many other younger knitters, I am a big fan of Lily Chin's designs and her highly technical column in Knitter's. I was quite excited when I heard about this knitting book and it was a bit of a letdown when I actually saw it.  As pointed out before, the color pictures are stuck in the center of the book so that the reader has to stick her thumb in the pages to save her place so she can see what the project will actually look like. Also, the finished designs are not modelled, they are photographed less attractively on a shelf, like a department store ad or something. It's a shame since I think it would have been cool to see the young designers modeling their creations. Ok, that's the bad stuff. Here's the good stuff. The book is well-written with a short knitter's bio of each of the Urban Knitters Ms. Chin selected for the book. Many of the designs have little twists and touches that makes them more professional and unique than your average knitting patterns. The design of the knitted bra is a definate highlight and though I know I am in the minority, I thought the knitted shoes were kinda neat. They just would have looked better if there had beem a model. Shoes (especially sandals) don't look too exciting by themselves. Advice? This is a tough one. Look at the sample pages, maybe even borrow a copy from a friend or from the library and see if this book contains the sort of things you enjoy knitting. But then again, this is a fairly inexpensive knitting book so if you feel adventurous, take the leap as I did. Maybe the book will grow on you too!
