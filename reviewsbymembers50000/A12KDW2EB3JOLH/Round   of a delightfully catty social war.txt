 (I shall take for granted that you are already familiar with season 1. This series is linear and MUST be watched in order for full enjoyment) This is not so much a sequel as a continuation of the adventures of everyone's favorite social climbers. Series 1 ended with a victory for Mapp and Lucia vowing revenge and series 2 begins with Mapp (now Mrs. Mapp-Flynt) returning from her honeymoon. Almost instantly, she and Lucia are back at each other's throats. In this series, politics are added to the mix with both Mapp and Lucia vying for a seat on the town council, Lucia making herself into a charitable saint and Mapp being as underhand as always. All of the actors from series 1 return (Lovely! I do not like it when shows change actors) Georgie is given more to do this time around. Actually, all of the characters are given more developement which should delight fans of the series.  The series does not end conclusively. I won't give specifics, I'll just say that the social war is bound to continue for all eternity. What a shame there were no more installments into this lovely series. Once again, the costumes are madly original, the acting is all around superb and the writing is very good indeed. Anyone who enjoyed series 1 is bound to like this series too (though to what degree depends on their personal taste) and I suggest buying both series at once so that you are not left on a cliff-hanger. This is a wonderful series and I do hope it comes out on DVD soon. Anyone who loves clean, subtle humor with a twinge of madness would find this series very agreeable indeed. Essential for the anglophile.
