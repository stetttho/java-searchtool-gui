 This is the tale of the ultimate femme fatale. Meet Ellen. She is completely selfish and her only form of love is total posession. This book is the noirish tale of her marriage. Richard Harland happens upon Ellen while riding a train and she seems just a little too perfect to be real. Ellen eventually marries him but her desperate posessiveness grows worse. She will stop and nothing, even murder, to see to it that Richard is hers alone. The book gets into the heads of all the major characters and I was impressed at how well the author writes from the female viewpoint. While Ellen is quite insane, it is still clear what makes her tick. This book has much to offer: romance, mysteries, drama and finally an intense courtroom scene. Highly enjoyable and has the true flavor of the 40s.
