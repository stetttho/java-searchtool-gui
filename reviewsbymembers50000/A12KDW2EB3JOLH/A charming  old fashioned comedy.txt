 I always heard about how wonderful Jeeves and Wooster was but I held back on buying it since I had no idea if it was to my taste. At last, I decided to give it a try and was delighted by the witty dialogue, the marvelous set-ups and the back-and-forth between the very talented leads. To anyone who wants to try this series but is not sure, it is marvelous. From the first bars of the catchy theme song (which gets stuck in your head) I was totally in love. The comedic style reminded me of the screwball comedies of the 1930s, the era in which this series is set. A must for Anglophiles, fans of older comedy and people looking for good, clean humor. My favorite episode is the first one but every episode in the set in a minor comic masterpiece. Try it and you will not be sorry.
