 ...READ THE BACK OF THE BOOK JACKET! Does it sound funny and amusing? Then you will probably like it. If you think "ewww" then you will probably dislike it. It's as simple as that. The book is dark humor and dark humor only appeals to certain tastes. I would have loved this book as a child since I was raised on such movies as Arsenic and Old Lace. Other children may be frightened, use you own judgement. However, it is my belief that these books are more fun for adults than children. I fail to see why these novels are compared to the Harry Potter series (of which I am not a fan) since they are not really the same genre. I think this book will be more enjoyable readers who have had wide experience in the field of "orphan" stories (read the Boxcar Children back to back with this book and note some amusing comparisons) This irreverent tale turns many of the cliches of the genre on their heads. Now, adult content. Forced marriage to a 14 year old. I honestly do not believe that most children will think of the risque aspect of the plot device. After all, it is not really dwelled on and besides it has been used in Disney films, fairy tales and such for years. And the plot is all centered around getting the fortune from the children not Count Orloff finding a bride. Again, parents should use their own disgression. (The same argument goes for the child in danger plot device) This book has marvelous dry humor and it is a kick to read but it simply is not for all tastes.
