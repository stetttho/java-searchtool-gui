 I enjoyed this book greatly. I am in the younger generation of knitter, chubby yarns, cute styles and fast results. That is what this book is all about. While luxery fibers are used through much of the book, substitutions are fairly easy and that can cut the price of knitting considerably. I agree that the price is a bit steep but it can usually be found on sale. One problem with the text: the authors give no size for the buttons required so you need to use guesswork. Not too good for the newbies like me. But the knitting is good. Sure it may seem simplistic but the styles are attractive and the lines are classic.
