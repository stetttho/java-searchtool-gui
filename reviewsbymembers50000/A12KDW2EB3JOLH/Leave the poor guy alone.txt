 It's me again. I wanted to defend the book from a few accusations that seem to have popped up. The introduction has offended some people since they believe Goldman is insulting his family. Actually, I think he was writing about an "alternate" version of himself. I read on the jacket of another of his novels that he has two girls, not a boy. So, he was making up his family life in this book. Think about it, I mean, don't you think his wife would read the book her husband published. The whole thing is part of the gimmick.  As I said before, this book is more than likley a spoof of the notoriously wordy historical novelists, that is the point of the "abridgement. Or, perhaps the author just wanted to write a silly story. Either way, the book is fun. There is no point in complaining about the "abridgement" and if the introduction is not to one's taste, then it can be easily skipped. It doesn't make much sense until after you've read the story anyway. Great book, read, enjoy
