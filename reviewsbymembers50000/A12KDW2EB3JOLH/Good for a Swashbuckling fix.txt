 This movie was Errol Flynn's debut and one of the best swashbucklers of the golden era. Sadly, the genre has fallen out of favor although Hong Kong action is arguably its successor. This movie was based on the novel of the same name by Rafael Sabatini and for the most part stays close to the book. (some of the goofy dialogue was not from the book I am glad to say, the other goofy stuff just sounds odd because Blood is Irish being played by an Australian) The plot involves a Doctor who is railroaded into a treason conviction and subsequently sentenced to slave labor in Barbados. There he meets the lovely Arabella (played by Flynn's usual leading lady, Olivia deHavilland). Naturally, being the most photogenic people on the island, they fall in love. Then Blood escaps, becomes a pirate but never stops thinking about the girl he left behind. Flynn is more boyish here than he was in his later roles, he was only in his mid twenties. Both he and deHavilland are a decade younger than their counterparts in the book and act accordingly, they are both much less polite. This is a very fun movie and while VHS is dandy, I would love to see a DVD. There is a shocking lack of golden era action on DVD and I do hope the situation is corrected. Essential for a Flynn fan, pleasant for a lover of the classics and one of the better Sabatini adaptations (he wrote Scaramouche, the Sea Hawk and the Black Swan, FYI) this movie offers a solid return for your investment. Oh, and do try the book, it will make you understand the movie better.
