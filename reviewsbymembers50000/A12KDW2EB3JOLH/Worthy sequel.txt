 While not as feverishly fun as The Mark of Zorro (1920), Don Q still showcases Douglas Fairbanks's talent for swashbuckling silliness. He plays Don Cesar son of Don Diego aka Zorro. (the Don Q reference in the title is rather obscure, I can't imagine why they just didn't leave it at Son of Zorro) Don Cesar is in Spain for his education and having a whale of a time showing off his skill with the whip, partying with a foreign prince and romancing the lovely Dolores played by a young Mary Astor who is probably best known for her fatal woman role opposite Bogart in the Maltese Falcon some fifteen years later. Donald Crisp (who also directed) plays the chief bad guy Don Sebastian and rival for Dolores's hand in marriage. As it becomes more and more clear that Don Cesar will win her, Don Sebastian murders the foreign prince and frames Don Cesar. The movie is a bit overlong and drags in spots but it is still quite good and makes a good double feature with the original Mark of Zorro. The grand finale featuring father and son (both played by Fairbnanks) is entertaining and Mary Astor makes a nice understated heroine who doesn't faint too much. In the supporting cast is Lottie Pickford, sister of Mary Pickford, as Don Cesar's maid and spy. Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks were married at this time. Also, Charles Stevens plays Cesar's manservant. He was grandson of Geronimo whom Fairbanks put in almost all of his movies since he considered him lucky. A final note, this movie, like The Mark of Zorro, is silent and the old fashioned methods of acting take a while to get used to but it is worth the effort.
