 I enjoyed this book greatly. I am a brand new knitter so some of the designs are over my head (not for long, I hope) but I intend to try some as soon as I am comfortable with the craft. The bolero on the cover is my favorite. I also liked the Rennaisance coat and the portobello tunic. I do think that the little jumper would have been better with two different lengths like the Garbo outfit. After all, not everyone can or will wear mini skirts. The instructions are clear, easy to read and complete. The childrens clothes are adorable as are the throws and pillows. In all, good job to Jean Moss, it's a beautiful, well designed book with plenty of imaginative designs. (With shaping, thank heaven. I hate potato sack sweaters) Naturally, not all the designs were my cup of tea but everyone's taste is different so what else can be expected. The point is, I liked most of them and I'm happy knitting so that's all that matters.
