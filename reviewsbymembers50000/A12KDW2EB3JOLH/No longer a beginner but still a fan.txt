 I wrote an initial review of this book when I had never worked with polymer clay before. In the few months that have passed, I have gotten pretty excited about the medium and have a few varied projects under my belt. Which means this book is worthless, right? Wrong! This book is still quite an inspiration to me. I love the way the author blends stones and clay for an affect all her own. While such stones and jade and rose quartz can be simulated to near perfection with clay but rubies and emeralds and such must still be replicated with glass and semi precious stones since even the transparent clay is relatively opaque. This is most certainly a book for people who enjoy and can pull of chunkier, ancient looking jewelry and if you fit into this category I am certain this book will appeal. If you taste runs toward cute jewelry or more delicate stuff, there are plenty of polymer clay books that will fill your needs. This book is also ideal for rennaissance fair junkies, and people who need specialized ancient looking jewelry. One element I really enjoy about this book is the collection of pictures that show where the author got her inspiration. (many are paintings from the Louvre) So, you're really getting two books in one, a light art book and an instruction book. As to painting, the way I like to add a metallic look to black clay (after comapring many different instructions) is to dust it with powder and then add highlights with metallic wax. Both items are easily available. If you fit the profile of someone who would read this book, give it a try. If it isn't to your taste, shop around for another book and enjoy the wonderful medium of polymer clay.
