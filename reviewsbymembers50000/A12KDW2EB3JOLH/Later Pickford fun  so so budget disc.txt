 Although today Mary Pickford is mainly her known for her child roles, she was actually a versitile actress who alternated her parts accordingly. However, audiences of the time much preferred "Little Mary" to her more mature roles and so, to please her fans, Pickford concocted Little Annie Rooney and it was a huge hit. Pickford (then in her early thirties) plays the rambuctious preteen daughter of an Irish cop. The dirst act of the movie plays like an episode of Hal Roaches Little Rascals with Pickford's multi-ethnic gang battling fiercely with their rivals. However, there is trouble at home. Annie's older brother is hanging out with a grown-up gang, a groups of ne'er do wells who have pretentions of being big city gangsters. Meanwhile, Annie developes a crush on the big brother of her arch-rival.  William Haines is appealing as Pickford's "grown-up" love interest (Haines was 25 at the time) Pickford's leading mean in the teens were often stodgy and boring next to her spunkiness and it is nice for her to play against a leading man who is equally energetic. As is usualy for a Pickford film, tragedy strikes and she is forced to save the day in the nick of time. This is not one of Pickford's best films but it is a very good one, showing her doing what she did best, NOT acting her age.  The supporting cast is good although some of the ethnic stereotypes can cause some uncomfortable moments for modern audiences.  And Annie's father is forced to speak (via intertitles) in a distractingly Lucky-Charms-Leprachaun-style Irish accent. The climax is a bit too sappy but Pickford knew her audience expected happy endings and delivered accordingly.  These are really the only flaws in an otherwise charming movie. The same cannot be said for the disc packaging.  While the print quality is pretty good (though, as another reviewer mentioned, a scene is repeated for no reason) the soundtrack is highly inappropriate.  It was the 30's reissue soundtrack for the D.W. Griffith film "Way Down East" which, with it's themes of marriage and blizzards, utilized the wedding march as well as wintery tunes.  This was fine for WDE but it is just terrible when played along with Little Annie Rooney. Budget discs often cobble together soundtracks out of classical records and I would almost prefer it to this.  I can only suggest that viewers turn the movie music down and put on a CD or have a musical friend or relative play along with the movie. In conclusion, this is a fun, but not brilliant, later Pickford vehicle that delivers all the humor, sentiment and energy Pickford fans can expect.  The movie is better than it's packaging. BUY IT IF-  You're a Pickford fan             You like silent comedy             You want an entertaining, light, old movie YOU WON'T LIKE IT IF-  You're into heavy drama                        You don't like sentimental movies
