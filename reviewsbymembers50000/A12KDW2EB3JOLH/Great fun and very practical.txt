 This is pretty much the ultimate do-it-yorself knitters book. The whole idea is to give ideas that will spice up a ho-hum project and turn it into something amazing. I am a fairly new knitter and am progressing well but some projects are beyond my present skills and it is encouraging to have a book with easy, attractive details. I agree that the I-cord section alone warrants the purchase of this book but I am also partial to the embroidery section. These two chapters are interesting in that you can use them to beautify existing knitted pieces and possible be able to cover damage that would otherwise ruin a garment. There were some complaints that the book includes knit 1 purl 1 ribbing. I see nothing wrong with this as some newer knitters may not know this and since you have to start somewhere. This book is invaluable especially if you are starting to design your own knits. I am knitting a purse using techniques described in this book and I am already getting complements on it! New knitters: this book provides a fast, easy way for you to create advanced looking knits. Advanced knitters: it's a good deal of fun in the bargain. You simply can't go wrong!
