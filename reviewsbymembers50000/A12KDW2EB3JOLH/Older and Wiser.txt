 After having seen Mansfield Park (80's version) the latest Pride and Prejudice and Sense & Sensibilty we Austen fans were under the naive notion that all adaptations of the authors work were as wonderful. Therefore, we had no compunctions about laying out $ to purchase this  video. Good heavens! If only we had known! We should have guessed we were  in trouble with the tasteless "gothic scenes" which open the  movie. But like fools we plodded on.  Indication number two came in the  form of the female leads. They looked like they were refugees from Simi  Valley! The young actresses were either badly directed or actually were  from the Valley or the English equivelant. Indication number three was  the music. The other Austen adaptations featured lively piano pieces or  suitably tear-jerking melodies. This soundtrack seems to be ripped off from  the Young and the Restless. (Note to aspiring soundtrack composers: there  were no saxaphones in the early 19th century) We couldn't finish this sad  movie and returned it halfway unwatched. This is the worst Austen  adaptation (perhaps it ties with the 1995 version of Persuasion) we have  ever had the displeasure of viewing and can only warn clever Austen fans to  indeed avoid it like the plague. PS- the book is well worth the time of  any thinking person, enjoy Austen's delicious satire of Gothic romance.
