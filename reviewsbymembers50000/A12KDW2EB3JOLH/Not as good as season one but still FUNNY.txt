 It only took one episode to addict me to Jeeves and Wooster. This season finds our heroes once again in and out of scrapes, most of them matrimonial. The fact that some of the actors are different is alarming at first, especially when you watch the two seasons back to back but the replacemnts are very good and soon it does not distract at all. My two favorite episodes are kidnapped, in which Bertie is almost forced into a shotgun wedding and The episode in which Aunt Agatha tries to set poor Bertie up with a young lady who happens to be a confidence trickster. Of course, brillian Jeeves saves the day. The DVD offers no extras except chapter search but the quality of the picture is good and DVDs are very convenient. If you've never seen Jeeves and Wooster don't be afraid to take the plunge. It's a lovely bit of British humor.
