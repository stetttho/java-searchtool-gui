 I am not a particularly big fan of Deep Forest though I do enjoy a bit of Enigma. I found Mythos to be smooth and relaxing with a very slight touch of darkness. What is really most impressive is the sheer technical skill of the group. The guitar is flawless and the electronic soundscapes are imaginative. My only complaint is that occassionally the vocals interfere with the mood. My favorite tracks on this album are the darkly spectral ones like "Sirens" and "the Odessy" and the simple yet haunting ones like "Introspection" It took a few sessions in my CD player to absorb the delicious layers of music but it is now one of my favorite albums and I highly recommend it.
