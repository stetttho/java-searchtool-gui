 This has been one of my all time favorite movies for years and it simply has never been outdone before or since. This movie, more than any other version, captures the flavor ot the Robin Hood legend. Has there ever been an actor who captures Robin's saucy good humor like Errol Flynn? Could any other actress match Olivia DeHavilland's sweet but smart Marian? Has there ever been such a slinking, swashbuckling villain like Basil Rathbone. Warner Bros. knew a good thing when they saw it which is why this is one of several Flynn/deHavilland/Rathbone teamings starting with Captain Blood. Like most other movie versions, Robin is portrayed as a nobleman turned bandit to fight injustice rather than the peasant boy framed for poaching. Also, like most versions, this movie borrows heavily from Sir Walter Scott's medieval epic Ivanhoe. The Norman/Saxon conflict is lifted directly from there as is much of Prince John's plotting. The two themes, however, are melded rather seamlessly. Most delightful is the fact that unlike the other two famous versions of Robin Hood (the 1922 version and Prince of Thieves) this movie shows how most of the main merry men (say that 3 times fast!) were recruited. Not only are we shown the battle with Little John but also the rescue of Mudge the Miller's Son and the tricking of Friar Tuck. Flynn/Robin is a very good loser and this is maybe the most likable trait of his character. The dialogue fits in perfectly, over the top yet believable when spoken by the talented cast. "Why, you speak treason!" "Fluently" My only complaint is no DVD! If ever a movie deserved one this is it! The technicolor would be spectacular, the music gallant, and of course, I want to see some DVD goodies! I hope we will get one soon.
