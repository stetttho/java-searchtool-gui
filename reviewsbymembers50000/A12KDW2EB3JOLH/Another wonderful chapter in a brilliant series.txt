 This is the fourth DVD of the Adventures of Sherlock Holmes and it presents two of the best mysteries that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle wrote. They both succeed to varying degrees. The Greek Interpreter- The title character is abducted and forced to aid two villains who are torturing a Greek speaking man to get him to sign a mysterious paper. This was the only story where Sherlock's brilliant elder brother Mycroft is shown. (I do not know if he appears in other episodes of the series) Doyle's short stories are so short that all of the TV series episodes had to pad to fill out the hour running time and so this episode has a longer and much more drawn out ending than what was originally in the story. All around very good. The Norwood Builder- A house burns down and the fireman find a body in the cinders. They suspect a young lawyer who begs Holmes to look after his case since he claims to be totally innocent. But all appearances are against him and it appears that Holmes may finally have a case that is unsolvable. This is one of the best of the series, totally enjoyable. One note, I found that most of the DVDs in this series choked on my DVD player unless they are scrupulously cleaned and totally lint free. I don't know if anyone else has this problem, I have not run into it from other DVDs. However, the discs run very well in my computers DVD drive. Just a side point. This is a wonderful series crammed full of great acting and amazing set design, this is one of the best entries and I hope everyone will want to try it out.
