 ...you should know one small fact. This copy is ABRIDGED!   Whoever did it did not see fit to inform readers of this but the fact remains. Three whole chapters were cut from this edition. I totally agree that  this book is really great but I also like to know that I am reading the  whole book. Try to find an older edition, read it and see what I mean. It  will make much more sense
