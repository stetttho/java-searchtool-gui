 I saw this movie on TCM as it is unavailable on either VHS or DVD. This is a terrible shame since it is an absolutely classic adventure tale. I know that many people raise a stink about it being Imperialist but honestly, how can you expect a movie made over 60 years ago to forsee the values and opinions of US citizens circa 2000? Complaining about a 1939 movie with a mostly British cast being Imperialist is like complaining about an American movie made in 1942 being pro Ally, anti-Axis. The British Empire was certainly not wholly good but it also was not some sort of Nazi regime. Almost every Empire since Egypt started the trend has been part good, part bad with the mixture depending on who was in charge. The villains of the film are the Thugee death cult, a group of nasties who strangled and robbed for supposedly religious reasons (more probably, they just wanted an excuse to rob and strangle). No one liked them, for rather obvious reasons. The film opens in the late 19th century and the Thugee cult is being reborn under the insane eyes of a new guru. He wants to annihilate the British in India so he can start up his own empire. Standing in his way are three British soldier, best of friends, and their amiable water-carrier, Gunga Din. This movie combines action and comedy, more comedy than is usual. The funniest bits involve Douglas Fairbanks Jr.'s attempts to leave the army and get married. His two friends conspire to keep him there and use any means, fair or foul (mostly foul) to do it. I greatly enjoyed this movie. (No, I am not an old Imperialist, I am 20 and love classic films) and I hope that it will be restored and released on DVD. It is a rousing yarn and can be enjoyed by one and all if any political leanings are forgotten. Just set your frame of mind to 1939 and have fun.
