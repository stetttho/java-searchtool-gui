 Vas is one of the most beautiful and unique groups to come on the scene in a long time. I have no idea why people are trying to compare them to Loreena Mckennitt. Loreena has a very Celtic sound with middle eastern influences whereas Vas is almost entirely middle eastern with some african and classical influences. In other words, they are different and comparing them is pointless. Don't get me wrong, I love Loreena but comparing her to Vas is like comparing Deep Purple and the Beatles. Same genre, same country, totally different sound. This is Vas's best album yet. Azam Ali's incredible, pure, powerful, sensuous voice is displayed to perfection. She is a truly beautiful woman with amazing talent. She is backed by the best. Greg Ellis is an amazing drummer. I loved Ceremony of Passage, it really displays his ability. Here's my point, Vas is Vas. Just listen to their beautiful wall of sound and try not to compare. Let their music stand on its own merit.
