 First, a warning. This book has absolutely no frills. No patterns, no color pictures, just a lot of good kntting advice. Also, since it was written in the 70s, some of the knitting techniques are given different names than what a modern knitter is used to. For all this, the book is a wonderful addition to a knitter's library. It is a book of a "knitter's knitter", I agree that it is not for a total beginner. The basics are rushed through in favor of more advanced techniques. There is a wonderful section on ribbon knitting and a very well researched chapter on various yarns, their origins and history. Most of all, there is a section on knitting terms translated from other languages. Included are British terms, French, German and Swedish. This is a great help when dealing with the great number of wonderful knitting patterns available from other countries. (The very poular German magazine Rebecca, for example, though it comes with a translation booklet. Then again, if you ever lose it...) I consider this section a very valuable source. Last of all, there are many fascinating stitch patterns to be tried, two handed fair isle knitting explained (though other books explain this technique too) and tips on argyle knitting. The book is full of good information and you simply can't go wrong. Every knitter needs a good general reference book (or ten!) and this one is certainly going to be on my shelf.
