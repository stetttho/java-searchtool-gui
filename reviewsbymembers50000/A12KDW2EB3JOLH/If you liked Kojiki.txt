 ...then you'll probably like this album. I agree with the previous reviewer, this is closer to Kitaro's 80's albums. I'm glad of it since his 80's period is my personal favorite. The first track reminds me of the dramatic and then elegant opening of Kojiki. Kitaro's main talent lies in making dramatic music that is not over the top and romantic music the is not syrupy. Some of the faster tracks reminded me of the Light of the Spirit.  I have been listening to this album quite a lot since I bought it. (To the uninitiated Kitaro listeners: Kitaro is intrumental new age. He takes his influences from many countries but you can always feel the delicate Japanese sound of his music. His music ranges from soft, dainty songs, to dramatic scores that sound like they are from an epic movie to mysterious and sometimes menacing pieces. Note Crystal Sands on this album for an example of the latter.)
