 This movie is a light action/romance/comedy which manages to balance all of the elements well. If you have never seen a silent movie, this is a marvelous place to start. Valentino's preformance is charming as a "nice kid" who, after his father's death, becomes an outlaw. Matters are complicated by the fact that he has rebuffed the advances of Czarina Catherine the Great earlier in the movie. Matters become more complicated when he falls in love with his enemies sweet daughter. Matters become complicated still more when he takes a post as her French tutor in order to exact hsi revenge on her father. While all of the comedy is excellent, the throw away bits are the best such as when Valentino is about to give Vilma Banky a ring but then it gets stuck on his finger or when he adds a few zeros to the reward offered for his capture on a wanted poster. Wonderful, would recommend to anyone interested in classics and silent cinema.
