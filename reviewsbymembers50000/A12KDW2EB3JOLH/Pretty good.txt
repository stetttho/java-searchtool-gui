 In this album, Funker Vogt has shown a definite shift toward more complex, lush electronic background. But don't worry, it still has a BEAT! I wasn't too keen on Gunman but I loved the first 5 tracks otherwise. Nuclear Winter was a haunting song and the only one not really meant for the dance floor. Also, the vocals have toned down a bit but are still synthasized. The sometimes non grammatical lyrics did not bother me since they speak better English than I do German so who am I to complain? The CD seems to loose oomph during the second half so I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5.
