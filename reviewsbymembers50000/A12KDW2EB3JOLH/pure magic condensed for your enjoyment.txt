 Wow. I've been a fan of this miniseries for a few years now and it never fails to blow me away. The plot, the acting, the costumes, the perfect blend of satire and drama are enough to make a romantic of anyone. This is the movie that made and anglophile of me. The tale is a familiar one, the tempestuous romance between Miss Prejudice and Mr. Pride personified. Darcy and Elizabeth are a marvelous pair, likable but by no means perfect. The whole thing is handled with such taste and elegance that many modern movie makers should be ashamed of themselves by comparison. I cannot think of a single weak point in the movie except for this: It is addictive. I was sadly unable to watch the entire series in one gulp but I stayed up late many a night until I had watched every tape. The fourth one is the killer, it will literally mesmerize. In case you haven't noticed, i only liked this movie a little. ;-) Give yourself a treat and watch this smart, funny romance and fall in love with it yourself.
