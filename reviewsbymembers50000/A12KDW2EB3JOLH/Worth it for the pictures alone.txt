 The basic premise of this book is a mervelous one, compare history as it was with history as hollywood portrays it and show what it gets wrong and what it gets right. The book is made up of over half a dozen sections, one for each period of film history such as "Tudors and Sea Dogs" "Rule, Britannia" etc. This makes it easy to savor the book since people can easily skip to the period that they find most interesting. That said, the book is worthy of being read all the way through. The book focuses on movies made during the "golden age", that is 30's and 40's. There are a few modern films reviewed, such as Rob Roy and Braveheart. The book first shows the historical figure as he really was, usually from contemporary portraits and photographs, and then it shows the various actors and actresses who portrayed them. Fraser's witty commentary keeps things entertaining throughout with his comments on each film ranging from praise to marvelously catty contempt. (His reviews of Braveheart and Mary of Scotland are deliciously caustic, I laughed myself sick) Even if the prose fails to please, the pictures are worth the price of admission. It is very easy to spend lots of time browsing through the various incarnations of famous people. Also, this is probably a good book for history teachers to read before they decide to show a movie for class. I am glad to have gotten a copy before it wnt out of print.
