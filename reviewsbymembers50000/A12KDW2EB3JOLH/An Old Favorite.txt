 This album has been one of my favorites since I was a small child.  My family wore out our casette and had to wait for technology to catch up so we could upgrade to a CD.  Sylvia Woods (who was the 1980 All Ireland Harp Champion) is a talented harp player as well as a composer.  She has also written numerous books on harp intruction and harp music that are uniformally excellent.  The suite tells a fairy tale story about the power of the harp.  Sylvia's compositions range from spritely to heart-breaking.  This abum inspired me to play the harp, using Sylvia's books (of course!).  However, I highly recommend this album to anyone who enjoys celtic, world, or new age music.
