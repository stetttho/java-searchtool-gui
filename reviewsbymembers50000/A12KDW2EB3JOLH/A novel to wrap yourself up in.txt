 I have never read a Thomas Hardy novel and so have nothing to compare this to but I found Madding to be a marvelous love story. And what is more, it's a love story that you can actually believe because the characters are so human. The protagonist of sorts is Gabriel Oak, as nice a fellow as ever there was. He falls in love with the wild and flirtatious Bathsheba (she hates her name too, I think it was meant to be symbollic, as in David and Bathsheba) Of course, she will not even consider the stoic Gabriel and thus begins a career of flirtation and romance that will end in tragedy. Throughout it all, Gabriel is in the background, helping her when she needs him, advising her when she wants it but he knows he has no chance of winning her. Gabriel's character is a marvel. Even though he is a simple farmer, he has an artistic soul, it is clear from the way he thinks about stars, sheep, even toads. It sounds corny but he is at one with  nature. As for Bathsheba, I won't give away anything but let's just say she learns her lesson the hard way. Even though she is a coquette to her fingertips, you always like her and understand why three men would all find themselves in love (or infatuated in the case of one) with her. The books stately but never boring pace makes it ideal for a winter day when you are snowed in or something like that. I savoured it over a weekend and am planning to read it again.
