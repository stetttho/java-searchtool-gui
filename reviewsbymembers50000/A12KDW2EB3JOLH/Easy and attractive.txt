 This is my first electric tea kettle and I have to say that I'm in love. The water heats quickly, the kettle has a large capacity and the automatic shut-off makes it easy to see when the water is done. It is also a very nicely designed appliance (that's, of course, not a reason to buy kitchenwares but it is nice when they look good.) It's easy to run and the cordless feature (the kettle goes on a small hot plate) makes it very convenient to carry around. I also liked the strainer feature. I only have two problems with this kettle. It is a little bit noisy so don't be alarmed at the boiling sounds. The gauge that shows how full the kettle is is hard to read when the kettle is held at an angle, such as when you would be filling it under the tap. Other than these minor problems, I am enjoying this kettle greatly and, short of a power outage, I can't see myself going back!
