 I didn't catch this series when it first ran on TV but I was introduced to it whyen I rented some videos. This show has it all. Big name stars and directors, whimsical set design and (usually) some very funny comedy. My two favorites are without a doubt The Emperor's New Clothes and The Three Little Pigs. The first stars Art Carney as one of the con men trying to dupe the king in a way we are all familiar with. 3 Little Pigs has Billy Crystal as a pig and Jeff Goldblum as the Wolf. Goldblum is hysterical with his silly makeup and huge tail. It's a shame that this series has gone out of print since I am certain it would find new fans, especially with the upswing in the fantasy genre lately. If anyone is listening, why not re-release on VHS or (be still my heart) DVD.
