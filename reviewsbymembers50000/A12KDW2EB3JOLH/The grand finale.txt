 This DVD contains the last three episodes of the Adventures of Sherlock Holes series. As usual, the acting is wonderful and the setting is full of period flavor. Jeremy Brett in particular has really outdone himself in his portrayel of Holmes. Of course, even the weakest episodes in the series are still a pleasure but the three on this DVD are surely some of the best. The Resident Patient: Holmes is called on to investigate when the only crime seems to be a minor intrusion. However, things change when there is an apparent suicide. This episode delves into definate Poe territory with its opening nightmare sequence. The banter between Holmes and Watson is very good. The Red-Headed League: I freely admit that this story was one of my least favorites since I was forced to read it three times in school. However, the adaptation is very good and I was forced to rethink my dislike. Holmes is once again called to investigate what seems to be a non-crime. A mysterious League of Red-headed men forms and vanishes inexplicibly. The episode also features our first glimpse of Holmes's arch-foe, Moriarty. Not according to the book but an understandable addition. The Final Problem: Any Holmes fan knows what this story entails. To those who have never read the books, I shall say that the series closes with a real bang. Mariarty tires of Holmes's interference in his criminal affairs and goes on the offensive. The show ends on a literal cliff-hanger and as I write, there is yet no word on when the Return of Sherlock Holmes will be released on DVD. I do hope it is soon since I am ready for more! There is a complete DVD set of the entire series available. However, if you, like me, have been collecting the DVDs as they come you will find this disc a worthy completion of your Adventures set.
