 One word to sum up this book. Addictive. Totally, completely, amazingly addictive. I was up till 1:00 am because I HAD TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED NEXT!  It just gets better with each reading. The period detail is  fantastic. History teachers could certainly pick worse assignments although  be warned, you may stand up your prom date because as stated before  this  book is impossible to put down! Read it if you love any of the  following: History cool characters Love Swashbuckling Funny dialogue  Fiendish villains (The guy at the end gets the prize as nastiest villain of  ALL TIME) Read it, you will never regret it although your prom date  might.
