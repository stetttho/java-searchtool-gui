 I love this series a lot and enjoyed the first half of this particular mystery however there was a problem with the disc. This is a two disc set and while the second disc is correctly marked, it is actually a duplicate of the first disc! This is obviously a mistake in the factory but it is highly frustrating since it happened not once, but twice. It's quite frustrating to be left on a cliff hanger and then have the second half of the mystery be unavailable. By all means, buy this wonderful mystery but note that there are some defective sets floating around. I have ordered my third set and hope to finally see the ending. All I can say is, Buyer Beware, check both discs right away so you can return it promptly if you need to.
