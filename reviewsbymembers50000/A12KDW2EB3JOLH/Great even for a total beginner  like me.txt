 I enjoy ren-fairs and I love old style jewelry. This book was an impulse buy entirely. I have no experience with clay (beyond the flour clay I had as a kid) and none with jewelry making. I bought some clay and today I tried the simple pendant near the end of the book. It turned out beautifully! The author's simple advice and step-by-step instructions were a great help. The clear photographs helped me to see what I was doing. All of the pieces in the book can be basically broken down into just a few shapes: the main shape, small balls of clay and spaghetti like strands used to simulate filigree. The pieces are modeled in black polymer clay and painted with patina which makes them look antique with very little effort. If you like the raw look of ancient jewelry, or if you want to broaden your artistic horizens, this book will be a help and an inspiration. I am excited and can't wait to try another piece.
