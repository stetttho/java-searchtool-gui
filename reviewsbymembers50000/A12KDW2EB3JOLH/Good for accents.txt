 This book isn't as bad as it is made out to be. The designs are mainly good for accents, not for decorating your entire home with and I think that the animal pillows would be adorable in a child's bedroom. All in all, a good book if you have a room that needs just a little bit of zaniness. As a twenty year old knitter, I am more open to wilder themes. If you want some lovely afghans or some crazy additions to your home, then this is the book for you.
