 This is another don't-read-unless-you-have-no-social-life books. It will grab you by the throat and drag you into the adventures of Sir Oliver, the Cornish knight turned barbary corsair and his firecracker of a girlfriend, Rosamund. This is historic melodrama at its absolute best. The villains  are sympathetic but not so sympathetic that you want them to win. As a  character Sir Oliver is an amazing creation. His idea of warfare is to be  nastier than his opponents. Oh, and do not read in a public place, you  will find yourself exclaiming "BUT HE DIDN'T KILL HIM!"  "DON'T BURN THE LETTER!" "PLEASE, ROSAMUND, SEE THE  LIGHT!" That kinda thing. Loverly book, a must for any  action/romance/classic junkie
