 In Douglas Fairbanks's only color movie, we are treated to what is really a homage to boy's pirate novels. All of the elements are in place: the daredevil hero, the insidious villain, the amiable sidekick, the damsel in distress, saber battles, buried treasure, murder on the high seas, bloody duels on the beach, walking the plank.... The plot could have been from a Robert Louis Stevenson novel. Fairbanks plays a nobleman whose father is murdered. He swears vengeance and to gain it, he infiltrates the pirate ship. Plans go awry when the lovely Billie Dove shows up. (she was cast mainly because Fairbanks liked the way she photographed in color!) This edition features an orchestral score and a commentary on the making of the movie. I found it rather fun to see how Fairbanks worked at making his stunts perfect. As mentioneed before, the movie is RATHER more bloody than one expects in such an old film but it is by no means as gory as most modern action movies. (I would rate the violence between a PG and a PG-13) Other than the violence, there are no objectionable scenes, it is all mainly suspense. This was made at the height of Douglas Fairbanks's popularity and you can easily see how it influenced swashbucklers for years after. It's only a shame that the genre died out in the 50s. The certainly do not make them like they used to.
