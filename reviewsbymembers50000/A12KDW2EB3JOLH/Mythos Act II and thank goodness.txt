 I rather liked Mythos's self-titled first album and this is an excellent follow up/continuation. It has more electronica and classical elements this time around. Once again, the technical skill is wonderous and the arrangements are flawless. And again, only occassional obtrusive vocals (on Venice) detract from the mood. Vision 1 & 2 are great tracks as are Alchemy (with that marvelous dark undertone that Mythos does so well) and The Ring. Vision 2 makes you wish they would employ lyrics more often, maybe they will next time. Congratulations to all concerned on another superb CD. I look forward to their next effort. PS Mythos has some of the best cover art I have ever seen. It makes you want to frame the case. I mention this because the art on both of their albums is what made me buy them.
