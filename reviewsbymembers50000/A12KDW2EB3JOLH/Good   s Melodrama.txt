 Before starting this review, I think I should mention that I read the book before I saw the movie. This may or may not have affected my opinion of it. Leave Her to Heaven is an enjoyable (albeit over the top) melodrama of jealousy and fatal love. Gene Tierney plays a woman who will stop at nothing to keep her new husband all to herself. Tierney throws herself into her part as the ultimate femme fatale with obvious relish. In fact, whenever she on screen and wicked, the movie glistens. The two most famous scenes in the movie, and justly so, are the drowning scene and the fall down the stairs. Both are well directed and both are basically one woman shows. She richly deserved her Oscar nomination. The supporting cast is competant for the most part but none of them come close to Tierney's preformance and perhaps the movie suffers a bit from it. Also, I felt there that a lot of time passed between the introduction of Tierney's character and her first really wicked act. (It was more obvious in the book that she was diabolic) Still, in spite of it's short comings, this is a well put together moie and if your taste runs toward old fashioned melodrama then you will find this movie an enjoyable though flawed work that provides a decent evenings entertainment. Obviously, I will not include a laundrey list of instances where the book and movie differed but I do encourage everyone to try out the book, it is very good and gets more into the head of the jealous, lovely Ellen.
