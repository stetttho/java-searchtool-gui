 I must agree with the South Carolina reviewer below, the good Baroness has a monarchy fixation. "The CURS! How DARE they revolt against the good and wonderful French monarchy! Let them eat cake! ARRGGHHH!"  And  her prose is a bitty bitty bit over the top. SIR PERCY IS GREAT AND  CHAUVELIN IS EVIL AS WELL AS UGLY AS WELL AS STUPID!  Did I mention Sir  Percy is the best? Well, that said, this book has two things going for  it: 1- the compelling character of Sir Percy (NOT Percival like they say  in all the movies, JUST Percy) He's marvelous, demmed marvelous. He is just  so absolutely fun, you can forget about everything else. 2- The ending. I  won't give it away but it is SO cool!  Here's an interesting theory that  I must reveal to the world. Told from a different point of view, Citizen  Chauvelin would be the good guy. Think about it. The ci-devant aristos  who  are responsible for starving the peasants, raping the women, enslaving the  populace and growing fat off the land are escaping with the help of a  shadowing foreign spy. It's up to Chauveln, brilliant investigator to catch  him. Bottom line, if the Baroness had only allowed her characters to  stand on their own merits, there would have been a great duel of wills but  she is not satisfied at this, she has to force Sir Percy to win when it  would have been more interesting if he had struggled for it. Worth the  read if you like that sort of thing
