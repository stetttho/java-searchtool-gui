 I checked out this video mainly to see what the big deal was about Valentino. I had read that women slashed their wrists when he died. This is his signature film. This movie is a little strange to get into at first. The camera work seems jerky by modern standard but this quickly becomes unnoticable. The film quality is also a little grainy. This is an interesting film historically and what is odd is that I had trouble judging it by the same standards as other movies. This film is so completely strange, almost ethereal that it is quite absorbing. That's not to say it isn't corny. On the contrary, it was considered corny in 1921. The melodrama just adds to the otherworldly atmosphere. As for Valentino, he has a definate SOMETHING although I cannot see myself slashing my wrists for him in the near future. The movie had to grow on me, I still cannot say if I like it out of a strange fascination or if it just appealed to me because it is quaint. It doesn't really matter, I have not had so much fun with a movie in ages and I encourage people, especially one's who have never seen a silent movie, to try it out. Even guys seem to like it, the "jealousy" men had for Valentino (as described on the film's box) has faded over the past eighty years and they seem to find it just as interesting as women do. It does make you wonder, though, what will people in eighty years think about OUR male heartthrobs?
