 I have to admit that my thoughts about Fawlty Towers pre-viewer were, "can anything be THAT funny?" (I have rather a pessimistic nature) And the answer is yes, yes YES! John Cleese is at his hysterical best (in both senses of the word)as Basil Fawlty. He is a comedian who makes a nervous breakdown the funniest thing in the world. Then there is the marvelous Prunella Scales as Cybil, his wife and (as he calls her) his little puff adder. Andrew Sachs is great as the sweet but always confused Manuel (he's from Barcelona). And of course, Cleese's real life wife at the time and writing partner, Connie Booth as Polly who runs back and forth between the bickering Fawltys and usually manages to benefit herfelf in the process. The cast, as you can tell, is the reason it all works so well. For anyone who has never seen Fawlty Towers, it concerns the adventures of the staff and owners of the afore mentioned hotel. They have a talent for making a small problem into a full scale disaster until it blows up in Basil's face. And don't feel sorry for him either, he is a horrid person but a funny one. My favorite episode is also "The Germans" with Basil suffering from a concussion ordering Polly and Manuel not to mention the war to some German guests all the while doing impressions of Hitler and other insulting things. As the German guest put it, however did they win? The best tape in the set in the one with Communications Problems. It was the first one I saw and I nearly imploded from laughing so hard. This is the Sistine Chapel of sitcoms (quothe Entertainment Weekly) and you definately owe it to yourself to try it out.
