 This is a wonderful book for nailing down a charcter's appearance and their basic personality. I loved the thesaraus of noses, eye color, etc. The personality index can really be a motivational tool. However, the  facial expression section is at times simply laughable. "heart wrung  with pity" is simply terrible and "lump in one's throat" is  older than the hills. Avoid copying anything from this section. Another  complaint is the accent section, as the reviewer below pointed out. A  writer's book I once read said that accents are to be avoided "as they  are not read so much as translated". I completely agree with this  opinion. "Oi Loik to avoid accents, mite" All in all, buy this  when worrying about very general character creation, it can be a real help
