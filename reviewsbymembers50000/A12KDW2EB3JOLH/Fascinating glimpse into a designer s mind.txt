 First, I would like to clear up a few misunderstandings about this book. The author does not trash dime store knitters. She simply states that she finds them to be part of the folk art land scape. However, her constant admonition throughout the book is to buy the best you can afford. You can't cook a gourmet meal with bargain basement ingredients, can you? Also, swatching is an absolutely essential part of the designing process. (Some designers even go so far as to suggest dedicating an entire ball of yarn to swatches) A designer who does not swatch will never know the full potential of a yarn. This is simply a fact. If you don't like swatching (and I don't) the author offers alternatives. However, she makes her swatches so pretty that I am almost tempted to change my mind. The author offers her design system so that [novice] designers can borrow some or all of it until we come up with our own. The system is methodical and seems a great deal of fun. We find inspiration, find a yarn and swatch swatch swatch. I hope everyone will give this book a fair chance. Knitters are artists and artists are not helped by being thin skinned or afraid to try something new. AS noted by other reviewers, this book is not for the total beginner. You are expected to be knowledgable of basic knitting techniques as well as fibers etc.
