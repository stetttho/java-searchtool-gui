 I taught myself to knit entirely from books and this is one book that I used to get started. The sections are yarn selection, guage and the history of knitting are rather good and definately inspired me. The projects are about the best I have ever seen in a beginners book. There are only three but they are enough to teach basic knit/purl patterns, increasing and decreasing, knitting in the round and stripes. Rather than the usual garter stitch scarf (rather boring) we are taught a checkerboard pattern that is simple but looks challenging. This was my first ever project (I knit it on two skeins of Lopi) and no one could believe I was brand new! As to the technique debates, I HIGHLY reccomend that anyone endeavoring to learn from a book should buy TWO or more books on the subject. These need not be expensive, just get a second opinion. The reason is simple: everyone is wired differently and a diagram that may make perfect sense to everyone else may confuse some. Getting another book with different pictures is the best way to prevent this. For example, I could not get the long-tailed cast on. I tried several books and finally, a book on hats had the perfect instructions for me. I have not tried much crochet, only enough to complete my knitting project when needed, but I am sure that it is just as good.
