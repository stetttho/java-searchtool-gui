 The costumes, scenery and actors are all very easy to look at but I'm afraid that I cannot recomend this movie. The problem can be blamed entirely on the script. The actors try hard but there is only so much you can do. Half the problems come from the fact that the character's motivations do not remain consistant. For example, Robert's fixation for his aunt comes and goes. One minute, he's gazing longingly in her direction and the next he is threatening to turn her in for her "secret". The secret could be easily guessed in the first twenty minutes. Also, the characters display behavior very out of place for their time. When Lady Audley starts getting nervous, she downs an entire glass of brandy in one gulp. Fine. Then she starts knocking back brandy like a spaghetti western gunslinger in the middle of a party. Not so fine. I was so disappointed in this movie that I immediately read the book. It makes ever so much more sense and is a nice light read. I wish the script had been better since, as I said before, the cast is exceptional.
