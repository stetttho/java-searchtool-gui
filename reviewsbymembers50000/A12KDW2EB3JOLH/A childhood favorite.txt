 This book was my constant companion throughout my childhood and I had many hours of fun with the suggestions from it. This book teaches how to make costumes from houshold items, old clothes and the ever popular old sheets instead of from expensive materials. The book is well written, well illustrated and thoroughly enjoyable. Though I am an adult now, I still enjoy thumbing through it. I think every imaginative child (and what child isn't imaginative?) should have  a book of this type to inspire their creativity. A shame it went out of print.
