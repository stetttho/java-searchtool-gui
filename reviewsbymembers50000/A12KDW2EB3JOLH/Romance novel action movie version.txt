 Very true, movies do not have to follow the book word for word (in fact, sometimes it is better if they don't) Some scenes are better left out and so are some characters. Fine. So long as it is true to the overall "feel" of the book, I won't give a whimper. That said, I really did not like this movie. (I shan't refer to where it diverges from the book, I will simply judge it on it's merits as an epic.) The tendancy lately of period pieces is to take cliches long abandoned by their respective genres and thrust them into time periods where they do not belong. Examples you say? Glad you asked! Killing messengers. Left and right. And in very hammy ways. Giving the damsel a sword (as if she would want to use it, she'd stain her dress!) What was the point there? Graphicly showing all of the death scenes. Yes, I realize the middle ages were no picnic but really, there is such a thing as good taste and it is not exercised in this case. I really wanted to like this movie and I gave it a valiant try but it was frankly too gross. If blood guts and writhing in agony don't disturb, fine, whatever makes you happy. I just wish there had been some sort of warning. PS The Knights Templar were certainly corrupt (that is rightly portrayed in this case) but no more so than your average knightly order of that size. Also, it is generally accepted by historians that they were executed so that rulers could access their massive wealth more than for corruption or heresy. In conclusion, if this sort of thing is to your taste, I suppose you should go for it. For the more faint of heart, stick to the classics.
