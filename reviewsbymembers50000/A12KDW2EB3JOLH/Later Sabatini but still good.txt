 Rafael Sabatini was scoffed at by many critics of his day who did not enjoy his melodramatic historical novels but remained popular with the public. (Just goes to show that sometimes the public is right. His best working period were the teens and early twenties of the twentieth century during this time he wrote the Sea Hawk, Captain Blood, Bellarion and Scaramouche. His later books have not quite the ramantic charm but they are still quite a lot better than your average modern historic novel. The plot is basically a contest of wills on a south sea island between a French corsair who is defending a lady passenger and a rather nasty English pirate. The suspense is well portrayed and there is a rather good suprise ending. (It's not giving anything away to say that no one could forget the severed head scene) I found the heroine to be somewhat dim-witted at times but I really liked the hero, Charlie. The movie version of this book does not follow it at all (it only borrows a few characters names) so viewing is no substitute for reading the real thing.
