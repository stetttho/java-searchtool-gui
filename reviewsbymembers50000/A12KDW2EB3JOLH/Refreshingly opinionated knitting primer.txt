 There are a lot of knitting books being published right now with plenty of pretty pictures. This book is printed in black and white and is 17 years old, so why do you need it? For the simple reason that every page is filled to the brim with no nonsense knitting advice that the author has gleaned from her years working as a designer and instructor. If you enjoy chatty instruction books (and I do) then this is certainly a book to buy. This book covers most of the basics of knitting (as noted before, there is no section on intarsia) and along the way we are told anecdotes, tricks and cheats. The section on button holes is one of the best I've read and the author's summing up the chore (it's like getting a hippo out of the water, any way you can) is a refreshing change from "perfect every time" button hole instructions. I personally liked her suggestion to forget the critters entirely and use snaps. Without a doubt, my favorite chapter is the one on how to tell the structural flaws of a garment by how the model is posed. Coincidentally, I had received a knitting magazine in the mail the same day and I was able to apply the author's advice. Last of all, I liked the projects. I love shawls (though I am only in my early 20s) and with the peasant look coming back in style, they are once again viable accessories. The layette set is good for the basics and the author gives many suggestions on what to do with the silly thing when you are done if you don't have a child or a grandchild. I do not know if this book would be good for a brand new knitter (I am intermediate) but if you do decide to use it to learn I will say what I always say about basic knitting books. BUY ANOTHER BOOK. Always have two books on the subject so you can compare between the two, look at different pictures and diagrams, etc.  This is a fun and funny book and most certainly a favorite of mine.
