 This is most definately a book you have to wade through but Scott is such a masterful story teller that the difficult passages are worth the effort. Rebekah (I can't remember which way Scott spelled it so please bear with me) is a brilliant character, an intelligent and independant woman who uses her brain. Most modern books don't have as strong a female character. THe introduction to my copy says that the book is not accurate to medieval history and was not meant to be. The Normans and Saxons were symbols for the English and Scots. (Scott was pro independance) I don't know how true this is but it makes a good deal of sense. My point is, the strength of the book was not it's historical accuracy but Scott's brilliant characters. Rebekah and Brian de Bois Gilbert are my favorites hgandds down for their complexities but everyone has at least one good scene. (Except poor Rowena who really is a damsel in distress.)
