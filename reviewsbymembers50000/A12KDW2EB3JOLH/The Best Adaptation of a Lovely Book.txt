 I went into this movie with very low expectations, I was given to understand that it would be a rather dull, too 1960s, pseudo-epic. In fact, it is a dainty, intimate look at a woman and the three men in her life. Julie Christie's hair and makeup are indeed too modern but her preformance is marvelous. She is not afraid to show natural emotion even if it means looking less than glamorous. Peter Finch absolutely smolders as the spurned Boldwood. Terrence Stamp is a smiling rogue. The best of all, however, is Alan Bates as Gabriel Oak, the one man who truly deserves to win Bathsheba. Bates is exactly perfect as the nearly saintly Gabriel. His patience and love (but never priggishness) are perfectly translated. I adored the soundtrack of this film. Putting the song Bold Grenadier in when the gargoyles are filling Fanny's grave with water from the rainstorm. Wow. That was a marvelous touch and it really made the scene work. I know that the Masterpiece theater production version has a following and I like it well enough but I feel that this was the best version of the book. Compare both versions and see which one you prefer, I prefer the smooth going and brilliant preformances of the megawatt cast of this one.
