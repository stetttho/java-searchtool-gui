 This is arguably the lushest version of Robin Hood (although the Flynn classic is in the running) with enormous sets(some of the biggest ever made), lavish costumes and big stars. However, the name is a bit misleading. The movie is 2 hours long and Robin Hood doesn't show up until exactly half way into it. Before that, he is the Earl of Huntingdon who wears armor and prefers lance to longbow. In fact, the entire first half takes after the Scott novel Ivanhoe much more than the Robin Hood legend. If you know this before going in, you will enjoy the movie more. I kept waiting for Fairbanks to start the Robin Hood stunts. Enid Bennett is a pretty leading lady and wears her gowns with flair. Wallace Beery is a boisterous King Richard. (both also appeared in the silent epic the Sea Hawk, perhaps the best silent costume drama ever made and sadly unavailable for purchase)Sam de Grasse is an understated but insidious Prince John. Alan Hale plays Little John, a role he reprised for the 1938 Flynn version of Robin Hood. The plot involves Fairbanks being framed for desertation on the way to the Crusades, returning to England and becoming the bandit we all know and love. Once Fairbanks gets into his feathered cap and gets a bow the movie picks up considerably. He leaps, dances, prances and generally becomes a proper Robin. But before this is an hour of courtly love and stately processions. This is a good vehicle for Fairbanks but I think it could have been one of his best if it had more of the title character. But then, I suppose if I had one of the most opulent sets ever made at my disposal, I might show it off a bit too.
