 "I will study and get ready, and perhaps my chance will come." -with these words referring to how that encounter with President Kennedy affected him, William Jefferson Clinton starts the exposition on his life's work.  The books reads like a diary from Clinton's boyhood to right after leaving office, having served the maximum term for a US President. Clinton's recall of past friends/acquaintances is quite photographic - it seems he already knew that he would become important enough to publish his own memoir and needed to remember names.  Quite interesting is his evolving campaign strategies that took him from attorney general to Arkansas governor and eventually to President. In this field, Clinton has no peer. In fact, he frets more about his political mistakes like the car plate tax that cost him reelection as a governor, than his personal failings(the Lewinsky affair was treated more as a political failing than a personal one). Much vitrole is of course reserved for Ken Starr - the independent prosecutor whose appointment he approved to his deep regret.   All in all, the book is saved by its subject as it tends to drone towards the end. The reader has to labor just to get a few morsels of information but it's worth the effort. His insights on his successor proved to be prescient. Also pertinent are his thoughts on "Black Hawk Down" in Mogandishu, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and Bush vs Gore.   In the end, people would want to know what the first Baby Boomer president thinks and stays with him till the end of his story.
