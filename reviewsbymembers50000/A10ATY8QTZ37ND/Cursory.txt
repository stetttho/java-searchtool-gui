 The book can be characterized as Greenspan's testimonies interspersed with the authors' interpretation of Greenspan's words in the context of what really happened thereafter. Quite interesting are Greenspan's (and not the authors') take on the 1997 Asian financial crisis and reforming Social Security, quite relevant considering W.'s desire to overhaul the system.   If the Internet has not gone mainstream, this could have been a very good book, however, Greenspan's testimonies can be readily accessible in http://www.federalreserve.gov - and a reasonably astute reader can easily do the analysis and place it in the context of what happened thereafter which is exactly what the authors did. It could have been better if the book concentrated on the inner workings of the Fed. Some anecdotes inside Fed meetings could have gone a long way.  The book also has problems with the light treatment it gives to its subject. Case in point - though it mentions that Greenspan looks at key indices and meets with the Fed governors before coming up with his testimony, it never comes around to explaining how he does it in detail.  Overall, the "Greenspan Effect" may be a good introductory primer on the Fed but its lack of focus and detail plunges it to the ranks of all those futile attempts to explain every nuance of Greenspan's pronouncements and ending up where they started.
