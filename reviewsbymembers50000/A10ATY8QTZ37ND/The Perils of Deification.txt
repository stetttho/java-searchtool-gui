 It has often been the case that we tend to etch our hopes and dreams in the coattails of superstar athletes who exceed our expectations time and again. Each time, the bar is raised until the star is brought down to earth by these same expectations that made them stars in the first place.  Such is the tale provided by Michael Leahy in this definitive work on Michael Jordan's comeback with the Wizards. The account provides details from Jordan's start as an executive to his comeback and to his eventual firing (not unexpected as it first seemed).  Interesting details abound in this book in contrast to the droning sound bites found in newspapers who seem quite reluctant to call out the naked emperor. Examples include the true extent of Jordan's tendinitis, the effect of Jordan's injury to his right index finger plus Phil Jackson's thoughts on the comeback. Also, Leahy provides quite a convincing critique not only on Jordan the player but on Jordan the playing executive as well.  My only problem with this book is that it tends to get repetitive at times - Pollin's firing of Jordan and the Karla Knafel story is retold more than once. However, it stands on its own in chronicling Jordan's days as a Wizard which luckily for Jordan will always remain a footnote to an otherwise marvelous career.   Most of us would have considered that jump shot at Salt Lake City the highlight of our lives, but then again Mike still has more than half of his life to live.
