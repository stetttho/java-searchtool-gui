 Phil Jackson chronicles his "last" season with the 2004 Lakers starting from the training camp  in Hawaii to the day he was told that the team was taking a "different direction". Jackson the writer and basketball scholar comes to the fore in this book as he frets about the relevance of the 3-second rule as applied to today's big men, the officiating of Shaq, Duncan's ability to save fouls and the influx of high school kids to the NBA.   Interesting locker room tidbits include the extensively reported bathroom meeting between Jackson and the remaining threepeat members (Kobe, Fish, Fox, Shaq and Devean), Kobe and Malone's shouting match after practice and even some from the old Chicago dynasty which involved Jordan crying at a team meeting.  At the end of the book, the writer, obviously smarting from that Finals defeat, labors to explain what transpired and was very reluctant to accept that the Pistons' were indeed the better team that series. But I believe the point where the Lakers were doomed was when Phil found himself longing for his days with Dennis Rodman on the Bulls' team.  A very good read and stacks up the points for writer Phil but the jury is out on what it will do to the career of coach Phil.
