 Though much has been written about dot.com successes (Google, EBay, Amazon), few books have been devoted to the failures which I believe provide the more interesting stories.   I'm glad this book came along to provide us an inside look of a dot.com company(Value America) from its inception, near death, rebirth and inevitable demise from overblown expectations, mismanagement and intrigue which could very well be the stories of dot.coms past.   If you want to know why corporate graveyards are littered with dot.bombs then this is the book to read.
