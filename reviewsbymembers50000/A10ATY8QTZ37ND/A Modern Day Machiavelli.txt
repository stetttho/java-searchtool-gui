 Derogatory title notwithstanding, this book provides quite a lot of relevant information on Karl Rove - from his beginnings as a political consultant in a Democrat-dominated Texas (Though Texas has never been kind to Democratic presidential candidates, the vital state positions have been once occupied by Democrats) to his efforts to place Republicans in vital state positions and finally to painting the whole country red with the ascension of George Walker Bush.   Moore and Slater's Rove is a ruthless, take-no-prisoners political operative who often leaves beaten opponents appalled with his rough house political tactics. The book even devotes a final chapter scrounging through the rubble of fallen Democrats. Even John McCain, Bush's opponent in the 1998 Republican primaries was appalled at how the Bush campaign spun his adoption of a Bangladeshi as well as his POW experience in Vietnam.  Interestingly, this book says that Rove has never been finished college! He even simmered when Democrats blocked his nomination to the East Texas State University Board of Regents.  The high point of this book is its thesis on the Iraq war - a flagging economy, upcoming midterm elections and inability to capture a fugitive on a dialysis machine were spun so effortlessly by Rove that Democrats even found themselves voting for the Iraqi war resolution.  Indeed, in today's politics, principles matter not as long as you get a consistent message across.
