 This collection of stories from King spans several genres most notable of which are the vampire stories (Popsy, The Night Flier), human-eating frogs (sort of gives a new twist to the term "raining cats and dogs"), a hand in the drain which had me looking at the drain in my shower room, a city of famous dead musicians and his own foray into sportswriting in "Head Down" where he describes the exploits of his son's Little League Team in Bangor Maine (I think he's more than qualified to cover his favorite Red Sox).  What makes King's writing particularly effective is that he tells tales of common people(like you and me) experiencing extraordinary things. When you put this book down, you can't help but wonder if the same thing will happen to you. I also have the sense that these stories were written for the sheer joy of writing regardless if it makes the author a quick buck.
