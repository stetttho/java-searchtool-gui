 Tells the story of quite an unconventional family - the Pope's and all the sacrifices each member has to go through to do the "will of God" (Warning: You may be appalled upon reading what these sacrifices really are, one wonders how these events were allowed to happen in the Holy See). As with most Puzo novels, it has the puppeteer (Rodrigo Borgia aka Pope Alexander) that holds all the strings.  I give this book 4 stars because I can sense a deviation in writing style at the end owed to the fact that Carol Gino concluded this novel as requested by the dying Mario Puzo.
