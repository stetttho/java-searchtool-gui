 Author tends to jump from one topic to the other and tends to introduce too many characters at a time which is very hard for the reader to keep track of. Title says something about "Defending the Crown" but the book devotes a mere chapter to it. I gave it 2 stars as the topic is very interesting but book falls short on presentation.
