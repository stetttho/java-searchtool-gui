 Lazenby's book opens with the Bulls' heartbreaking playoff loss to Orlando in the 1994-1995 season followed by an offseason of introspection. What follows is a narrative of their record breaking regular season all the way to the championship. Each chapter tackles a key figure on that Bull championship team (Krause, Jackson, Kukoc, Rodman) interspersed with narratives of regular season games. Lazenby provides the reader with a behind the scenes look on that historical season - the different strategies Phil Jackson uses to neutralize Miami's Alonzo Mourning for instance. My only complaint about this book is that it could have used a lot less pictures and more anecdotes.
