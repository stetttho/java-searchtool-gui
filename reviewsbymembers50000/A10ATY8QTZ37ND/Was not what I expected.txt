 Though many think this book as a sequel to Matchett's first novel, "Life in the Fast Lane", its main thrust is instead Matchett's career path from a mechanic working in both Ferrari and BMW to the Benetton Formula One Team to his resignation and transition from champion race mechanic to writer.  It still contains some interesting anecdotes though from Nelson Piquet's penchant for farting when the mechanic rests his head on Piquet's lap to adjust the ride height of the car to Michael Schumacher's very photographic memory - he can give the chassis' behavior as the car enters and exits every corner of a race track. Matchett also quashes notions about Benetton having a 1st and 2nd driver - all cars are created equal from the chassis to its minutest parts. I was disappointed with the exposition as the author seem unable to decide whether the book is about his career path or an analysis of a Grand Prix event. Would have expected more analysis from him i.e. what he thinks of McLaren, Ferrari, who the best driver is, etc...
