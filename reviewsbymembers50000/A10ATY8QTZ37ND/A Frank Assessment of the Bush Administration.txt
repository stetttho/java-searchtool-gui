 In a strikingly chilling narrative culled from around 19,000 documents and interviews, Suskind removes the American media-issued rose colored glasses and paints quite an unflattering image of the Bush administration.  The book takes through different high level meetings as if we're perched on former Treasury Secretary O'Neill's shoulders as they discuss the direction of both America's domestic and foreign policy. From there, the reader gets an idea as to how the current administration really decides on critical issues where ideology constantly triumphs time and again over rational thought. In those meetings at least that O'Neill attended, only the how's are discussed to achieve the goal. Apparently, the decision making is done in higher level meetings in which O'Neill is never invited.   Suskind's story is quite convincing as it doesn't resort to absurd Bush-Saudi family connections but instead provides cold, hard facts. Furthermore, the primary source is from the Republican Party itself who may even have voted for W. in 2004! One only has to see the events unfold today to be convinced that these are the results of the policies discussed in those meetings - the much ballyhooed American withdrawal from the Kyoto Treaty, tax cuts, the Iraq War and now privatization of Social Security.   Suskind's Bush is surprisingly not the rambunctious type as described in other books but is mysteriously detached, aloof, almost Manchurian. Makes you wonder who is pulling this President's strings.
