 If you have enough money to buy only one book in Java then this should be it! Bloch's masterpiece consists of 57 tips which specifically delve on using the Java API THE WAY THE DESIGNERS INTENDED IT TO BE. In case you're wondering, the author is a Senior Staff Engineer at Sun Microsystems and was the one who designed and implemented the Java Collections Framework and the java.math.package.  I have been programming in Java for 5 years already and still each tip teaches me something new (I was actually surprised when Bloch mentioned that the hashCode method has to be overriden if you were to override an Object's equals method). However, you need to have programmed in Java for quite some time to appreciate this book as it will not teach you object oriented programming and the Java language constructs from scratch. It's quite a shame that the details he expounds on this book are in the Java specifications but are merely glossed over by the anxious programmer searching for that elusive Java class method to meet some deadline.
