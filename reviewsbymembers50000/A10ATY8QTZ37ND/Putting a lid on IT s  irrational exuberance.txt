 Carr provides a stirring indictment to the belief that IT brings with it the promise of competitive advantage. Instead, he posits that IT is merely a cost of doing business, cut in the same cloth as other innovations that once held a lot of promise like electricity and the railway system. Though no company can ever hope to operate much less compete without the above, its homogeneity and prevalence has somehow blunted its value.   The search for that elusive silver bullet has found CEO's bequeathing so much power to IT that a good number have expected it to rescue bad business plans. Carr mentions specific examples of IT's inability to mask business problems but rather makes them more apparent earlier.   One major point I find hard to believe is that the window of innovation for IT has closed. Though a lot of strides have been made, a lot of work is yet to be done. However, I fear that Carr would be proven prescient even seminal on this particular point in the short term. Though IT people continue to churn out the next line of killer applications, there is a danger that the customers may simply refuse to upgrade or purchase thereby sealing IT's fate as a commodity.  An interesting thought gleaned from the book is that IT (automation) frees people to do far more important tasks. However, what those important tasks are is not clearly defined. Granting that most tasks will be automated, it will lead to more unemployment, a surplus of products (assuming productivity rises because of IT), low prices and profits until the next new thing is discovered that will disrupt the balance once again. But this hasn't happened yet.  Though I don't agree with some of Carr's ideas, I believe it is good to read dissenting opinions on the future of IT.
