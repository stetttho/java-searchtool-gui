 Depicts Andrew Wiles quest to solve Fermat's Last Theorem (Last theorem in a sense that it was the last theorem of Fermat's devoid of a rigorous proof). Author takes the reader to the times of Archimedes, Euler, Fermat then to the modern day Andrew Wiles.  Singh makes an effort to make his prose understandable even to people with a high school mathematics background. Appendixes contains some simple proofs for those who want to know, less mathematically inclined readers can read on. There is no detailed explanation for Fermat's Last Theorem in the Appendixes though as I believe it is difficult to comprehend, nonetheless Singh tries his best to make the reader understand the gist of the proof. Definitely an interesting read.
