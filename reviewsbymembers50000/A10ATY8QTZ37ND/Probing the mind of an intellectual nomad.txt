 From riding helicopters to braving seasickness in a state of the art computer-controlled yacht, Michael Lewis gives us an insight into the mind of one James H. Clark - founder of Silicon Graphics, Netscape and Healtheon.  Unlike other tech moguls, Jim Clark is more innovator than businessman as he never sticks around quite long enough to reap the results of his foresight. Though his startups have made him a very rich man, it is the businessman who ends up running the company that has always reaped more (Wozniak vis-a-vis Jobs, Allen vis-a-vis Gates).  In retrospect Clark's attempt to induce an inflection point onto the old economy was a good one no matter how short lived. To this day, marketing people have always had their way with engineers. In reality, engineering genius may not always scale well in the market economy.  As always, Lewis' free flowing narrative is very successful in painting quite a complete picture not only of Clark but of the New Economy as well. This author has the knack for providing the reader insights not only on the subject itself but extends it to a far broader social context. Indeed, any subject that perks up this author's interests may it be baseball or Wall Street has always been a worthwhile read.
