 Consists of a journal by of a fictitious employee at Microsoft who moved on to greener pastures in Silicon Valley when the boom was at its highest. At the latter part of the book the reader finds himself/herself sharing their worries and aspirations. 5 stars for making me feel that I am not alone in having these reflections.
