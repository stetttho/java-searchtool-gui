 Author chronicles Jordan's first season on a playoff mission with the Washington Wizards, something which happened when this franchise was still known as the Bullets.  The book opens with Jordan sinking that picture perfect shot against Utah then to his foray as a Wizard executive, practicing with the Wizards players then to his experiences in the court with teammates not named Scottie or Dennis but Kwame, Brendon. Krugel paints a Jordan looking for that one last shot, that one last roll of the dice no matter how many times over he has beaten the house. I really loved this book for it gave us an in depth look of Jordan at his lowest point - from there you could begin to grasp how he won all those championships. The book also explains why there was a comeback attempt and why it ultimately failed. As proof, the author compares Jordan's best performance as a Bull compared to Jordan's best performance as a Wizard. In the end, it was Jordan's body that let him down but not his indomitable will. Though there were times when he could hold his own against a new generation led by Kobe, Pierce and Iverson, he failed miserably when measured against the standard to which all other future basketball players will be measured - his former incarnation.
