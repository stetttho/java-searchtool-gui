 In 1996, around 800,000 out of 1.3 million Americans survived cancer. Lance Armstrong was one of them (Cancer Statistics, 1996 CA-A Cancer Journal for Clinicians).   People are sometimes suprised if Armstrong quips that surviving cancer is far more difficult than conquering Alpe d'Huez. Advances in medical technology may have a lot to do with cancer no longer becoming a death sentence. However, this book comes along to remind us all once again, how cancer is the scourge that gnaws away at a person long before the actual, physical death.   Written in the first person account, this book chronicles Armstrong pre-cancer (at the top of the world) to post cancer (winning his first Tour de France). Jenkins along with Armstrong do a very good job in chronicling the different stages a sick person experiences - denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance (in Armstrong's case - recovery).  Most poignant scene in this book was Armstrong training after recovery and as with any other recovered cancer patient asking himself the question, "what now?". Of course, we all know that this individual goes on to win 7 Tours, others just go back to the office and resume working. Both equal triumphs of the human spirit.  Nonetheless we thank the subject of this book, a reluctant star, for becoming the face of cancer patients everywhere.
