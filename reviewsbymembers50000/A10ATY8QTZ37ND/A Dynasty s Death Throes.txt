 Three years hence, Buster Olney brings us back to that fateful Game 7 in 2001 which effectively ended the Yankees' 3-year championship run. Interspersed with the narrative are interesting backgrounders on each main character of the Yankee team - Steinbrenner, Torre, Jeter, O'Neill, Brosius, Rivera, Girardi and Knoblauch.   The Yankees that Olney describes in this book are a team with shared experiences from Torre's and Stottlemyre's battles with cancer to the loss of a parent for some team members. Particularly poignant was when Paul O'Neill returned to the locker room after the 1999 Series clinching game and realized that he could no longer call his father as he before Game 3. Shortly after, the door opened and in came Clemens, followed by Brosius and Sojo, all who have already lost their fathers comforting him.   In the center of the book is the Yankee's indefatigable owner George Steinbrenner who'll stop at nothing to build a World Series Champion. From that fateful loss at the hands of the D'backs, he relied less on less on the judgment of his executives resulting in a team of All-Stars which relied less and less of that team dynamic to win games but fell short of championships.   Though Olney may not have been aware of it, he has no doubt provided quite a convincing argument not only why Rivera blew the save in Game 7 that day but also why Rivera and ultimately the Yankees blew a 3-0 lead in the 2004 ALCS against the hated Red Sox.
