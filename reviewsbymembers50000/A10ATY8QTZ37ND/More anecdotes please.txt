 This book chronicles the different life stories of the prominent personalities of the F1 paddock - Bernie Ecclestone, Max Mosley, Frank Williams, Ron Dennis as well as some of the old members like Enzo Ferrari, Walker, Cooper and Chapman. Also chronicles the rise of Paul Stoddart, the owner of the Minardi Team.  Instead of delving on the inner workings of the Piranha Club, the author opts to present a collection of biographies of the more prominent members of the Club. There are some anecdotes on the inner workings interwoven between the life stories of the team principals(e.g. Schumacher's transfer from Jordan to Benetton, poaching of Minardi's chief engineer by Toyota, Frank Williams closeness with Ron Dennis) but they are few and far between.  If the author could have made these inner workings of the club as the main thesis of the book then it could have been a far worthwhile read.
