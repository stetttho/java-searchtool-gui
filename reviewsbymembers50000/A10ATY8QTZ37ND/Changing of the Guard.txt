 Talks about the dramatic changes brought about by the Internet in a world where adults are supposed to rule. Anecdotes range from a kid whose instincts in playing the stock market prove to be better than experienced stock brokers to a teenager whose legal advice prove more useful in the people's eyes compared to the members of the Bar. All these are possible as they compete in the ultimate playing field called the Internet.   Author then progresses from the Internet to the concept of change in general and closes with Bill Joy's article on Wired magazine titled, "Why the Future Doesn't Need Us" outlining the software guru's fear of change. In the end CHANGE of which the Internet is just one form is the ultimate leveller in any playing field.   Excellent writing indeed.
