 Through 90 compiled articles that span 30 years, McIlvanney takes us back to the time when the great prizefighters roamed the ring (Ali, Foreman, Frazier, Hagler, Leonard, Tyson, Lewis, Bowe, Holyfield). Also included are some memorable fights for top-ranked British fighters as well as his thoughts on the issues facing boxing then (and maybe even now) - ring deaths and the dearth of good heavyweights.  Like his subjects, McIlvanney pulls no punches. Here are some excerpts:  On the people who believed that Tyson carried Buster Mathis Jr. for a few rounds in one of his first fights after prison, he has this to say: "Anybody who believed that drivel about the set-up would lose an IQ competition with a plant". On Riddick Bowe as a possible contender who could give the paroled Tyson much trouble: "...But Bowe is handicapped by his ability to out-eat a squad of navvies" [ellipsis mine].  The only limitation I have with this book is that the articles consist merely of preludes and postscripts to a fight. This would prove no problem when the article is read in the context of a newspaper where events are fresh on the minds of the readers but when read by people who weren't even born during the time of those fights, there's that sense of missing the plot felt by the reader.   Still, McIlvanney's insights are priceless. Quite interesting are his evaluation of the heavyweights. Though it's a given that Tyson had talent, he refused to see him as Ali's equal which was proved prescient. Holyfield was what he considered a "synthetic heavyweight" - a good matchup for the 5'11 Tyson but cannon fodder for taller heavies like Lewis or Bowe. His disdain for Lewis who seems to be always one good punch away from a knockout, is also quite evident in the text.   All in all, McIlvanney tackles the sweet science like no other writer and boxing as well as his other favorite sports (horse racing, football) should consider themselves blessed that such a talented writer patrols the beat.
