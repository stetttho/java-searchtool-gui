 As with any book based on its far more popular movie incarnation, readers tend to expect the book to trace the movie's plotlines, deviating little from beginning to end. This book however is different.   Though the book traces the same plotlines, it reveals far more important backgrounds of each character such as how Dukoo became Sidious' apprentice, how General Grievous earned his "Jedi Killer" reputation and even how Obi-wan's lightsaber fighting style became the perfect foil for Grievous.   Also given extensive treatment in the book are major plot points which should have been further developed in the movie such as the seduction of Anakin Skywalker, the identity of Darth Plagueis' apprentice, Padme's involvement in the attempt to curtail Palpatine's power and the reason Yoda left the final battle with Palpatine.   All in all, the book fills all the gaps in the movie's plot lines to the point that I could even say that the movie was based on the book. A well spun dark tale indeed by Matthew Stover.
