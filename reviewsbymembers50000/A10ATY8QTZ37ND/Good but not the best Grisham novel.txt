 Tells the story of Patrick Lanigan, a lawyer who faked his own death and absconded with 90 million dollars of his employer's money to Brazil.  Novel opens with his capture and progresses through his skillful evasion of a variety of people who wanted him behind bars or wanted to recoup their money - the Feds, his former employers as well as the insurance firms who paid up as part of his life insurance policy. Adroit maneuvering was done with the help of his lawyer Sandy and lawyer-girlfriend Eva.  As the story progresses one gets the feeling that Grisham has stacked the cards too much on the heroes' side for Lanigan has every move by his pursuers anticipated and promptly parried.  The story is good but I would place it at a lower rung to his other novels (The Firm, The Pelican Brief, The Brethren).
