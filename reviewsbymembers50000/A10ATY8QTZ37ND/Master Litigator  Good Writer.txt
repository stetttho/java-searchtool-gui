 David Boies at the ripe old age of 64 comes up with a memoir different from the run-of-the-mill autobiographies out there as he concentrates on the most high profile cases he has handled  notably Steinbreinner vs MLB, US vs Microsoft and Bush vs Gore.  The book starts off briefly with his schooling days of which he doesn't dwell on too much and immediately proceeds to precedent-litigation he was involved in. As a side note, he reveals that a learning disability has actually compelled him to develop quite a photographic memory which has served him in good stead.  Though much has been written about the cases in this book, it helps to know what the lawyer (more often than not in the winning side) thinks as he was involved in it. Quite interesting are Boies' thoughts on the aftermath of the US vs Microsoft case as well as Bush vs Gore of which he devotes 3 chapters.   The writing style is free flowing and he takes great pains to explain lawyerese terms like "MFN clause" to the lay reader. There is none of the self-patronizing tone common in most autobiographies as he discusses matter of factly how he solved the legal problems of his client. One gets the sense upon reading this book that Boies would have never found himself defending O.J. as he not only defends his client but sees to it that justice is served.  Though the book is quite a compelling read in its current form, I believe that some cases should have merited a full chapter rather than a few paragraphs in the afterword such as Lloyds of London vs the WTC leaseholder Larry Silverstein. All in all, I wished he would have made the book longer!
