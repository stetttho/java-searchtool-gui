 Book opens with Schumacher's infamous collision with Villeneuve at Jerez in 1997 and progresses through the 1998 and 1999 seasons in his quest for redemption(At this point Schumacher never admitted to making a mistake but he admitted it on 2000). Of course we all know how it ended for Ferrari in 1998 and 1999.  Book contains interesting anecdotes about Irvine intentionally blocking Schumacher in Silverstone'98 which ultimately caused his title-ending injury and Schumacher telling Mercedes boss Norbert Haug that he didn't mind Hakkinen winning in 1999 for obvious reasons.  Have to give credit to James Allen for giving an unbiased view on Schumacher as I've always known him to be biased against arguably the greatest f1 driver of all time.
