 My Morning Jacket, the best band out of Kentucky since Days of the New, are finding not a lot, but some "mainstream" (and I mean that in the most alternative sense of the word) exposure with "It Still Moves". If you're not familiar with the band's sound, imagine 70's-era Neil Young with a good dose of the Band, and some early Dead and Van Morrison for good measure. "It Still Moves" (12 tracks, 71 min.) contains a quite a few excellent tunes, primarily on the first half of the album: opener "Mahgeetah" finds singer-songwriter Jim James sounding very confident, but also "Dancefloors", "Golden", "Master Plan" and "One Big Holiday", the latter getting ever some exposure on the radio (WNKU in Cincinnati, thanks guys!).  What keeps "It Still Moves" from being a truly great album is that it is WAY too long. At 71 min., it loses focus in the second half. Cut a couple of tracks, pare it down to around 50 min., and the album would have been much better in my opinion. The 9+ min. "I Will Sing You Songs", a slow song coming right after "One Big Holiday", the best track of the album, is an absolute momentum killer. Same for the 8 min. "Rollin' Back". That aside, there is of course a simple solution: your remote control! So I've pared down "It Still Moves" by a few songs, and love the album. I saw these guys open last year for Bob Dylan, and they put on a great set.
