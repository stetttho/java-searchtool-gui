 I bought Justin's "Justified" album for my daughter and as it turns out, Justin doesn't need *Nsync to be good. In fact, the album is quite an enjoyable listen all the way through (but that's for another review). The stand-out song is "Rock Your Body", and it is finally issued as a single (the 3rd off the album). With irresistable funk, the song just cries out for dancing. Come on over wallflowers! Anyone can dance to this! The remixes are less to my liking (albeit not bad), but the song deserves this year's "guilty pleasure" throphy, no question about it. Buy it!
