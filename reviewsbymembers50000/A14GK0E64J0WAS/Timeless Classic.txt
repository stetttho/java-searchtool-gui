 What can you say about the best of one of the greatest jazz combos, ever? This is about as timeless as it gets. And in remastered sound, no less. I'm not necessarly a big jazz fan, but I recognize great music, whatever style. The songs are from the 1959-1964 era, and include all the classics, including among others "Take Five", which remains as fresh today as it was in 1959, "I'm in a Dancing Mood", a live version of "The Duke", and "Blue Rondo a la Turk". I marvel at the genius of Dave Brubeck. My only regret is that I never I had the opportunity to see Dave Brubeck live in concert. Oh well... meanwhile I will do with this. Essential for any serious music lover, whatever your musical preference.
