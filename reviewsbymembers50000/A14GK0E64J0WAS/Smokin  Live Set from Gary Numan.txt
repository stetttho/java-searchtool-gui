 I had the good fortune of seeing Gary Numan twice on his "Pure" world tour in 2000-01. I only recently found out that there was a live album from that tour, and immediately ordered it, sound unheard. I was not disappointed! Gary Numan's critically acclaimed 'comeback' album Pure cast him in a somewhat new daylight, with lots more guitars and even darker sounds than we were ever used from him. "Scarred" (2 CDs, 21 tracks, 97 min.) brings the complete London Brixton Academy show from October 2000. The set starts off with a sizzling "Pure". While it is followed by the familiar "Me I Disconnect From You", the majority of the songs after that focus on the Pure album, with gems like "Rip", "I Can't Breathe", "Prayer for the Unborn" and "Listen To My Voice", but also a great "Angel Wars" (from the Exile album). "Down in the Park" is recast and sounds greater than ever, as is "Replicas" (check out that stomping intro!). The obligatory "Cars" is here of course, but it truly is not one of the better songs on here. Numan has moved on from "Cars" and he is (and we are) the better for it. The 'new' Gary Numan brings us an overall sound that's somewhere in between of NIN's industrial rock and Depeche Mode era-"Songs of Faith and Devotion" (another synth band that discovered guitars, but Numan brings yet more guitars), and it just works great. It's telling that the CD cover shows Numan with a guitar, as if to convery that this is not the same ol', same ol'. I also have the 1979 "Living Ornaments" live album of Gary Numan, and both that album and "Scarred" show Gary Numan at his very best. If you can accept the fact that 21 years after "Living Ornaments" Numan is not just about "Cars", you are in for a treat. Strongly recommended!
