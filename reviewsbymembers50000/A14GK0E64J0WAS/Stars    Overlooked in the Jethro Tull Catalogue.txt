 "Songs from the Wood", originally issued in 1977, is overlooked in the Jethro Tull catalogue. Perhaps this (very welcome) reissue (11 tracks; 53 min.) will reignite attention to this gorgeous collection. I hadn't listened to this album in probably more than 15 years when I recently saw that it was reissued in a remastered version, and with liner notes from Ian Anderson to boot! I knew I had to buy it. "Songs from the Wood" boasts no hit singles (apart from the minor Christmas hit "Ring Out Solstice Bells", which happens to be a very fine Christmas tune). It can be vaguely be described as a concept album, with songs celebrating life in the English country side. Musically, this album reminds me of the electric rock-folk of Steeleye Span and Fairport Convention, but of course with Jethro Tull's unique twist and Ian Anderson's instantly recognizable flute preminent. Stand-out songs include the title  track, "Jack-in-the-Green" (Anderson in the liner notes: "It was all played by me one rainy Sunday afternoon, I wrote the piece in the morning, had lunch, and beetled off to record it while the idea was still in my head. I think we even mixed it in the same evening. Wow!"), "Ring Out Solstice Bells" and "Pibroch (Cap in Hand)", the only "hard" rocking song on the album, with Martin Barre's guitar upfront, but with an equally mesmorizing flute solo by Anderson. This reissue comes with 2 bonus tracks: "Beltane" is from the same sessions, but not nearly as delightful as the original album songs. "Velvet Green" is a live version of the album track. If your idea of Jethro Tull is focused on/limited to "Aqualung", "Locomotion Breath" and the like, then "Songs from the Wood" is not for you. If, however, you are looking for a great album featuring Jethro Tull music, then by all means buy this! You will not be disappointed.
