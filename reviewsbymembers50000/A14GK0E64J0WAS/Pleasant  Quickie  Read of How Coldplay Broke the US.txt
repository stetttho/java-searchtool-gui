 I'm a big Coldplay fan, and when I saw this book at my local library, I just picked it up out of curiosity. The author, Gary Spivack, was a record label executive at Capitol (he's since then departed) and responsible for marketing/supporting Coldplay in the US.  "Coldplay: Look At the Stars" is Spivack's personal take on how Coldplay broke the US market, and in that it succeeds. He obviously had a lot of contact with the band, and that is where the book succeeds. My favorite part of the book is Gary's recollections on Coldplay's first American tour in February, 2001, for no other reason than I happened to see Coldplay in Portland, OR (the second stop in the US). You could just feel the magic in the air, a band that was about to make it really big.   The author doesn't spend a lot of time on how the band actually formed and where it found its musical origins, and that is the major failing of this book. Nevertheless, this is a quick and pleasant read. Spivack recounts his sacking from Capitol in early 2003, and how quick Chris Martin was there to console him (by phone). But for the definitive Coldplay story, we will  have to wait another day and another book.
