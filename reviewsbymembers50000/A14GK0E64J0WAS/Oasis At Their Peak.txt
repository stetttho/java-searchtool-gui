 Oasis in 1994-1995 issued 2 fabulous albums (Definitely Maybe, and What's The Story Morning Glory), yet that was only part of the "story": their many singles from those albums contained great non-album tracks. Belatedly, this album contains many of them, and they are an absolute necessity to anyone's Oasis collection. Many of those songs were (and in some cases, are) an integral part of Oasis' live repertoire, and for good reason: they are as good, if not better, than the regular album tracks. The highlights are many and include "Acquiesce", the intimate "Talk Tonight", the scorching "Swamp Song" (which started their concerts in the 95-96 era), "Rocking Chair", "(It's Good) To Be Free", one of their best songs ever, period. I didn't wait for the 1998 release of this and bought a bootleg CD simply called "The Non-Album Tracks" (prestine audio quality), the set list of which is mostly overlapping with this, but containing the essential "It's Better People", "Round Are Way" and "Bonehead's Bank's Holiday", which are for whatever reason not on here. No matter, this collection is just as superb, and an absolute must for any Oasis fan.
