 As others have pointed out already, this is the 3rd release of the European tour in 1972: Hundred Year Hall, Europe '72, and now this. The Dead at this point were a 'one drummer' band (Mickey Hart had temporarily departed). While hailed by many as being one of their best tours ever, it's really not my favorite (note that these are in any event all very subjective appreciations and observations).  "Rockin' the Rhine with the Grateful Dead" (3 CDs, 28 tracks, 227 min.) brings some spirited songs in the first 2 CDs, such as "Tennessee Jed", "Playing in the Band" and the cover "Good Lovin'", but the real attraction on this set is the 3rd CD, with a great "Dark Star"-centered jam that goes for about an hour or is followed by a "Not Fade Away"-themed jam, wow! I'd rate CD3 by itself close to 5 stars. As usual, the fine folks at Rhine did an outstanding job with the packaging of this set, although the liner notes are skimpy at best.  Another thing: I grew up in Europe, and I know for a fact that the Dead there were an almost-unknown American oddity. This comes out again when you listen to this album, as it appears there were very few people actually in attendance and applause is scarce at best (not that it matters as such or impacts on the quality of the music). In all, "Rockin' the Thein" is not a bad set, by any stretch of the imagination. But the band does not sound "full" and Mickey is missed IMHO. For my personal preference, I'm more charmed by the Dead 1974's "Wall of Sound" phase. For a great example of that, check out Dick's Picks Vol. 24.
