 Just a year after the "Green Album", Weezer returns with "Maladroit", 13 songs in 33 min. This album falters in comparison to the "Green Album" on several levels, the main one being it doens't have the same amount of great instantly addictive guitar riffs. That does not mean that "Maladroit" is a bad album, far from it. "Dope Nose" is a fabulous song, as are several other tracks, like "Keep Fishing" and "Love Explosion". One other thing that struck me about this album is the guitar solos that are preminent on several tracks, unusual for the band. Weezer is clearly in a phase of great creativity. Let's hope that they keep on rolling. Wouldn't you love to see another Weezer coming out in 2003?
