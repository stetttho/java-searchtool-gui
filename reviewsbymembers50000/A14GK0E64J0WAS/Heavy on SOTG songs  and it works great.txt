 "Live 17" (3 CDs, 198 min.) was recorded at a show in Portland, OR in July, 1998, a mere months before Phish would release "The Story of the Ghost", and showcases many of that album's songs (7, half of the album). It shows the faith that Phish has in its phans, playing that many then-unknown new songs to the audience.  Set 1's highlights include a very heavy and funky "Moma Dance", much better than the studio version on "SOTG" (it reminds me of Level 42), a great "Guyute" (check out the long instrumental outro), and the medley "Horn>Portland Jam>Chalk Dust Torture". The Portland Jam is a Pink Floyd-era Meddle-type, truly mesmorizing instrumental. After "Roggae" comes to an abrupt end, Trey complains he didn't get to do his 'cool guitar solo', so the band starts up again impromptu, giving him the solo he craved 'after such a long song', just great.   Set 2 is equally good, with a huge medley of "Limb by Limb>Simple (with great bass work by Mike)>Tweezer>California Love>Tweezer>Free", the band is really at the top of its game. After that, yet another new song ("Meat") before wrapping things up with a great "Harry Hood". Slapped at the end of this collection is a terrific funky 24 min. workout of "Bathtub Gin" from a St. Louis show a few weeks later. In all, this is a terrific addition to the great "Live" series.
