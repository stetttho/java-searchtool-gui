 This excellent compliation combines the best of the "10 Mistakes" (tracks 2 through 9) and "Back to 78" (tracks 11 through 18) albums, supplemented by 3 singles (tracks 1, 10 and 19). All but Track 1 are from 1977 through 1979. Considering that Gruppo Sportivo hit their heyday in the Benelux during the late seventies, it is amazing how enduring their music remains after all these years. For those not familiar with Gruppos Sportivo, think of them as a "cross of Abba, Dury and Blondie" (as they sarcastically describe themselves in the song "Blah Blah Magazine"). Others have referred to them as "Rock for Nerds" (think Weezer in the 70s.)  "I Shot My Manager" spoofs Clapton's "I Shot the Sheriff". "One Way Love" spoofs a bunch of Beatles song titles and sounds. "I Said No" spoofs early rock'n'roll. "Mission a Paris" is a fast-moving song about a non-French speaking detective's trip to (and misadventures in) Paris, just hilarious. Most of the songs are under 3 min., delivering their musical hooks, and then leaving you in the dust and moving on. After their first 2 albums, Gruppos Sportivo lost direction and really never recovered, although still occasionally bringing good singles (for their later work, see the "Married with Singles" compliation CD). Completely by coincidence, I happen to see them in concert while in Europe earlier this summer. What a fun trip down memory lane!
