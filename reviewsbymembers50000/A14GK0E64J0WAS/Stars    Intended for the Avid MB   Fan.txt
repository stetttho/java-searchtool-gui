 As a casual fan of MB20, I picked this up really cheap, and while this is not a bad collection, it certainly is not essential either, except prob for the avid MB20 (which I'm not). "EP" (6 tracks, 23 min.) is a collection of live, in-studio live and unreleased tracks. The best include "If You're Gone" and "Disease", both finding Rob Thomas essentially by himself with his accoustic guitar, and reworking well-know tracks quite effectively. I also liked the live version of "All I Need". The new song is "Suffer Me", a leftover of the "Mad Season" sessions; it is a good, up-tempo song, and makes me wonder why it didn't make the final "Mad Season" album tracklist. In all, "EP" is aimed for the MB20 fans, and in that sense delivers.
