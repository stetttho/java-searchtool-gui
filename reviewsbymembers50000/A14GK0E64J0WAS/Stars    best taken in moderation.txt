 Unlike many here, I come here without any comparisons to previous Rufus albums, as this is the first Rufus album I have bought, and then only accidentally. I heard "I Don't Know What It Is" on the sampler CD  included in a recent Paste Magazine (great music magazine, incidentally), and was blown away, so I purchased the album. "Want One" (14 tracks, 59 min.) starts off with a very intruiging "Oh What a World", with an unmistaken inspiration from Ravel's "Bolero" if you can believe it. Then follows the afore-mentioned "I Don't Know What It Is", for me the highlight of the album. The album's production is lush and rich, and it reminded me of eating Belgian chocolate: it's best consumed in moderation. There is simply so much here that after a while it becomes too much. Many tracks are good ("Vicious World", "Vibrate", "Beautiful Child" among them), and the closer "Dinner at Eight" is a nice way to close, with Rufus on piano, augmented by orchestra. "Want One" is a good album, but overlong. I find myself playing  3 or 4 tracks at one time and then again some other time another 3 or 4 tracks. Supposedly Rufus is thinking about issuing a sequel ("Want Two"). I'll probably end up buying it as well, and will play that one in moderation as well.
