 I heard this album played in a local book/music store, loved what I heard and bought the album on the spot. Imagine my surprise when I opened the CD booklet at home only to discover that the Thrills originate from Ireland! Not that it matters, but I would have never guessed it. "So Much for the City" (11 tracks, plus "hidden" track; 46 min.) can best be described as alterna-country (you'll find banjo's and harmonica's sprinkled throughout), with an Irish twist and a California splash (many songs deal with and are drenched in California). Opener "Santa Cruz (You're Not That Far)" sets the tone. "Big Sur" (another single) follows nicely. "One Horse Town" is the "hit" and signature track of the album, with the clever chorus "Well I Never Should Have Settled Down/Hanging Around in a One Horse Town/Does Nothing For Your State of Mind". Other stand-outs include "Say It Ain't So" (with nice vocal harmonies and a great steel guitar),and the closer "Till The Tide Creeps In". (Beware: there is a hidden track about 1 min. after "Tide" is over.) In all, this is a great album. Anyone complaining about the lack of quality music these days isn't looking in the right places. 2003 was incredibly rich with albums from (relatively) new bands like The Cooper Temple Clause, the Stills, the Strokes, Calla, the Thrills, Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, the Raveonettes, Kings of Leon, and the Music, just to name a few.
