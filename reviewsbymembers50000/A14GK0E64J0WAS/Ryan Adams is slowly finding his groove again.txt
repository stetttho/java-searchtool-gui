 I'm finally getting into Ryan Adams' second album of 2005, following "Cold Roses" which I found overall disappointing as a too calculated attempt to go back to the success of 2001's "Gold" album.  "Jacksonville City Nights" (14 tracks, 46 min.) is a an outright country album, and thus going back to Ryan's earliest roots of Whiskeytown. The album is pretty much a mood piece, and if you're in the right mood, this sounds great. From the opener track "A Kiss Before I Go", the country tunes sounds great. There is an interesting duet with Norah Jones on "Dear John". Other outstanding tracks include the somber "September", a deviation of most of the tracks. The slide guitar features prominently on here, check out for example "Games".   Ryan Adams has presented so many (too many?) facets of his talents: see Ryan do alt-country on Heartbreaker! see him do retro-rock on Gold! see him do 80's rock on Rock'n'Roll! see him do alt-rock on Love is Hell! see him do 60's rock on Cold Roses! While it might be disorienting, Ryan does put out a lot of quality music, and he surely is one of the most prolific artists out there. And before you get settled in, he's got yet another 2005 release coming, set for late December, with what is rumored to be a pared-down (just acoustic guiter or piano) sound on "29". Meanwhile, "Jackson City Nights" is a fine album, if the country mood strikes you right, and certainly a much better album than "Cold Roses".
