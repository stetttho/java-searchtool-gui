 This book came highly recommended to me by a friend, and I really enjoyed it. In a nutshell, "Brick Lane" tells the story of a Bangladeshi woman named Nanzeen who moves to London in an arranged marriage. After 10+ years of living life fairly uneventfully and raising her 2 young daughters, Nanzeen ultimately becomes involved romantically with another man, Karim, also of Bangladeshi descent. When Nanzeen's husband decides that the family should relocate back to Bangladesh, Nanzeen is forced to make a decision: follow her husband back to Bangladesh, or staying in London with Karim. Or is there a third option?  Monica Ali takes her time developing the characters, which works well actually. Nevertheless somewhat distracting in my opinion is the side-story involving Nanzeen's sister who has remained in Bangladesh. It takes up quite a bit of the book but ultimately has really nothing to do with the resolution of Nanzeen's life choices.   The book's inside cover points out that Ms. Ali herself is from Bangladesh and now lives in London. Obviously she knows what she is writing about, even though the circumstances of her move to London are presumably quite different from the fictional characters in the book. But it does beg the question what Ms. Ali will write about next, I mean, how many times can you approach the Bangladesh-to-London story? Meanwhile, "Brick Lane" is a very engaging book, and as highly recommended it came to me, I can now recommend it on to the next person.
