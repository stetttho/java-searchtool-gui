 After last year's very promising "Darts of Pleasure" EP, Franz Ferdinand now hits the big time with the release of their debut album. The band's sound invites comparisons to the Strokes and Interpol, but comes away very nicely with its own sound. "Franz Ferdinand" (11 tracks, 38 min.) starts off very misleadingly, albeit beautifully, with a very soft 45 sec. intro to "Jacqueline", with just guitar and vocals, only to then explode into the full band sound, setting the stage for the entire album. Lead-singer Alex Kapranos is very confident, without sneering. Stand-out tracks include the Hot Hot Heat-ish "Tell Her Tonite" (which appeared in demo-version on the "Darts" EP), and "Take me Out" (2nd single), which is the best song here, period, and rocks irresistably. Others include "The Dark of the Matinee" (3rd single), "Come on Home" (with even some synths up front), and "Michael" (set for release in July as the 4th single in the UK). In reality, there really are only a couple of less-than-stellar songs, such as "This Fire". Franz Ferdinand has ascended very quickly to the musical top in the UK in the past year, not unlike the Darkess, but are in my opinion far the better of the Darkness. I can't wait to see these guys live at some point. Meanwhile, this album is not leaving my CD changer any time soon! PS IF you were wondering about the band's name, FF was the Austrian duke whose murder was the immediate cause of the beginning of WWI...
