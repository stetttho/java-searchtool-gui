 The "Reckoning" album is somewhat of an oddity in the Dead's catalgue. It's comprised of many "traditional" tunes (such as "Been Around This World" and "On The Road Again"), and it's the Dead completely "unplugged", with Garcia and Weir only on accoustic guitars. The album creates it's own atmosphere, it's almost like you can feel them sitting in your room causally playing. Pulled from several shows in 1980, it shows a very different side from what most Deadheads expect, but you can just feel the *love* the band has for traditional and unplugged music. Garcia's guitar work is outstanding. In all, quite different from the electric "jams" we all know and love on Dead live albums, but a very nice addition to the catalogue.
