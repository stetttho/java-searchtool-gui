 R.E.M. is one of my all-time favorite bands. Or I guess I should say, was. I don't know when it happened for you (if at all) but for me somewhere around the late 90s R.E.M simply stopped making relevant music, "New Adventure in Hi-Fi" from 1996 being their last truly great album. Yes, I bought both "Up" and "Reveal" but admit to hardly ever, ok never, actually playing them anymore.  Turn back time to 1983, when R.E.M. issued its debut album "Murmur" (12 tracks, 44 min.). What a delight that album remains, 21 years after its release. From the opening sounds of "Radio Free Europe", the band comes with a unique mix of rock, folk, americana, and even some country, but it all blends just beautifully. You might even say the album comes with a unique sounds all of its own. My favorite tracks come in particular in the first half of the album, including "Pilgrimage", "Talk About the Passion" (like the earlier mentioned "Radio Free Europe" a small radio hit), and the pensive "Perfect Circle".  R.E.M. is coming to Cincinnati shortly, touring behind the new release "Around the Sun", which I admit is the first R.E.M. album in forever that I am not planning on purchasing. But I will go to the upcoming show. I hope that Michael Stipe & Co. will throw in some nuggets "from the old days". A couple of songs from "Murmur" would be perfect.
