 The notion that prog-rock Genesis would one day become a singles band, and wildely commercially successful at that, would have been unthinkable for fans of the band's first decade. But it did, and this complitation is to set the hits record straight. Or did it? "Turn It On Again: The Hits" (18 tracks, 78 min.) concentrates rightfully on the singles-heavy albums "Invisible Touch" (all 5 of its singles are here: Land of Confusion, Tonight Tonight Tonight, In Too Deep, Throwing It All Away, title track) and "We Can't Dance" (4 of its singles are here: Hold On To My Heart, Jesus He Knows Me, No Son of Mine, title track). That takes up half of the CD. Other hits rightfully included here are Abacab, Mama, That's All, and Misunderstanding. Beware: some of the tracks come in a (heavily shortenend) radio-edit. There are nevertheless a number of highly questionable tracks on here, and others missing. "Congo" was a 'hit', didn't you know? Me neither. "The Carpet Crawlers 1999" is a pointless remake of the 1974 classis (I guess any excuse to ask Peter Gabiel to join in, would do). Inexcusably missing from this "hits" compilation: Your Own Special Way (from "Wind & Wuthering", and the first Genesis single ever to make the US charts), Paperlate (major UK hit), Counting Out Time (from "Lamb Lies Down", and a decent hit in Europe), Man on the Corner (from "Abacab"), and It's Gonna Get Better (from "Genesis", a double A single with Mama). So a flawed compilation at best. The trouble could've been avoided with a 2 CD set (as Columbia does in the excellent "Essential" series), which would have allowed to include all the Peter Gabriel-era singles and essential tracks. Finally, with 18 years of hindsight, it amazes me how badly the "Invisible Touch"-era songs have aged. It sounded ok then, but now these songs just sound  bad, period.
