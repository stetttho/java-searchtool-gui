 Director Martin Scorsese undertakes the seemingly impossible taks of putting together the ultimate documentary of Bob Dylan's early career (1961-1966). As a long-time Bob Dylan fan, this documentary is riveting and shocking (in a positive way).  "No Direction Home: Bob Dylan" (2 DVDs) contains quite a few surprises: first of all, Dylan himself provides commentary in a clear and focused way, not at all as one might expect from an artist who mostly appears on stage aloof, if not disinterested. Second, the footage that Scorsese uses, is absolutely astounding. Check for example the various Newport Folk Festival appearances. While DVD1 traces the early years of Dylan's childhood, and gives a good musical context of which artists influenced Dylan, the real treasures are on DVD2, and in particular the footage from the 1966 UK and European tour. Watch how an exhausted Dylan towards the end exasperates "I don't want to go to Italy! I don't want to go nowhere! I just want to go home!" The documentary ends with the infamous "Judas" performance of "Like a Rolling Stone", which has long been available on CD, but now for the first time is shown on film. And amidst it all, Dylan the elder-statesman comments how sick he was of it all by then (mid-1966). No surprise then that he made such subsequent incomprehensible albums like "Self-Portrait"! Anything to be one step ahead of the public's expectations.  The DVD comes with a number of extra features, the best of which is a collection of 8 Dylan performances, including early TV performances, "Mr. Tambourine Man" from the 1964 Newport Folk Festival, an unfinished "I Can't Leave Her Behind" from his hotel room in 1966, and 2 more songs from the 1966 UK tour. The sound quality is surprisingly good throughout. In all, this should be required viewing for anyone-young and old--interested in music (and not just folk or rock). Outstanding from beginning to end! BUY IT!
