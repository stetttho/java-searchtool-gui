 Led Zeppelin has not been served well by "official" live recordings to date ("The Song Remains the Same" soundtrack, anyone?), but that has been corrected, for once and for all by this massive 3CD (18 tracks, 149 min.) recording of their 1972 concerts in LA and Long Beach. CD1 (10 tracks; 56 min.) is the most diversified of the set, with the band romping through a variety of classics, including a great "Immigrant Song", an electrifying (literally) "Heartbreaker" and "Black Dog" (which even live sounds terrific without the multiple overdubs of the studio version). "Stairway to Heaven" is not my fave Zep tune, but sounds great here. "Going to California" is gorgeous. CD2 (4 tracks, 53 min.) is centered around "Dazed and Confused", sounding better than ever in all of its 25 min., and John Bohnam's 19 min. drum solo. CD3 (4 tracks, 40 min.) is the lesser of the set, but contains a great "The Ocean". In all, this is a monumental and indispensable release, not just for the die-hard Zep fans, but for anyone casually intersted in Zep. To call this "Greatest Hits Live" is doing Zep an unjustice as the band was never about "hits" but in the end, this is what this album really sounds like.
