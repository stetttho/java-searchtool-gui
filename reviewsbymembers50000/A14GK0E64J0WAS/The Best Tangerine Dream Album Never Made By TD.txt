 I first heard a track from the "Hummel" album on the "Echoes" late night program on NPR and immediately knew I had fallen on a gem. As a big fan of Tangerine Dream era '73-'77, I keep hoping to come across more albums that display the same unique sound of "deep space" made legendary by TD (think "Ricochet", "Rubycon", "Encore"). Well, look no further. "Hummel" is as good as, if not better, than anything TD ever put out. Clearly, the "Hummel" album is a loving tribute by Spacecraft to TD.  The album starts of with "The Summon", a 15+ min. track that starts off slowly with an atmospheric guitar solo and eventually finding its rythm in a nicely-done sequenced piece. "Explorations in Space" is aptly-titled and reminiscent of the mood found on the "Spacecraft" debut album. The title track is without a doubt the best track on the album, another 15+ min. piece, more urgently and densly sequenced than "The Summon". What can I say, this is the very best you will find in today's "space music" genre, bar none. The rest of the album is very good as well, although it cannot match the outstanding quality of the first 4 tracks. Spacecraft is fairly prolific, and has issued several albums since, none of which have matched the quality of "Hummel" However, the "Cybersphere" album issued in 2001 comes very close and is in my opinion the true worthy sequel to "Hummel". Meanwhile, enjoy the deep pulses, sequencers and screetching guitar solos that will be reminiscent of that certain German space music pioneer band. "Hummel" is a 70 min. masterpiece of space music. By all means, BUY THIS!
