 Maybe you are like me who, after "August and Everything After" and "Recovering the Sattelites", have fallen off the Counting Crows' band-wagon as a result of the less than great (if not to say mediocre) albums "The Desert Life" and "Hard Candy". Well, our problems have been solved by this "greatest hits" album. "Films About Ghosts: The Best Of Counting Crows" (16 tracks, 72 min.) pretty much delivers on the premise, which is to say: all the hits and best known tracks are here. Rightfully, this compilation centers on the first album: 5 tracks from "August and Everything After", including the essential "Mr. Jones" (the song that put the band on the musical map), "Round Here", the exquisite "Rain King", "Omaha" and "Anna Begins". "Recovering the Sattelites" is represented by 3 tracks, including the haunting "A Long December", the hard-rocking "Angels of the Silences" and the title track. The later years have some good songs, including the jamming "Hanginaround", and even the cover of "Big Yellow Taxi", an unexpected radio hit. But the true treasure on this compilation is "Einstein on the Beach", which appears for the first time on a Counting Crows release. "Einstein" is a 1991 "demo" (but not sounding like a demo), which lead the band to getting a record deal, and is arguably Counting Crows' best song ever. Adam Duritz never sounded so upbeat again. Is this compilation perfect? No. For one, I like "best of" compilations to run chronogically, and this one doesn't. But that quibble aside, "Films About Ghosts" is a really great overview of Counting Crows' best songs to date.
