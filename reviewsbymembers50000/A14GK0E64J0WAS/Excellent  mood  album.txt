 Aqualung is the one-man band of Matt Hales (not to be confused with that other equally excellent one-man band Aqueduct). Aqualung's music is in spirit similar to Damien Rice and David Gray (with whom he will be touring in the US in early 2006). This is Aqualung's 4th album, and the best yet.  "Strange and Beautiful" (12 tracks, 48 min.) is a "mood" album all around. No upbeat tracks really, just mid-to-slow tempo songs about love, sorrow, hesitation, despair, hope, and life in general. Outstanding tracks include "Brighter Than Sunshine" (2nd single), with orchestral sounds added, "Good Times Are Gonna Come" (1st single), "Easier to Lie" (3rd single), and some understated gems like "Breaking My Heart" and "If I fail". But there is also a beautiful "Left Behind", which is the most 'rocking' track on the album.  Aqualung continues his rise with "Strange and Beautiful", as each album improves on the previous one. I cannot wait what Matt Hales has in store next, and I am really looking forward to his set when he comes to Cincinnati in early March, 2006.
