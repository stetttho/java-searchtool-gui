 Even though Michael Hoenig was only briefly a member of Tangerine Dream (and they never recorded a studio album with him), this album is an absolute necessary addition to the Tangerine Dream catalogue. Released in 1977, this album is completely in line with TD releases like "Ricochet" and "Encore". The sequencers are all over this album, and create a throbbing atmosphere. The key track is the opener title track, a 20 min. journey that ranks among the top Tangerine Dream output of the 1975-1978 era. For those looking to nowadays Tangerine Dream-like sounds, check out Spacecraft, which has issued some great albums in the late 90s like "Hummel" (see my review there).
