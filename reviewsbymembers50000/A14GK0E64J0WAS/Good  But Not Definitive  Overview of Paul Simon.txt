 This is the third (US-issued) compilation of Paul Simon, following 1977's "Greatest Hits, Etc." and 1988's "Love Songs and Negotiations". Did they get it right this time? "The Paul Simon Collection: On My Way, Don't Know Where I'm Goin'" starts of with CD1 (19 tracks, 79 min.) that gives a pretty good overview of the singles and best known tracks. One place they really missed the mark is with the 2 songs from "The Rythm of the Saints": where is "The Obvious Child", the lead-off single and a genuine hit? There is also one song from the Broadway disaster "Songs from the Capeman", and the last 2 tracks are from the under-appreciated "comeback" album "You're The One". The (limited edition) CD2 (5 tracks, 25 min.) is the hidden gem on this compilation: 5 previously unavailable live tracks: from 1973 comes a crisp-sounding "American Tune" and an absolute outstanding "Duncan"; also included is "The Coast", and in a tip of the ol' hat, the last 2 acknowledge the Simon & Garfunkel legacy, with nice albeit very different sounding versions of "Mrs. Robinson" (somewhat country-like) and "Bridge Over Troubled Water" (the latter a duet with Aaron Neville). In all, not a bad collection at all. The bonus live CD is really what will attract most Paul Simon fans. For an even better collection of his career, check out the 1993 European-issued compilation called "The Paul Simon Anthology", a generous 2 CD collection that rightfully gives 15 tracks to the "Graceland" and "The Rythm of the Saints" albums. Simply outstanding.
