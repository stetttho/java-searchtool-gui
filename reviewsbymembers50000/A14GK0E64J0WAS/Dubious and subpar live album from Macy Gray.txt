 May Gray stormed onto the music scene in 1999 with the very impressive debut album "On How Life Is". Things have gone downhill since then. Her subsequent 2 studio albums (2001's The id" and 2003's "The Trouble With Being Myself") failed to take off critically or commercially, and now, out of the blue comes this live album.   "Live in Las Vegas" (2 CDs, 18 tracks, 100 min.--please note that the track listing by Amazon as listed above is flat-out wrong) is a curious affair. It is not released by Macy Gray's label (Sony), but by some obscure label called NuTech. Furthermore, the release does not give any indication whatsoever when this was recorded, who was in the band, who wrote the songs, or any other credits. As to the album itself, it just doesn't cut it, and the performances are generally subpar (in particular the back-up vocalists are horrible). As to the few highlights, "Why Didn't You Call Me" is built around a Kraftwerk sample; "Do Something" sounds good as well, and Macy's breakout hit "I Try" also hits the stride. Note that all those songs are from her debut album, in fact 8 of its 10 tracks are on this collection.  Unless you are a die-hard Macy Gray fan, this is not a recommended purchase. Not only is the quality subpar, but the purchase price is pretty steep as well. Buyer beware!
