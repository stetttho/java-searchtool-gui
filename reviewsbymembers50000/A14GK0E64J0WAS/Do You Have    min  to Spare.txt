 Can you imagine what it must have been like for Julian Cassablancas (lead singer and main songwriter of the Strokes) to face the pressure after the acclaimed "Is This It?" album to come up with a new batch of songs that would prove the Strokes are not a one-album wonder? I can't, honestly, but somehow he did. "Room on Fire" (11 tracks, 33 min.) stays the same line as its predecessor album, and that is a good thing. Opener "Whatever Happened" sets the tone. "Automatic Stop" finds the band putting some reggae undertones in their sound, and it is the best track on the album. "12:51" (first single), with a tip of the ol' cap to the Cars, is so catchy that it's "barely legal". Other standout tracks include "Between Love & Hate", the band's first "ballad" "Under Control", and the hard-charging "The Way It Is". So many albums these days are overly long. Coming in at a crisp 33 min., the sound is tight all around and just doesn't let up. If it sounds too close to "Is This It", that's a good thing in my book. "Rooms on Fire" is excellent all the way through, with not a second wasted. Do you have 33 min. to spare?
