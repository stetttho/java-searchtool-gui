 This is the first, and best, single off of "Gold", Ryan Adams' breakthrough album. We all know and love "New York New York", the best post-9/11 song out there, period (even if written before). Given the more than suspect quality of radio nowadays, I sometimes wonder if "New York New York" would have made it big on the radio without 9/11, but no matter. The remaining tracks, which do not appear on "Gold", are top quality as well. "Marie Lisa" is Ryan solo on accoustic guitar, in one of his patented "love gone wrong" songs (which he seemingly can crank out at will). "From Me to You" also is an intimate song, which flows very well with the rest of this single. Finally, the single is enhanced with the video of "New York New York", which, as the editorial review above points out, is nothing short is haunting, yet a beautiful tribute (if unintended). By all means, buy this!
