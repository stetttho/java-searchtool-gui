 This 5 songs CD, recorded in December 2000 in Olso, brings us Coldplay in peak live performance. "Trouble" is a faithful version of the "Parachutes" track, wiht Chris at piano. The song remains one of Coldplay's better tracks. "Shiver" finds Chris at accoustic guitar. Because of the layered instrumentation found on the "Parachutes" studio version, this live version sounds quite different. The energy jumps out at you. Before starting "Sparks", Chris dedicates the song "especially to the guys that don't have a girlfriend", after which he starts questions some guys in the audience whether they have a G/F. Finally ("Do all Norewegians have girlfriends or are they just lying?" Chris jokes), he finds someone without a G/F, and Christ jumps in the song. At times, I thought Chris would not be able to reach all the heights of the tune live, but he did. "Yellow" gets the greatest applause from the audience, of course, but otherwise is a straight rendering, no more, no less. Before starting the last song, Chris asks for the audience's help to sing the last part of "Everything's Not Lost". Chris then takes a false start to the song, prompting him to start over. Coming towards the end of the song, rather than ending with a crescendo, we hear the audience repeating the last verses as the band is heard leaving the stage. Beautiful! This CD is a fantastic memento for anyone that's been to a Coldplay concert recently. For those not so lucky, it is a superb live record, period. Good value too: at 25+ min., it runs (almost) half of an actual concert (the show I saw on their recent US tour ran barely over a hour). Finally, the sound quality is superb as well. BUY IT!
