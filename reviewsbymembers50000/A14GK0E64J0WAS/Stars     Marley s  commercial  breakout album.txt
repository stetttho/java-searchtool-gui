 Bob Marley was making critical waves but not until the release of "Live" in 1975 did he also break through commercially.   "Live" (8 tracks, 45 min.) was re-released in 2001 with a remastered sound and one bonus track. The energy is bustling throughout, starting with the opener "Trenchtown Rock". The band is in top form throughout. This album of course includes the mega-hit "No Woman, No Cry", released as a single and enormously successful. But there are some other great jems, such as "Them Belly Full (But We Hungry)" and "Get Up, Stand Up". The bonus track, not found on the original (vinyl) album, is an equally outstanding "Kinky Reggae".   It is obvious that this is a milestone album in the Markey catalogue. But I still have to wonder why, to this day, the entire show of this legendary London July, 1975 concert hasn't been released. And in my book (which is of course a subjective feeling), the 1978 live album "Babylon By Bus" is even better.
