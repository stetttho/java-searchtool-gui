 It's taken Donald Fagen a mere 24 years to complete his trilogy of albums, started with 1982's "The Nightfly" album and continued with 1993's "Kamakiriad" album.  "Morph the Cat" (9 tracks, 53 min.) musically sounds pretty much like any recent Steely Dan album ("Two Against Nature" and "Everything Must Go"), or his previous 2 solo albums, and that's a good thing in my book. The title track opens the album and the lush production is noticeable. The best tracks for me are "H Gang"; the uptempo "Brite Nitegown" (which is what W.C. Fields referred to for "death", according to the helpful liner notes by Fagen himself); "Security Joan", and the outro-reprise (mostly instrumental) of "Morph the Cat". Less effective is "The Great Pagoda of Funn", which lacks focus and tempo, and at almost 8 min. goes on way too long.   While the overall theme of the album is looking at and dealing with death, this is not a depressing or downer album. In fact, much of the music is upbeat. In short, this is a most welcome return of Fagen solo. While not as accomplished as "The Nightfly", which really was perfect in every way, "Morph the Cat" is a very good album on its own, and highly recommended.
