 I admit I had not heard of Calla before but I saw these guys open for Interpol not long ago, and was simply blown away. I bought their second album "Scavengers" on the spot, and now their new album. "Televise" is not as dark as "Scavengers", and rocks more, which is when Calla really shines. The opener "Strangler" is one of the highlights, as is "Dont Hold Your Breath", "Customised", and best of all "Televised", with its drawn out and hypnotizing riffs. The comparison may not be really good but the band reminds me of how early-Cure might have sounded if they started recording now. I'll be interested in seeing how Calla evolves from here. Meanwhile, I am very content with this album, and can't wait to see them live again.
