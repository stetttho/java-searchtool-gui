 If you think that the glitterball 70s ever went out of style, well think again (OK, maybe briefly in the mid-80s, but hey, the 80s sucked!). The Scissor Sisters prove that point again with their delicious debut album. Yes, you can believe the hype, and the comparisons to Elton John (era "Rock of the Westies", George Michael (maybe he should listen to this and remember the fun and graet music he used to make), the Bee Gees, etc.  "Scissor Sisters" (11 tracks, 43 min.) starts off with 4 blazing tracks, all issued as singles (in the UK): "Laura", "Take Your Mama", the Pink Floyd cover "Comfortably Numb" (a text-book example of how to remake a familiar tune into something completely new and fresh), and the ballad "Mary", just perfect. The production is well-rounded and not over the top. The "A Side" ends with another pulsing track "Lovers in the Backseat". "Side B" is more subdued, but still has a couple of gems, like the rocker "Music is the Victim" and "It Can't Come Quickly Enough". The album closer is a guitar-fronted "Return to Oz", filled with regret and melancholy.  The Scissor Sisters are huge in the UK. I wonder if the New York band will find that same succes here in the US. Regardless, this is one of the best albums of the year. (And hey, they word-drop Cincinnati in "Laura", for no apparent reason, but it's cool.)
