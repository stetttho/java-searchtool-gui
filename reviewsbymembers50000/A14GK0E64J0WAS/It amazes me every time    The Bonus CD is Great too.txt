 When I first heard Norah Jones' "Come Away With Me", I wrote that this is why music is such a great art, and how you can be amazed by something new. The album remains a fave of mine, more than a year after it came out. This version comes with a bonus CD, and the question is whether it adds anything to the "regular" album. To which I say: YES! "Ruler of My Heart" is another one of those great mid-tempo tunes, with The Dirty Dozen Brass Band adding some great touches. "Cold, Cold Heart" is a great live version, a nice momento for anyone having seen Norah in concert. "I'll Be Your Baby Tonight" finds Norah in top form. "Peace" is Norah solo on piano, what a wonderful tune! Highly recommended!
