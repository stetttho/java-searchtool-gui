 I saw this book at my local library and felt compelled to pick it up. I have never done ecstacy in my life so I wouldn't really know the temptation or seduction of it.  "Rolling Away: My Agony with Ecstacy" is written by 25 yr. old Lynn Smith. She brings us her life's story, and how she got into the "party scene" in NYC after graduating from high school in a small Pennsylvania town. The best part of book is Lynn's description of her ordeal in the psych ward, with utter desparation setting in. Apparently Lynn became somewhat of a "mini-celebrity" afterwards when she shared her story with MTV and MTV turned it into a special on ecstacy. The book ends somewhat open-ended, with Lynn returning to NYC, and an afterword 3+ years later telling us that she is doing well. I would've been interested to read how she coped day-to-day.  Though not easy to read at times, this book is a powerful reminder of how addiction (of any sort) can destroy lives and families.
