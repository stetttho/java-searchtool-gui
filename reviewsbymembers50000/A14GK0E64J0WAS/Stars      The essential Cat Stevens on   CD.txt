 Cat Stevens has been compiled many times, starting with the "Greatest Hits" (vinyl) album in 1975. But this compilation is the best of them all, for a number of reasons.  "The  Very Best of Cat Stevens" (20 tracks, 68 min.) tracks Cat's career chronologically, starting with 1967's "Matthew & Son" and ending with 1978's "Just Another Night". The bulk of this compilation rightfully focuses on Cat's two multiple hit albums "Tea for the Tillerman" and "Teaser and the Firecat", which provide about half of the songs on this compilation. Among the other gems on here is the achingly beautiful ballad "My Lady d'Arbanville", as well as an unreleased track "I've Got a THing About Seeing My Grandson Grow Old", from the "Mona Bone Jakon" album sessions, really nice.  The liner notes are well done, as are the song and album credits. The remastered sound leaves no complaints. In all, as compilations go, this is about as good as it gets. If you're not going to invest in any individual Cat Stevens albums but are simply looking for a single disk overview of his work, this is the CD to get.
