 In 1997, at a time when Over The Rhine was in between labels, the band decided to issue this compilation for its "Rhinelander" fan club, consisting of live tracks, remixes, demos, and throwaways (the album thankfully is now available to not just fan club members). "The People Here Are Not Shy" is a remix of the "Till We Have Faces" album. "Hey (I  Do)" is a quickie ("written in 15 minutes on Sunday afternoon") that didn't make the final track list of "Patience", the second album. "My Love Is a Fever" is a 1995 live version of the track on "Eve", the third album. "Within Without" is an early, bluesier version of what would end up on "Eve".  The real nuggets are tracks 6 and 7, both outtakes from the "Eve" sessions that didn't make the album: "Last Night", an outright country tune, and even better, "Murder", a pulsating song with Karen's voice sythesized. Wow! Then there are a couple of "Good Dog Bad Dog" session songs in a different mix, including a great demo of "Lucy". "Miles" is the only true "new" songs, an accoustic guitar driven, uptempo track.  Finally, last but certainly not least, is what is perhaps the best song ever of Over The Rhine, the 13 min. live version (recorded in 1995) of "If I'm Drowing", a concert staple of the original line-up for years, where the band members leave the stage one after another (with Ric Hordinski's blistering guitar solo as a highlight), until only the drums remain and pound away. It must be heard to be believed and appreciated! This song alone is worth the price of this album. This compilation concentrates on songs of the first three albums, and in a strange and compelling way it supersedes each of those. BUY IT! you will not be disappointed!
