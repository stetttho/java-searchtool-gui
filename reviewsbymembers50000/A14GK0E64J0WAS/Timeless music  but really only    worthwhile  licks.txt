 There have been many, many Stones compilations, from the "Hot Rocks" volumes to "Jump Back" (recently finally officially available in the US), so how does "Forty Licks" compare? Not bad at all, as a matter of fact.  "Forty Licks" (40 tracks, 2 CDs, 175 min.) divides the output between the 1964-1971 era on the first CD, and everything after that on the second CD. There is no arguing with the songs on CD1, the better of the two. It's all here. What jars me a bit is that the songs are not presented in chronological order. It's a bit weird jumping from "Gimme Shelter" to "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction)" or from "Get Off Of My Cloud" to "Wild Horses", all great songs in and of themselves. CD2 contains the latter day hits, 16 of them that is. Mixed in between are 4 new songs, which frankly are all forgetabble and simply mess up the flow of it all. Hence, we really get not 40, but only 36 true timeless "licks".  That said, it is undeniable that the Stones remain one of the best bands around, still today. I saw the Stones again on the "40 Licks" tour, and was amazed again how great they are live. These guys simply refuse to age, don't they? This 2 CD collection is the best overview available of their entire career, even if it's marred by the sequencing and the unneccesary addition of 4 new songs.
