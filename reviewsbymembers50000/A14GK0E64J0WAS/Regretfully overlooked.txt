 After the mediocre 2002 "Red Letter Days" album, I was about to write off the Wallflowers as a one-album wonder (1996's "Bringing Down the Horse"). Not much has been heard from Jacob Dylan and his bandmates in the last few years, and now, without much fanfare or hype, the Wallflowers have released their 5th album.  "Rebel, Baby" (12 tracks, 50 min.) is a very nice surprise. I will admit that my expectations were very modest, following the ho-hum previous album. But this is by far the best Wallflowers album yet, apart from BDTH. The tracks play with cohesion, giving us a soundscape with touches from Tom Petty, Bruce Springsteen and even Billy Joel (and that is meant as a compliment), the latter particularly on the slower songs. Interestingly, the second half of the album is by far superior to the first half. After a delicious ballad ("God Says Nothing Back") with non-sensical lyrics (to me anyway), comes an all-out rocker "Back to California" that is the best track on the album. A couple of other 'ballads' are noteworthy: "From the Bottom of My Heart" is so beautiful I played it back-to-back-to-back several times when I heard it first, and also "How Far You've Come", in which Dylan is more a crooner than singer.  This album barely charted on the Billboard 200. I can't think of any radio airply for this album. Regardless, the Wallflowers march on and with "Rebel, Baby" make a strong musical statement. Highly recommended!
