 It was a long time coming but in a way inevitable that Eric Clapton would do an all-Robert Johnson cover album. Clapton is so immersed in the blues, his "From the Cradle" album but being one example. I was really excited about hearing this album. Ouch! "Me and Mr. Johnson" (14 tracks, 49 min.) faithfully covers 14 of Robert Johnson's known 29 tracks. The album gently rolls along with tracks like "Little Queen of Spades", and "Traveling Riveside Blues", both the better of the bunch. Yet something is lacking, I'm not sure how to put my finger on it, but maybe Clapton is covering the songs TOO faithfuly? There is a lack of excitement throughout, I don't know how to put it differently. It may be a completely unfair comparison, but for my taste I really enjoyed the recent Aerosmith all-blues album "Honkin' on Bobo" so much more! I would never question Clapton's integrity and commitment to the blues, but this album just didn't do it for me, sorry.
