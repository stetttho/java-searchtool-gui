 In 1973, Steve Harley and his band Cockney Rebel came out of nowhere with the "glam-rock" image and the superb (and not at all "glam-rock" sounding) single "Sebastian". (The premise of Cockney Rebel was not to use any electric guitars.) In 1974, the band issued its second album, "Psychomodo" and it speaks to the strength of the album that it is now being issued in a remastered version. The sound quality of this CD is impeccable. The songs on the album are almost all an instant classic, from the opening sounds of "Sweet Dreams", the singles "Psychomodo" and "Mr. Soft", the clever word plays in "Singular Band", the majestic "Ritz", the brooding "Cavaliers", the joyous "Bed in the Corner" and the grand finale in "Tumbling Down". What a collection of songs! I rate the album as such 5 stars. I have to deduct 1 star from the overall rating, because with a running time of 41 min., it is inexcusable that there are no bonus tracks whatsoever. Where are the singles B-sides? ("Such a Dream", the B-side of "Psychomodo", is one of the best Harley songs ever, and if you ever wondered where NIN got their inspiration for "Closer", look no further than that song!) Where is "Big Big Deal" (the excellent Steve Harley solo-single issued in Fall '74 after this album but before "Best Years of Our Lives")? Where are the live tracks? It's great to have the album remastered, but it's a shame the opportunities of CD capabilities are not fully taken advantage of.
