 When we last heard from Natalie two years ago, "Motherland" proved to be her major label swan song. Natalie has chosen to go her own way, not only in going truly 'indie' to issue her albums, but also musically. Subtitled "A Collection of Traditional & Contemporary Folk Music", it's Natalie's way of saying "please don't come looking for another Candy Everybody Wants". So ok, we get the idea, but the question is: is the new album any good? The answer is a resounding YES. "The House Carpenter's Daughter" (11 tracks, 50 min.) is a gorgeous collection of songs. Album opener "Sally Ann" is one of the standouts, with great violin solos. "Which Side Are You On?" follows very nicely. The album overall reminds me of Steeleye Span and Fairport Convention, so it's not a surprise that Natalie covers the Convention's "Crazy Man Michael", just beautiful. "House Carpenter" is the epic center-piece of the album, with great banjo work. Song titles like "Weeping Pelgrim" and "Weeping Willow" convey that there is a lot of heartache, but Natalie has not lost her sense of humor, witness the witty (and danceable) "Soldier, Soldier" tune. In all, this is wonderful album. It's become clear to me that with each subsequent album, Natalie strays further from the mainstream, with great results. No, you won't hear this on your localcommercial radio station. But Natalie has earned my trust that I can say I will buy a new Natalie album, sounds unheard, confident that she will surprise and delight me. I can only hope taht she will take this album on the road, often and loud... By all means, BUY THIS!
