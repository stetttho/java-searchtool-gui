 "Tickets for a Prayer Wheel" is a 10 track "EP" single, which at 44 min. playing time, gives us an album's worth of hits and misses. Built around the single "Within a Room Somewhere" (off of the "This Beautiful Mess" 1995 album), this is truly a mixed bag of some great and not-so-great Sixpence tunes. The single itself "Within a Room Somewhere", a great tune, is served up twice, in a Radio Edit and a Demo version. So far, so good. "Healer" is the best track, the upbeat Matt Slocum song that defines the Sixpence sound we all love.  After that, it's up and down, quite honestly, with several instrumentals, "Solomon" being the best of them. The 2 "hidden" tracks make me scratch my head, in particular the closer, which is some super-charged techno-beat track, unlike you'll ever hear from Sixpence ever again I'm pretty sure! This is a nice addition, but not necessary addition to the Sixpence catalogue. If you are a Sixpence die-hard (and you know who you are!), buy it. If you are not, go instead to their 1997 self-titled album, still their best to date.
