 I have read and heard about the Bravery being nothing more than a lesser-quality of the Killers, and I don't get it. Sure, there is a vague similarity of sound, but so what? I don't remember that when the Seattle grunge scene was big, everybody was saying "this band is a second rate version of that band". The fact is that many bands today are (re)discovering the glam 70s (see Louis XIV) and the new wave early 80s (see the Killers, the Bravery), just to name these. Have we become such music snobs that we will leave that stand in the way of enjoying good music? I sure hope not.  "The Bravery" (11 tracks, 37 min.) is the New York band's debut album, and starts off with the totally irresitable (and lead off single) "An Honest Mistake". I was afraid that radio was gonna play it to death, but it hasn't happened yet (knock on wood). Other great hum-alongs include "Swollen Summer", "Unconditional" (which is the second single, released in the UK), and "Public Service Announcement".   There is no great "artistic statement" on this album, just a bunch of fun songs, and done well at that. At 37 min., the album blitzes by in Strokes-like fashion, and you'll fing yourself wanting to play it again.
