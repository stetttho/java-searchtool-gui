 The 2005 Tour will always be remembered as Lance's last grand stand in the Tour de France, winning an improbable (and most likely never to be equalled record) 7th straight win. It made for great TV viewing (as I experienced it).  In "Chasing Lance: The 2005 Tour de France and Lance Armstrong's Ride of a Lifetime" (240 pages), author Martin Dugard brings us what it's like to live and experience the Tour day-to-day. The overwhelming sense I got is that it's a three week logistical nightmare, getting from one stage finish to another, and quite an exhausting feat at that. On that level, the book works quite well, as the author describes how it's like staging the SuperBowl... 23 days straight. As for the race itself, the book can never match the excitement of seeing the race, with all of its colors and the fans' excitement, on TV. Dugard does bring a great episode of standing along with the crazed Spanish Basques fans in the Pyrenees mountains. As for tidbits on Armstrong, Lance's dislike of Greg Lemond's comments (regarding Lance's possible performance-enhancing methods--which Lance has strongly denied) stick out.  As a race fan, I am looking forward to the 2006 Tour de France, even without Lance. The race will, for the first time in a long time, be wide open, without a clear pre-race favorite. That said, "Chasing Lance" is a pleasant read, but certainly not an "essential" read. For that, we'll have to wait for the definitive Lance-authored or Lance-approved book.
