 As a long time fan of Pearl Jam it is great to finally get the long rumored compilation of B-sides and rarities. "Lost Dogs" (30 tracks plus 1 hidden; 113 min.) is a redemption after last year's uneven and ultimate disappointing "Riot Act" album. I say this because "Lost Dogs" feels like another "proper" album, more so than a compilation. CD1 (14 tracks; 53 min.) starts off with one of the strongest tracks, the heavy "All Night", from the "No Code" sessions (it still remains my favorite PJ album). "Sad" and "Down" are almost as powerful, very good. Other highlights include "Black, Red, Yellow" (also from the "No Code" sessions), "U", and of course "Yellow Bedletter" the concert fave which finally gets released on album. CD2 (16 tracks plus 1 hidden; 58 min.) generally speaking finds a more laid-back, accoustic Pearl Jam at work. Again the highlights are many: "Fatal" (from the "Binaural" sessions), "Footsteps" (from the "Ten" sessions) and not the least several of the Christmas songs released previously as fan club singles: "Strangest Vibe", "Drifting" and "Let Me Sleep" almost feel like the band jamming in your home room, just great. The hidden track (about 5 min. after "Bee Girl" ends) is "4/20/02", Ed solo, lamenting the death of Alice in Chains lead singer Layne Staley that very day, hauntingly beautiful. In all, this is of course an essential album for any Pearl Jam fan, but I venture to say it's also very accesible to the casual fan, simply because of the strenght of the songs and the smart sequencing of the tracks. In the excellent liner notes, the band says there's lots more tracks like these in the vaults. Here's hoping "Lost Dogs 2" will see the daylight!
