 It's been almost a year since "Ohio" (21 tracks, including 1 "hidden" track; 91 min.) was released, and I'm still not tired of the album. It seems to me as well that "Ohio", and not "Film for Radios", is the album Karen and Linford were bound and destined to make. FFR is in my opinion a more adventurous album, but too much of a departure of the "classic" OtR sound. My favorite tracks on "Ohio" include "Lifelong Fling", "When You Say Love" "Nobody Number One", "How Long" and "Cruel and Pretty". And while I understand when Linford says they simply HAD to make a double CD album, unfortunately there are a few too many "just average" songs on here that keep "Ohio" from being a 5 star album. Anyone who had the opportunity to see OtR tour behind "Ohio" knows that they rock much harder live than what "Ohio" the album might lead you to believe or expect. OtR has just self-released "Changes Come" (13 tracks, 74 min.), a live album recorded on the "Ohio" tour last Fall. (This album is available only from OtR's website www.overtherhine.com.) All but 3 of the 13 tracks are from the "Ohio" album, and in a sense, this is a better album than "Ohio". Karen and Linford are awesome, but guitarist Paul Moak (unfortunately since departed from OtR) really smokes throughout the album, check out in particular his electrifying solo in "When I Go". Best track is the 9+ min. "Lifelong Sunshine", which is really "Lifelong Fling" seguing into a cover of Bill Withers' "Ain't No Sunshine", just superb! I rate "Changes Come" 4.5 stars. Most assuredly worth a visit to the OtR website.
