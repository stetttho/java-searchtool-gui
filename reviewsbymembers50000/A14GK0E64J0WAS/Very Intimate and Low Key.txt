 I happen to see Robert Deeble in concert not long ago, and he brought all new songs. He explained he hadn't done anything for quite a while etc. The new songs were quite nice, and I decided to check out some more of his music. Indeed, Deeble has not produce much the last 10 years: 2 albums, including this one, which technically is not even a "Robert Deeble" record. The group is "Days Like These", a trio with Deeble being the main creative force behind it. The self-titled "Days Like These" is a collection of songs from 1992-1994, which found their way on this 1997 album. Most of the songs are very intimate, and low key. The opening track "The Kiss" is a good example of that. On "Half Time Slow" Deeble brings some nice accoustic guitar work. "The Bridge" is one of several strings-heavy songs. Overall, this is an okay album, but at times I was ready for the songs to become a little more "heavy", which they didn't. This is a very relaxed, intimate, at times somber album.
