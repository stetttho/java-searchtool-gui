 After a 10 year absence (which feels like 20 years), Peter Gabriel returns with the proper follow-up to "Us". Being a long-time fan of Gabriel (I saw him in concert in a small venue in Belgium in support of his first post-Genesis album), I have to admit that this album at first threw me for a loop. Forget the instantly accessible "So". Upon reflection, "Up" is indeed a logical extension of "Us", minus the commercial songs on the latter. At 66 min. in just 10 tracks, the opener "Darkness" sets the stage: a long and complex structure starting very slowly, then bursting with sonic distortions. "Growing Up" is as upbeat as the album gets, with a drum beat that even wants to make you wanna dance, my personal favorite track on the album. After that, there are a lot of reflective, slower songs on here. "The Barry Williams Show", the current US single, is a reflection on Jerry Springer-type talk shows, and while good, there is no way this will find wide airplay. Which unfortunately says more about the state of US radio than Gabriel. In the end, I find this album quite good, but it requires repeated listenings to really appreciate it. At times I felt I was listening to "Art", instead of just music. Yes, the album gives pleasure, but no instant gratification. Which is not a bad thing.
