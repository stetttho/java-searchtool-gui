 First of all, I have not read the "Roaring Lambs" book to which this album is a companion, as I am going strictly on what I heard on the CD.   "Roaring Lambs" (12 tracks, 49 min., released in 2000) brings music of some of my all time favorite bands. The highlights for me are Over the Rhine's "Goodbye", an outstanding evocative song that would appear one year later on OtR's "Films for Radio" album (still their best album to date). Then there is Sixpence None the Richer's "The Ground You Shook", an introverted gentil song from Matt Slocum and Leigh Nash (this track would later be included on "The Best of Sixpence None the Richer, released in 2004). Then there is Bill Mallonnee & Vigilantes of Love's "Wondering Where the Lions Are", an excellent cover of the 1979 Bruce Cockburn song. Those three songs alone are worth the price of the CD as such. Other good songs are the contributions of Ashley Cleveland & Michael Tait, Steve Taylor (not to be confused with Aerosmith's Steve Tyler), and Burlap to Cashmere.  When this album came out in 2000, it didn't garner much attention, which is a pity. While there is some filler, there is a LOT of great music on here, punctuated by the last three tracks on the album, by Over the Rhine, Bill Mallonnee and Sixpence. You can probably get this for a few dollars in the used bin store or here on Amazon, and it's absolutely worth that.
