 Starsailor blasted onto the music scene with their 2002 debut album "Love Is Here", which even made some waves in the US, and their follow-up album was hotly anticipated.   "Silence Is Easy" (11 tracks, plus 2 bonus tracks, 47 min.) came out in 2004 and has largely been ignored in the US, regretably so. It is a better album that "Love Is Here", showing main song writer and lead vocalist James Walsh has matured. The album blasts off with "Music Was Saved", one of the better songs on the album. The other stand-out track is "Four To The Floor", an irresistable hum-along "disco" song that, say, George Michael wish he could make these days, just great. Also great is "Born Again", the next track. The album has 2 bonus tracks only available on the US edition, and they are good, although non essential.  The album is now also famous for having 2 tracks produced by Phil Spector (the title track, and "White Dove"), his last work before getting engulfed in the murder trial he's now facing. That aside, this album is a great listen all the way through, although it hasn't gotten the attention of US audiences... Starsailor is a band to be watched, for sure. Can't wait for what these guys will bring next!
