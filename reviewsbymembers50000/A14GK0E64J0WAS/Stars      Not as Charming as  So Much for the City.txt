 I saw the Thrills in concert here in April or so, opening for Phantom Planet, supporting their debut album "So Much for the City". I was quite surprised when I recently heard that the Thrills were already to release a new album. I mean, wasn't "So Much for the City" just out? "So Much for the City" indeed was released in the US only 10 months ago, but actually in May 2003 in their native Ireland, and by the time "So Much for the City" created a buzz, it was Spring, 2004.  "Let's Bottle Bohemia" (10 tracks, plus 2 hidden tracks; 42 min.) starts off with an electric guitar riff and crashes into "Tell Me Something". Current single "Whatever Happened to Corey Haim" follows, and it features strings, quite nice. But then as the songs flow, it is quite apparent that this is a more electric guitar driven album, and unfortunately the sound is not as charming as "So Much for the City", which featured more prominently the sounds of accoutic guitars, banjo and the like. The album is very well paced and before you know it you find yourself at track 10. Beware: about a minute after "The Irish Keep Gate-Crashing" ends, there are 2 more tracks, which are among the best on the album, check out in particular the beautiful instrumental to end the album.  "Let's Bottle Bohemia" is in and of itself not a bad album. Unfortunately, it's the follow-up to "So Much for the City" which came out of nowhere and charmed everyone to no end, and "Let's Bottle Bohemia" doesn't reach that same level.
