 311's quality of their albums is a dizzying up and down since their break-through (and best ever) "blue" album in 1995. Every 2 years a new album comes out like clock-work. 1997's "Transistor" was down, 1999's "Soundsystem" was up, 2001's "From Chaos" was down, and 2003's "Evolver" was (way) up. (I'm leaving out last year's "Greatest Hits" album).  "Don't Thread on Me" (11 tracks, 37 min.) continues the trend and, while not "bad" per se, it's definitely down from "Evolver". The album does contain a couple of good moments, including the title track, "Solar Flare" and the closer "There's Always an Excuse". But there are no truly stand-out tracks and there are unfortunately too many "lazy" songs that don't get anywhere. (And what is with the steel drums? Showing up in 2 tracks...)  As a live act, 311 remains formidable. I saw them again the day before this album was released, and they were outstanding. One thing that struck me is how great lead-guitarist Tim Mahoney is live, a monster really (and I mean it as a complement). But on "Don't Thread on Me", he is nowhere as prominent. As a long time fan, I'm already looking forward to the 2007 album 311 will release, which, if the trend holds up, will be just fab.
