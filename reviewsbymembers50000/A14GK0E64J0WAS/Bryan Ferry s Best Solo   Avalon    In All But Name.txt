 Roxy Music issued "Avalon" in 1982 and despite its broad  commercial success it was the last (studio) Roxy album. It became clear  why, when 3 years later Roxy lead singer and composer Bryan Ferry issued  "Boys and Girls", in all but name a straight sequel to  "Avalon" (the implication being that Avalon probably was far more  a Ferry solo album than a true Roxy album--comparions to Roger Waters/Pink  Floyd "The Final Cut" come to mind.) "Boys and Girls"  continues the dreamy soundscapes from "Avalon", mixing up more  upbeat, dance-oriented songs ("Don't Stop the Dance", "The  Chosen One" "Stone Woman") with slower songs ("Slave to  Love" (which was the lead-off single), "Windswept",  "Boys annd Girls"). And of course there is the short (1 min)  "bridge song" (here "Wasteland", like "India"  on "Avalon"). While the album covers no new ground, it still is  the best Bryan Ferry solo album, because the sounds are lush and deep, and  the entire album (clocking in at 38+ min) plays like one long dream-along  song. In this remastered issue, the sound quality is remarkably better than  before. The CD also contains the lyrics to the songs. Nevertheless I deck a  star from my rating because there are no extra tracks such as single  B-sides or live tracks and there are no liner notes. Enjoy the dreamy world  of Bryan Ferry, though!
