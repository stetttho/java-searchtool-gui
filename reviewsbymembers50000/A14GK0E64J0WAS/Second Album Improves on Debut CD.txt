 In 2003 Kings of Leon brought us "Youth and Manhood", an intruiging debut album. Somehow labeled the "southern version of the Strokes" (even though most of the songs of that debut album didn't sound like the Strokes), we now receive the eagerly awaited second album (which was released last Fall in the UK, where KoL are much bigger than here in the US).  "Aha Shake Heartbreak" (12 tracks, 35 min.) is a much improved collection than the debut album. The opener "Slow Night, So Long" is tentative, but then things start cooking with an excellent "King of the Rodeo" (with a tip of the ol' hat to the Cars' "Let the Good Times Roll", check out the hand-clapps, and the line itself). Other highlights include "The Bucket" (current single), which is an irresitable song, but also "Soft", "Razz" and "Four Kicks". The Followill gang sounds very tight throughout the album.  The entire album flies by with hardly a weak moment, a marked improvement over the "Youth and Manhood". Kings of Leon are coming to Cincinnati in a few weeks, and it's a show I'm really looking forward to. "Aha Shake Heartbreak" is a terrific album all around. Highly recommended!
