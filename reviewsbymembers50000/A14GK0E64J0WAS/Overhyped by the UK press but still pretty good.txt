 The Arctic Monkeys have rocketed to the top of the UK music scene on the basis on a couple of great singles, and when their debut album was released a few weeks ago, it broke the record of the one-week sales. NME declared "Artic Monkeys have delivered a Definitely Maybe" (referring to Oasis' debut album). Not so fast...  "Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not" (13 tracks, 41 min.) brings basically a great bar band delivering mostly up-tempo songs about the life of 19 and 20 yr. olds (which is what the band members are). Track 2 "I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor" is the break-out single and an irresitable 3 min. blast of great music. While the first half of the album staggers a bit, the second half truly takes off with the pensive "Riot Van", followed by the best track of all, "Red Light Indicates Doors Are Secured", a slightly reggae-flavored track that delights and delivers. Other stand-outs follow: "Mardy Hum" is a mellow singalong, and "Perhaps Vampires Is A Bit Strong But..." is the meatiest track of all. "When The Sun Goes Down" is the other attention-grabbing single, quite good.  In all, this is quite a good album. But to say that this equals the towering "Definitely Maybe" does disservice to Arctic Monkeys. Let these guys (kids, really) develop and let's see where they go from here.
