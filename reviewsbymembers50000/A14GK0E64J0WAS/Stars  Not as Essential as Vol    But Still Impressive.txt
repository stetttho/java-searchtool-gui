 On the heels of last year's excellent Bootleg Box Vol. 1 now comes Vol. 2, continuing to showcase Tangerine Dream's legendary live sets. Vol. 2 (7 CDs, 6hrs 24 min.) documents concerts from 1976 through 1983. By far the best show is Nottingham (11-8-76, 79 min.), picking up a mere 6 months from the last show of Vol. 1, it brings the classic line-up of Froese/Franke/Baumann in perhaps one of their best outings ever. Melodies take their time to build up, and when the deep synths, moogs and mellotrons fire up all cylinders, it's as good as TD has ever/will ever sound. The Washington show (4-11-77, 2 CDs, 109 min.) is also very good musically, but as it's culled from an FM broadcast, it's annoyingly interrupted on several occasions by the radio announcer. The Hamburg show (2-24-78, 52 min.) is the first post-Baumann show, and moreover features the Cyclone-era drummer and flutist/vocalist. I can handle the drums, but I cannot handle the occasional vocals, sorry. The Newcastle show (10-25-81, 2 CDs, 110 min.) is quite good, although by now the experimental live improvisation has left, but instead (with now Schmoelling in the line-up) is now more structured; fragments from "Logos Live" and "Exit" are featured in this set. Finally, the Frankfurt show (6-11-83, 35 min.) starts off as a somber tribute to the deceased German filmmaker Rainer Fassbinder, and then evolves into a preview of what we now know as the "Poland" set, quite nice. In all, this is a most welcome addition and logical sequel to Vol. 1, which will satisfy many Tangerine Dream early-era fans (like myself). This is definitely not for the casual fan. And if I may say so, let the "Bootleg Box" series stop right here, right now: 2 volumes, 10 concerts on 14 CDs, it's been great. Why not quit while you're on top?
