 I will be upfront about the fact that I am a music fanatic, so my review needs to be taken in this context. After a 12 year lay-off, the Rolling Stone Album Guide returns with its 4th edition.   First, the positives: it's nominally the 4th edition, but in reality pretty much an all-new book, as it should be, given the 12 year lay-off. Reading it now, it's good to see that recent releases such as PJ Harvey's "Uh Huh Her", the new Libertines CD, Jill Scott's "Beautifully Human", just to name a few, are covered. The writing is generally well done. Be aware, though, that many of the writing is very opiniated. For example, Weezer's "Pinkerton" is rated 5 stars, above all other Weezer albums. Huh?   That said, there are a lot of negatives as well, unfortunately. Leaving out certain artists is a judgement call, but as to certain oversights (such as Metallica and George Harrison) I must believe that is was an editing error (I hope!). Other entries are incomplete, for example leaving out Natalie Merchant's excellent 2003 release "The House Carpenter's Daughter", Rod Stewart's 2003 "Great Storybook Vol.2" or the seminal 2002 Stone Roses compilation "The Very Best of the Stones Roses".   In the end, this pales to the "All Music Guide to Rock", the most recent edition of which was released in early 2002, but which gets updated constantly on line. The "Rolling Stone Album Guide" may be ok for the casual fan, but for the rest of us, this is not good enough (even though many of us will purchase it anyway or have purchased it already, like myself).
