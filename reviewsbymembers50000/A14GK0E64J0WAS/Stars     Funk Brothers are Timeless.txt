 Music: 5 stars; Compilation: 3 stars.  As we know by now, the Funk Brothers, the 'back-up band' for countless Motown hits, finally got their moment in the sun when the documentary "Standing in the Shadows of Motown" was released some years ago. Following the success of that movie, the Funk Brothers (or what was left of it) started touring again, and I actually saw them open for the Dead a few years back, if you can believe that (true story, though).  "20th Century Masters: The Best of the Funk Brothers" (12 tracks, 38 min.) brings us a snippet of their overall musical output (at budget price, it should be pointed out). Found here are the instrumental versions of such Motown classics as "Come See About Me", "How Sweet It Is", as well as latter days "What's Going On" and, best of all, "Papa Was a Rolling Stone".   The musical importance of the Funk Brothers cannot be overestimated. This is not a bad album, but there's just not enough music on it, reason I cannot rate this higher. For a true measure of their music, check out instead the recently issued 2CD deluxe edition of the soundtrack of "Standing in the Shadows of Motown", a true 5 star album.
