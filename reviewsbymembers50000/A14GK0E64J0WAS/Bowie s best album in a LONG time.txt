 David Bowie's output remains surprisingly frequent. Only a year after the "Heathen" album" comes the latest, "Reality". The good news is that this album is the first Bowie album in a LONG time that is thoroughly enjoyable from beginning to end, and achieves a cohesion that lacked in recent albums. "Reality" (11 tracks, 49 min.) sounds like it could have been released in the "Let's Dance" era. It is full of arena-sized rockers. Opener "New Killer Star" immediately takes to you (reminding me of "Heroes"). Other highlights include "Pablo Picasso, "Never Get Old", "Looking for Water", and the title track. The piece-de-resistance is the almost 8 min. "Bring Me the Disco King", not the "disco" song you might expect, but instead a jazzy-like piano-based tune, reminiscent of Depeche Mode's "Death's Door". The only oddity on the album is the George Harrison cover "Try Some Buy Some", which sounds very close to the 1973 original and musically just doen't fit in with the rest of the album. I had the chance to see Bowie on the recent "A Reality" tour, and when Bowie sings "And I'm Never Gonna Get Old", boy, does he mean it! I mean, Bowie literally looks younger now (age 56) than he did, say, 10 years ago. Cool also that he still has some good songs in him, as this album amply demonstrates.
