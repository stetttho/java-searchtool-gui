 I have to admit I was very sceptical when I saw this release. I saw the Who last in concert in 1996 (on the "Quadrophenia" re-enactment tour) and wasn't too impressed, frankly.   "Live at Albert Hall" (3 CDs, 29 tracks, 162 min.) brings us the full benefit show from November, 2000. What stands out immediately when "I Can't Explain" kicks off CD1 is how reinvigerated the band sounds, in particular the bass playing of John Entwistle. The band simply is in great form that evening. Other highlights on CD1 are "Relay", "The Kids Are Alright" and "Who Are You". CD2 is more risky, with all the guest stars (this is a benefit show, after all). I really don't understand or like Bryan Adams on "Behind Blue Eyes", I mean, Bryan Adams on the same stage as the Who? c'mon on! Other guest spots work much better, such as Paul Weller on "So Sad About Us", Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder on "I'm One" and the Stereophonics' Kelly Jones on "Substitute". But the real highlight of CD2 is a 12 min. workout of "5:15", check out the bass solo from Entwistle! The bonus CD brings us 4 songs from the February, 2002 show at the Royal Albert Hall, the last show of the band with Entwistle, and a must for that reason alone.  I personally was appalled that the 2002 US tour went on, a mere days after the passing of Entwistle. When can you say 'enough is enough'? Meanwhile, "Live at Royal Albert Hall" is a very strong live album, highly recommended!
