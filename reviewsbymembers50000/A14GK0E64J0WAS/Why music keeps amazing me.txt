 Do you know where Norah Jones was 12 months, or even 6 months ago? I don't either. Once or twice a year an album comes along, out of the blue, that just blows you away. It's what makes music such a great art. "Come Away With Me" is one of those albums. Don't be scared by the "jazzy" label people throw on Norah Jones. This simply is a collection 14 songs, 45 min., of beautifully polished and intimate songs. The best songs on the album are the opener "Don't Know Why", the Hank Williams cover "Cold Cold Heart", the title track (one of the Norah Jones-penned tracks), and "Painter Song" (one of several songs by bassist (and beau) Lee Alexander). If you like to be surprised, or if you simply like great music, whatever style, then by all means buy this! You won't regret it.
