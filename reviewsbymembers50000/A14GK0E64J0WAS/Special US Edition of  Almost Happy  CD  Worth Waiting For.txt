 "Almost Happy" is K's Choice 4th studio album, which was issued in Fall 1999 in Europe, but remained off the US market, until now. K's Choice following in the US has dimished from the glory days of "Not An Addict" in the mid-90s, but its musical qualities cannot be doubted. "Almost Happy" finds Sarah and Gert Bettens in fine form. Sounding relaxed and unhurried, the songs are mostly reflective in nature. The opening track (and first single) is the uptempo "Another Year", which leads into other outstanding tunes like the title track (also a single), "My Head", "Somehwere" and later on "Busy" (also a single). The US edition of the album comes with an extra live disc, which essentially pulls the best tracks of the double "Live" CD that was issued in Europe last December. It is a veritable "Greatest Hits Live" CD, covering all of their best known songs, including of course Not An Addict, but also Mr. Freeze, Cocoon Crash, Breakfast, Winter, If You're Not Scared, Everything For Free, Believe, Hide, and others. Except for "My Head" (the single currently out in Europe), there is no overlap among the studio and the live tracks. Finally, please note that the cover work for the US Edition of "Almost Happy" is completely different from the European version. This is only fitting, to reflect the generous extra live CD. Belgium's best band shines on both the sudio and the live set. I hope they can find a spot on US radios again!
