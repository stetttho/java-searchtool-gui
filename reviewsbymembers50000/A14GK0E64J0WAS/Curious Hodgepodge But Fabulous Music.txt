 Music: 4.5 stars... Compilation: 3.5 Stars  There are a lot of Jackson 5/Jacksons compilations available, so the question is where does this one stack up? The answer is, not bad at all, but not the greatest either.  "The Jacksons Story" (20 tracks, 78 min.) tries to compile the Jackson 5/Jacksons in a single CD, and what a difficult task that is! The album starts off with the true-and-tried earliest Jackson 5 hits (such as "ABC", "I Want You Back" etc.), in remarkable remastered sound. It then jumps to Michael's earliest solo hits such as "Ben" and "Got to Be There". After that we go to the awkward mid-70s period, which for no apparent reason also includes Jermaine Jackson's only bona fide hit (1980's "Let's Get Serious", a great song actually), before we get to the late 70's streak of great Jacksons hits, including "Blame it on the Boogie", "Shake Your Body", "Lovely One" etc. Inexplicably absent from this compilation is "State of Shock", the huge hit featuring Mick Jagger. Instead, again for no apparent reason, 2 Michael monster solo hits ("Don't Stop Till You Get Enough" and "Billie Jean") are tagged at the end. What do they have to do with the Jacksons story?  In all, this CD contains a ton of incredible music, but the compilation is a hodgepodge that goes all over the map. Not a bad album by any measure, but just a weird compilation.
