 Dick's Picks Volume 2 is the only single CD of the series, and then only 58 min. at that. But the length (or lack thereof) is not the main issue that I have. The biggest problem with this CD is that the sound of the album is flat, period. Maybe it is accentuated by the absence of Mickey Hart, who had temporarily departed the Dead at this time (Oct. 71). But even with that, I find "Dark Star" to be lacking in comparison to some other live versions. Things kick up in the second part of the album, starting with "Not Fade Away". But overall, this is a lesser addition in the overall Dead catalgue of the "Picks", regretfully.
