 There are at least 4 or 5 Peter Frampton compilations out there, but this is the only one that covers not just the solo years, but also covers the years prior to Frampton's first solo album in 1972.  The first half hour of "Anthology: The History of Peter Frampton" (16 tracks, 78 min.) includes one single from the Herd, which Peter joined at age 17. I had long forgotten about that song, "From the Underworld", but I instantly recognized when it played. Even better are the next 5 tracks, from Peter's days along with Steve "Small Faces" Marriott in Humble Pie, with whom he made 5 albums in less than 3 years. Best of them is the live song "I Don't Need No Doctor".  The remainder of the set showcases Peter's solo career. Beware, there is only 1 track from "Frampton Comes Alive" ("Show Me the Way"), all the other tracks are in studio form. Which doesn't matter, because if you are anywhere interested in Frampton, you already have that CD. The set closes with "I Can't Stand It No  More" from 1979. Not that Frampton has stopped making music, as llast year's underrated album "Now" shows. "Anthology" is an excellent set, that showcases very nicely Cincinnati's best known resident musician (yea, I had to slip that in here...).
