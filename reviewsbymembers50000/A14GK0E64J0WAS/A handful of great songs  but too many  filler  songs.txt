 Twenty-five years after the worldwide smash hit album that "Guilty" was, Barbra Streisand returns, along with Barry Gibb, with a sequel, "Guilty Pleasures" (released outside the US under the title "Guilty Too").  "Guilty Pleasures' (11 tracks, 47 min.) starts off promisingly with one of the 2 Streisand/Gibb duets, "Come Tomorrow", a perfectly fine "middle of the road" song. The lash production jumps out at you, as it does throughout the album. However, after the opener, it's immediately to ballads and other slower-tempo songs that don't seem to go anywhere. The second half picks up again with songs like "Night of My Life" and "All the Children", the 2 outright uptempo songs on the album, and both are great. The second Streisand/Gibb duet "Above the Law" is not as good as the first one. The album closer "Letting Go" is Broadway Barbra: just vocals with piano and orchestra, not my cup of tea.   Finally, the album also includes a curious cover of Andy Gibb's "(Our Love) Don't Throw It Away". It's not bad, but it just made me reach back for the Andy Gibb Greatest Hits CD I have, so I could enjoy the original. "Guilty Pleasures" is not bad per se, but certainly not as consistently good as 1980's "Guilty" album. Not surprisingly then, "Guilty Pleasures" dropped off the charts pretty quickly following its September, 2005 release.
