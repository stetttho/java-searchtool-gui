 I found out about the all-girl band Go Betty Go through my 14 yr old daughter, and just loved what I heard. This is the initial EP release of the band.  "Worst Enemy" (5 tracks, 16 min.) start off with a charging "You're Your Worst Enemy", and doesn't let up up from there. There will inevitably be comparisons to its SoCal neighbors The Donnas, but for what it's worth the quality of this EP is miles ahead of the Donnas' first album. The best songs are "Son Mis Locuras" (sung partially in Spanish), and the closer "C'mon" (not to be confused with the Von Bondies' "C'mon C'mon"), a perfect ending to 16 min. of all out rock-and-fun. (Incidentally, "C'mon" also appears on the 2004 Vans Warped 2CD compilation). "Worst Enemy" is highly recommended!
