 In the Fall of 2003, Over the Rhine was touring behind the critically acclaimed "Ohio" album, and out of the blue the national tour was canceled not even midway through it. No explanation was given, and there was rampant speculation on the band's forum boards. Only much later did Karen Bergquist and Linford Detweiler, the husband-and-wife team behind OtR, admit that the tour was canceled due to relationship issues.  "Drunkard's Prayer" (11 tracks, 51 min.) is the "catharsis" album of the breakdown-and subsequent restrengthening-of their relationship. The album is deeping personal, almost shockingly so, I cannot recall off the top of my head another such album (although I'm sure there are others). This is the first OtR album whose songs are all credited to "Bergquist/Detweiler" so it's hard to tell who wrote what lyrics. Musically, this is a return to the sound of the "Good Dog Bad Dog" era (1996), with sparse instrumentation: mostly piano and accoustic guitar, although at times augmented by drums and bass. My favorite tracks include "Born" (the original intended title for the album, changed at the last minute), "Spark", "Lookin' Forward", and "Who Will Guard the Door". The album closes with a nice cover of "My Funny Valentine". Karen's voice has never better sounded than on this album. She's truly a "best kept secret" in today's music scene.  As a fan since the early days (OtR formed in 1989), it remains fascinating to watch the history of OtR unfold. Counting compilations and live albums, "Drunkard's Prayer" is the band's 12th album and quite a nice addition to the OtR catalogue. A  quiet album that should be played loud. For OtR's most adventurous (and, in my opinion, best) album, check out 2001's "Films for Radio" album.
