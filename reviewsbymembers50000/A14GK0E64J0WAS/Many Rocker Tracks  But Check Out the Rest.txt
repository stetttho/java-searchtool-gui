 Like most here, I only came to "Good Feeling" after having played "The Man Who" (still the best "new" album of 2000). It has been widely reported that "Good Feeling" rocks more than "The Man Who" and I certainly will not dispute that. However, to overlook the other tracks on "Good Feeling" would be a shame. "Good Feeling" starts of with the by-now classic AIWDIR (their first single and the opener in all 3 of their concerts that I saw this year). It remains a beauty. "Good Feeling" also contains the all-out rocker "U16 Girls", and the singalongs "Tied To The 90s" and "Happy". All 4 of these tracks charted in the UK Top 50. Next there is the title track, which remains a staple in their concerts. Once you've gone over the familiar ground of the above tracks, settle in for some less-familiar gems: "The Line Is Fine", "Midsummer Nights Dreamin", and in particular the soft and gentle "I Love You Always" and "Falling Down", which perhaps is the best track on the entire. Mesmorizing! If you're hungry for more Travis after playing "The Man Who" and "Good Feeling" to no end, check out the "Coming Around" (CD2) and "Writing To Reach You" import singles, both of which contain quite a few tracks not available elsewhere.
