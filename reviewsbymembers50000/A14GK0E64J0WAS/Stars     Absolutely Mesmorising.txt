 Credit must go to where it belongs... my 14 yr old daughter introduced me to Eisley, and I now absolutely love this band. Six months after their debut EP "Laughing City", Eisley released this second EP in late 2003. Eisley (4 siblings and a friend) reminds me musically of Sixpence None the Richer, another fave band of mine. "Marvelous Things" (4 tracks, 15 min.) starts off with a blaze with the title track, a hard driving tune with great vocal harmonies, one of the band's trademarks (the lead singer is 15 yrs old, if you can believe it!). "Memories" is in the same vain. "Sea King" is a dreamy track, just great. "The Winter Song" is a reflective tune, and a nice way to round out this EP. If you play both "Laughing City" and this EP back to back, it sounds like a great (if somewhat short) album, frankly. The fact that these are really just teenager kids gives me great hope and expectations for their future output (they are working on their full-fledged debut album now). Meanwhile, we'll do with this. BUY IT!
