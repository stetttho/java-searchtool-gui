 This CD compiles Collective Soul's 11 biggest hits, and offers 2 new songs (Energy; Next Homecoming--both good tracks actually). For the casual CS fan, this offers a nice package. The set is centered around Collective Soul's peak years: 3 songs from 1995's break-through "Collective Soul" album (The World I Know; Gel; December) and 4 songs from 1997 (Precious Declaration/Listen/Forgiveness from "Disciplined Breakdown" and She Said from the "Scream 2" soundtrack). The set is mercifully short on last year's "Blender" album (only Why Pt 2). For those of use who already have all the albums, this collection is superfluous and somewhat confounding (some radio hits/key album tracks are missing, including Smashing Young Man, Breathe, Simple). I've said it before and I'll say it again: at this point, the band would have been better served with releasing a live CD, as its energy at concerts is amazing. (Ed Roland, are you listening?) Nevertheless, singer/songwriter Ed Roland has built an impressive catalogue of infectuous rock hits, and if you don't have the albums, this compliation is a great starting place. (The good news is that the set isn't entitled "Greatest Hits Volume 1" as that is the surest sign a band is about to break up!)
