 Let me state upfront that I am not a great Sinead fan. For that, her behavior over the years has simply been too off-putting. But there is no denying that she has a superb voice. I had heard that a few years ago she had been tipping her toes in reggae, and after a failed "retirement" from music in 2002, Sinead returns to the music scene with this album.  "Throw Down Your Arms" (12 tracks; 47 min.) is a full-fledged reggae album, produced by the legendary Sly (Dumbar) & Robbie (Shakespear), who also play drums and bass, to superb effect. REcorded at the legendary Tuff Gong studios in Kingston, Jamaica, this album is the real deal: top-notch reggae, bar none. Sinead always has been a superb judge of what songs to cover, and she does it here again. The highlights are plentifold on this album: Burning Spear's "Door Peep", Lee Perry's "Vampire", Bob Marley's "War", the title track, etc. The outstanding song for me on here is "Prophet Has Arise", with the back-up band in superb form, and Sinead's voice perfectly fitting in, a true jem. But the truth is that there are no weak tracks on this album.  I have discovered 4 months after 2005 that this is really one of the best albums of last year. Better late than never. Now, if we only could get Sinead to go on tour with Sly & Robbie! What a prospect that would be! I'd be there in a second. "Throw Down Your Arms" is highly highly recommended!
