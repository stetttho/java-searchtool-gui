 RCA, Jefferson Airplane's label, celebrated its 100 year anniversary in 2001 by releasing a bunch of compilations of the label's best known acts. There have been many compilations of Jefferson Airplane, but this one fits in nicely.  "The Roar of Jefferson Airplane" (14 tracks, 54 min.) thankfully brings the best of the band in chronological order, starting with "It's No Secret" from the band's 1965 debut album. 1968's "Greasy  Heart" is a delight, with Grace Slick just soaring. This includes of course the band's best known song, "Somebody to Love", but "White Rabbit" is mysteriously absent (and reason I cannot rate this compilation higher than 4 stars). There are plenty of highlights, though, such as "The Last Wall of the Castle", with a great guitar solo from Jorma Kaukonen (he of Hot Tuna later on), and the accoustic "Plastic Fantastic Lover", among others.  Great also are the liner notes from Jeff Tamarkin, who puts the band and all of the songs in great context. This album is a great time capsule of one of the most influential bands of the 60s. Highly recommeded!
