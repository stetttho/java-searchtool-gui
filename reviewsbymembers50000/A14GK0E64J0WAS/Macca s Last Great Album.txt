 Paul McCartney's follow-up album to 1989's "Flowers in the Dirt" has shamefully been overlooked over the years. I would call it Paul's last great and relevant album (sorry, but the later albums just didn't cut it for me anymore).  "Off the Ground" (12 tracks, 50 min.) starts off with the rocking title track, followed by the biting "Looking for Change", an anti-animal-abuse song surely inspired by Linda. Then follows the delicious single "Hope for Deliverance", reminiscent of 1978's "Deliver Your Children". The album contains 2 tracks Macca co-wrote with Elvis Costello, and they are standouts: "Mistress and Maid" and "The Lovers That Never Were". Anther great track is the epic "C'Mon People" (another single, 7+ min, reminiscent of "Hey Jude"). What keeps this album from getting more than 4 stars are a couple of duds like "Biker Like an Icon" and the preachy "Peace in the Neighborhood" (another single).  Following the release of "Off the Ground", a big commercial succes (the last one, really) for Paul, he set off on a world tour that was documented in the "Paul is Live" CD, only necessary for Paul-completists (count me as one). Meanwhile, "Off the Ground" is a great album, sadly overlooked in the Macca catalogue.
