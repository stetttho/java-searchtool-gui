 The Christmas season is usually the time of the year that I dig out my collection of Windham Hill CDs. The Windham Hill "new age" label, founded by guitarist Will Ackerman, issued a bunch of truly classic albums in the 80s, and this particular compilation is one of the label's very best.  "An Evening with Windham Hill Live" (1982, 7 tracks, 41 min.) is a sampler of some of the label's biggest names. The album starts off with 2 great guitar pieces: first the (late) Michael Hedges brings his wizardry on "Rickover's Dream", then it's Alex DeGrassi's 9 min. epic "Turning: Turning Back" ("it's just about a trip to Philadelphia!"). "Spare Change" finds Hedges surrounded by pianist Liz Story and bassist Michael Manring, outstanding! But wait! There's lots more! Guitarist (and then-label CEO) Will Ackerman teams up with Chuck Greenberg (of Shadowfax) and brings a soaring "Visting". The last 2 songs feature George Winston, on "Hawk Circle" he is joined by Ackerman and Hedges, and on "Reflections/Lotus Feet' it's Winston solo. Great great stuff.  The CD I have is a straight transfer from the vinyl album I had. I don't understand why this CD is out of print. This album is nothing short of a "all-star" collection of Windham Hill's best artists. If nothing else, this album should be reissued with a remastered sound AND bonus tracks, which surely exist (the sleeve notes indicate the songs were recorded over two nights). In any event, in these cold winter months, what better than to light up the open fire and to have Windham Hill music in the background while reading a good book!
