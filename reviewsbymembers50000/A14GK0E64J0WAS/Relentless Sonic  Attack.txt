 The Hives are the best musical export out of Sweden since ABBA (sorry, Roxette). This mini-"best of" album is a hotch-potch of 4 tracks from 2000's "Veni Vidi Vicious" album (which only this year gained acceptance in the US), with album tracks of 1997's "Barely Legal" CD and a variety of singles and B-sides. Clocking in at 28 min., "Your Favorite New Band" sums up very nicely where the Hives are at this point: take-no-prisoners, all out sonic assault, short songs that make rock so great, check out "Hate To Say I Told You So", "a.k.a. IDIOT", and "Outsmarted". The best song, though, is the delicious B-side "The Hives Are Law You Are Crime" (an instrumental no less) which puts us all in place! Please don't confuse the Hives with the Vines! The Hives are what rock is about (not that the Vines arent), and this compilation is a great introdution. Now when will they come out with a bona-fide follow-up to "Veni Vidi Vicious"?
