 "Sing" is Travis' first single of the new CD "The Invisible Band". The single features 3 songs and runs 11 min. "Sing", also the lead-of track to the album, is classic Fran Healy and picks up nicely where Travis left us last summer with the "Coming Around" single. The song has rich instrumentation, and the banjo (of all things!) is nicely featured throughout. The song has instant appeal which makes you just want to "sing sing sing" it again. Track 2 is "Ring Out the Bell", which is (as far as I know) the first Dougie-penned track to make it onto a Travis single or album. Dougie also sings lead vocal. It is a surprisingly strong song, and I have to believe he's got more tunes up his sleave for us! The reason I rate the single 4 stars (and not 5) is because of Track 3, a "cover" of Queen's "Killer Queen". I couldn't quite believe it when I heard it. It is literally a note-for-note remake of the original, at times I had to strain to hear any difference at all. Very disappointing. (Compare this to earlier Travis covers like "The Weight", where they take a song and make it their own.) Overall, very satisfying for the 2 originals. Sing Sing Sing!
