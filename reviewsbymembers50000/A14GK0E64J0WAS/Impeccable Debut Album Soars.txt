 How ironic, yet how fitting, that my last review for 2002 covers one of the very best CDs to come out this year. Interpol comes out of NY, like the Strokes, and I find it to be the perfect companion CD to "Is This It".  This collection of 11 songs (49 min.) gets a soaring start with "Untitled" which for some reason reminds me of the Stone Roses' "I Wanna Be Adored". "Obstacle 1" and "PDA" are the best tracks of the album, guitar-driven, very high-energy. Other oustanding tracks include notables include "Say Hello to Angles" and "Stella". Whether Interpol will be able to climb out of critical acclaim to mass-popularity remains to be seen (which sadly says says a lot about today's music industry, as Interpol gets virtually no airplay). On the account of their impeccable debut album, they sure deserve it. In mid-January they will visit Cincinnati,  and that is one concert I am really looking forward to!
