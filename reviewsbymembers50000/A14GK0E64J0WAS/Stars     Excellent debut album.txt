 I admit I had never heard of Lovedrug untill I saw them open not long ago for Eisley (talk about a strange combination!) and soon after that I got their album, which was releases exactly a year ago (July, 2004).  "Pretend You're Alive" (13 tracks, 57 min.) is engaging from (almost) beginning to end. If you're not familiar with Lovedrug, imagine a mix of Muse-meets-Blonde Redhead-meets-Starsailor-meets Tori Amos. This description does not do justice to their sound but it's the best attempt I have for it. The album is a bit overlong in the end, with a few songs cut, it would've been a 5 star rating. That said, there are plenty of highlights, among them: the title track is a haunting "ballad", as beautiful as you will ever hear. "Down Towards The Healing" has a hardly threatening, yet ever present under the radarscreen beat (this song reminds me of what Tori Amos would sound like, if she were a guy). "Angels With Enemies" recalls the Starsailor sound. "Radiology" has a dream-like beat to it, just beautiful. "It Won't Last" is a 7 min. epic that captures the band at its best, with lush soundscapes.  I am so glad I found these guys! If you are constantly looking for something new and fresh in the music scene (as I am), this album will not disappoint you. By chance, Lovedrug will be opening for Switchfoot in a few weeks not far from here, and yes I will be there!
