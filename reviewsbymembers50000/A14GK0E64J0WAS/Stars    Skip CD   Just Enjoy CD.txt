 The Rolling Stones: another tour, another live album (after "Flashpoint", "Stripped" and "No Security" to document the previous 3 tours), are you surprised? The twist this time is a double-CD, one documenting the hits and one with more obscure songs.  "Live Licks" (23 tracks, 109 min.) gives "Greatest Hits Live" on CD1 (11 tracks, 49 min.), and is totally unnecessary. I mean, do you really need aonther live version of, say, "Start Me Up" or "Satisfaction"? Much better is CD2 (12 tracks, 60 min.), which brings first-ever CD live versions of such lesser-known classics as "Monkey Man" (the best song on this collection), "Can't You Hear Me Knocking", "Worried About You", but also nice covers such as "Everybody Needs Someone to Love" and "That's How Strong My Love Is". Given the depth of the Stones' catalogue and their varied song selection on the "40 Licks" tour, it's surprising that the CD's full 80 min. is not used.  If CD2 of "Live Licks" had been issued as a single CD, I would have rated it 4 stars. CD2 is reminiscent in fact of the succesful strategy behind "No Security", which I still think is a pretty good live collection. Anyway, having seen the Stones on the "40 Licks" tour, I thought this is a pretty nice tour souvenir. I just won't play CD1.
