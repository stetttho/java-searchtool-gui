 I have seen Steely Dan live a few times, though not on the 1993/1994 tour, from which this live set comes. On the one hand, in a Steely Dan concert you know what to expect beforehand, namely the songs will be recreated as closely as possible as the studio version, which in a way is nice, comforting perhaps. On the other hand, you wish for something unpredictable to happen with the live arrangements, and it never happens, but for the rare guitar solo or horn solo. In the lines notes Donald Fagen writes, when asked why they decided to tour again after so many years: "We wanted to hear what 'Babylon Sisters' would sound like live". Good enough for me, but then again you could've replied "it just sounds like the studio version".   "Alive in America" (11 tracks, 66 min.) provides pleasing versions of some of Steely Dan's best known tracks, including "Babylon Sisters", "Bodhisattva", a swinging "Peg" (one of my all-time fave Steely songs), "Kid Charlemagne" and even oldie "Reelin' in the Years" is included. The best is saved for the very last, namely a 9 min. majestic version of "Aja", just beautiful. For the Steely completists, also included is "Book of Liars", one of the few Steely Dan songs ever where Walter Beckett sings lead.  In all, this is certainly not a "necessary" purchase for the Steely Dan fan. But if you've seen them live, this is a nice souvenir, nothing more nothing less.
