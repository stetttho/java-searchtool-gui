 I recently bought the CD to replace the vinyl I no longer play, and it's like revisiting an old friend after all these years. Think of Information Society as The Human League minus that band's "We're serious  musicians. Please respect us!" attitude.  While the album is best  known for the hit "What's On Your Mind (Pure Energy)", that is  actually one of the weaker tracks. Listen instead to I.S. taking on ABBA's  "Lay All Your Love On Me", the stomping "Attitde" and  the tongue-in-cheek final track "Make It Funky" (all 1 min 40 sec  of it!). This is what great dance music in the late 80's was like.
