 "Family Values" is now in its third outing. The Fall 2001 tour headlined Stone Temple Pilots, Staind and Linkin Park. This album is a good sample of the tour, with the same flaws. The album starts of with a blistering STP "Vasoline" (the first live track on CD of STP, aren't they overdue for a live album?), followed by Likin Park's equally scortching "Runaway", and then Staind's best track ever "Fade". There are many other choice cuts on this album, including Static-X's "Cold", STP's "Wicked Garden" (with some nice banter by Scott Weiland about being born in San Jose, where this track was recorded) and the album closer by Linkin Park's "One Step Closer", just terrific, the energy jumps out at you! The major flaw in this album is to include 2 of STP's "unplugged" tracks, the truly dreadful "Wonderful" and "Creep", which of course is a classic, but... as in the concert, they are out of place, and bring down the energy completely. What were they thinking? So no 5 stars...
