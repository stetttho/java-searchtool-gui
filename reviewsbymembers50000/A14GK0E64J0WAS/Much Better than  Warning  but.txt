 It's been 4 years since Green Day released the (for me) disappointing "Warning", and since then a LOT has happened in the world, 9/11 foremost, which appears to have been a source of inspiration for Green Day, as the band comes back with a vengance, and with a rock opera no less! Ahhh, the forgotten art of the rock opera!  "American Idiot" (13 tracks but really 22 songs; 57 min.) is Green Day's version of The Who's Tommy or Genesis' The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway. I'm not entirely sure what the story line exactly is, but there is plenty of anger, frustration, lost loves, confusion, and redemption (which of course are themes expored in every Green Day album). But musically Green Day hasn't sound this good in YEARS. The title track is Green Day at its best. There's much to do about the two 9+ min. tracks, but in reality both of them are simply 5 songs cramped together without the 1 or 2 seconds of silence between regular tracks. Other standout tracks include "Are We the Waiting", "Boulevard of Broken Dreams", "She's a Rebel" and "Wake Me Up When September Ends".  If there is one setback to the album, it's that it simply runs too long (almost twice as long as other non-compilation Green Day albums). After about 40-45 min., it feels like you keep hearing the same thing again, which is unfortunate as there is a lot of great music on "American Idiot". But for this, I probably would've rated this higher than 4 stars. Nevertheless, this album is highly recommended!
