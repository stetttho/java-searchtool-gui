 After hearing Jewel's new album "This Way" in its entirety for the first time, I didn't really know what to make of this album... I've listened to the album several more times since, and must report unfortunately that my initial reaction still stands. It's been 3 years since "Spirit" came out, and one would think that that is plenty of time to assemble strong tracks. However, nowhere on "This Way" will one find the 1-2-3 knockout punch of Spirit's Deep Water/What's Simple is True/Hands ("Simple" is Jewel's best song ever, period). The opening track (and first single) is "Standing Still", which is what I wish Jewel would have done, rather than looking for a "new sound" such as on "Everybody Needs Someone Sometime", a truly bland, Shania Twain-like Nashville-flavored song. And then to have "Cleveland" for us Cincinnatians, ouch that hurts!!  Surprisingly, the best tracks on the album are the 2 live "bonus" tracks, both of which is just Jewel solo on accoustic guitar, reminiscent of the "Pieces of You" album: on "Grey Matter", THE stand-out on the entire album, Jewel's vocals truly shine; on "Sometimes It Be That Way" Jewel points out in the liner notes that "the false start at the beginning is me forgetting the lyrics". Beautiful! The rest of the album could've used some more spontaneous moments and intimate songs like these. In sum, a very uneven and overlong (60 min.) album, reminding us at the very end why we have come to like Jewel in the first place. Jewel of old, come back! All is forgiven!!
