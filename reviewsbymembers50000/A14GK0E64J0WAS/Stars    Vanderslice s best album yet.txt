 John Vanderslice continues to issue an album just about every 15 months or so, this is his 5th one since his debut solo album in 2000.   "Pixel Revolt" (14 songs, 53 min.) is mesmorizing from beginning to end. If you're not familiar with Vanderslice's soundscape, think Aqueduct meets Bright Eyes, but with Vanderslice's own unique (and at times, very personal) lyrics. Track 2 "Plymouth Rock" is outstanding, and haunting. Musically the second half of the album is actually the stronger. "Radiant With Terror" is reminiscent of the Smashing Pumpkins' "Disarm". "Continuation" in another highlight. "Dear Sarah Shu" has intricate instrumentation and production. In "Angela", under distorted percussions, Vanderslice confesses to having let Angela's bunny out of its cage and then it jumped out of the windown "and hopped down Magnolia Blvd/no way he'll survive/maybe those last days of freedom/were the best of his life". The last track feels like a release of Vanderslice's pent-up fears and frustrations, catharsis-like.  With "Pixel Revolt", John Vanderslice brings another breath of fresh air into the music scene. This surely will be one of 2005's top albums. Highly recommended!
