 "Obstacle 1" is the second single off of Interpol's "Turn on the Bright Lights", one of the very best albums of 2002, period. This single (3 tracks, 13 min.) is slightly less-compelling than the first single "PDA" (a/k/a "Interpol EP"). No-one will question the musical genius of "Obstacle 1", the best song on the album. While sequenced smartly on the album right after the "slow" opening track "Untitled", it stands up very well on its own. The guitar play between Paul Banks and Dan Kessler is just outstanding. (I'm sounding like an old record, but why can't such great music find airplay? Except for WOXY, thanks guys!) The other 2 tracks on here are somewhat "filler": the version of "PDA" is a live, "in-radio" version, and not as good as the original studio version. Equally, "Hands Away" is a live "in-studio" verson for the John Peel BBC program. Hence only 4 stars.
