 In 1983, Mark Knopfler, singer/songwriter of Dire Straits, released the superb soundtrack to "Local Hero", which remains a favorite of mine still, and one of the best soundtracks ever. The next year, he followed with another movie soundtrack, "Cal", which brings the story of an Northern-Irish family tormented by the struggles with the British "occupancy".  "Cal" (12 tracks, 35 min.) evokes the atmosphere of Irish life, with superb result. Check out the opener "Irish Boy", with gentle guitar and flute. The conflict in the movie is born out in "Fear and Hatred", which is the only "harsh" track on the album, all the other tunes are mood pieces. There are 2 center pieces on the album that are beautiful beyond belief: the 6+ min. "Father and Son" which evoke all the ache that is in the movie, and the closer "The Long Road", which is uplifting in sound (and sight onto the screen). Knopler's excellent guitar work is never overbearing, but enhances the mood throughout.  Mark Knopfler would go on to score many other movies, but he never reached the peaks of the 1-2 punch of "Local Hero" and "Cal". "Cal" may only last 35 min., but it is a superb soundtrack, and highly recommended. I bought it on vinyl and again on CD and it remains a favorite of mine.
