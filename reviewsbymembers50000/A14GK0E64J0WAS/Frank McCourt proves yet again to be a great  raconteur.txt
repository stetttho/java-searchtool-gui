 Concluding the trilogy that was started in 1996 with "Angela's Ashes" and continued in 1999 with "Tis", Frank McCourt brings the most recent chapter of his life (teaching in NY high schools for 30-some years) back to life.  "Teacher Man" (258 pages) continues the saga of McCourt's life. And, as he did with the earlier memoirs, he brings it with incredible detail. McCourt must have a memory of steel. Names and places remain fixed in his mind forever. Some of the most interesting pages in the book don't have anything to do with McCourt's teaching at various high schools, but instead detail McCourt's failed attempt to get a doctorate in English Literature at Dublin's Trinity College: at age 38, he goes back to Ireland and basically wastes away 2 years, only to realize how much he misses New York. In the last part of the book McCourt finally finds his groove when teaching at Stuyvesant High School. That is, until he retires and finally takes up the challenge thrown out by one of his students on McCourt's last day of teaching: "Hey Mr. McCourt, you should write a book." McCourt responds: "I'll try..." The rest, of course, is history.  With this trology behind him, McCourt has shown he can write a non-fiction book as good as anyone out there. Being a young 75 years old, the question now is: what is next for this brilliant author? I'd love to see McCourt try his hand at fiction...
