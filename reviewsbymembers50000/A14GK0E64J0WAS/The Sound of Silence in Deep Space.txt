 From the opening moments of the first track Planit Orbit, Spacecraft takes you onto a flight in deep space, giving you a flavor of the sounds of silence found there. Not much melody here, just mood explorations with  synthesizers of all kinds. Think Tangerine Dream around Phaedra and Zeit.  The key track is Zero, One: a 22 minute "quiet blowout" of their  deep space sound. This album is the perfect setup for what would come next  for Spacecraft, namely the Hummel CD (see review there).
