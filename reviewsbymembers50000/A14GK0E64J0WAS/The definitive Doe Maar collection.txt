 Growing up in Belgium, the Low Lands were hit in the early 80s by the biggest thing in ages by the Dutch band Doe Maar, which combined reggae-flavored tunes with fun yet "meaningful" lyrics. For a couple of years, there was real "Doe Maar-hysteria" in the land. The band split in 1984. This 2 CD compilation combines all of Doe Maar's singles and most important album tracks, making it the definitive collection (among many available). "Is Dit Alles" ("Alles" means "Everything" in English, hence the title of the compilation) is one of Doe Maar's signature songs, but many more treasures are on here, including "Pa", "Sinds 1 Dag of 2", "De Bom", "Smoorverliefd", "Okee", "Nix Voor Jou", "Nachtzuster", "De Laatste Keer", "Doe Maar Net Alsof" and many others. Even if you're not Dutch-speaking, I would venture that this makes for a great listen, simply because the music is just outstanding. But for those of us who grew up with Doe Maar, this is an all-encompassing compilation. A few years ago, Doe Maar reunited for the one off (but excellent) come-back album "Klaar", which is also a recommended buy.
