 This is VHS or Beta's second album, and even though it's been out almost a year (released September, 2004), the band is still out there touring in support of this album, finding new fans every day. I am one of those.  "Night on Fire" (10 tracks, 52 min.) starts of with the title track, and the second you hear the lead singer, you think, "wow, has Simon Lebon joined VHS or Beta"? In fact, the first 2 tracks have an overall "Duran Duran" feel to it, and would fit in very nicely next to "Girls on Film". After that, the band sounds much more distinct (albeit it still inviting comparisons). There are several instrumentals and almost-instrumentals on here that are among the best tracks on the album: "Forever" is hypnotic behind the "Forever on my own" chorus; "Nightwaves" is full of energy; and the best is saved for last: the closer "Irreversible" is a 9 min. instrumental blowout that synthesizes the band's sound perfectly. I find myself playing that track more than any other.  I saw VHS or Beta in concert not long ago. Live they rock out, and make even the wallflowers in the audience dance along, you just can't resist it. If you have a chance to see them, doooo eet.
