 In October 2000, K's Choice issued it's fourth album "Almost Happy", which has gone unreleased in the US until now (it is finally being issued--in a different version--in April 2002). The subsequent tours all over Europe to support "Almost Happy" are the source of this double CD, which came out in Fall 2001 in Europe. (For the record, the album really is just called "Live", not "Le Double Live".) This double CD is neatly divided in 2 completely separate sets: CD1 is essentially K's Choice "Greatest Hits Live": 9 of the 11 tracks were a hit single, including Not an Addict (their biggest US success), Mr. Freeze, Cocoon Crash, Everything for Free, Believe, Almost Happy, Another Year, Busy, If You're Not Scared, and the non-single but instantly recognizable Hide. The performances are generally top notch, and exciting. CD2 is a totally different affair. It is "K's Choice Unplugged", meaning: only Sarah and Gert Bettens, reinterpreting primarily lesser-known catalogue songs just on acoustic guitar. Contrasted to the enthousiastic feeling of CD1, the "Unplugged" set falls a little short, although Sarah's voice shines throughout. For anyone having been to a K's Choice concert, this is an excellent memento. Belgium's best band comes through once again!
