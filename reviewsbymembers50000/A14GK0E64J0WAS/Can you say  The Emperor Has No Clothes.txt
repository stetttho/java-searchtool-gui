 Before jumping all over me for this review, please know that I am not one of those who's yearning for Radiohead to return to its "OK Computer" days. I have never heard or listened to that album (shame on me, supposedly!). I do have "The Bends" and "Kid A", both very different albums, yet both very enjoyable. I have listened to "Amnesiac" from beginning to end, and was very unimpressed, even bored with what I heard. The key track that demonstrates so well why "Kid A" works, and "Amnesiac" fails, is "Morning Bell", which appears on both albums. On "Kid A" it is a beautiful track, with the dreamy keyboards driven by underlying drums. On "Amnesiac" it is an irritating, jazzied track, with Yorn's vocals too much up front. I had read in several places that "You and Whose Army" was supposed to be one of Radiohead's best songs ever, and after I heard it (all 3'09" of it), I thought, "that's it?". I did like a couple of tracks, including "I Might Be Wrong". I was impressed by Radiohead's vision and guts when it released "Kid A", because it went against all "mainstream", but even more so because that album sounded great. Not so with "Amnesiac". Looks to me that Radiohead went a bridge too far with this one. But who has the guts to yell out "The emperor has no clothes"?
