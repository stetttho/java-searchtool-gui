 Caitlin Cary and Ryan Adams were both the vital members of Whiskeytown. This is Caitlin's full-fletched debut solo-album, and it is pretty good. Of course, it invites comparisons to Ryan's post-Whiskeytown solo output ("Heartbreaker" and "Gold") and this album simply isn't as good. The opener "Shallow Heart, Shallow Water" is an uptempo, uplifting, almost radio-friendly track. "Fireworks" (unlike Ryan's "Firecracker"!) is a mellow, country-like track, with Caitlin prominent on her trademark violin. Mike Day, also of (latter day) Whiskeytown, co-wrote some and plays on most of the songs, the best being "Pony" and "The Fair", staying closer to Whisleytown's country-flavored origins. The initial pressings of the album come with a 4 song bonus CD, the most notable track being "The Battle", co-written and co-sung by Ryan. Overall, a nice album, but it's so hard to not compare with Ryan Adams' sublime post-Whiskeytown albums...
