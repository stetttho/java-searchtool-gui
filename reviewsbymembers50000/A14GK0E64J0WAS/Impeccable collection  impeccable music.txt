 After last year's excellent "Lost Dog" collection of B-sides and rarities, now comes the more straightforward collection of Pearl Jam's "greatest hits", surely not in the Top 40 sense of hits, but perhaps better titled the "best and most beloved" songs of Pearl Jam.  "rearviewmirror (Greatest Hits 1991-2003)" (2 CDs, 33 tracks, 145 min.) is divided up between the rockers and the 'ballads'. CD1 (16 tracks, 66 min.) is the "Up Side", and covers such classics as "Once", "Alive", Curderoy", "Not For You", "Hail Hail", etc., this rocks from start to end. CD2 (17 tracks, 79 min.) is the "Down Side" and includes great songs  like "Black", "Daughter", "Elderly Woman", "Off He Goes", "Nothingman", and "Last Kiss", the band's only true "Top 40" hit. Smartly and rightly, this collection emphasizes the early years: 21 of the 33 tracks cover the first 4 years of the band (up to "Vitalogy"), whereas the last 9 years are covered by 12 tracks. So thankfully no "Elton John Greatest Hits 1970-2002" situations, where latter day non-greatest hits are taking up space and block other genuine greatest hits of the earlier days from being included.   The cynic deep inside of me wanted to believe that this collection was just another attempt by Epic/Sony, the label Pearl Jam left last year, to squeeze the last financial drop out of the Pearl Jam phenom. And maybe that is what's going on, who knows. But in the end, I couldn't resist having all the best songs of Pearl Jam onto a single collection. In an era where too often "greatest hits" and "best of" collections are botched by the record label and/or the artist, this collection was done exactly right.
