 I have gone through the college search process once, and am doing it again due to an early interest taken by my daughter who's a sophomore. We got a bunch of the most recent college search books, and went through them.  "Fiske Guide to Colleges 2006" (774 pages) is a curious book in my opinion. It lists the "best and most interesting" colleges. I couldn't find exactly how many are listed, but from the looks of it, I'd guess about 300 (750 pages, with about 2.5 pages per college). While the descriptions give a good flavor of a particular college, there are some essentials missing, such as the exact tuition/room/board (there is only a general 1 to 4 star rating on how expensive a college is). Also not helpful in my opinion is that the colleges are presented alphbetically, rather than by state (although there is an index by state).  This is certainly not the first book to go to if you are at the very beginning of the college search. My daughter is simply looking to get basic information, and she did not spend a lot of time with this book. This is always a subjective rating, of course, but I also feel there are better books out there, although this book may be more helpful to get a second (or third) opinion once your child has narrowed down his/her selection of colleges of interest.
