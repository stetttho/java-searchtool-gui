 As a longtime Neil Young fan, it pains me to tell you (and I'll prob get slammed for this) that this album is not the brilliant album so many reviewers here have described, but a shockingly mediocre, overly long album that is really a case of "the emperor is wearing no clothes".  Concept albums like "Tommy" and "The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway" are a rarity these days. Neil brings us songs about "Greendale" (10 tracks, 78 min.), a fictional small town of about 20,000 people. Neil is so focused on the story-telling that he seems to have forgotten about the music. I can honestly say there is not a single track that "grabbed" me, purely from the musical perspective. Not a lot of tempo changes either: all the songs are mid-tempo (at best), where's the passion? Sometimes you just wish that he'd up the tempo and blast you away, but alas. The songs go from one to another and after a while it all starts to sound the same. Not to mention that this is a long, long, long labor. With just 10 tracks in 78 min, that's averaging about 8 min. per song. "Granpa's Interview" just goes on and on and on, for 12+ min, with no changes to speak of, whew! The bonus DVD (here the St. Vicar, Ireland gig of Neil solo, in a later reissue the "Greendale" movie Neil shot with amateur actors) is a nice touch. Too bad the music simply isn't up to par.
