 There is a new "school' of female singer/songwriters out there today, lead (in measures of success) by Jewel, Sheryl Crow and even Shelby Lynne. However, there are many others, lesser known but in many respects more engaging, including Miranda Lee Richards, Nikka Costa, Shea Seger and yes, Leona Naess. On "I Tried to Rock You But You Only Roll" (is it just me, but I find that a rather annoying and akward title for the album), Leona shows us how much she has matured since her debut album "Comatised". The opening track "Mexico" (not to be confused with the James Taylor song of the same name) sets the tone for the entire album: a mid-tempo song about asking a former lover to come along to Mexico ("We can laugh about the love we used to know.... I Should Hate You But I Don't, You Should Love Me But You Wont"). "All The Stars" reminded me of some old Donna Summer tune. The title track is a smart pop song, a couda-shoulda-been radio hit. Other standouts are "Blue Eyed Baby" and the very strong "Panic-Stricken". Leona Naess's second album is full of quality songs. With the teen pop craze finally starting to fizzle out, maybe radio will find room for albums such as this. For those of you already familiar with Leona, you will not be disappointed!
