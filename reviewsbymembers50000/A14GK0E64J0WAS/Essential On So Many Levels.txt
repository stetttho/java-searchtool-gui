 I saw "Don't Look Back" again the other day, my first time in a number of years. I actually was prompted to this after seeing the recent Bob Dylan interview on "60 Minutes" (to promote his equally astonishing memoir "Chronicles-Volume 1"). Were you as astonished by the "60 Minutes" piece as I was? In any event, "Don't Look Back" is essential on so many levels: first and foremost, it gives us a never-since equalled candid view at life (on the road) with Dylan. While it does contain a number of performances, "Don't Look Back" is not a concert movie. It's more a pre-concert movie than anything else, watching Dylan getting ready to perform in the "Green Door" and other performing halls' waiting rooms. The film also remains essential as a looking glass onto England, 1965, with its gritty, if not to say seemingly always gray outlook and feel to it.  Back to the "60 Minutes" interview. When I was watching it, it felt so familiar. Even though the interviews are separated by almost 40 years, Dylan played the "60 Minutes" interviewer in very much the same way he played the British journalists in 1965, although admittedly in a somewhat nice fashion now. Watch again the "interview" Dylan did with the reporter from "Time Magazine" towards the end of "Don't Look Back", it's the highlight of the movie for me.  The live performances in "Don't Look Back" are equally essential, if for no other reason that you are watching Dylan in Spring, 1965 (almost 40 years ago to the day!), a mere months before turning electric at the Newport Festival. From an audio perspective, the performances in "Don't Look Back" are very similar to the material covered in the 2 CD set "Dylan Live 1964", issued in Spring of 2004. The staying power of "Don't Look Back" 40 years later is proof that this movie is essential for any Dylan fan. Highly recommended!
