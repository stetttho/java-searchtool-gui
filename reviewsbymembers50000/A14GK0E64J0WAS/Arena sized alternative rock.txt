 Let me begin by saying that I've been a Coldplay fan from the very (humble) beginnings, I saw their 2nd US concert ever, in February 2001, when they toured behind "Parachutes, just released a mere months before in the US. The growth/transformation of the band has been astonishing. When the "Rush of Blood" album came out, I said in my review Coldplay could be "the next U2, if they want that". That has been answered loud and clearly, yes they want to be!  "X&Y" (12 tracks plus one "hidden" track, 62 min.) is a long way from the intimate "PArachutes" album, but it does offer a lot. From the opening track "Square One", the sound is arena-sized, even with the quivering emotions from front man Chris Martin.  A lot has been made about "Talk", the song that takes the riff from Kraftwerk's "Computer Love" (it supposedly was the last track to make it on the final ablum set track--Chris Martin lists Kraftwerk as one of his all-time fave bands--as it is one of mine, by the way). It's a good track, but when you listen to "Speed of Sound" (the lead-off single), it struck me how similar both tracks sounded in their soaring music. "The Hardest Part" is the most early-Coldplay like track, and a beauty. The "hidden" track is "Till Kingdom Come", a nice quiet song, although not sure why it was not officially listed on the song track.  When all is said and done, "X&Y" is better than, say, 90% of the music that is put out today, hence my 4 star rating. It is not my favorite Coldplay album, though. "Parachutes" is so much more adventurous and unexpected, and I would urge anyone new to Coldplay to seek it out.
