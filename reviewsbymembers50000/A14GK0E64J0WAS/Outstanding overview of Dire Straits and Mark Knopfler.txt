 There have been a number of Dire Straits "best of" compilations, including the decent "Sultans of Swing" 1998 compilation, but this is the first time that the entire career of Mark Knopfler, both in Dire Straits and as a solo artist, is reviewed. I must admit upfront that I am not a great fan of his solo work.  "Private Investigations: The Very Best of Dire Straits and Mark Knopfler" (2 CDs; 139 min.) brings 14 Dire Straits songs, 7 Knopfler solo songs, and 1 new Knopfler-Emmylou Harris duet "All the Roadrunning". The big thing is that the Dire Straits songs are presented in original album-length format. Yes, the full 14+ min. of "Telegraph Road, the full 8+ min. of "Tunnel of Love", etc.Also, no live versions of certain songs are found here (unlike on the "Sultans of Swing" compilation). Really only 2 (semi)classics are missing: "Twisting by the Pool" and "Heavy Fuel" (the latter in any event only a second rate carbon copy of "Money for Nothing"). The 7 Knopfler songs are outstanding. If you don't have the "Local Hero" and "Cal" mostly instrumental soundtracks, do yourself a favor and buy them. You'll find one song of each on here. "Sailing to Philadelphia", "What It Is" and "Boom, Like That" are equal to his Dire Stratis-standards. The duet with Emmylou Harris is nice, but not essential.  If you distill the very best of Mark Knopfler's 25+ year career down to 140 minutes, it really is amazing how good it all sounds. As it should be, the emphasis is on the Dire Straits hits, but when you pick and choose in his solo output, there are some beautiful tracks there as well. This compilation was released without much fanfare, but I highly recommend it!
