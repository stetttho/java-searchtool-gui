 I can't say that I'm a huge Neil Diamond fan (I don't have a single album of his, in fact). But when I recently heard "Cracklin' Rose" and "Sweet Caroline" back-to-back on the radio, I realized the man has some truly great songs, which eventually lead me to this collection.  "In My Lifetime" (71 tracks, 227 min.) is thankfully organized chronolgically, so that one can follow and understand the musical evolution of Neil Diamond. Not surprisingly CD1 is the most interesting of the collection, with the early demos and songs, near-hits and finally, hits. Be aware, 20 of the 27 tracks on CD1 are in mono. If CD1 is the most interesting, then CD2 is the "greatest hits" of the greatest hits. Blockbuster song after blockbuster song rolls along. Fascinating is "Dry Your Eyes", Neil's contribution to "The Last Waltz" farewell concert of the Band. You didn't know that Neil was part of that show? Me neither. Included also is a 5 song suite from the "Jonathan Livingstone Seagul" concept album, wich I owned and loved in the good ol' vinyl days. CD3 starts with the hits from "The Jazz Singer" remake (America, Love on the Rocks, Hello Again), and coast along following the lines of "Heartlight", which is admittedly not my favorite Diamond stuff.  If there is one surprise in this collection, it's that there is nothing in here from either the original and very successful "Hot August Night" live album, which I believe is Neil's biggest selling album ever, or any other of his live albums such as Live at the Greek and HAN 2. That aside, this collection gives the proper due to a truly gifted singer-songwriter.
