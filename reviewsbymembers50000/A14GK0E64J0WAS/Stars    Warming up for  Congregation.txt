 The Afghan Whigs issued their second album "Up In It" in 1990 and while quite good, in retrospect the album sounds like an appetizer for the truly great next album, 1991's "Congregation". "Up In It" (13 tracks, 45 min.) starts with a blast, "Retarted", as sure an arena rocker as you'll find. The album generally sounds quite heavy, with guitars all over, check out "Hated" for example. "You My Flower" is a nice breather in all the heaviness. Other good tunes include "Big Top Halloween" and the closer "I Am the Sticks". Overall, the album drags a bit, and a tighter song selection would have served the album well. This is a good Whigs album, but not the best. For that, check out "Congregation" and "Gentlemen". Finally, I cannot write this review without mentioning that the Afghan Whigs are one of the very best bands coming out of Cincinnati in the last 15 years (along with Over the Rhine)... Greg Dulli, come on back, all is forgiven!
