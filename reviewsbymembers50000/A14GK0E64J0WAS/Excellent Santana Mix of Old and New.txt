 Did you know that Santana's 1999 smash succes "Supernatural" was his first million-seller since 1977's "Moonflower"? And there is a good reason for it. The original double vinyl album mixed up new studio tracks with live versions of older nuggets, and works spendidly.  "Moonflower" (2 CDS, 19 tracks, 97 min.) became a mega-seller primarily due to the (unexpected) succes of its lead-off single, a Latinized cover of the Zombies' "She's Not There". Other singles followed, including "I'll Be Waiting", and "Europa (Earth's Cry Heaven's Smile)", a beautiful 'Samba Pa Ti'-like instrumental with awesome guitar solos from Santana (it was a HUGE hit in Europe, where I grew up). But there are many other nuggets, such as "Flor d'Luna (Moonflower), another beautiful instrumental. The live tracks are pretty darn good too, including the "Black Magic Woman/Gypsy Queen" medley, and the 14 min. blowout "Soul Sacrifice/Head, Hands & Feet", outstanding!  This remastered edition, in addition to the superb sound, adds the single versions of "She's Not There", "I'll Be Waiting" and "Black Magic Woman". In all, "Moonflower" is a terrific album all around. Notwithstanding the mega-succes of "Supernatural", I wish that Santana would go back to the well of the sound of the older days, documented so well on "Moonflower".
