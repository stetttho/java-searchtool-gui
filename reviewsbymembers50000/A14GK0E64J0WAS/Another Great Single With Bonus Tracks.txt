 "Driftwood" was the second single from "The Man Who" album. The single was originally issued in the UK in May 1999. (The UK single was issued with 3 live tracks of songs from that same album. See reviews there.) This single was issued in Austria, and is different altogether. After the dreamy "Driftwood", there are 2 excellent bonus tracks: first there is Travis' take on Phil Spector's "Be My Baby", which remains very true to the original version. Then there is "Where Is the Love", an accoustic-guitar based song reminiscent of Tom Petty or even early solo George Harrison. This single is 13 min. of just beautiful and sophisticated pop songs. Anyone who likes Travis cannot go wrong with it: buy it!
