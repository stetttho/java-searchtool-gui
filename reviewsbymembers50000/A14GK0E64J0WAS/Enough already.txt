 Ryan Adams used to be the coolest dude in the music industry with the 2000-2001 double whammy of the "Heartbreaker" and "Gold" albums. He seemingly could do no wrong. The prolific songwriter he is, albums would continue to fly off the shelf, with mixed result. In 2005, Ryan released not 1, not 2, but 3 albums!  "29" (9 tracks, 49 min.) was released in late December, 2005, following the okay "Cold Roses" 2 CD album which was an attempt to recreate the sound of the "Heartbreaker" and "Gold" era, and the "Jacksonville Nights" album, an escapade to the earlier Whiskeytown country flavored songs. With "29", Ryan misfires in a bad way. The songs are generally tuneless, and wonder along WAY too long. The few highlights are the 2 opening tracks: the title track, which shows some punch (with a great backing band), and "Strawberry Wine", a gentle acoustic song that could've fitted well onto "Heartbreaker". After that, it just feels like Ryan crying into a beer, and going on and on... and on, but it doesn't feel right. Honestly, none of the remaining songs have any appeal to them, or grab your attention.  Releasing 3 albums in one year may have been a publicity stunt, for all we know, or a vanity project, who knows. The much better move would have been to condense the best songs of those three albums into one great album. The songs are there, for sure. I don't know what is next for Ryan Adams, but he is a LONG way removed from being the cool dude in 2001, the self-appointed "savior of rock 'n roll" right now....
