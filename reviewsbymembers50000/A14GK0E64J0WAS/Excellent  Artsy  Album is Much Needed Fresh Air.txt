 Someone lent me this album, thinking I would enjoy it, and boy, have I ever. It wasn't long before I bought the album myself. Disclaimer: I have not heard any of Blonde Redhead's other albums, so when I see the frequent references to Sonic Youth regarding BLonde Redhead's earlier work, I can only scratch my head, because this particular album sounds absolutely nothing like Sonic Youth, not even close.  "Misery Is a Butterfly" (11 tracks, 45 min.) instead invokes memories for me to past "sophisticated, artsy" music, for example not unlike Kate Bush but harder charging. Even a comparison to Sixpence None the Richer is not out of place, with rich melodies and textures throughout the album. Lead vocals on some songs (such as the excellent opener and first single "Elephant Woman" and also the title track) are by Kazu Makino, and she shines. On other songs Amadeo Pace sings lead, including on "Falling Man", my favorite song on the album, and on the equally ecellent "Doll Is Mine".  I can't emphasize enough how much I like this album. It provides some much needed change and fresh air in today's music scene. This surely will end up on my shortlist of favorite albums of 2004. Strongly recommended!
