 Stereophonics were one of the more exciting bands in the late 90s coming out of the UK. The Welsh trio brought brash rock with a swagger, and I loved it. After peaking with the 1999 "Performance and Coctails" album, things slowly but surely started going downhill, and I did not like last year's "Language" album whatsoever. Now, on the 10th anniversary of the band, they finally release a live album.  "Live at Dakota" (2 CDs, 20 tracks, 92 min.) was taped during the 2005 tour for the "Language" album. CD1 (10 tracks, 42 min., 3.5 stars) focuses heavily on the newer songs, and unless you love the "Language" album, you're not really gonna get into it. It does have a blistering version of "The Bartender and the Thief", though. CD2 (10 tracks, 50 min, 4.5 stars) fares much better with the song selection, including "Hurry Up and Wait" and "Just Looking" form the Performance & Coctails album, "Vegas Two Times" from the J.E.E.P. album, "Too Many Sandwiches" and "Traffic" from the Word Gets Around album, but also "Carrot, Cake and Wine", an old B-side. Guitarist-singer-songwriter Kelly Jones is in great form throughout.  While I haven't been overly impressed with the Stereophonics' last 2 studio albums, they remain a great live act, and this set does more or less justice, although at 92 min. over 2 CDs, there was plenty of room left for some earlier (and still performed) classics such as "Have a Nice Day" and "Roll Up and Shine" that somehow are not on here.
