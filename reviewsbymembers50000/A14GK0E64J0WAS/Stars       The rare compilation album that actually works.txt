 I have never been a big fan of the compilation album genre, be it movie soundtracks, charity albums (such as this album) or whatever multiple artist compilation. But when I saw this album on a recent trip to London, I couldn't resist, and for once, I am happy to say that this album is worth every nickel.  "Help: A Day in the Life" (20 tracks, 78 min.) is the sequel to the 1995 charity compilation album "Help: War Child". The line-up of artists contributing to this album (with every single track recorded in a 24 hr. span of September 8-9, 2005) is just outstanding. Among the many, many highlights: Coldplay's "How You See the World, Pt.2" (which, contrary to the Amazon editor's review, is NOT the bonus track of the Japanese version of "X&Y"--that track, "The World Turned Upside Down", can be found on the "Fix Me" single); Radiohead's down-trotten "I Want None of This", Keane's charming cover of "Goodbye Yellow Brick Road", The Magic Numbers' "Gone Are the Days", The Coral's little gem "It Was Nothing", and towards the end of the album, the 1-2-3 punch of Bloc Party's "The Present", Hard-Fi's "Help Me Please" and Babyshambles' "From Bollywood to Battersea" (giving a glimpse of how good Pete Doherty can actually be, if only he could stay away from drugs long enough). But the outstanding track on the album is the Kaiser Chiefs' cover of "I Heard It Throught the Grapevine", with a riveting guitar lick throughout.  There is really no weak track on here, as hard as that is to believe. Even the non-rock tracks such as Tinariwen's "Cler Achel" and Emmanuel Jal's "Gua" don't sound out of place. "Help: A Day in the Life" is an outstanding album, frankly one of the better CDs of 2005. And that the proceeds help a good cause, only makes this so much easier to recommend.
