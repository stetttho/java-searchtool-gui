 Ash has been big in England for years (ten top-20 hits, and counting), and with the belated release here of "Free All Angels" (which came out in England in April 2001) and tireless touring in the US (recently supporting Coldplay, among others), will America finally discover Ash? This album is Ash at is most accessible and "pop" to date. From the opener "Walking Barefoot", an ode to the beginning of summer, Ash lays out its guitar riff-driven hooks. Included here are the 4 UK hits: "Shining Light", "Sometimes", "There's a Star" and the really delicious "Candy", a slower song with strong underlying drums, in my opinion the ideal song for American radio (better than "Burn Baby Burn", which is the current US single). The album comes with a bonus DVD (apparently the new trend to entice potential customers), containing videos and concert footage.
