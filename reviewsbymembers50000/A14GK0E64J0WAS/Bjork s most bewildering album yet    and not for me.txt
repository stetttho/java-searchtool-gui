 Bjork has left the commercial side of the recording business a long time ago, forget about "Human Behavior" from 1993's Debut album or "Army of Me" from 1995's Post album, her greatest commercial successes, not to mention her Sugarcubes days.  "Medulla" (14 tracks, 45 min.) is a mood piece, and a difficult to absorb one at that. It is an almost vocals-only album, augmented at times with some instrumentals. At times it almost sounds like a modern opera. I credit Bjork tremendously for going places where a popular artist like her have hardly dared to go. I mean, this is way off the charts. But, and this is a purely personal opinion, it doesn't really cut it for me. There really are no melodies to speak off, except for the very last track "Triumph of a Heart". Seperate from the music, the CD booklet does include the lyrics, but they are near-to-impossible to read (black on dark gray), what is up with that?  This album is I imagine a great "art" statement, appreciated by many reviewers here, but it just bewilders me. I'm sorry but I ache back to the days that Bjork made music that rocks more than this. I can't call this a bad album, but it's just not for me.
