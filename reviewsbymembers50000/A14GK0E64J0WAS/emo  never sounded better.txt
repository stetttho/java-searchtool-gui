 Here again... credit goes to where it belongs... my 14 yr. old daughter gave this CD to me as a Christmas gift, and she must know me pretty well, as I have come to love this album. "Deja Entendu" (11 tracks, 49 min.) brings out the best of the so-called "emo" sound (along with Dashboard Confessional). The album starts off with the subdued "Taoutou" but then jumps straight into the blazing "Sic Transit Gloria" (the 2nd single). The first half of the album is simply impeccable, with among others "The Quiet Things" (1st single, and big MTV video hit), but also "Okay I Believe You" and "Jaws Theme Swimming", both smartly intermixing the "soft" and the all-out rock sound.  The album falters a bit towards the end, but no matter, because contrary to so many "one song" bands today, Brand New have delivered a cohesive album that actually delivers more than just the one MTV hit. A great listen all around!
