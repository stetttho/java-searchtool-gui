 I admit that I did not know much of what exactly happened in Atlanta on March 11-12, 2005, other than that some escaped killer had taken a woman hostage, and then let the woman go free. It turns out that Ashley Smith, the so-called Atlanta Hostage Hero, in fact has quite a story to share.  In "Unlikely Angel" (276 pages) Ashley recounts the events of that fateful evening, essentially talking her way through the night before somehow managing to convince the escaped killer to let her go. The retelling is intermixed with Ashley's past struggles (alcohol and drug abuse; husband murdered; being an unworthy parent to her daughter; etc.). It is clear that Ashley is taking the events of March 11-12, 2005 to turn her life around hopefully for good this time, and rededicate her life to Christ. Only time will tell whether Ashley succeeds, and I am hoping and praying that she will. Meanwhile, this is a terrific and inspirational read.  As an aside, I can't help but question a number of the other reviews posted here. Take for example Sam O'Brien's review a couple of spots below this one: unlike what he writes, the book in fact does contain all the "unflattering details", and in fact spends a huge number of pages on it, making it clear to me that this guy didn't even read the book. Boo!
