 I picked this book up just before going on vacation. Having lived through another long winter, the idea of reading a book in which summer plays a key role, was appealing to me. Boy, was I wrong.  "In Summer" tells the story of Leo Peery, who has just graduated from high school and awaits going to college at the end of summer. Leo works as a life guard, and hangs out with friends and relatives, gets involved with girlfriend(s), etc. It's not the story line that is the problem, it's the writing that does not connect with me. It seems very detached. For example, at some point fairly early in the book, Leo finds out that his mom is dealing with a potentially terminal medical problem. One would expect that Leo is devistated, but somehow it doesn't come across the pages.  In summary, despite the author's lenghty and numerous descriptions of the feel of summer as experienced by his 18 year old fictional character, I just didn't feel it and when I finished the book, I thought to myself, 'what did I read this for again?'. Not recommended.
