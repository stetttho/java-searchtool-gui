 Originally issued in '85 as a triple album, this essential and ultimate Tangerine Dream collection fits nicely onto 2 CDs (19 tracks, 133 min.). This particular release is the 2002 reissue of the 1985 compilation (exact same tracks), albeit with a new cover.    This collection was originally issued shortly after TD enjoyed true broad commercial success for the last time with the soundtrack for the movie "Risky Business" (starting and ending the compilation on tracks 1 and 19). All other tracks inbetween are the highlights of the Virgin Records era of TD (thankfully leaving out pre-1973 experiments like Zeit and Alpha), starting with excerpts (too short, in my opinion) of "Phaedra" and "Rubycon". The tracks move along pretty much chronologically, ending with "White Eagle" from 1982.     The set includes 2 side-long tracks, "Ricochet Part II" and "Tangram Part I". The "Ricochet" track shows TD at its peak, a 20 minute oddisey of throbbing sequencers and soaring guitar solos. "Ricochet" stems from '75 but hasn't aged a day. And to think that the "Ricochet" and "Tangram" albums actually made serious dents in the UK album charts in the mid-70s! Those were the days! If you're gonna to buy just one Tangerine Dream CD, this is the one . . .    If you're looking for more "essential" Tangerine Dream, check out last year's "Bootleg 1", which brings 5 live concerts from the 70s.
