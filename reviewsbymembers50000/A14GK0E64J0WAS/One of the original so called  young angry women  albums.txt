 When Patti Rothberg released her debut album in April, 1996, Alanis Morissette's Jagged Little Pill was taking the world by storm, and Patti was (too) easily thrown in the bag of "young angry women". 7 years later, "Between the 1 and the 9" stands as a great album. The comparison to Alanis is not a good one, musically speaking. Rothberg is more in the vein of Beth Orthon, or Tracy Chapman for that matter: more up-tempo accoustically driven (with the occasional electric guitar work-out), with less "shouting" than Alanis, but still speaking her mind about relationships and life experiences. A chick-CD, so to speak (and I don't mean that negatively) The album's best tracks include "Inside" (the first single), "Treat Me Like Dirt" (which in the 1996 heydays of alterna-radio also gathered radio-play), and "Remembering Tonight". Patti Rothberg pretty much disappeared from sight after this album, among other factors due to label problems. She finally issued a follow-up album in 2002 (which I have not heard, not too many others ahve, I suspect). However, "Between the 1 and 9" is a great album, period.
