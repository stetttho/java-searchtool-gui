 Editors stormed on the UK music scene in early 2005 with the single "Bullets", and haven't looked back since. The band's sound is reminiscent of Echo and the Bunnymen and Interpol (I played the CD to my 15 yr. old daughter and after 2 songs she said "hey, this sounds like Interpol", and she meant it as a compliment).  "The Back Room" (11 tracks, 43 min.) starts off with a 2'30 min. blazing "Lights", with lead singer Tom Smith proclaiming "I've Got A Million Things To Say", and boy, do they ever. Outstanding songs follow: "Munich" (the second single) is mesmerizing, "Blood" (third single) is almost danceable, in a dark kinda way. Other highlights include "All Sparks", the epic "Open Your Arms" and the closer "Distance", but there really isn't a weak track on the album. "Bullets" has just been re-released in the UK as a single, and you can just feel this band is going places.  Many have commented that this album is the UK's response to Interpol's "Turn on the Bright Lights", and I have to agree. This is a near-perfect album, drenched with urgency from beginning to end, just beautiful. It begs the question not if but when this album will find a US release and a US audience. "The Back Room" is easily one of the best albums of 2005. Highly recommended!
