 There's no denying the cultural phenom that Britney was for a period of 5 years, from early 1999 through 2003. With her future in doubt (no touring in 2004, disastrous quickie Las Vegas wedding-cum-annulation, followed by the eyebrow-raising wedding to one of her dancers), this collection comes in the nick of time.  "Greatest Hits: My Prerogative" (2CDs, 85 min.) starts with the greatest hits on CD1 (17 tracks, 60 min.). While there is little to argue about the songs themselves, there are 2 things that bother me. First, the collection would be a much better listen had the songs been arranged chronologically. For example, going from "Everytime" to "...Baby One More Time" is simply disorrienting. Second, some of the songs come in a remixed version. For example, the original "Overprotected" is a terrific song but it shows up here in a different version altogether. CD2 (5 tracks, 25 min.) brings more of those remixes, and they present well-known songs in an almost unrecognizable version. It's not really my cup of tea, although "Breathe On Me" is admittedly pretty good, imagine a Donna Summer-like sound of "I Feel Love". The 3 new songs are not bad, although the "My Prerogative" Bobby Brown cover doesn't come close to the original.  I personally have serious doubts about Britney's future as a power in the music business whenever she decides to end her current hiatus. Meanwhile, this "Greatest Hits" set is adequate. It could've been better, but there are a lot of great songs here, there's no denying that.
