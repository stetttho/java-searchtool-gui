 B.B. King gives the ultimate birthday present on his 80th birthday both to himself and to the fans: a new studio album that is a star-studded affair, which not surprisingly has its ups and downs.  "80" (12 tracks, 54 min.) matches up the living blues legend with a bunch of stars, including Van Morrison, Eric Clapton, Sheryl Crow, John Mayer, Roger Daltrey, Elton John, and many others. The album is generally a pick-and-choose affair. The best tracks for me are "Hummingbird", where John Mayer foreshadows his release shortly after this one of "Try!" by the John Mayer Trio (a guilty pleasure for me); "All Over Again" with delicious guitar duets between B.B. King and Mark Knopfler; "Never Make Your Move Too Soon" with Roger Daltrey in great form; and the closer "Rock This House", a rousing live track with Elton John. There are a couple of real duds too, unfortunately, including "The Thrill Is Gone" with Eric Clapton, how can 2 such legends sounds so lame, and, the worst of all, the 7 min. duet with Gloria Estefan, what in the world is she doing on a blues album?!?  All that aside, I am simply amazed by the continuing energy of B.B. King, who continues also to tour regularly. I only hope that when I reach 80 in 35 years, I have half the stamina of this truly living legend and American treasure. "80" may be a mixed affair, but there are enough good moments to make this a worthwhile addition to your B.B. King collection.
