 We are finally treated to the "Essential" Billy Joel compilation, making excellent use of the 75 min. per CD. This 36 track 2-CD set all but makes the previous Greatest Hits sets (Vol. 1-2-3) superfluous. The interesting thing about this set is that it comes 6 months after the UK issued their "Ultimate" Billy Joel 2-CD compilation. The UK and US sets (which are, at the current exchange rate, priced pretty much the same), mostly overlap, although the track sequencing differs greatly. If you cannot live without "All for Leyna", "This is the Time", "Streetlife Serenader", "Modern Woman" or a few other choice cuts on your "ultimate BJ" then I suggest you switch to Amazon.co.uk and get the UK "Ultimate" version. Conversely, the UK set does not contain tracks like "Only The Good Die Young", "Lullbye", "And So It Goes", and a few others that you will find only on the US "Essential" set. This is the best of all worlds: compare which one suits you better, and everyone wins. Either way, though, this is an excellent update of "the best of" Billy Joel on one CD set. When you hear these tracks one after another, it is truly amazing how many winning songs the "Piano Man" has written over the years. Here's wishing that BJ has a few more up his sleeve...
