 Ahh... we all remember the sunny days of summer '82 when Imagination was THE best European disco act around... Imagination, a trio out of France, cranked out hit after hit, and this compilation has them all. The band had a sound all of its own, in the middle of the crazy European disco scene. The up-tempo songs are still the best: Just an Illusion (their big break-through hit in 1981), Music and Lights, Flashback, Changes, Looking at Midnight (albeit regretfully here in the "single" version), New Dimensions, State of Love,  Burnin' Up, and on and on... The ballads are not bad either (such as Body Talk, In and Out of Love, etc). This compilation is what anyone interested in Imagination would ever want. All the hits are here, and as a bonus, there is a "Megamix" tagged on as well. Classify this as a "guilty pleasure": this isn't serious music, but oh so enjoyable!!
