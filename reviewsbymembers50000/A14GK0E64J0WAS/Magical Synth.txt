 I had the vinyl way back in the 70s and just bought the CD.... it remains a timeless classic. The CD consists of only 2 tracks but if you are into  "deep space" synth, this is a no miss. The CD is neatly divided  into 2 30 min. tracks, the best track being the first "bayreuth  return", a mesmorizing journey of moogs and synths that will take you  beyond today's existence and open your mind to things you could not have  imagined... This is Klaus Schulze's best album by far. If you want to  explore the best of Europe's deep space synth, look no further, this is IT
