 British rockers Gomez have had to live with the hype of their acclaimed 1998 debut album "Bring It On" (which won multiple awards). Since then, they have searched and tried to live up to that acclaim, with mixed results, and now here comes their 4th album, and it's great to see that Gomez is finally, truly back in the saddle! "Split the Difference" (13 tracks, 50 min.) is a return to the all out rock'n'roll that brought the acclaim. The album starts off with a blasting "Do One" and doesn't let up from there. "Where Ya Going" reminds me of early-Pearl Jam, just great. "Silence" (a UK single) is almost a pop song (and I mean that as acompliment). "Catch Me Up" (another UK single) just rocks great. "Sweet Virginia" (not to be confused with the Rolling Stones tune of the same name) is a gorgeous ballad. There is really no bad song on the album. If there is a weak track, it's the closer "There It Was". For those of you who fell in love with Gomez' debut, this is the true and worthy follow-up. For those of you new to Gomez, this is one of the better 2004 albums so far, please check it out!
