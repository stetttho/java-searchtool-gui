 After the terrific singles "The Hindu Times" and "Stop Crying Your Heart Out", Oasis really makes a curious choice for its third single of the "Heathen Chemistry" album. This is a so-called "double A-sided" single, with "Little by Little" and "She is Love" being the "double As". Both "Little by Little" and "She is Love" are Noel-penned and sung, and are average MOR ballads, at best. A much better choice for single IMHO would have been "Born on a Different Cloud", one of the album's best songs (it also would be the first Liam-written song to chart on its own). The redeeming track on this single is Oasis' take on The Who's "My Generation", which has been part of Oasis' live set the past year. For those that already have the album, no need to buy this single, unless you just can't live without having "My Generation". For those that don't have the album, don't buy this single but buy the album instead!
