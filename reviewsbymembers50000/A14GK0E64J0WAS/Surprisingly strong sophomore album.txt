 Audioslave's 2002 debut album became a somewhat unexpected hit album, on the strength of a couple of great radio hits. Nevertheless, scepticism remained whether this super-group (ex- Soundgarden's Chis Cornell with the 3 instrumentalists of Rage Against the Machine) really was in it for the long term. That question now has been answered.  "Out of Exile" (12 tracks, 53 min.) is pretty much a straight-up rock album, with Cornell's influence clearly increased from the first album. The opener "Your Time Has Come" and the title track showcase the band at their rockingest. Radio-hit "Be Yourself" is outstanding. "Doesn't Remind Me" is a delightful lil' throwaway tune. The second half of the album is actually even better, starting with a scorching "The Worm". The best tracks of the album follow later: "Yesterday or Tomorrow", with great guitar work from Tom Morello, and "Dandelion", showing Cornell at the top of his game.  In all, "Out of Exile" is a surprisingly strong album, clearly better than the debut album. It looks like Audioslave is really growing into its own identity, away from Soundgarden and RATM, and I look forward to see where the band goes from here.
