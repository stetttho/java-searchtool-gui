 In early 1975, Peter Gabriel stunned the music world when he announced he was leaving Genesis for a solo career. Could there be a Genesis without Gabriel? Equivalent to, say, Jethro Tull sans Ian Anderson, or the Stones without Jagger or Zeppelin without Robert Plant? Most had their doubts, but against the odds, the band soldiered on, and with drummer Phil Collins taking over on lead vocals, released "A Trick of the Tail" (8 tracks, 51 min.) in February, 1976. Perhaps anticipating the worst, the music industry's collective jaw dropped at the opening sounds of "Dance on a Volcano", starting off the album with a blaze and never letting up: "How can Genesis be so good without Peter Gabriel?" "Entangled" is perhaps the best song ever that Tony Banks and Steve Hackett co-wrote, just mesmorizing. "Sqonk" proves that the "new image" Genesis can rock harder than ever before. "Robbery Assault and BAttuery" showcases Tony Banks' wizzardry on keyboards, just great. The album "tails" off a bit with the title track and the instrumental "Los Endos", rehashing the musical themes of the album's tracks. But that's minor quibble. It's hard to imagine know, knowing the succes that laid ahead still for Genesis, but in 1975 it was not at all clear the band would survive Peter Gabriel's departure. "A Trick of the Tail" answered that challenge, and then some!
