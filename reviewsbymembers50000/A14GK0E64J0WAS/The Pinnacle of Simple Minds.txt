 "New Gold Dream", issued in 1982, is (with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight) the very best album Simple Minds ever made, bar none. Although it contains 3 songs that charted in Europe ("Someone Somewhere in Summertime", "Promised You a Miracle", "Glittering Prize"), this is still Simple Minds before they really hit it big in the US with "Don't You Forget About Me" and the "Once Upon a Time" album. The great strength here is that the album flows wonderfully from one track to another. And, truthfully, the best tracks are NOT the 3 tracks that charted, but instead the more adventurous ones such as "Colours Fly and Catherine Wheels", the title track, the driving "Hunter and the Hunted" and "King is White". Simple Minds have recorded great music, but were never better that on this album. As an aside, I have seen them live only once, in 1983 when they were touring behind this album and it is one of my very memorable concert memories.
