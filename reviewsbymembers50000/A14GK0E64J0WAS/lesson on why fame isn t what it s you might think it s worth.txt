 First things first: I got this book from my 15 yr old daughter as a birthat present. I am generally not one to read fiction books. But of course as a birthday present, I felt I had to read it. And guess what, I actually enjoyed this book, quite a lot.  "This Is Your Life" (313 pages) brings the story of Jimmy Conway, who is living a bland life as a part-time teacher in Southern England. Jimmy meets a major TV celebrity by chance when jogging one day. The celebrity dies the next day, and Jimmy somehow builds this encounter into a bit of 15 min. of becoming a B (or C) celebrity as a stand-up comedian whom nobody has ever actually seen perform (which he hasn't of course). Jimmy enjoys his new status, but then there is a major twist towards the end of the book, which I won't reveal, but it brings Jimmy back down to earth, realizing that his "bland" existance in fact was the best thing going in his life.  This book is not a major literature statement, but it is hilarious (I laughed out loud many times throughout), and it does bring home an important message: you may want to be famous, but it isn't at all what you might think it may be, and instead you should enjoy the things you already have around you. Excellent book all around. Thanks for that birthday present, my daugther!
