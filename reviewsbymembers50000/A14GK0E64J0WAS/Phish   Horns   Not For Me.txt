 The "Live Phish" series contains many excellent editions, but 19 is not one of them, for me personally. I want to emphasize that other Phish phans may (and do, as some reviews here show) feel differently.   "Live Phish 19" (2CDs, 28 tracks, 148 min.) is from a 1991 show in New Hampshire. CD1 (79 min.) starts off in a jazz-like club atmosphere, with a lot of short tracks, and the horns up front. Concert staples "AC/DC Bag" and "David Bowie" show a lot of energy, but sound very differently than one might expect with the horns. CD2 (69 min.) is much better, with an excellent Gumbo>Mike's Song>I Am Hydrogen>Weekabaug Groove, the latter with a blazing Trey guitar solo, the highlight of this concert. The Doors cover "Touch Me" works quite well too, no wonder since the original song also featured horns...   In all, this is not a bad live set (is there such a thing with Phish?), but it's not my favorite. Check out instead for example Live 15 or Live 20, much better to my liking.
