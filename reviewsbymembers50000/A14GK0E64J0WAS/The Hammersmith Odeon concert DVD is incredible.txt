 It's hard to believe that "Born to Run" was released 30 years ago, wow. This is indeed the perfect way to pay tribute to that monumental album: a remastered edition, plus not one, but two  DVDs. As to the remastered edition, it sounds very nice but not all that noticably better then what was already available. The second DVD contains a lot of great background materials and documentaries, but truth be told, I doubt that I will watch that DVD a lot.  The reason to have this is of course the concert DVD of the 1975 concert at London's Hammersmith Odeon. If you haven't been to that venue, it is quite small, but of course at that time Bruce was not the superstar he would become not long after. The Amazon editorial review describes Bruce as "pensive and joyless". Huh? Have they seen the same concert that I saw? Bruce is super-energetic, running all over the place, and clearly enjoying himself and the occasion. Interesting is that Bruce doesn't start playing guitar until the 5th song into the set ("She's the One"). My favorite moments include "Spirits in the Night", "Born to Run", with a refreshing sound (of course it was a brand new song then), and "Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)", but truth be told, this DVD is a delight from beginning to end. A true time-capsule from 30 years ago, and yes, this DVD will get repeated playing! Highly recommended!
