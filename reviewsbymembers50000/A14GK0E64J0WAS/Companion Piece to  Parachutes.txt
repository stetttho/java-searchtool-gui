 I stumbled onto "The Blue Room EP" after diving into Coldplay's mind-blowing debut album "Parachutes". This EP was recorded in summer of 99 and released a few months later. This EP contains 5 songs and runs 20 min. I suspect that most of you, as did I, will listen to this after having fallen for "Parachutes".  The EP starts off with its strongest song, "Bigger Stronger", which has all the elements of why "Parachutes" would be the best "new" album of 2001 (it was released in Nov. 2000): great melody, smart lyrics, and that hard to resist lead vocal.  Track 2 is "Don't Panic", which is also featured on "Parachutes", but here on the EP in a different, cleary earlier version: the intro is a fascinating mumble of guitars, which is not found on the album (where it is the lead off track); it also comes in a different guitar orchestration. Track 4 is "High Speed", which is featured "as is" on the album, the only track from the EP to make it onto the album without any changes. Track 3, "See You Soon", is a charmingly, soft-ridden track. Track 5, "Such a Rush" starts off very gently but eventually builds up to an outburst of the band's instuments. It is the best song after "Bigger Stronger" If you like "Parachutes", by all means BUY THIS
