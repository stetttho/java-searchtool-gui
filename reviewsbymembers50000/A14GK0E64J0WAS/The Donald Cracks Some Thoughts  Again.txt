 I must admit I probably wouldn't have picked up this book if I wasn't such a big fan of "The Apprentice". But I am, and I did. This book is, as the Donald says himself, a straight-forward sequel to the equally succesful "How to  Get Rich".  "Trump: Think Like a Billionaire" is a quick read, just 229 pages, and they're not top-to-bottom filled at that. Lots of quick thoughts, just over a page or 2 pages long. But Trump does give a couple of good tips. Such as in the introduction, about thinking like a billionaire: "Don't take vacations... Have a short attention span... Don't sleep anymore than you have too... Don't depend on technology... Think of yourself as a one-man army..." etc. Or on how to impress anyone in business: "Be on time... Make a mental dossier on people... Let other people talk... Be self-depreciating and disarming..." etc. It all sounds pretty evident, but not really! There is a chapter on "The Apprentice 2", with an inside look on the first 4 episodes. Nothing mindboggling, but it does show that the Donald is very involved and hands-on with the show.   If there is anything that bothers me in the book, it's the endless gratuitous name-dropping, it just doesn't stop and most of the time just self-serving. Reading this book certainly won't get you much closer to becoming a billionaire, if that is your objective. That said, this is a pleasant "quickie" read, nothing more, nothing less.
