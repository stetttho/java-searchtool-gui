 After 12 years, 7 albums and countless singles, here appears the first ever compilation of Tori Amos. "Tales of a Librarian" (20 songs; 78 min., plus bonus DVD) is neither a "best of" nor a "greatest hits" but simply a compilation of great Tori Amos songs. The first half of the album is the "rockier" one, with such classics as "Precious Things" (Tori's best song ever?), "Cornflake Girl", "God", "Spark", "Crucify" and the new song "Angels" which sounds straight out of "Scarlet's Walk". The second half is the more reflective half, with "Mr. Zebra", "Me and a Gun", "Baker Baker" and the new ballad "Snow Cherries from France", quite beautiful.  The problem with this compilation is that it ignores, for whatever reason, the latter part of Tori's career: only 1 song ("Bliss") from the terrific "To Venus and Back", nothing from "Strange Little Girls" and, due to contractual label issues, also nothing from last year's "Scarlet's Walk". That means only 1 song from Tori's last 5 years! Also missing from earlier albums are essential songs/hits such as "Caught a Light Sneeze" and "Hey Jupiter". Why? The bonus DVD puzzles me completely. Sure, the 3 songs on it (recorded at a soundcheck on Tori's 2003 summer tour) are terrific, in particular "Honey", with Matt Chamberlain (drums) and Jon Evans (bass) providing excellent support. However, considering that a DVD can contain 3+ hours of content, we get 15 minutes?? What is the point of that?
