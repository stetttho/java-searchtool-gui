 Following "Shiver, "Yellow" and "Trouble", "Don't Panic" is the 4th single off Coldplay's debut CD "Parachutes". This single has 3 tracks and runs 11 min. "Don't Panic" is the lead-off track from the album, and is a 2'17" gem of a song. Starting of gently with Chris on accoustic guitar, the song then drives into the chorus, featuring Coldplay's unofficial motto "We Live in a Beautiful World". One phrase seldom has captured the essence of a band as well as this one. When the song reaches the end, you can't wait to hear it again. Track 2 is a live version of "You Only Live Twice", yes, the title track to the James Bond movie! Coldplay used this song as the set closer on their February US tour. While staying true to the song, Coldplay nevertheless makes it its very own. A great example on how to treat a cover song. Track 3 is a live version of "Bigger Stronger" (which is the lead-off track from their "Blue Room EP"). One can tell that the band has "matured" into the song, and this version is perhaps better than the early studio version. Very enjoyable. Perhaps not as great a single as "Shiver", but definitely a great addition for any Coldplay fan.
