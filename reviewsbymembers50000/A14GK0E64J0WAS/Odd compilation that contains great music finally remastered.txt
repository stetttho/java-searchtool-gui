 The number of Rolling Stones compilation albums is staggering, and this album is an oddity among them: not a greatest hits album, not a rarities album, it is a little bit of both, and some more. Originally issued on vinyl in 1981, it had been long out of print on CD, but now it is finally reissued, and in great remastered sound.  "Sucking in the Seventies" (10 tracks, 41 min.) starts off with a blistering "Shattered". The sequencing of songs has no rhyme or reason. From a reggae-flavored "Hot Stuff" (from the "Black and Blue" album) we go back to the 1974 ballad "Time Waits for No One". "Fool to Cry" is one of the few true greatest hits on here, which is followed by 2 obscure live tracks (the bluesy "Mannish Boy" and the terrific "When the Whip Comes Down"). We then get the outtake "If I Was a Dancer (Dance Pt. 2)" (from the "Emotional Rescue" recording sessions), and my favorite track here. The album closes with the great rocker "Crazy Mama" and the ballad "Beast of Burden".  Regretfully this reissue comes without any liner notes or credits whatsoever, what is up with that? Also, while the original vinyl album was constrained in length, there are no additional songs (why not include "Miss You" or other obscure live tracks?). Nevertheless, despite its flaws, "Sucking in the Seventies" contains a lot of great music, some of which you can't find on any other Stones albums.
