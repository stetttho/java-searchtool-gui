 "Godbluff" is VDGG's first in a trilogy of 1975/1976 "come-back" albums (followed by "Still Life" and "World Record"). There are only 4 tracks, each at about 9 min. and while these days a 37 min. album is inexusable, in the 1975 vinyl era, things were different. "The Undercover Man" starts off in a hush-like atmosphere of Hammill's voice and Jackson's flute, eventually rounding out to the full classic line-up with Evans (on drums) and Banton (on keyboards). "Scortched Earth" is more urgent in sound, and more complex; with Banton on the forefront, it reminds me of early Genesis. "Arrow" is the most "experimental" track of the album, but quite good. The album-ending "The Sleepwalkers" is the true gem of the album, finding the band's sound focust and tight, if not melodic. "Godbluff" is IMHO the most accessible of the 3 come-back albums, and a great introduction to VDGG. Too bad we are still waiting for remastered editions of all of them, because the sound is a bit dull. As far as the music goes, this is prime!
