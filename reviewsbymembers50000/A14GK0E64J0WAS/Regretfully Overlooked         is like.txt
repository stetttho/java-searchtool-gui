 After the Human League issued the great "back to basics" album "Octupus" in 1995, they took 6 years to follow up with "Secrets", which is as close as ever the League have come to their pinnacle album "Dare!", issued in 1981. "Secrets" covers 16 songs in 51 min., 9 "real" tracks with 7 short instrumentals interwoven. The leadoff track (also the 1st single) is "All I Ever Wanted", with an instantly likeable hook reminiscent of old times. "Secrets" has primarily upbeat tracks, thankfully leaving "ballads" to a mimimum (only one, really, "Never Give Your Heart"). The best track is "Reflections", a 6+ min. blowout of funk techno pure danceable fun, check out the 2 min. outro, just great! The short instrumentals are quite fun, and flow well within the overall sound of the album.  The album has not gotten a lot of attention in the US. But for the League fans, this album is a great treat. 2001 is like 1981!
