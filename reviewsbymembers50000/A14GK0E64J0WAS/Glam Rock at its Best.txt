 T. Rex was an enormous commercial force for only 3 years (1971 through 1973), but its legacy is huge. Interest in the band has gone up and down over the years, but after 30 (!) years, they are still to be dealt with, and with reason. In a short span, Mark Bolan (the creative force behind the band), gave us an unforgettable collection of songs, including "Hot Love", "Jeepster", "Telegram Sam", "Children of the Revolution", "Metal Guru", "20th Century Boy", and of course the best known of  them all "Get It On (Bang A Gong)", remade many times since then. But when you go beyond those hits, you'll find many other jems, such as "Mambo Sun", "Planet Queen", "The Motivator", and "Monolith". T. Rex was already on the way down before Mark Bolan's death in a car accident in 1977. Nevermind. This collection shows why the band remains relevant, after all these years.
