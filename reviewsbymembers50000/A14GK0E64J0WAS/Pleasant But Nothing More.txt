 Multi-instrumentalist Pete Yorn blew on the musical scene with the great "musicforthemorningafter". Here comes the sophomore album "Day I Forgot" and the question is whether Pete takes to the next level. The answer is, regretfully, no. "Day I Forgot" (14 tracks, 42 min.) starts of promisingly with "Come Back Home", the best song on the album, giving us the same urgency that Pete projected on "musicforthemorningafter". But after that, things settle in with middle-of-the-road songs that you forget as soon as you've heard them. "Long Way Down" (not to be confused with the GooGooDolls song of the same name) is typical of that: mid-tempo, pleasant, but instantly forgettable. "Burrito" is one of the better songs, with Pete rocking hard. But the album just doesn't equate to the level of exitement of his debut album, nor of his live performances for that matter. I wonder where Pete Yorn will evolve from here. Another album like this will squander the cred he built up with his great debut album. "Day I Forgot" is not a bad album, it's just not a memorable one, unlike his debut.
