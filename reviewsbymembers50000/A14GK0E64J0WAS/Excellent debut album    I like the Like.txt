 Rating: 4.5 Stars if new to the Like; 4 Stars for the rest of us.  I don't know how or where exactly my 15 yr. old daughter heard about the Like, but last year she downloaded a free song from the Like's website, and based on that we bought the 3 self-released EPs the band had issued in 2004 from their website (no longer available, I might add), and they were excellent. Based on the strength of those EPs, the band obtained a record deal. Fast-forward one year, and here we are.  "Are You Thinking What I'm Thinking" (13 tracks; 47 min.) brings us a nice mix of poppy rock, and I mean that as a compliment. The album is well-sequenced: from opener "June Gloom" to (first single) "What I Say and What I mean", and on, the set of 13 songs really flows well, with hardly a weak moment. Other highlights include, among others, "(I'll Sit Here) Waiting", the pensive "Bridge to Nowhere" and the rocking "Under the Paving Stones". (Incidentally, the singer of the band reminds me of the Pretenders' Chrissie Hynde.)   Another comparison that comes to mind is Eisley. Similar to this band, Eisley released some EPs and then their excellent debut album earlier this year. The music of the Like is a bit edgier than Eisley, but generally is the same smart pop sense.  Finally, I rate this album "only" 4 stars since about half of the album are songs that come from the self-released EPs (similar to Eisley's debut album). We want more new songs! But if you're new to the Like, there is a lot of great new music to discover and, urr, to like. Highly recommended!
