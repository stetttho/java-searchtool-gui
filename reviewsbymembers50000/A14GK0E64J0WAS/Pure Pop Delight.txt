 While in the US we're just now getting "Turn/Why Does It Always Rain On Me" issued as a single, Travis fans in Europe were treated in June to this delightful CD of new Travis material. The lead-off track "Coming Around", a UK top 5 hit, is an upbeat 3 min. track, with an accoustic sound reminiscent of the Byrds/Tom Petty, the perfect singalong song for the summer that was about to start in Europe. Track 2, "Rock 'n (Salad) Roll" is a 2 min. romper that goes back to Travis' harder songs found on their inital album "Good Feeling". Track 3 is a cover of the Band's "The Weight", which Travis also played during the encore of its just concluded US tour. Clocking in at 10 min., this CD single is pure pop delight from start to finish. A must have for any Travis fan. (Please note that I had trouble ordering this CD from the US Amazon site, but had immediate success ordering from the UK Amazon site, which worked out quite well, given the strong US dollar exchange rate!)
