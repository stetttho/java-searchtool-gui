 The Yeah Yeah Yeahs finally deliver their full-fledged debut alnum, and what a treat it is. This is a blast of garage rock that is most welcome. The trio that makes up the YYYs take their spare instruments to the fullest (not unlike the White Stripes, in fact).   "Fever to Tell" (11 tracks, plus "hidden" track, 37 min.) starts of with a rocking "Rich". Singer Karen O. is all over the song, without going overboard. (As the songs go by, I couldn't help but be reminded of Chrissy Hynde's similar voice.) Other standouts include "Man" and the slashing "Cold Night". An interesting thing happens towards the end of the album: quieter songs come up and really resonate: "Maps" is a pensive standout, as is "Modern Romance" and the hidden track (about one min, after "Modern Romance" ends). "Fever to Tell" is a terrific album all around. The YYYs are coming soon to Cincinnati, and I can't wait to see how their live show translates their songs... Meanwhile, this is a highly-recommended album!
