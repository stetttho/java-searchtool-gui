 Louisville's My Morning Jacket have released what is, in my opinion, the best and most adventurous album of 2005, "Z". It is hard to believe how much MMJ has matured in just a span of 6 years.  "Tennessee Fire" (16 tracks, 57 min.) is the 1999 debut album of My Morning Jacket, and quite a trip, frankly. It brings mostly a very intimate, low-key sound, which works well if the mood strikes you right. Many of the tracks don't even feature drums, and are just bare and not very melodic. Sometimes it works (such as on "Nashville to Kentucky"), sometimes it doesn't. This is pretty much a "hit-and-miss" affair. Much has been made about the "low-fi" sound of the album, but that doesn't bother me nearly as much as the lenghth of the album. Cut about 3 or 4 of the weakest tracks from here, and we have a 4 star album. The last 'bonus' track is an interesting instrumental, just beautiful.  I have seen MMJ in concert a number of times in the last 2 years, and they have out-grown their humble beginnings, no question, in fact I would put MMJ as one of the top live bands out there these days. "Tennessee Fire" is a fine album in its own right, but MMJ has gone on to much better things ("It Still Moves Me" and "Z").
