 "Say Hello to the Angels" is the third single off of Interpol's debut CD "Turn On the Bright Lights", one of the very best releases of 2002. The album has generated great buzz, and through non-stop touring since last Fall, it seems that Interpol might break out of the "indie" circuit and reach greater audiences. As the 2 best tracks on "Turn on the Bright Lights" (PDA; Obstacle 1) already have been released as singles, the record label faces a tough task in deciding on the next single. Matador came out with a "split decision", and chose a "double A" sides single: "Say Hello to the Angels" is another great, up-tempo, guitar wall-of-sound track. "NYC" is the most intravert song on the album, an ode of sorts to Interpol's hometown ("New York Cares"). The last track is a demo version of "NYC". These are great songs, and deserve a larger audience. But if you have the album already, why buy this? Rather than a demo-version of "NYC", the label should have added some live tracks of recent shows, or other hard-to-find tracks like "5", "Precipitate" or "Specialist". If on the other hand you don't own the album yet and just wanna sample Interpol, this is a great way to start.
