 Editors stormed on the UK music scene in early 2005 with the single "Bullets", and haven't looked back since. The band's sound is reminiscent of Echo and the Bunnymen and Interpol (I played the CD to my 16 yr. old daughter and after 2 songs she said "hey, this sounds like Interpol", and she meant it as a compliment).   "The Back Room" (11 tracks, 43 min.) starts off with a 2'30 min. blazing "Lights", with lead singer Tom Smith proclaiming "I've Got A Million Things To Say", and boy, do they ever. Outstanding songs follow: "Munich" (the second UK single) is mesmerizing, "Blood" (third  UK single) is almost danceable, in a dark kinda way. Other highlights include "All Sparks" (fourth UK single), the epic "Open Your Arms" and the closer "Distance", but there really isn't a weak track on the album. "Munich" is actually getting some airplay on alternative radio stations in the US, and you can just feel this band is going places. Editors will be coming to Cincinnati in a few weeks, and you can be sure that I will not miss that show!  Many have commented that this album is the UK's response to Interpol's "Turn on the Bright Lights", and I have to agree. This is a near-perfect album, drenched with urgency from beginning to end, just beautiful. Upon being released in the UK it begged the question not if but when this album would find a US release and a US audience. Well, it's here and it's finding an audience! Highly recommended!
