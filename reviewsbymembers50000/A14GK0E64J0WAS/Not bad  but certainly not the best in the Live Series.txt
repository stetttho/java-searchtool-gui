 Set 1: 4.5 stars; Set 2: 3.5 stars  "Live 02" is the second in the series of (so far) 20 shows officially released by Phish (more are available via its website). "Live 02" (23 tracks, 3 CDs, 154 min.) was recorded at the end of the Summer '94 tour, in Phish's home state of Vermont, always a good omen of good things to come.  Set 1 is the treasure of this set, starting off with an excellent "Golgi Apparatus" which immediately puts you in the middle of great jamming, it's like the band skipped 'warming up'. Other highlights include a superb "The Lizards", a great little song, "Silent in the Morning" with subtle guitar work from Trey, and a blazing "Maze". Set 2 (on CD2 and CD3) is very uneven IMHO. I can't get into the 19 min. "Antelope" at all, just not my kind of jamming. "Harpua" includes Trey 'telling a story' but it takes too long. "AC/DC" is good but I've heard (much) better versions. Much is made up by a delicious "Harry Hood", the best track of this set.  There is really no 'bad' outing in the 'Live' series, but (and this is subjective of course) there are better 'Live' sets (some of my favorites are 18 and 20).
