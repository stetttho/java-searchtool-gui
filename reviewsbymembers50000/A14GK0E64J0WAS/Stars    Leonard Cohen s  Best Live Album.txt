 In 1979 Leonard Cohen (45 years at that time) was touring behind the just-released "Recent Songs". 22 years later Columbia released this album, and none too soon, as it proves to be the best live album of Leonard Cohen to date. "Field Commander Cohen: Tour 0f 1979" (12 tracks, 63 min.) gives us a great mix of Cohen songs old and new. There are 4 tracks of the then-new "Recent Songs" album, including a great "The Guests". Leonard's back-up band is Passenger, a jazz-band which appears also on "Recent Songs, and they are outstanding throughout, perhaps nowhere better than on "Lover Lover Lover" which comes with an extended instrumental intro, just beautiful. The set includes of course old staples like "Hey That's No  Way to Say Goodbye", "So Long Marianne" and "The Stranger Song", all from Leonard's 1967 debut album. The question always has been whether Leonard was a great poet who happened to write some darn good songs, or whether he was a terrific singer-songwriter in his own right. This live album should answer that debate for once and all. "Field Commander Cohen" is a terrific testament to Cohen's songs and live preformances. Strongly recommended!
