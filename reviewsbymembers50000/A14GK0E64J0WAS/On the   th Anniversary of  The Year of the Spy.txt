 When I read the insight flap of the book, I was immediately attracked to this. The author spent more than 30 years working for the KBG, inculding two tours working from Washington.  At the beginning of "Spy Handler" (338 pages), Victor Cherkashin (and ghost writer Gregory Feifer) makes clear that if one was expecting James Bond-like "jump out of the plane" situations, this is not the book for you. Indeed, Cherkashin explains that a lot of the "spy" related work is in fact very mondane work, sifting through lots of information. A good part of the book is devoted to 1985, the so-called "Year of the Spy", because so many deep penetrations on both sides (KBG/CIA) occurred that year. Cherkashin's most famous involvement is for "handling" both Aldrich Ames and Robert Hanssen when they decided to spy for the KGB, and those pages read like a Le Carre thriller, expect of course this is real leife, not some novel.  Very interesting also is the next-to-last chapter, dealing with the post-1991 era. Cherkashin does not hide his disdain for Gorbachev, whom he blames for the break-up of the Soviet Union. Cherkashin left the KGB in 1991, and now runs a security firm. Somewhat ironic is that his daughter eventually married an American. That said, even though Cherkashin of course wants the KGB to "win", his repsect for his counterparts at the CIA and for the US is very clear as well. Overall, a very interesting book, even if you're not as such into "spy" stuff.
