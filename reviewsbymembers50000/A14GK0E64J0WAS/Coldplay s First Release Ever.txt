 In 1998, Coldplay was toiling away in London pubs when they got noticed by someone from Fierce Panda Records, which offered the band a one single release contract. In March 1999 the label released this 3 track single, which immediately attracked great buzz, leading to a bidding war among bigger labels and some months later the band signed a "major label" deal with Capitol. "Brothers & Sisters" (3 tracks; 11 min.) is a fascinating look into early-Coldplay. The title track is quite good, and the band later re-recorded the track as a B side for the "Trouble" single in 2000. "Easy to Please" is a dreamy track, with Chris Martin crooning away over sparse instruments. "Only Superstition" finds the band rocking harder, a nice track. In all, a very welcome re-release of Coldplay's earliest recording. Definitely highly recommended for those of you who (like me) are charmed by the "Parachutes" sound.
