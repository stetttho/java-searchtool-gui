 This is the 3rd go-around of Foreigner's best, following 1982's "Records" and 1992's "The Very Best... and Beyond". So what does "Complete Greatest Hits" (20 tracks, 77 min.) have to add to this? There is little difference in the songs found on "The Very Best" and "Ultimate Greatest Hits". The major difference is that "Ultimate" sequences the songs chronologically, and it really does make it a much better listen overall. A nice touch is that "Ultimate" includes "Soul Docter", one of the new songs on "The Very Best". In the end, "Ultimate" is your best choice. As always, the great folks at Rhino did a great job packaging the CD, with great liner notes and pictures. It is worth recalling that Foreigner really did have a major splash on the singles and album charts for a ten year period (1977-87). That is a LONG time. I happen to have seen them twice in the last year (actually, one of those was "The Lou Gramm Band", haha). Couldn't help but wonder what was going through Lou's head when he was singing the lines "That Was Yesterday/ When I Had the World in My Hand/ But It's Not the End of the World/ Just a Slight Change in Plans".
