 Less than a month following my review (posted below), I heard today that Stuart Adamson, leadsinger and guitarist of Big Country, was found dead in a hotel room in Hawaii, at age 43. Say it ain't so!! Whatever the reasons behind his death (apparently he had been battling many demons in recent years), Adamson may be gone, but he is not forgotten! Check out "The Crossing" CD and you wonder why Adamson sold himself short... Peace to wherever you are, Stuart!
