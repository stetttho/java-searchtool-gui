 (A side: 3 stars; B sides: 4 stars) This is the second single from "Rush of Blood to the Head". "The Scientist" is the A side, a mid-tempo piano-driven ballad. As a song, it doesn't do all that much for me, I thought it to be one of the lesser tracks on the album. (Check out the incredible video, though...) The B sides are far more interesting. "1:36" (which actually lasts 2:02) is one of the hardest rocking tracks ever from Coldplay, and Coldplay has performed it regularly at gigs. It starts off with a heavy guitar riff which continues throughout the song. I found it instantly recognizable, but it took me a while to place it: it is the EXACT same riff as the title track of AC/DC's "Ballbreaker", check it out! "I ran away" is also a mid-tempo song (guitar-driven, though), and in my opinion a much better song than "The Scientist". In all, Coldplay has released better singles, but "1:36" is the curiosity that will make Coldplay fans seek out this single.
