 I saw Collective Soul live for the first time in 1995 when they opened for Van Halen. There was electricity in the air, that's how much energy they brought. I've seen them many times since then, and they never disappoint live. I've never understood why the band (or their label) never issued a live album. Well that has finally been corrected!  "Home" (2 CDs; 22 tracks; 97 min.) brings the best of 2  homecoming concerts Collective Soul held in April 2005 in Atlanta. The additional "twist" is the Atlanta Youth Symphony Orchestra. Before you wonder whether this is another one of those forced concoctions (remember Metallica with symphony? or KISS with symphony?), strings always have played an important role in Collective Soul's music, in particular its ballads. And the "Home" album bears this out: on the tracks where a symphonic sound comes natural, it really works very well (check out for example "The World I Know", "December", and "Pretty Donna"). THe inclusion of "Youth" is interesting as that track did not make it onto the album of the same name. Ed Roland is in good form (and humor) throughout. By the time the encore "Shine" comes along, I was surprised how quickly it all passed by.  Collective Soul now has plans to release individual shows from the Fall 2005 tour as well. To which I say: bring it on! We have been without a live album too long, from famine we go to feast. (The fact that the band now self-releases its records surely has a hand in that.) All that aside, "Home" is a thoroughly enjoyable live album, and a must for the serious Collective Soul fan.
