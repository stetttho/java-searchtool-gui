 Greatest hits albums are generally a "hit and miss" thing, it's amazing how often they don't get it right (last year's REM comes to mind right away), so I'm happy to report that 311's collection is pretty much on the button. "Greatest Hits '93-'03" (17 tracks, 59 min.) contains 311's 14 best known songs, plus 3 new tracks. Altough I generally prefer greatest hits compilations to run chronologically, this is not the case here, but it nevertheless works. The set starts off rightfully with 311's greatest hit ever, "Down" (from the Blue Album), which brought the band mainstream success and is as fresh now as it was in 1995. In fact, it's a bit surprising that the Blue Album gets only 3 tracks, given its massive success. After "Down", the hits and best known songs just keep rolling along: "All Mixed Up", "Amber", "Transistor", "Come Original", etc, it's all here, not to forget the early (but now classic) "Homebrew". The new songs are "Love Song", a Cure cover from the "50 Dates" soundtrack earlier this year (and the weakest song on the set), "How Do You Feel" and a blazing "First Straw", one of their best ever and reason enough to buy this of you have all of 311's albums (like I do). 311 is one of my fave bands, and it pleases me to no end to see them get the royal treatment with this greatest hits set. If you are a casual 311 fan (if there is such a thing), you won't be disappointed with this compilation. BUY IT!
