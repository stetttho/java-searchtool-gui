 It's been 4 years since the excellent "Dizzy Up The Girl" and I regretfully must report that "Gutterflower" is a disappointment. At 12 tracks (just over 41 min.), Johnny Rzeznik wrote 8 of the songs (that's an avearage of 1 song every 6 months!), with Robby Takac clocking in the other 4 tracks. The opener "Big Machine" is the album's best track by far, combining true-and-tried GGD hooks with smart lyrics. From there on, it's a mixed bag. The "hit" single "Here Is Gone" is quite good, but Johnny doens't have much else up his sleeve, despite the 4 year lay-off. Strangly it's always reliable, even if not in the same spotlight, Robby who provides some much needed punch on songs like "Up Up Up" and "Smash". Even though I am a long-time GGD fan, I'm not craving for the "old days" all-out rock albums like "Superstar Car Wash", but this album pales compared to latter day GGD "Dizzy Up the Girl", plain and simply.
