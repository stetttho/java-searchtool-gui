 Aerosmith has released a number of live albums over the years, most recently the 2CD "A Little South of Sanity", and generally with mixed results. Somehow it has eluded the band to transfer the live experience (which is outstanding most of the time) onto CD.   "Rockin' the Joint" (11 tracks, 58 min.) was recorded in January, 2002 during the tour supporting the then-just released "Just Push Play" album. The opener from that album "Beyond Beautiful" also kicks off things here, and the band sounds as tight as ever. After that, the song selection focuses mostly on 1970s tunes, including "Same Old Song and Dance", "Draw the Line", "Walk This Way", "No More No More" and a really great "Rattlesnake Shake". The inclusion of "I Don't Want to Miss a Thing" is a huge mistake, as it cuts the momentum midway through the album, and furthermore the song simply does not fit musically with the rest of the album.  "Rockin' the Joint" was released in October, 2005, without much fanfare, almost 3 years after being recorded, which begs the question: why now? While the band sounds tight and focused throughout, there is no overall theme or direction, and thus there is no real compelling reason for this live collection. Which leaves Aerosmith still looking for that ultimate live album release that has eluded them for so long.
