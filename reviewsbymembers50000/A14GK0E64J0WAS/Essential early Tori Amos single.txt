 What a delight this single (5 tracks, 20 min.) is for any Tori fan. "Winter" is one of several singles from Tori's debut album "Little Earthquakes" (the better known singles are "Crucify" and "Precious Things").  "Winter" is a beautiful ballad. The 4 B-sides are wat make this a true find. "The Pool" is an eerie song, just Tori's mesmorising vocals, no instruments. "Take to the Sky" is a jazzy type song, one that Tori has performed on occasion on her current "Scarlet's Walk" tour. "Sweet Dreams" is an uptempo "intermezzo", quite nice. "Upside Down" is another beautiful ballad, not unlike "Winter".  In all, a great addition to any Tori fan's collection.
