 After I recently watched the outstanding PBS "Country Boys" documentary about 2 Appalechian high school boys trying to make it to college, a friend of mine brought this book to my attention.  In "Diamonds in the Dew" (122 pages), author Nora Stanger retells her own struggles growing up dirt-poor in the Appalechian and how she eventually went to college and grad school, and now is a successfull "motivational' speaker on the matter. Stanger takes enormous pride in her Appalechian upbringing, and makes many valid points on how to overcome the negative stereotypes of the Appalechian culture. Stanger goes into depth about the "guilt" feeling of rising out of the roots and becoming a successful person, all the while also pointing out the misconceptions people have that have not had to deal with such adversity (count me as one). In the later chapters, Stanger give lots of useful advice to those that are hoping to one time reach out of that despair.   In an ideal world, this book would be required reading in high schools. "Diamonds in the Dew" is a sobering (for those of us not used to those adversities), yet uplifting read, rooted in a strong religious background, which Stanger points out is a critical element in the Appalechian culture. As a Christian, I can only say that this book is highly recommended!
