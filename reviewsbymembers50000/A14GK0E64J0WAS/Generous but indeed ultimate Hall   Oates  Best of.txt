 Hall & Oates have been compiled numerous times over the years, both in the US and even more so overseas (I think there are more "best of" albums than regular studio albums.) However, the compilations issued in the US have been less than stellar for a number of reasons. That has been rectified, once and for all, with this collection.  "Ultimate Daryl Hall + John Oates" (37 tracks, 156 min.) gives a chronological overview of all the Hall & Oates hits and other notable tracks. CD1 (20 tracks, 78 min.) starts with 1973's "She's Gone", which still sounds surprisingly strong after all these years, followed by such hits as "Sara Smile", "Rich Girl", "You've Lost that Lovin' Feelin'". The last 7 tracks, starting with "Kiss on My List", is where Hall & Oates really took off, and ruled the charts. CD2 (17 tracks, 78 min.) starting with 1981's "Maneater", continues that streak of top hits. After "Method of Modern Love" things start to level off. The very last track is the 'come-back' hit from 2002 "Do It For Love", which sounds way too "VH1"-ish for my taste.  This collection is just about perfect, even a bit overgenerous (too many hits for 1 CD, but not-quite-enough to fill 2 CDs). Thankfully the collection runs chronologically. Hall & Oates' heydays were about 20 years ago, and while some of their songs have that icky "80s sound" to them, one must admit that Hall & Oates did bring us an impressive string of hits.
