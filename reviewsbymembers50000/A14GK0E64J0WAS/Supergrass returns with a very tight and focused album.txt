 Supergrass has had an up-and-down career, starting with the blazing debut album "I Should Coco" in 1995, an album they are  still trying to live up to, 10 years later. 2002's "Life on Other Planets", their most recent album before this one, divided the Supergrass fans, some thought is was outstanding, others (like me) were quite disappointed.  "Road to Rouen" (9 tracks, 35 min.), issued in Fall, 2005, is a great return to form. The band is highly focused, and sounds re-energized after a 3 year lay-off. While only lasting a little over half an hour, the album brings a LOT, starting with the opener "Tales of Endurance (Parts 4, 5 & 6)" (making you wonder where the first 3 parts are). The other epic song on here is "Roxy", a 6+ min. minutely built song, just beautiful. Interestingly, it is followed by a short and funny instrumental, "Coffee in the Pot", showing that the band hasn't lost its sense of humor. The upbeat title track is a tribute to the fact Supergrass recorded this album in France. The closer "Fin" ("end" in French) is a sweet 'ballad' in the way only Supergrass can bring it.  While a major act in their native England, major success has always eluded Supergrass in the US, and this album has not changed that. Nevermind, "Road to Rouen" is a top-notch album, and highly recommended.
