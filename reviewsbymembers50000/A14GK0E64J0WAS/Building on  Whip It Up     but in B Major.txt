 On the heels of last year's excellent "Whip It Up" EP (recorded in B Minor...), here comes the Raveonettes' debut album (13 songs, 33 min.). The Danish duo continue to 'whip out' short songs (just about all are 2'30"), carving out songs that are surf-reminiscent-but-with a twist, with great result. Things start off nice and easy with "Remember", but really start cooking with "Noisy Summer", with distorted guitars and noises all over the place. "The Love Gang" is the Beach Boys 21st century style. "Let's Rave On" just, urr, raves! The best songs, though, are on the second half of the album. "Heartbreak Stroll", the best song on the album, just rocks great, on the same surfer beat, as does "Untamed Girls". The title track is another stand-out, with the sarcastic chorus 'I'm a Jailbird, Baby, Cuz I'm Not in Love with You', haha! The CD's sleeve jacket is strangely reminiscnt of Marlo Brando-era "The Wild Ones" movie, and I guess that's the image Sune Rose Wagner and Sharin Foo want to project. This is a fine, fun album. Short and sweet. Rock on to the Raveonettes!
