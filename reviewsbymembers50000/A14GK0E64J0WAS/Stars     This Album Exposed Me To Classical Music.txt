 My oldest sister got the original vinyl album. I was intruiged by the cover (a glorious color photo of an empty Royal Albert Hall) and inside picture (a grainy black and white picture of Deep Purple surrounded by the orchestra in front of an overflowing Albert Hall). When I heard the album, I couldn't quite believe my ears. Here's the orchestra creating beautful sounds, there comes the band crashing in with heavy metal! And it all somehow hangs together! Recorded 35 years ago, two-thirds of that magical evening is now avaible (still missing: the opener Sixth Symphony of conductor and composer Malcolm Arnold). After the opening symphony, Deep Purple then came on for a short 3 song set (which was not featured on the vinyl album, but is included on the CD reissue). That set is incredible: Hush, the instrumental Wreck That Neck, and the then-still unreleased, unrecorded and unknown Child in Time (explaining why there was no reaction from the crowd when Ian Gillan announces the song).  Last but not least comes the Jon Lord-composed "Concerto for Group and Orchestra". The 1st Movement is still my favorite, because it takes it time setting the table and then magically making the way for an instrumental hard rocking jam by the band, with a blazing solo by Ritchie Blackmore. The 2nd Movement is my least fave of the three, as it is too timid (and reminding me at one point of the Moody Blues, argh!!). The 3rd Movement however is explosive, and includes an amazing drum solo by Ian Paice, only to then go to an incredible explosive final of band and orchstra. Wow!  A year after this album Deep Purple started its string of now-classic albums "In Rock", "Fireball" and "Machine Head". However, the "Concerto for Group and Orchestra" album is just as adventurous in its own right. I "borrowed" the album from my sister, and sure am glad to have it on CD now. Buy it, you won't be disappointed!
