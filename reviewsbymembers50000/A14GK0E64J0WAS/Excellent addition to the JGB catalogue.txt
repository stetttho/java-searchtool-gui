 Given the reputation of Garcia, it's surprising that there are not all that many live Jerry Garcia Band releases.Sslowly but surely more JGB concerts are finally being released. JGB has always played second fiddle to the Dead, and that's regrettable as JGB should be seen as complimentary to the Dead, not in competition.  "After Midnight - Keane College 2/28/80" (16 tracks; 3 CDs; 165 min.) features a short-lived 4 person line-up of JGB. Besides Jerry, there is also John Kahn on bass, Ozzie Ahlers on keyboards, and John de Foncenza on drums. The band is super-tight throught the evening, starting with "Sugaree" (one of only 2 Garcia/Hunter songs in the set). There are 2 great Dulan covers, including a delightful "Knocking on Heaven's Door". The set also includes a guest appearance from Robert Hunter on vocals, doing his own "Tiger Rose" and "Promontory Rider". The cover of Allen Toussaint's "I'll Take a Melody" also works very nicely. But the brightest star on this set is the 25 min. medley of "After Midnight>Eleanor Rigby>After Midnight (Reprise)", with everone in the band getting an opportunity to stretch out, although the best of course comes from Garcia's solos.  Somewhat awkwardly, the first set of the evening goes about 85 min, and thus does not fit on a single CD, reason this release ended up as a 3CD release. The liner notes from Robert Hunter are a nice addition and the overall packaging is top notch, courtesy of the wonderful folks at Rhino, reliable as usual. In short, "After Midnight" is a great addition to the Jerry Garcia Band catalogue.
