 Starting this review, I must admit that I miss the Afghan Whigs, one of the finest bands ever to come out of my city, Cincinnati. That said, Greg Dulli's current band, the Twilight Singers, is slowly finding its footing, and "Blackberry Belle", their second album, testifies to that. "Blackberry Belle" (11 tracks, 44 min.) is a mood-piece, no question about that. It only takes you the opening piano bars of the lead-off track " Martin Eden" to realize that. "Teenage Wristband" is one of the few up-tempo tracks, and rocks great. The mesmorizing "Decatur St." is another stand-out, my favorite track on the album. Thankfully the CD comes with the songs' lyrics, which are an important aspect of Dulli's songs. The overall feel of the album is helped greatly by the sequencing of the tracks, which move along at a nice clip, even the slower songs. No unnecessary filler here. Given the widespread acceptance of alternative rock in the early and mid 90s, it still amazes me to this day that the Afghan Whigs never found a larger audience (I don't think any of their albums ever broke the Billboard 200). Times have changed, and surely this album will not go beyond a small but core audience. A shame, really.
