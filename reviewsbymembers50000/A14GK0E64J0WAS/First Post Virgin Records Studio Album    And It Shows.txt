 "Le Parc", originally issued in 1985, is TD's first studio album after concluding their relationship with Virgin Records on 1983's Hyperborea", and the change in record labels somehow translates also in a profound change in musical styles. "Le Parc" marks the beginning of a slow but sure descend into less adventerous, more "new age" type of albums. "Le Parc" has its moments, though. Consisting of 9 fairly short pieces (the entire CD clocks in at 41 min.), TD paints musical impressions of parks around the world. The best tracks are "Bois de Boulogne", "Gaudi Park" with a nice drum-driven pulse to it, "Le Park-LA Streethawk" which sounds like a TV theme (and...it is!), and, best of all, "Zen Garden", a terrific piece with nice oriental music flashes. "Yellowstone Park", which concludes the album, is best known for featuring the female voice found on Pink Floyd's "The Great Gig In The Sky". As correctly noted elsewhere, most TD fans fall in either of 2 groups (pre-1983 vs. later recordings). "Le Parc" and "Underwater Sunlight" are transition albums between those 2 eras, and probably the only albums both groups can still find solace. Bottom line, "Le Parc" is not a bad album, but TD had done so much better!
