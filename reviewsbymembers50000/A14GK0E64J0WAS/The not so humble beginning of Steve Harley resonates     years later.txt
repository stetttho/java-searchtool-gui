 Steve Harley made a huge impact in the mid-70's, with 1975's "The Best Years of Our Life" as the exclamation point. But his band, Cockney Rebel, came on the European music scene with this album, originally released in 1973, with a "new" concept: no electric guitars, but instead a violin as the lead instrument, what a concept!  "The Human Menagerie" (12 tracks, 51 min., including 2 bonus tracks) is mostly famous for its hit single "Sebastian", a 7 min. beautiful epic, yet slow and mostly quiet song, truly an enigma that this somehow found an audience (try imagine this today: not gonna happen!). But the album offers a lot more: the opener "Hideaway" is a delicious starter that perfectly introduces the band's "revolutionary" sound. "Mirror Freak" is another stand-out track, but the closer of the original album looms larger than any other: the 10 min. epic "Death Trip", with full-blown orchestration, just beautiful. This reissue comes with 2 bonus tracks: "Judy Teen", the great hit single released after this album and before the subsequent "Psychomodo" album, and "Rock and Roll Parade", the B-side.  Cockney Rebel is often classified as a "glam" band of the mid-70's era (based on their looks--check the album cover of "The Human Menagerie"), but that is just plain wrong. Their sound is unique. "The Human Menagerie" is a good album, but to hear Cockney Rebel at their peak, check out 1974's "Psychomodo", truly a classic.
