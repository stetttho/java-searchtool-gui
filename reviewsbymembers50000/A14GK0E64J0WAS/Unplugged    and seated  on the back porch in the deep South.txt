 Wow... where to begin? I am a huge fan of the band's first 2 albums ("B.R.M.C." and "Take Them On, On Your Own"). I knew the buzz was that the new album would be different. I've had the new album since it came out about 2 weeks ago, and have been listening to it quite a bit.   "Howl" (14 tracks, 52 min.) is not just an evolution from the previous sound, but as radical a departure that I can ever recall from a single band. The best way to imagine what this album sounds like it is to picture the band sitting on the back-porch somewhere in the deep, deep South about 100 years ago, and strumming along to some songs, all acoustic if course. The influences of gospel, blues and even country are everywhere. That said, if you can accept that a band can make such a musical departure, you can then start to appreciate the album for what it is, and the inevitable conclusion then is that "Howl" is a terrific album. From the opening sounds of the opener "Shuffle Your Feet", with a gospel choir filling the air, "Holw" is a mood piece that begs repeated listening. "Ain't No Easy Way" (UK single) is a short blast of acoustic jamming, but most songs are pensive ("Fault Line", "Restless Sinner", "Gospel Song" are good examples). This album reminds me in spirit of the "O Brother Where Art Thou?" soundtrack and it's no surprise then that T-Bone Burnett contributed as well to "Howl".  In all, this is a very nice album. If, however, you are looking for more of the sound of the first two BRMC albums, save your money and DON'T buy this. As a separate thought, I am really curious how BRMC is going to take this album on the road. I guess they'll simply have 2 different sets altogether, one for the old stuff, and one for the "Howl" songs. Maybe they'll change outfits as well. It would be appropriate. "Howl" is highly recommended!
