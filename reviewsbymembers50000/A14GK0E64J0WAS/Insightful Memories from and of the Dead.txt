 There have been many, many books on the Greatful Dead but Phil Lesh is the first of the Grateful Dead's original members to tell the inside story of what it really was like. The timing of his book couldn't be better of course, 2005 being the 40th anniversary of the band's start.  "Searching for the Sound" is roughly divided in 2 halves: the first half of the book goes up to December 1969 (Altamont), and the second half covers the period since then. Not surprisingly, the first half is by far the most interesting (I rate it 5 stars), giving amazing insights and details on how the band started, how the members found each other and how the music came to be. Particulary fun to read are Phil's accounts of the band's frightful performance at Woodstock (many people don't realize that the Dead in fact performed at Woodstock, as they did not appear in the movie), as well as how the band, which was slated to be the next-to-last act (before the Stones) to perform at Altamont, refused to come out due to the "bad vibes in the air" (how right they were!). The second half of the book (I rate it 3 stars) is far less appealing, as it is too much of "we then went on tour again (fill in the year and the location)".   Very surprising to me was that in the last 2 pages of the book, Phil refers to the Dead's "reunion weekend" at Alpine Valley in 2002 as "The Other Ones", but makes no mention whatsoever that in 2003 the surviving members decide to tour again (quite successfully at that) as "The Dead". (I must admit at being disappointed that the Dead are not touring this summer, given that this is the 40th anniversary of the band and the 10th anniversary of Jerry's passing away.) That said, this book makes for a mostly fun read, and if you like the Dead, this will make for an enjoyable beach read this summer.
