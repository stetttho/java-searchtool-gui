 The Cooper Temple Clause follow up last year's "See This Through and Leave" with "Kick Up The Fire" (10 tracks, 53 min.), with excellent results. For those not familiar with TCTC, think Hawkwind-meets-Radiohead-meets-Pink Floyd, but with more guitars. "Kick Up the Fire" is making serious waves in the UK, with the singles "Promises Promises" and "Blind Pilots", both of which are pretty straight-forward power-rock tunes. But it's on the more adventurous tracks that TCTC really shines. Take the opener "The Same Mistakes", sounding ambient yet pulsating. Even better is "New Toys", which is what Radiohead should sound like if they had the guts. The album's "piece-de-resistance" is the closing track "Written Apology", an epic 10 min. blow-out of piano, guitar and electronic noodling, fantastic! It's a crying shame that neither of The Cooper Temple Clause's album have been released in the US, but thankfully you can still purchase them on sites like... Amazon! Or you could happen to be on business in the UK, like I was. Either way, if you're a fan of "quality" alterna-rock, you will love this album.
