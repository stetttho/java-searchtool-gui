 Lyz Glick is a "single married" woman (as she and other women left behind by the 9/11 tragedy describe themselves), widow of Jeremy Glick, who perished on Flight 93. To say this book is moving would be doing it grave injustice, as it goes way beyond that.  "Your Father's Voice: Letters for Emmy About Life with Jeremy Blick--and Without Him After 9/11" is meant to be a collection of letters from mom Lyz to be read someday by daughter Emmy, all of 3 months old on 9/11, about how a loving and doting father Jeremy was, in many ways the more natural parent than Lyz herself, and Lyz readily admits so in the book. The book also paints a detailed picture how Lyz and Jer first met each other and were meant for each other, even though it took them quite a few years to fully realize it and actually get married.  The accounts by Lyz of the post-9/11 days, on how to deal with the grief, the endless inquiries from the FBI and other government officials, but also well-meaning if intrusive regular people, are heartbreaking. Yet one thing that struck me is how little reference Lyz makes to faith or Christ, even in the darkest of hours. Even though Jer and Lyz married in a religious ceremony, religion and an ultimate trust in the Lord (even if we cannot understand why certain things happen the way they do, we do know the Lord has an ultimate reason for everything) are strangely absent. Anyway, this book is highly recommended on many accounts. I wish Lyz and Emmy Glick nothing but the best as they try and move on with their lives.
