 While I generally do reviews on albums I really like, I thought I'd switch the tables and review an album I really dislike. Mind you, I am a big Cranberries fan, and have seen them in concert a number of times over the  years. When I bought this album and listened to it, I couldn't quite  believe what I heard. Save perhaps for "Promises", there really  isn't quite a memorable tune that I really enjoyed after listening to it.  Whatever happened to Dolores' muse?  OK, she's a happy mom now, but I  linger for the strength of songs found on, say, "No Need to  Argue". Don't buy this CD. Cranberries have a lot to offer, but it  sure doesn't show on this CD.
