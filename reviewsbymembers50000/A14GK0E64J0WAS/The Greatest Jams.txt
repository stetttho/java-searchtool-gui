 Can we all agree that the best Dead album is not one of their studio albums but a live album? If you accept that premise, it is nigh impossible to pinpoint which is their best live album. Rather, it comes down to what is the most enjoyable for you. That said, "So Many Roads" is probably the most enjoyable "album" (5 CDs totalling about 6 1/2 hrs) for me. The highlights are many, but flawless CD3 is what I play the most, which includes a sparkling "Eyes of the World (from 1974), the reggae-tinted "Estimated Prophet" (from 1979), and the sprawling "Shakedown Street" (from 1984). The jams are what this collection is all about, including 2 very different "Dark Star" verions, and even tracks that are just a snippet of jams, no song really. The earliest recordings from 1965-66 are really interesting, with the band still looking for a "definitive sound" but already presenting some great, tight melodies. CD5 includes 5 "rehearsal" tunes which dont really mix with the rest, but it does end gracefully with "So Many Roads" from their last concert in 95. Thankfully this collection progresses in chronological order, which makes for great listening enjoyment. All in all, while there are of course some lesser tracks, it is in my opinion the best of the Dead jams, and isn't that what the Dead is about? (For another great live album, check out Dick's Picks Vol. 24, from Cow Palace, SF (1974) with the definitive live "Scarlet Begonias", among others)
