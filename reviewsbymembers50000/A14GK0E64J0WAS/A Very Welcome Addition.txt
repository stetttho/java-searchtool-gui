 I agonized about buying this CD, but ultimately did and, perhaps because my expectations were limited (among others, because of the wildly varying reviews here on Amazon), I was very pleasantly surprised. This 1976 live  recording fits nicely between the 1975 Ricochet live CD and the 1977 Encore  live CD. The 41 min. track starts off tentatively, but gets really going  about 14 min. into it, with throbbing sequencers and Mellotrons all over  and a ripping Egdar Froese guitar for good measure. According to the liner  notes, the entire piece was improvised as they played along, which only  makes this even more intriguing and impressive. I'm trying to reconcile  this with the review of this CD by Christian Turk (see his review), and in  the end can only say that  it sure doesn't sound like we listened to the  same CD.  Finally, as to some complaints that this CD is "only"  41 min. long: get over it already! Ricochet and Rubycon clock in each well  under 40 min. and that doesn't bother anyone. Bottom line, I find this  album to be a very welcome addition to the classic Tangerine Dream  repertoire of the 73-77 era.
