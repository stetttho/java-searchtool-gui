 This import CD combines 2 of Simple Minds's early albums, albeit in a slight shortened version to get them on 1 CD (13 songs, 69 min.) While not attaining the greatness of the "New Gold Dream" CD that would come out 2 years later, this album has some really great tunes. Opener "In Trance as Mission" sets the tone, with a heavy bass. "Sweat in Bullet" has a nice intertwine between synths and guitar. "Boys from Brazil" is reminiscent of XTC-era "Making Plans for Nigel". Other standouts include instrumental "Theme for Great Cities", "20th Century Promised Land", and the best of all "The American", which truly foretells things to come on "New Gold Dream" and "Sparkle in the Rain". This album is not for the casual Simple Minds fan, who should stick to the pretty inclusive "Best of Simple Minds" 2 CD collection. But for those enchanted by "New Gold Dream" and "Sparkle in the Rain", this is a necessary addition to the collection.
