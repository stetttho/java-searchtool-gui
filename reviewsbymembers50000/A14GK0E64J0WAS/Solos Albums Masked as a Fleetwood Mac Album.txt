 I really was quite open-minded about Fleetwood Mac (sans Christine McVie) doing a reunion album. I decided not to see the Mac when the tour came to Cincinnati last year (not at $78-$128 ticket prices anyway), but when I had the chance, I picked up the album pretty cheap. I have to say I was quite surprised with what I heard. As "Say You Will" (18 tracks, 76 min.) plays along, you can immediately pick out the songs penned by Lindsay and the ones penned by Stevie. Low and behold, as by chance, each gets to deliver 9 tracks to the album, which at 76 min. truly is 2 solo albums collated together, albeit with the great backing of John McVie on bass and Mick Fleetwood on drums. I can only imagine the tension of sequencing the tracks: after Lindsay gets the first 2 tracks, Stevie prob said, if I don't get the next one, I'm walking. So track 3 "Illume" is a Stevie track, as is track 4! And so on. I guess I wouldn't mind it so much if the music was first class, but the problem is that (surprisingly) there are no really great songs here. I wish I could be more positive, but it all sounds so average, so middle-of-the-road! Who woulda thunk that Christine McVie would've been missed so badly? But the proof is in the pudding: her pop-savvy is missed sorely. As for "Say You Will": it just doesn't feel like a Fleetwood Mac album, sorry.
