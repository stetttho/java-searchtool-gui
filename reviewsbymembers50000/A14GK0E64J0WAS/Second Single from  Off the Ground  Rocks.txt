 The 1993 "Off the Ground" album gave Macca his last true international success. It spawned 4 singles, this being the second of them.  "Off the Ground" (5 tracks, 19 min.) starts off with the rocking title track, just great. "Cosmically Conscious" is excerpted on the album as the fade-out but featured here in its full version, and a great song. "Style Style" is an above-par mid-tempo rocker, and could have easily fitted onto the flow of the album. "Sweet Sweet Memories" features great vocal harmonies, another great B-side. "Soggy Noodle" is a short guitar instrumental, and unnecessary, frankly.  In all, though, this is a great single, and a necessary addition to any Paul McCartney completist.
