 Where in the world is George Michael nowadays? Who knows? His last album, the cover CD "Songs from the Last Century" tanked mightily and his last proper album before that, "Older", is by now 6 years old... So while we wait for George to wake up and smell the coffee, we have this 1998 sprawling (2 CDs, 140 min) "Best of" to remember what George was/is capable of. The compilation is divided in "From the Heart" (CD1, read: the ballads) and "For the Feet" (CD2, read: the dance tunes). Nobody is going to question his genius for writing great songs, and they are all here: Careless Whisper, Freedom, Too Funky, Kissing a Fool, Faith, Heal the Pain, Cowboys and Angels, Monkey, Waiting for that Day, and go on and on. Marvelous! Here is the problem: there are simply too many filler songs on this compliation (such as Desafinado, You Have Been Loved, A Moment with You, Spinning the Wheel, etc.) What would have worked better is a single CD, compiling all his greatest hits, no more, no less. Another beef I have is that one of his greatest hits, "I Want Your Sex", appears here as "Part 2", which is radically different from the song we all know and remember. What is up with that? So what could've, should've been a compliation of George Michael's greatest hits, isn't... Not that this compilation is bad, but it could've been greater.
