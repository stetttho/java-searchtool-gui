 It's hard to believe it's been another 3 years since the Human League released "Secrets", easily their best release since "Dare". There was a time when the League had lost direction, but their excellent 1995 "come-back" album "Octupus" brought the band back to the basics that brought success in the first place. "Secrets" (16 tracks, 51 min.) is essentially a collage of 10 'regular' songs and 6 instrumentals. Those regular songs are great. It's Phil Oakley up front with of course Joanne and Susan Anne providing back up vocals (and lead on "Never Give Your Heart"). Best tracks include "All I Ever Wanted" (a hit in Europe, and a classic League tune), "Liar" and the best of all: "Reflections", a 6+ min. blow-out that will rock your body, the 'outro' is just fab. As for those instrumentals, they actually work really well, and don't interrupt the flow of the album at all. It took 6 years for the band to follow-up "Octupus" with "Secrets". It's been already 3 years, and I guess I shouldn't be holding out for another new League album anytime soon. But I wish they'd hurry up already!! If you like "Dare", don't hesitate buying this, you will not be disappointed!
