 Can you believe it's been 7 years since "New Adventures in Hi-Fi" was released? Me neither. "New Adventures" was recorded while REM was touring behind the "Monster" album (my favorite REM album, even if dissed by many REM fans). The lead-off track "How the West Was Won and How We Got There" sounds thematically to the "Automatic for the People" opener "Drive". "Wake Up Bomb" and "Undertow" sound like "Monster" tracks (which they are, recorded around the same time), and really rock. "E-Bow The Letter" (the lead-off single) is a dramatic and haunting song (with great back-up vocals by Patti Smith). "Leave" is the longest REM song ever (7+ min.), a strange but appealing twisting sound of guitars and Stipe's vocals. "Be Mine" is an enthralling song. "Electrolite" (the 2nd single) is REM in it's classic form. Since "New Adenvtures", REM has issued only 2 albums ("Up" and "Reveal"), both forgettable really, but for a couple of great songs. A "Greatest Hits" set is due in September. Has it come to this? What a shame. Enjoy meanwhile this last outstanding effort of what once was one of America's premier bands.
