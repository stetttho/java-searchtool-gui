 The Greenhornes have been at it for a number of years, but had a break-out year in 2005 when they were the opener for most of the White Stripes year-long tour of the "Get Behind Me" tour. All of the sudden, the Greenhornes were written up in Rolling Stone and other rags, and so the label decided to issue this overview.  "Sewed Holes" (19 tracks, 68 min.) is a very generous serving of the Greenhornes' output to date. This is not a "best of", but an introduction of the Greenhornes' sound, and as such this compilation works great. Rightfully, there are 6 tracks from "Dual Mono", their best album so far, with great tracks like the CD opener "It's Not Real" and the mellow "Too Much Sorrow". The "Guns For You" album gets 5 tracks, including the excellent "I've Been Down" and "The End of the Night". Last year's excellent "East Grand Boulevard" EP gets 2 tracks, including the sublime "Shelter From Your Arms", which is my fave song of theirs.  As good as this compilation is, it still doesn't serve justice to how good the Greenhornes are live in concert. And can I make a shout-out to my town Cincinnati, where the Greenhornes are based. I've seen them in concert a number of times, but the best ever was when they opened for the White Stripes at Music Hall, what a sweet home-coming that was! In all, "Sewed Holes" is highly recommended if you are curious about the Greenhornes.
