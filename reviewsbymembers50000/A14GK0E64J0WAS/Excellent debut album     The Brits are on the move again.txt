 Kasabian has been making a serious splash in their UK home country, and their debut album from last year finally is released in the US, and not a minute too soon. Kasabian's sound is not unlike, but lighter, than the Music's heavy guitar sound, with more synths and even accoustic guitar.  "Kasabian" (53 min., 13 tracks, plus one "hidden" track) has spawned 5 singles in the UK so far, and these are not surprisingly the stronger tracks on the album. In order of release those singles are "Reason is Treason", the breakthrough hit "L.S.F. (Lost Souls Forever)", the irresitable "Processed Beats", "Cut Off" and the album opener "Club Foot", a hard charging dance-along, sing-along. But there are other highlights, including the mostly instrumental "I.D." and the entirely instrumental "Ovary Stripe", invoking space-rocking sounds not often heard since the 70's Hawkwind, just excellent!  The Brits are again unleashing a lot of great new bands, Franz Ferdinand, Kaiser Chiefs, Snow Patrol, the Bravery, and Kasabian, just to name a few. Mostly great stuff, here's hoping that US audiences are up for it.
