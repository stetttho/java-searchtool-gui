 Muse's third studio album "Absolution" came out in the UK last September, and in March was finally issued also in the US. Not a moment too soon, in my opinion.  "Absolution" (14 tracks, 52 min.) is no departure from Muse's earlier albums. The trio provides a wall-of-sound with heavy bass and drums, and scratching guitar riffs and solos all over, with the occasional pianos to add to the "heavy metal emo". It works great. Best tunes include the opener "Apocalypse Please" which oozes urgency, both musically and in the lyrics ("Declare This an Emergency...This is The End of the World"), the current single "Time Is Running Out" (in heavy rotation on MTV2 and Fuse), but also "Stockholm Syndrome" and the thundering "Hysteria". The group's sound has been compared to Radiohead era-"The Bends", which in my book is a plus, frankly. "Absolution" is an outstanding album, period. Muse are bone-fide stars in their home country of England and, to a lesser degree, elsewhere in Europe. They headline the massive UK open-air festival V2004 later this summer. To put that in contrast: about two months ago, Muse played Top Cat's here in Cincinnati, which holds about 200 people or so, give or take a few dozen (at least it was sold out!). True story. I still can't hard believe it myself.
