 Is there a new trend? First we got a compilation of Sting's Police and solo tracks, then there is the Mark Knopfler's excellent compilation of his Dire Straits and solo stuff, and now this, the very first compilation of John Fogerty's CCR and solo output. I think that yes, it is a new trend!  "The Long Road Home: The Ultimate John Fogerty/Creedence Collection" (25 tracks, 77 min.) is tipped heavily in favor of the CCR hits (18 of the 25 tracks are CCR songs), and rightfully so. Interestingly, four of those hits are presented as live versions from his 2005 tour. While normally I'd frawn on that, in this instance these songs in fact are excellent. (Compare the studio version of "Fortunate Son" agains the scorching live version--both of them on this CD--and you'll see what I mean.) As only seven solo songs are included, they actually blend in pretty well with the other stuff: "Centerfield", "Old Man Down the Road" and "Deja Vu (All Over Again)" are very good to say the least, and they stack up well against the CCR songs.  When you distill the very best of John Fogerty's 35+ yr. career down to 77 minutes, it is quite amazing how good his music remains to this day, of timeless quality really. I had the good fortune of seeing Fogerty on tour earlier this year, and he put on a rocking show, while clearly enjoying himself (again?). "The Long Road Home" is an excellent "best of", and highly recommended.
