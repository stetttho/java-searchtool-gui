 I have been a big Neil Diamond fan all my life, and I was pretty excited to hear that he was working with uber-producer Rick Rubin for his new album. It built great expectations. Boy, was I let down about that!  "12 Songs" (12 tracks, 50 min.) brings a stripped-down version of the Neil Diamond that I am used to, and I guess I just don't get it. This is mostly just Neil and his acoustic guitar, with spare and incidental instrumentation. Sometimes I get into it, such as the opener "Oh Mary", but mostly it sounds to me like "demo" versions of songs that *beg* for a bigger and fuller sound.   I guess this might be Neil Diamond's attempt to build "artistic credibility" (such as working with producer Rick "golden touch" Rubin), but honestly, did he really need to do that, with all that he has accomplished? I am not taking anything away from the many reviewers here that love this album, but for me this album simply did not "cut it". I can only hope that Neil has the confidence to come back with his "true" sound, which in my opinion "12 Songs" is not.
