 Much has been made in the music press and elsewhere of this album that this marks the return of Weezer to the genius of the Pinkerton album. Funny how time works. When Pinkerton came out in 1996, just about everybody didn't like or outright hated the album... (I didn't much cared for Pinkerton then, and still don't.)  "Make Believe" (12 tracks, 45 min.) is the much delayed follow-up album to Maladroit, and indeed sounds very different from the Green Album and Maladroit 1-2 punch in 2001-2002. The songs have less catchy hooks and are longer drawn out. (The running length of Make Believe is an eternity compared to all previous albums, which run about 30-35 min.) That said, there are some really good moments on here. "Beverly Hills" (first single) is a great stomper (even with the ridiculous lyrics). "This Is Such a Pity" is the Cars updated for 2005, quite fine. "My Best Friend" rocks great. The closer "Haunt You Every Day" is a nice (haunting) ballad to close out things.  Music is a very subjective thing. In my book, Make Believe is of course (much) better than the majority of the music released these days, but in comparison to the Blue and the Green albums, it is a disappointing album.
