 Music: 4.5 stars  Compilation: 3.5 stars When Axl Rose and Slash heard that Geffen Records was about to release a "Greatest Hits" album, they (unsuccesfully) sued to suppress the release. Reasons stated by Axl in the lawsuit: (1) Geffen did not consult him on the track-listing (note to Axl: Geffen OWNS the rights to these songs!) and (2) the release would hinder/endanger the release of the long-awaited "Chinese Democracy" album (I haven't laughed this hard in a long time!). "Greatest Hits" (14 tracks, 79 min.) is, without a doubt, a flawed compilation, yet also contains a lot of great music. The essential "Appetite for Destruction" is under-represented with only 3 tracks (no "Mr. Brownstone"?) and "The Spaghetti Incident?" is over-represented with 2 tracks (including an out-of-context "Since I Don't Have You"). "Use Your Illusion I and II" get 7 tracks, rightfully ("November Rain" stills sounds as bombastic and egotistic as ever). There are too many cover songs: 5 of the 14 tracks are covers, including for the first time on a GnR album the so-so (at best) "Sympathy for the Devil" from 1994's "Interview with the Vampire" soundtrack. Can you really be upset with Geffen Records for releasing this? I mean, they have been waiting TWELVE YEARS for a follow-up studio album. And do you really think at this point that "Chinese Democracy" will ever see the light of day? I'm not holding my breath... Meanwhile, this greatest hits (not a "best of") compiles GnR's best-known songs, which will satisfy most casual GnR fans.
