 "Yellow" is the song that got Coldplay the attention of US audiences, and while it is a good song for sure, it is surely not the best that Coldplay offers on "Parachutes", their debut album which features "Yellow". This CD offers "Yellow" and 2 additonal tracks: "Help Is Around the Corner" is a short (2'34) throwaway with Chris Martin on accoustic guitar that has the feeling of "Hey Chris, we need a track for the single, can you make up something quickly?" "No More Keeping My Feet Off the Ground" is taken from Coldplay's first (independent) release, the EP "Safety" (April 1998), and gives a great insight on how much the band has matured since then. It is the best song on this CD, but the sound is somewhat muffled, yet it shows the band at its intruiging origins. Bottom line: for Coldplay completists only.... If you're looking for Coldplay singles, go instead for "Shiver" or "The Blue Room EP" (see my reviews there)
