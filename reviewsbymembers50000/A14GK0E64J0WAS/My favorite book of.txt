 The hardcover edition of "The Faith of George W. Bush" came out in late 2003, but I didn't pick this up until the paperback edition was issued in 2004. I read it while on vacation this summer, and re-read it recently. While not a hefty volume (190 pages), the author covers a LOT of ground, and it was definitely worthwhile to re-read it.  In "The Faith of George W. Bush", author Stephen Mansfield covers how religion has been a part of George W. Bush's life, from growing up in Texas to the high school and college years in New England to the aimless years thereafter, and finally as Bush finds his groove (Rangers baseball co-owner, Texas Governor), on his way to the White House. One thing that becomes clear is that while of course there are a number of pivotal evolutions in the growth of Bush's spiritual life, there was not one single event that causes Bush to become born again. Just a couple of anecdotes from the book that stayed with me: on running for President, Bush says (in early 1999) that "I feel like God wants me to run for President. I can't explain it, but I feel my country is going to need me." This was 2 years before 9/11, wow. Bush on the success of faith-based initiatives while he was governor of Texas: "Government can do certain things very well, but it cannot hope in our hearts or o sense of purpose in our lives." So true!  The author makes clear that George W. Bush has committed many mistakes. Let he who has never made a mistake himself, throw the first stone. The reason why the President resonates well with a majority of this country is that he "talks the talk, and walks the walk". This is a wonderful book. Highly recommended!
