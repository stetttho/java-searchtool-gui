 As most of America, I was mesmerized by the insanely catchy iPod 30 sec. commercial featuring "Vertigo", the lead-off single from U2's latest album. On the strength of that tune I bought the album. My mistake.  "How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb" (11 tracks, 48 min.) starts off with "Vertigo", and boy, does it rock! But after that, I was pretty much disappointed. "Miracle Drug" sets the tone for the rest of the album, a mid-tempo song. "Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own" (the second single) is Bono's loving ode to his dad, who passed away recently, a nice ballad. But then it remains on cruise control, untill we get to "City of Blinding Lights", which brings some much-needed life and tempo. After that, it's more "middle of the road", pensive stuff, all the way through.  I'm astounded by the critical acclaim this album has gotten. Frankly, I think it's mediocre, and it it wasn't for "Vertigo", this wouldn't even get 3 stars. U2 has been better, much better, than this. Even the previous album, 2000's "All That You Can't Leave Behind" easily outshines this. That said, do you think I'll go see U2 on the coming tour? You bet!
