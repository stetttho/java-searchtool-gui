 I admit I had never heard of Espers, but my 16 yr. old daughter somehow (I have no idea how) found out about them and bought their album, and of course I was interested in checking them out as well. What a pleasant surprise this was! (And kudos to my daughter...) Espers is a trio lead by Greg Weeks, and is essentially a trip back in time to the 60s of the psychedelic-folk sound.   "Espers" (8 tracks, 40 min.), released in 2004, is a "mood" piece all around. The overall sound is of acoustic guitars, flutes, violins, and even dulcimers (but no drums), all to great effect. There are no uptempo songs on here, just slow mood pieces as if you were sitting around a camp fire. The vocals are shared by Greg Weeks and Meg Baird, who sounds just angelic. The 2 outstanding tracks are "Hearts & Daggers", an 8+ epic that culminates in a beautiful instrumental outro, and the album closer "Travel Mountains", another long song with a similar structure.   This is a beautiful album from start to finish. Not something to listen to when you are in a hurry, that's for sure. Espers has released an EP of covers last Fall, as a stop-gap for the release of their next proper album, and I can't wait for that. Meanwhile, check this out. Highly recommended!
