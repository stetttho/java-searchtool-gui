 The trio that comprises White Magic bring an ecclectic indie-folk mix of music that either you will like a lot or not care for. My 16 yr. old daughter 'discovered' them in our household, and she's got mixed emotions about this. Me, I looove it. This is their debut EP.  "Through the Sun Door" (6 tracks; 23 min.) is a mood piece from beginning to end. Some of the songs are piano based, others are guitar based, but all of them are rather sparse musically speaking, not that it matters, as the vibe is great all along. The best songs are actually the second half of the EP, starting with a rolling "The Gypsies Come Walking After". "Plain Gold Ringer" starts with singer Mira Billotte singing a-cappella, then joined by bass and drums, and ultimately the occasional piano. Vocally, Billotte brings to mind Grace Slick, and she sounds outstanding. The best track of all is the closer "Apocalypse", which sounds like the 60s never went away.  While this 2004 EP was well received critically, to my knowledge White Magic have not released anything since then, which begs the question why... "Through the Sun Door" is an outstanding collection of music, however short it is, and I highly recommend it. Now let's hope that White Magic will bring us more! BUY THIS!
