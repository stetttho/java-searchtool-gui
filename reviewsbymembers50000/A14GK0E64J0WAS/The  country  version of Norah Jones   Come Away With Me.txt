 I'm not a particular big fan of country music as such (or of jazz, for that matter), but I appreciate good music, and this album strikes me to be the "country" version of "jazz" sensation Norah Jones. Disclaimer: I have not heard Allison Moorer's previous 2 albums, and am going strictly with what I heard on "Miss Fortune". The album is very mellow, and creates it own mood, very well at that. From the opener "Tumbling Down", Moorer creates a gentle atmosphere, assisted by strings in quite a few tracks (which will turn off the die-hard country fans, I reckon). "Ruby Jewel Was Here" is a stand-out track. Moorer throws in some rocker tunes towards the end, "Going Down" reminds me of early 70's Rolling Stones! All in all, a very satisfying album. Moorer may not get the attention (yet) her more famous sister Shelby Lynn gets, but trust me, she is as good, if not better. This is an "under the radar" album that delivers!
