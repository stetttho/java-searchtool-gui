 "Going For The One", originally issued in 1977, is overlooked in the Yes catalogue (the same goes for 1978's "Tormato" for that matter). It finds the band in between the truly prog-rock early years and just before the less-then-thrilling foray of Top 40 ("Owner of a Loney Heart"). I personally am very fond of this album. The album includes the hard rocking "Parallels" and the majestic "Awaken", not to mention "Wonderous Stories", still one of the band's most popular tracks after all these years. This "Expanded and Remastered" edition (12 tracks, 79 min.) has of course the original album, but is supplemented by 7 bonus tracks. "Montreux's Theme" is an instrumental from the same sessions. "Vevey" is a live instrumental (recorded in a church!) of Jon on harp and Rick on church organ, just beautiful. "Amazing Grace" is a studio recording of Chris' amazing bass-solo, performed frequently in concert. The remaining tracks are (early) studio run-throughs of the album's tracks, providing a fascinating inside look on how the tracks sounded in their embryonic stages. "Going for the One" is here as an instrumental. "Parallels" is heard without the towering church organ. Best of all, "Eastern Number" is a 12 min. early version of what eventually would become "Awaken". Kudos to the fine folks at Rhino for putting together this exquisite reissue, and showing others in the industry how it's done. Excellent liner notes, great pictures, fascinating bonus tracks, it's all here. Essential for any Yes fan.
