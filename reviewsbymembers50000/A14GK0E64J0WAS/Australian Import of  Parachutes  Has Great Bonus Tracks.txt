 It's been 4+ years since the original release of Coldplay's debut album in the UK (the US release would follow in Nov. 2000), and as the phenom called Coldplay is getting bigger and bigger, it's now clear that "Parachutes" is a classic, in every sense of the word. By now, the original 10 tracks of the album all have become so instantly familiar, yet never tiresome. There is of course "Yellow", the US break-through single but for me probably the weakest track on the set. Check out instead "Shiver", "Don't Panic" (with the immortal line "We Live in a Beautiful World"), "Trouble" and Sparks", 4 other singles from the album (all of them still available on Amazon).   The Australian import version of "Parachutes" (14 tracks, 56 min.) comes with 4 additional tracks on a separate CD: "Sparks" in the album version (nothing new here), but then also "Careful Where You Stand" which is a b-side from the "Shiver" single, "Yellow" in an accoustic version that in my opinion is actually better than the original version, and the hauntingly beautiful "See You Soon", which originally appeared on the "Blue Room" EP. Both "Careful" and "See You Soon" are essentials in the Coldplay catalogue.   We now await Coldplay's new album, which supposedly will come out in Spring 2005. Who knows whether that's gonna be any good, but for sure it's gonna be a monster, and Coldplay is well on its way to be the next U2. Meanwhile, enjoy the humble and intimate debut album which I dare say Chris and the boys will never surpass.
