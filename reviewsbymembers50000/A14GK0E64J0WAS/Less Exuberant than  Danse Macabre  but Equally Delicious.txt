 The Faint brought us one of 2002's guilty pleasures with "Dance Macabre" and it's taken them a while (I didn't care mmuch for last year's Danse Macabre remix album) but finally out patience has been repaid with the new album.  "Wet From Birth" (10 tracks, 34 min.) is a logical sequel to "Danse Macabre", albeit slightly exuberant, not that that is a bad thing. The band still brings us delirious synth-based songs, but on some you'll hear strings (yes, you read right), such as on "Desparate Guys", the excellent album opener, and "Souther Belles in Lonndon Sing". On other tunes the guitars are more upfront (for example on "Dropkick the Punks"). Reaggae even makes an appearance on "Phone Call". But in the end, the best tracks are the all-out synth dance/groove tunes such as "How Could I Forget", "Paranoiattack" (the best track on the album for me), and "Sympton Finger".  I just love the Faint, and it's one of my fave bands I haven't seen live yet, I hope to change that soon. "Wet From Birth" is a great album, although I still rank "Danse Macabre" slightly higher.
