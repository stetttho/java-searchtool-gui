 Wow.. it's taken Nikka Costa a LONG time to bring us the follow-up to her 2001 break-out album "Everybody Got Their Something". Who can forget "Like a Feather", that irresitable dance-along from that album. Nikka Costa, a funkier version of Janis Joplin, took her time, and with good results.  "can'tneverdidnothin'" (11 tracks plus 1 "hidden" track, 45 min.) can generally be divided up in 2 sides: the harder, funky tracks, and the slower 'ballads'. The album starts off with a blast, "Till I Get To You" (first single), and follows with an equally blazing title track. "Fooled Ya Baby" is a great ballad. Things kick up again later in the second half, with "Swing It Around", and even better the all-out stomper "On & On". The album closes with 2 'ballads', including the great "Fatherless Child". The hidden track is a departure from the rest of the album, just a short, jazzy-feeling song.  It amazes me that this album has not gathered more attention than is has (which is basically none) since its release now almost 2 months ago. I suspect that the absence of a readily radio-friendly track similar to "Like a Feather" plays a big role. What a shame. This is a fine album. Maybe not as great as "Everybody Got Their Something", but still better than, say, 90 percent of albums released these days...  Seperate from that, Nikka Costa is an awesome live act. I've seen her in concert once, and she electrified the audience, giving her all. If you have a chance to see her live, don't miss it!
