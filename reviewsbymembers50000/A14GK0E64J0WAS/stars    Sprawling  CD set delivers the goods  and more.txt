 Last year, Sinead O'Connor, supposedly "retired" from the music business, released one of the best albums of 2005, the full-throtle reggae "Throw Down Your Arms". I have never been a huge fan of Sinead (too "off-stream" in too many ways), but having loved last year's album, it brought me to this album.  "She Who Dwells" (2 CDs, 32 tracks, 146 min., released in 2003) actually is titled much longer (similar to Fiona Apple's "When the Pawn"), but nevermind that, it's the music that speaks. CD1 (19 tracks, 78 min.) brings a bunch of originals, traditionals, covers, B-tracks, and other obscurities, and guess what, it works really well. From covers of Nazareth's "Love Hurts" and ABBA's "Chiquita" to originals such as "Brigidine Diana" and "Emma's Song" to traditionals such as "Song of Jerusalem", it all sounds ecstatic. But the real beauty of this album is CD2 (13 tracks, 68 min.) which brings Sinead in concert, and how she shines! The concert brings together a superb mix of pop, celtic and reggae. Yes, it includes her mega-hit "Nothing Compares to U" (in an acoustic version) but even better are the mood songs (such as "Molly Malone" and "John I Love You") and the more exuberant songs such as the reggae-flavored "Fire on Babylon", foreshadowing her next album.  Sinead has long left the main-stream music business, now releasing albums under full control, and to great result. Disregarding her potitical beliefs, she has been releasing great music, much of it under the mainstream radar, and for that she is to be recommended. "She Who Dwells" is, much like last year's "Throw Down Your Arms", a superb album. Highly Recommended!
