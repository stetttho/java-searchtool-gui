 5 Stars if you're new to Eisley; 4 Stars for the rest of us  Eisley has released 2 EPs in early and late 2003, the excellent "Laughing City" and "Marvelous Things". For whatever reason, it's taken over another year for the release of their debut album. The band is in my book one of the best new bands out there, and Coldplay's Chris Martin is a big fan as well (Eisley opened for Coldplay on part of their 2003 US tour).  "Room Noises" (12 tracks, 41 min.) is full of dreamy, yet very catchy songs, not unlike, say, Sixpense None the Richer. The best songs are in the first half of the album, including the opener "Memories", "I Wasn't Prepared", "Memories" (the standout track of the album), and "Brightly Wounded" with great intertwining vocals from the sister lead singers. Other great tracks are "Plenty of Paper", a great up-tempo song, and the closer "Trolley Wood".  What keeps me from giving this 5 stars is that 4 of the songs are rehashed from the 2 EPs (in newly recorded versions), and that's disappointing to a degree for those of us that have followed Eisley from the beginning. We want more new songs! Finally, the Amazon listing shows a bonus track (a remixed version of "Lost at Sea") but the CD I bought doesn't have it, hmmmm... Regardless, Eisley is a breath of fresh air in today's music scene.  Eisley is coming to Cincinnati shortly and I can't wait to see them live! "Room Noises" is highly recommended!
