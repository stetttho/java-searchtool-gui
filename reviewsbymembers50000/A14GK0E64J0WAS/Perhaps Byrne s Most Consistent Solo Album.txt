 First things first: any Talking Heads fan thinking/hoping to hear anything like that sound, fugget about it! you'll be sorely disappointed. But for the fans of David Byrne solo-era, "Grown Backwards" is a delight, and perhaps his most consistent solo album to date.  "Grown Backwards" (15 tracks, 58 min.) is a strange, even ecclectic mix of salsa and... strings and opera, of all things. But don't be put off, it all works great somehow. The Tosca Strings are featured on most tracks. One of the highlights is the Bizet duet between Byrne and Rufus "Want One" Wrainwright on "Au Fond du Temple Saint". "The Other Side of Life" is reminiscent of the Beatles (of all things!) strings-heavy "Sgt. Pepper" tunes. I just love how Byrne works Verdi's "Un di Felice, Eterea". There is one throw-back song to the Heads(latter) era, the delicious "Dialogue Box".   The album is a bit overlong, especially the last track, the 9 min. "Lazy" is just unnecessary. (It is billed in the liner notes as a "bonus" track, why I don't know. Bonus to what? It's part of the albums track listing.) But that aside, this is a great album. If you are not familiar with Byrne's solo output, give this album a chance, you will not be disappointed!
