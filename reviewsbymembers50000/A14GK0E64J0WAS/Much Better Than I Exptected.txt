 I am not a huge John Mayer fan. I know the radio hits, that's about it. Someone recommended "Any Given Thursday" to me, and much to my surprise I have really come to like this album. Meant as a stop-gap until Mayer would release his second album, and as a quick cash-in to Mayer's quick rise to stardom, this live collection nevertheless delivers. "Any Given Thursday" (2 CDs, 101 min.) is the complete recording of a September 2002 concert in Birmingham, AL. The set contains, not surprisingly, the bulk of the "Room for Squares" album (10 of its 13 tracks are here), and Mayer delivers them confidently, at times taking his time to "jam" with his band. My favorite tracks include the sublime "Why Georgia", "83" and "Neon" (all of which are on CD2, clearly the better of CD1). There is also the obligatory "John solo" mini-set, which contains a great cover of Sting's "Message in a Bottle" (I don't miss Sting's whining voice at all!). Perhaps somewhat surprisingly, there is not a single song previewing the "Heavier Things" album. In all, I was very pleasantly surprised with this album. OK, John Mayer live invites comparisons to Dave Matthews Band, there's no denying that. But hey, is that such a bad thing? Not in my book!
