 "The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway" (2 CDs, 23 tracks, 93 min.) is epic in every aspect, and along the way became the breakout album that put Genesis on the musical scene as one of rock's premier bands. Released in November, 1974, it remains as fresh today as it was 29 years ago. (Note to label: what about a 30th anniversary revisit?) CD1 (11 tracks, 45 min.) starts off with the rolling title track. "in the Cage" is one of the highlights, with an unleashed Tony Banks on keyboards. "Back in NYC" is a menacing, hard pounding track. "Counting Out Time" is the hit single, recalling "I Know What I Like" from 1973's "Selling England" album. The ballad "Carpet Crawlers" became a concert staple. CD2 (12 tracks; 48 min.) is the more experimental side of the album, with tracks like "The Waiting Room", "The Lamia" and the "Colony of Slippermen" medley, just beautiful. One of the things that stand out on the album is the incredible lyrics of Peter Gabriel, as he counts the story of Rael, full of words-smithing and word-playing. (Fun fact: Peter Gabriel agonized over the name of the main character, finally settled on Rael, only to find out post-factum that same name already had been used by Ray Davis (The Kinks) in one of his mini-epics!) This album does justice to the great art of double "concept" albums such as the Who's "Tommy". Lost in the translation to CD is the great art work (by Hypnosis, also found on Pink Floyd albums such as "Wish You Were Here") of the original vinyl issue. The sound on the remaster edition is exquisite, though. Peter Gabriel would leave Genesis after this album, but Genesis proved there was life after Peter Gabriel, and then some!
