 "Trouble" is the third single from "Parachutes", following "Shiver" (March 2000) and "Yellow" (June 2000). The single contains 3 tracks and runs 14 min. "Trouble" is one of the best tracks of "Parachutes", with Chris Martin on piano and as often is the case, singing about love, love lost and regret ("I never meant to cause you trouble/I never meant to cause you pain"). "Brothers and Sisters" reworks their earlier version, issued independently. This version, while still showing that it is one of the early songs of the band, is more complete, and also sounds "fuller". "Shiver (Jo Whiley Lunchtime Social)" was taped at some British talk show if I'm not mistaken. This version is essentially an "unplugged" version from the song found on "Parachutes": no drums, no electric guitars. It makes for a very different sound, quite intimate. Very Coldplay! I give 4 stars, instead of 5, because in comparison to the "Shiver" single and "The Blue Room EP", this single is slightly less compelling. Not a must for those who only know Coldplay from the current radio exposure of "Yellow". But a must-have for any Coldplay completist.
