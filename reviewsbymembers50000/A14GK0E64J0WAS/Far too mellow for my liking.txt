 For many long-time Stereophonics fans, going back to the 1997 "Word Gets Around" debut album, this album is likely to be a disappointment, as it is for me. "You Gotta Go There To Come Back" (13 tracks, 57 min.) is the Welsh band's 4th album, and a startling transformation. From a brash alterna-stomp-rock sound, the band is now already settling into a middle-of-the-age, lazier sounding bunch, regretfully. The album is dominated by pensive, easy sounding songs, even ballads with strings and all, if you can believe that. Some of them work quite well, like "Maybe Tomorrow" (the 2nd single) and "Rainbows and Pots of Gold". Others don't quite make it, like "I'm Alright", "Since I Told You It Was Over" and the truly out of place "Climbing the Wall". The album does contain some (2 to be exact) tougher-sounding tracks: "Madame Helga" (the 1st single) and "High as the Ceiling", both excellent. For me, the album's epitomized by the opener "Help Me", a lazy blues-rocker that, at 7 min., drones on about 3 min. too long. If it sounds I'm being harsh, it's because the Sterophonics have been much better. I don't imagine they'll play too many of this album's tracks at Cardiff's Millenium Stadium home-town gig later this Fall, because this album clearly doesn't translate well to stadium rock. Kelly Jones' vocals remain as instantly recognizable as ever, of course. But for their better work, steer instead to "Performance & Coctails", their best CD by far.
