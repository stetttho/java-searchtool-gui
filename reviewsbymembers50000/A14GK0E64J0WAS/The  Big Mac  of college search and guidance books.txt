 I have gone through the college search process once, and my youngest now has taken an early interest (she's a sophomore). We gathered a number of college search guides, and she ate it up.  "Petersen's Four Year Colleges - 2006 Edition" (3,087 pages--and that's not a typo!) is essentialy 2 books in 1. The first 1000 pages of the book present a summary of about 2,200 colleges around the US. On the average, all colleges get about half a page description. Very helpful is that the colleges are lumped state-by-state, because, let's face it, many many college students remain in their home state. The second part of the book is a more in-depth (two pages) profile of about 1,000 colleges. It is important to understand that those in-depth profiles  are NOT written up by the book's editors, but instead by the colleges themselves (and the colleges have paid for this placement).  I found the book more useful that my youngest did. For one, because the book is so huge and outright heavy, it's not particularly user-friendly. That said, there is no denying that there is tons of great information to be found in this book.
