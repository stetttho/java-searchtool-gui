 When Ryan's record label, Lost Highway Records, refused to release "Love Is Hell" in Spring 2003 as the proper follow-up to "Gold", they "suggested" that he come up with another album instead. For Ryan, one of the most prolific songwriters ever, that's not a problem. In no time he whipped out "Rock N Roll". "Rock N Roll" (14 tracks, 48 min.) is overall a radical departure of any album he's done before (yes, even the uneven "Demolition" collection), with dreadful results, unfortunately. 13 of the 14 tracks sound pretty much the same: mid-to-up tempo rock tracks. The songs sound hurried (which they were), but with none of the depth that we are used to from Ryan. After listening to the whole CD, there isn't much that stands out or sticks, but for the title track, which ironically is not a rock track at all, but a 2 min. piano ballad with Ryan lamenting "Everybody's Playing Rock N Roll, I Dont Feel Cool At All". Thankfully as a bonus to this album the label decided to issue "Love Is Hell" as well, albeit cut up in 2 EPs, the first one released the same day as "Rock N Roll" (the second follows in December). The first EP is by far superior to "Rock N Roll", and it just makes you wonder what record labels are thinking...
