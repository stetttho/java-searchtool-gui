 Ever I saw The Album Leaf in concert open for Sigur Ros a few years ago, I've been mesmorised by the band's sound. (In studio, this is Jimmy LaValle by himself.) This CD (some might call it an EP) is the follow-up to their great 2001 album "One Day I'll Be on Time". This split CD (with a band called On!Air!Library) contains 3 new TAL songs (17 min.) of the same dream-like instrumental music found on "One Day". Track 2 "Essex" is reminiscent of/musically the sequel to "Audio Pool" from "One Day", and the best track. Track 3 "Lamplight" (7+ min) is very reflective, and works quite well. I'm not sure why TAL chose (or was required) to issue this split CD with On!Air!Library (which songs are not up to par with TAL), but nevermind. Until we get a proper follow-up full-fletched album to "One Day", this will do.
