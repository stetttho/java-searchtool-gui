 I've been a Collective Soul since the first hour, saw them open for Van Halen in 1994 when "Shine" put the band on the map, etc. After the disappointing "Blender" album in 2000, it seemed that Collective Soul was done. A greatest hits collection followed the next year, and then nothing. Now, with little fanfare, comes a new Collective Soul album., seemingly out of nowhere (certainly no radio airplay!).  "Youth" (11 tracks, 40 min.) finds Ed Roland still in control of things, and the sound picks up as if not a day had passed since the late 1990's. Do yourself a favor: this is a great album, but simply skip the opening track "Better Now", which simply doesn't "gel", I mean it even has a saxophone solo in the outro! Things really start cooking with the 2nd track "There's a Way", with an irresistable hook and chorus. Same for "Home", "Counting the Days" (touted as the current radio single, but I haven't heard any radio station play it), and "General Idea". There are several nice CS-style ballads, such as "How Do You Love" and the album close "Sattelite". This album zooms by in no time, just a great listen (but for the opening song).  In the mid-to-late 90s, I saw Collective Soul live about once or twice a year, so much fun. Every concert was like a "greatest hits live" experience. I look forward to seeing them again if they come around here. While "Youth" certainly is not up to par with the band's second self-titled album (still by far Collective Soul's best album), this is a pretty good album, and a nice return. Welcome back guys!
