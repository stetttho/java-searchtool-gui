 Once in a great while, big music fans (like myself) are surprised, in the best way. I had heard about and read about the tremendous success that the band has had in the last year in England, and when "The Man Who"  was (finally) released in the US, I bought it, not ever having heard them  ever before. What a gift! The lead-off track "Writing To Reach  You" starts like it's an Oasis track (with explicit references to  "Wonderwall" to boot), but then the album goes and builds from  there. Every track sounds like an instant classic, quite frankly. While it  contains all of the UK hits (including "Driftwood" and "Why  Does It Always Rain On Me"), my faves are the mesmorizing "She's  So Strange", and all of the "hidden" extra tracks. For final  measure, when I saw Travis opening for Oasis earlier this year, they simply  put on a heartfelt show that surpassed the headliner. By all means, buy  this CD.
