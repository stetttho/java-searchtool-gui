 I had the opportunity to catch Roger Waters on tour this past summer, and this 2 CD set is a very nice reflection of the music played on that tour. The first CD is the stronger of the two, for a couple of reasons: first of all, this may very well contain THE definitive version of Shine On You Crazy Diamond (Parts 1-8), with an incredible Waters pounding on bass as he bridges part 4 into 5. That song alone is worth the admission price! Next, there is beautifully played (and great sounding) "Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun", which in the Cincinnati show opened the second set and is somewhat unfortunately here stuck at the end of the first CD. Finally, there a is the seldom-played "Dogs", from the underrated "Animals" CD. Not to suggest that the second CD is not good, but do we really need ANOTHER version of "Money"? I was surprised to see it show up in his set list, and it's the reason I'm rating this CD 4, instead of 5 stars. On the other hand, it was nice to see "Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking" and "Amused to Death", both of which are included here. In all, this is a very satisfying record. Roger Waters seemed like he was having a good time at the concert here (even smiling!). This album reflects the relaxed yet very crisp sounding band, as a result this is better than any of the tired-sounding live Pink Floyed albums of late ("Pulse" anyone?)
