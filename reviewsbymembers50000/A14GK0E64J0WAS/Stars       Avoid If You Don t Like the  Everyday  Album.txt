 This is DMB's 4th 'official' live release, from a July 2001 concert in Boulder, Colorado. DMB was touring behind the then recently released "Everyday" album.  "Live at Folsom Field" (2 CDs, 21 tracks, 151 min.) starts off on CD1 (73 min.) with the excellent "Don't Drink the Water" and then delves straight into the newer songs, including "JTR" from the Lilywhite sessions, and making its first appearance on a DMB release. If you don't like the "Everyday" album, it's gonna be a long night, as 8 tracks from that album are featured, including among others "When the World Ends", "So Right", and the fab title track, here in a 9 min. workout, with some great crowd singalong. CD1 also has an excellent "Bartender" and "Big Eyed Fish" (eventually released on "Busted Stuff"). After all the new songs in the first half of the show, CD2 (78 min.) returns DMB to mostly more familair terrain, including a nice "Recently", "Warehouse" (another crowd-pleaser and singalong), the ever-trusty Dylan cover "All Along the Watchtower", and the one-two punch of "Two Step" and "Ants Marching" as the encore.  This is a pleasant live album, no question, but otherwise really not all that remarkable. In my opinion other DMB live releases like "Live at Red Rocks", "Central Park" and even the most recent "The Gorge" are a better choice.
