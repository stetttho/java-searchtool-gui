 I saw Depeche Mode a couple of times on the "Faith and Devotion" tour, and also bought the "Devotional" VHS when it came out all those years ago.   DVD1 of "Devotional" is a transfer of the original VHS movie, and the great improvement is of course the sound, which is exceptional. The performance of the band is outstanding, and the song selection rightly focuses on the "Faith and Devotion" album, but other nuggets include "World in My Eyes", "Never Let Me Down" and "Enjoy the Silence". DVD2 brings some extras which, frankly, I don't really care all that much for. I do wish that they had added the 2 bonus tracks (including a superb "Halo") on DVD1.  In retrospect, we can now say without much of a doubt that DM era-1993 was DM at its peak. Once you can over the fact that Dave Gahan desparately seeks street-cred (tattoos, long hair, etc.), you have to admit that his voice was better than ever. Adding live drums was a stroke of genius. The songs rocked. Last but not least the stage design by Anton Corbijn was superb. This is a thoroughly enjoyable DVD, and a must for any DM fan. Highly recommended.
