 I am about as big a Telex fan as you will ever find anywhere. I have all of the original singles, maxi-singles and albums from the vinyl days of the late 70s and early 80s, and over time replaced the albums with the CD reissues. Being the Telex completist, I just had to have this remix album. Bad mistake. "I Don't Like Music (Remix)" (12 tracks, 74 min.) take well known ("Moscow Discow", "Twist a St. Tropez") and not so well known ("I Don't Like Music" is the B side of a single) tracks and turn them over to various remixers. I'll be upfront about it: I am not into "house" or "techno" music, nor am I really into the "club" scene (underground or otherwise). Simply put, I have never heard of any of these remixers. I was quite disappointed with what I heard, because the songs sound absolutely nothing like the original Telex songs. It reminds me of some of the Depeche Mode remixes that I've heard, which also sound so far away from the original songs.  When Telex released maxi-singles, they contained "alternative" versions of the hit song. That meant generally a (much) longer version of the original song, perhaps with a new synthesizer solo or something like that. However on this remix album, mostly you wouldn't know these remixes are based on the originals if you didn't know better. I can't say whether these remixes make any sense or not, they just didn't appeal to me at all.   I guess I should have been more careful, but this album is certainly not geared towards the Telex fan as such, but rather to the fans of techno/house/remix music. Buyers beware...
