 25 years after it first came out, the third (and best) album of the Dutch progressive rock band Kayak remains as enjoyable as ever. From the opening sounds of the title track through classics such as Life of Gold and Chance of A Lifetime, each track shows the band at its peak creativity and  performance. The 9 bonus tracks are primarily tracks from their first  albums "See See The Sun" (tracks 11-12) and second album  "Kayak" (tracks 14-15-16), as well as some B sides of various  singles. This reissue is a companion piece to a compilation (not available  anymore) simply called Kayak (not to be confused with their second album of  the same name). These 2 CDs essentially put all of Kayak's materials of the  EMI years (their first 3 albums, plus various non-albums singles) out on 2  (separate) CDs. As amply demonstrated by the other reviews on this album,  Kayak (era 73-75) is a widely under-recognized progressive rock band and  this album shows why. A must for every fan of progressive music!
