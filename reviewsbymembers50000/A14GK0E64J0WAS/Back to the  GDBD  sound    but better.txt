 In 2001 OtR released "Film for Radios", in my opinion a great, adventurous album, which, unfortunately, sank commercially (30,000 copies sold, I read). Karen Bergquist and Linford  Detweiler, the husband and wife team behind OtR, decided that the adventurous way was not the way to go, and instead came back with a more toned-down sound, reminiscent of the "Good Dog Bad Dog" album. I admit it's not my fave OtR sound, but "Ohio" has grown on me, after repeated listenings. The big thing of course is that this is a double-album, 21 tracks (including one "hidden" track), 90+ min. By far, CD2 is my fave. Although CD1 has its moments, such as the current single "Show Me" and Karen's affectionate ode to Ohio on the title track, the best juice is on CD2. "Nobody Number One" and "Cruel and Pretty" are great, setting the table for the best tunes, "How Long" and "When You Say Love", the stand-out track of this ambitious album.  I saw OtR on the opening gig of their new tour, and the 5 piece band rocks greater than this album leads on, so if you have a chance to see them, a great evening is guaranteed.
