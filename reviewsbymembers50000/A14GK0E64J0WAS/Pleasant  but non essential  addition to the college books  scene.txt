 My son and I went through the college searching process in the past year (he'll start college next month), and we went through quite a bit of literature in our quest. Some of it serious, some of it not so serious.  "The Insider's Guide to the Colleges 2005" is one of those to be taken not too seriously. If anything, I would suggest this is a good book to read, when your son or daughter is close to making a decision, and (s)he wants to find confirmation of impressions already made. My son concentrated his college search to colleges in the southern half of Ohio, and having visited a number of them, the descriptions in this book seem on target, in a general "gut check" kinda way.  I certainly would not recommend this book as the most essential book to read when starting off on your college search. But it is a fun, irrevent look at the college scene, and the book should be taken as such, nothing more.
