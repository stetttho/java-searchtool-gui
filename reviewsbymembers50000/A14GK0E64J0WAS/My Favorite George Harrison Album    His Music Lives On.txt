 I suppose that "All Things Must Pass" is the seminole Harrison album. Maybe it's just me, but I've always thought it was simply too much and too long. More satisfying instead is "Living in the Material World", the 1973 successor album to ATMP. "Living" is more coherent as an overall album, 11 tracks covering 45 min. Best know is of course the lead-off track (and #1 single) "Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)". The overall theme of "Living" is found on "Sue Me, Sue You Blues", where George agonizes over the seemingly omni-presence of lawyers. "The Light That Has Lighted the World" is a piano-lead ballad. "Don't Let Me Wait Too Long" is a beautiful love song, driven by accoustic guitars. The title track is the pivotal (and also the longest) track on the album, in which George despises the material world in which he grew famous while a Beatle. "The Lord That Loves The One (That Loves The Lord)" is the "other side of the coin" of the title-track, in which George urges us to loves the Lord, instead of materiality. The last track is a foreboding "That Is All". Hearing this song again, a few days after George's passing away, brings me goose bumps. "That is all I'm waiting for/Your love and nothing more/And that is all"... George Harrison has left us, but his music will live forever. "Living in The Material World" is George Harrison at peak musical creativity and in peace with himself and the Lord. BUY IT!
