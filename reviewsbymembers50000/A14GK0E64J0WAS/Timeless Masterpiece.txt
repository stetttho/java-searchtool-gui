 I cannot even begin to guess how many times I have played this album since its release 25 years ago. It is astonishing how easily Rubycon has stood the test of time. Part I remains one of my all-time fave TD pieces,  starting off slowly and then developing into a storm of multiple layers of  synths and threatening sequencers, ultimately gently fading away. It is  difficult to reconcile the classic TD sound on Rubycon with the  "TD-lite" sound on the TD releases in the 90s. I make it a point  to stay open-minded about how bands develop over time, but when I hear some  of the things TD dares to release nowadays, I can only shake my head and  think how truly ground-breaking they once were. Rubycon shows how and why.
