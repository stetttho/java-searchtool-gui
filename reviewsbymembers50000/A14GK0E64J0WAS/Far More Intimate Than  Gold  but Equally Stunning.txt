 For anyone who is thinking that Ryan Adams's debut album is similar to "Gold", let me stop you right now: "Heartbreaker" is far more intimate, less radio-friendly than "Gold". Which doesn't mean of course it is any less good. "Heartbreaker" is in general a toned-down album, simply Ryan with accoustic guitar telling stories of aching love gone wrong and other stories of life. "Oh My Sweet Carolina" is a superb example of that (with lyrics like "I went on to Cleveland and I ended up insane" haha, take that Cleveland!) Other essential tracks are "My Winding Wheel", the stunning "Come Pick Me Up" (a full-band ballad with Ryan on harmonica and piercing lyrics; by far the best track on the album and one Ryan thankfully continues to play live regularly on his current tour), and "To Be the One" (just Ryan's acoustic guitar and harmonica, reminiscent of early Dylan.) The album does contain a couple "Gold"-like uptempo songs, such as "To Be Young (Is to Be Sad, Is to Be High)" and the mean-rocking "Shakedown on 9th Street". But other than that, it's mainly Ryan by himself and his guitar. Finally, don't miss the opening hilarious discussion about Morrisey! What a hoot!
