 Panic! At the Disco has created quite a buzz with its break-out single "The Only Difference", which is an irresitable singalong. Now comes the album.  "A Fever You Can't Sweat Out" (13 tracks, 40 min.) starts off with a short instrumental, to then dive straight into the afore-mentioned "The Only Difference". Subsequent tracks "London Beckoned" and "Nails for Breakfast" continue on the same neck-breaking pace. Things slow down (but just a bit) on "Lying Is the Most Fun For a Girl", the last track of "Side 1" (track 7). After an instumental intermission, things kick up again with the delicious "But It's Better If You Do", and another highlight later on "Side 2" is "There's a Good Reason".  The album blasts by in no time. Musically, the album reminds me of Brand New, and that's a good thing in my book. There are a lot of emo bands out there but Panic! At the Disco is a band to be watched as they bring their sound with a great sophistication. "A Fever You Can't Sweat Out" is highly recommended!
