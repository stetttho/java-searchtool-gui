 It's almost the end of 2002, and so far the champ as Best Album of the Year remains Wilco's Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. Watch this album in the coming weeks pile up award after award (among others, it'a already received Album of the Year by Amazon's editorial staff). This is the delightful single from the album. "War on War" is one of the musically more upbeat tracks, driven by Jeff Tweedy's accoustic guitar playing. "Good Part" is a non-album track, also rather upbeat while not in tune with the rest of the album, hence left off. Finally, for anyone who has seen Wilco in concert this year, you know that "I'm the Man Who Loves You" finds Tweedy whipping out a fab guitar solo, and this live version holds true. "War on War" did not find any airtime on US radio. (Neither did YHF, for that matter.) It demonstrates once again how much top quality music never finds its way to the airwaves. What a shame.
