 "World Record" is the third in the trilogy of 1975/1976 "come-back" VDGG albums (after "Godbluff" and "Still Life") and finds the classic line-up of Hammill-Banton-Evans-Jackson playing harder then ever. In spite of the long lenght of the album (for those vinyl days anyway... 53 min!), not a moment is wasted. "When She Comes" and "A Place To Remember" finds the band working up to a frenzy, with Hammill's shrieking voice (no, he'll never be mistaken for, say, Frank Sinatra!), and Jackson working his saxophones tp the extreme. There are 2 slower tracks, "Masks" and the beautiful and catharsic album ending "Wondering", which is in retrospect a truly fitting end of the trilogy of albums... yes, there is hope! "Meurglys III" is the 20 min. "controversial" track, viewed by quite a few as excessive, but in my book the essential track, a complex build-up culminating in a delicious reggae-based 7 min. outro giving core members Jackson and Hammill brilliant solos. "World Record" gives VDGG fans what they want. This is a great album, period.
