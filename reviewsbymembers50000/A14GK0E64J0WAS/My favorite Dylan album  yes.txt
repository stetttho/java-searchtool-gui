 I own many Dylan albums, as I'm sure many of you. Yet, while there are many more "important" Dylan albums, this one remains my favorite album, the one I keep playing more than any other. Coming on the heels of the great "Blood on the Tracks", Bob takes a chance by co-writing all songs (the only album he so did) with an "outsider", Jacques Levy.  No matter, the quality of the songs is top-notch. "Desire" contains of course the well-known protest song "Hurricane", but that's just the beginning! "Isis" is superb, and "Mozambique" is an also coulda/shoulda been radio hit. "One More Cup of Coffee" generously features Emmy Harris' vocals. The 11 min. "Joey" is the only track that I "don't get" (too long, for one), but it is followed by the great "Romance in Durango" and the very best track on this album "Black Diamond Bay". The last track "Sara" is fab but sad, heart-breaking really, knowing now how things would turn out for them. As in all of music, it comes down to what appeals to you. For me, Dylan connected on this album better than any other (and there are now 41 Dylan albums, if I can count correctly). If you're on the edge about buying this, be assured, you won't  be disappointed!
