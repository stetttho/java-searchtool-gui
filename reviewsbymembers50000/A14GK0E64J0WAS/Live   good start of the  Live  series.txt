 With Phish calling it quits last year, we make do with the everlasting legacy of the (so far) 20 "Live" recordings (there are of course many more live releases from Phish, both official ones and from the band's website).  On "Live 01" (2 CDs, 19 tracks, 145 min.), Set 1 starts off with an immediately urgent Suzy Greenberg, and the high energy continues on Llama. The highlights of Set 1, though, come from Foam and Split Open, both of which bookend a new song Makisupa Policeman, a delightful light-reggae take-off. Set 2, as is often the case, outshines Set 1. The Curtain is as prog-rock as Phish will ever get (seriously, didn't it make you think you were listening to Yes?). Tweezer>Timber>Tweezer is awseome, but things get better yet with Hailey's Comet>NICU, showcasing the band free-flowing jamming. And isn't Slave to the Traffic Light a curious but daring way to close the set? A cover of Jimi Hendrix' Bold as Love is the encore. Phish is well known for doing covers, but this one is a bit tame for my taste.  That said, Live 1, recorded at the end of their (almost year-long) 1995 tour shows a band that's playing tight and with great confidence. A nice release to kick of the "Live" series. For other great "Live" releases, check out Live 18 and 20, two of my very favorites.
