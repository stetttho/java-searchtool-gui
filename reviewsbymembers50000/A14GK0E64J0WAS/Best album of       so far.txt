 Since the release of its debut album "A Brilliant Career" in 2001, the band has been through a number of personnel changes and a new label, and after a couple of stop-gap EPs, the band has finally released its second album.  "Film School" (10 tracks, 46 min.) kicks off appropriately with a 1 minute instrumental intro of wrangled guitars, to then slide into "On & On", one of the best tracks on the album, a very atmospheric wall of sound, reminiscent of Interpol-meets-My Bloody Valentine-meets-Lovedrug. The album can be divided in 2 sections: the first 8 tracks, and the remainder two. Indeed the album slowly but surely builds up towards a climax at the end of "11:11", bringing along the way a couple of shorter, almost radio-friendly tracks such as "Harmed" and "Breet", as well as some more majestic tracks such as "Pitfalls" and "He's a DeepDeep Lake". After "11:11" ends, the band must've realized that the album couldn't possibly continue in the same vein as before, and smartly the last 15 minutes of the album are very different, yet don't sound out of place. "Sick of the Shame" and "Like You Know" are accoustic-oriented dream-like songs (somewhat reminiscent of the Brian Jonestown Massacre sound) and the perfect way to close the album.  Film School (the band) brings sophisticated yet very accessible music, and is a delight to listen to. "Film School" (the album) is for me personally the best album of 2006 so far, and I would be surprised if this did not end up in my top 3 for the year. Highly recommended!
