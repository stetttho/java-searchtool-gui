 A reissue (and remaster) of the third album of Telex, which first came out in 1981. This reissue contains the 9 original songs of the "Sex" album, including the "hits" (minor as they were) Brainwash,  Haven't We Met Somewhere Before, and Sigmund Freud's Party. This reissue  also contains 10 bonus tracks, including B sides (Dummy, Basta), an early  version of L'Amour Toujours (the definitive version of which would appear  on their next album, Wonderful World) and the "12 inch" version  of Brainwash, the best tune on the album (and only "real" hit).  This is Telex just past their prime of "Neurovision", serving  more of their mix of Kraftwerk/Gary Numan with extra servings of humor and  self-depreciation. One listen to the double-entendre filled "Sigmund  Freud's Party" tells it all. If you wanna get a feeling of what  sophisticated EuroDisco sounds like, circa 1981, this is it. One final  note: when the album came out in 1981, it had to be retitled for the  issuance in the UK (where Telex had a good following still) to "Birds  & Bees". The title "Sex" was deemed too controversial  for the Thatcher-era Brits, hence the change. How times have changed!
