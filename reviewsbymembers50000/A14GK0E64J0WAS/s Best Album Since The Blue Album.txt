 As a long-time fan of 311, I was disappointed by the 2001 "From Chaos" album. I didn't know what to expect with the new album, and I'm happy to report that "Evolver" is a strong and focused effort. Opener (and first single) "Creatures (For a While)" is a good starter, but things get really heated up with "Reconsider Everything", with an irresitable riff. "Beyond The Gray Sky" finds a great mix of rock/reggae. The best block of songs are tracks 7 through 10, "Still Dreaming" is a great singalong, with the refrain "Sometimes When I'm Awake/I Can't Tell If I'm Still Dreaming/There's So much At Stake/When Every Moment Is Fleeting" (it's the best track on the album), but 1-2 punched by the great "Give Me A Call", and followed by the terrific "Don't Dwell" and "Other Side of Things". What keeps this album from reaching the high of the Blue Album are 2 "reflective" accoustic tunes ("Seems Uncertain" and the really bad closer "Sometimes Jacks"). Nevermind. This album shows that 311 is back in form, and here to stay.
