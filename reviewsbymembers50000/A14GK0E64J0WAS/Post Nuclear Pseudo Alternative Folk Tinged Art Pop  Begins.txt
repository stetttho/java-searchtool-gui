 Linford once described Over The Rhine's music (somewhat tongue-in-cheek, I think) as "post-nuclear, pseudo-alternative, folk-tinged art-pop" and their first album "Til We Have Faces" shows the origins of the band. The opener "Eyes Wide Open" is a representative track for the OTR sound referred to by Linford. It's been eleven years since this first came out, and it is striking how upbeat the band sounds throughout most of the album (in contrast with some later albums such as "Patience" and "Good Dog Bad Dog"). Equally striking is how Karen's voice has gotten stronger over the years (compare this with "Films for Radio" for contrast). The album contains several songs that would define OTR for years: "Like A Radio", still a concert fave these days and "If I'm Drowning" (compare it to the live version on the "Besides" album, though!). Other great tracks include "Iron Curtain" and "Paul & Virginia". At 55 min., the album is a bit long, but it is a very strong debut. I also note that the version listed here on Amazon must be a reissue (1995 apparently), because the original 1991 version which I have lists 14 tracks, not 16: the last 2 listed here ("Radio Coda" and "Downfall") do not appear on the original. Either way, you will enjoy the debut of Cincinnati's best band!
