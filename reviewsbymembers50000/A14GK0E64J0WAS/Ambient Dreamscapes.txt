 I have the "Dreaming...Now, Then" Steve Roach retrospective that came out a few years ago, and was pleasantly surprised with his latest release. I will admit that I only accidentally stumbled upon this album: it  was on the listening station at my favorite bookstore and once I started  listening to it, I could not pull myself away from it. The album is  essentially a 70+ min. oasis of dark, ambient synth-sounding guitar  feedbacks. The term "guitar feedback" is not meant to scare you  away, because quite frankly if it wasn't for the liner notes explaining  that the entire album is made with just guitars, I would not have believed  it (and if anything, only demonstrates the wizardry of Steve Roach). The  best track is "Broken Town", with a threatening bass vibration  that only further dramatizes the sound. Not for everyone (and certainly not  for anyone in a hurry), but for those open to the sounds of ambient  dreamscapes, this is a winner.
