 It is with some pride that I write this review, given that the Greenhornes are from Cincinnati. Even though the Greenhornes have been around for about 10 years, they are now finally finding some national recognition (Rolling Stone recently wrote them up favorably, among others).  "East Grand Blues" (5 tracks, 15 min.) is not a full-fletched album, due to the fact that Brendan Benson, who produced this, had to quit midway through, due to other commitments. Rather than sitting on the recordings, the band decided to release what they had as an EP. Smart move. This is a great EP. The Greenhornes recreate the British 60s era quite beautifully on here, just listen to the opener "I'm Going Away", or "Pattern Skies", just beautiful, it sounds like the British invasion of 40 years ago.  That said, the Greenhornes are opening for the White Stripes on their current US tour. I saw them here in Cincinnati, and they delivered a 30 min. set of garage blues heavy sound that nothing short of blew the roof off of Music Hall, just amazing and awesome. But that set doesn't sound anything like this EP, so will the real Greenhornes stand up? Either way, they are making terrific music, and "East Grand Blues"", as mistitled as it is, is one great EP. Highly recommended!
