 Kraftwerk's influence on the music scene cannot be overstated. Their best albums date indeed back from the 70s, but with the excellent "come-back" 2003 "Tour de France Soundtracks" album, Kraftwerk proved they continue to be relevant. There has never been a proper "greatest hits" album, although the 1992 compilation "The Model" is a decent attempt. Nor has there been proper live album, although the 1998 release "Concert Classics" is a worthwhile recording of a 1975 concert. All this has been solved now.  "Minimum Maximum" (2 CDs, 22 tracks, 120 min.) is an overview of Kraftwerk's 2004 Spring tour of the US and Europe (although curiously only 1 track is in fact culled from the US tour). It offers nothing short of the greatest hits album we have all been waiting for, even if the songs are live. CD1 (10 tracks, 54 min.) focuses heavily on the "Tour de France Soundtracks" album, with 6 tracks (there are 2 more on CD2), but also offers great versions of "Autobahn" and "Neon Lights". CD2 (12 tracks, 66 min.) is even better, with a greatly reworked "Radioactivity" kicking things off. "Trans Europe Express/Metal on Metal" is equally entrancing. Then comes a stretch of the "Computer World" album tracks, just awesome. The closer "Music Non Stop" is better than that album ever was.  This is a terrific album all around. Even if you have most of Kraftwerk's albums already (as I do), it is great to have the best known and loved Kraftwerk's tracks in a single place. Highly recommended!
