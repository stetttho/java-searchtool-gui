 Belgian electronic music group Telex issued its second album in 1980, and with it created its lasting legacy. This reissue contains all of the original 11 tracks, each one of them a classic, including the double  "A" sided single We Are All Getting Old/En Route, the (modest)  hit "Euro-Vision", as well as other classics such as Tour de  France (years before the Kraftwerk single of the same name), Cliche (41  seconds of brilliance), and a rousing cover of Sly Stone's Dance to the  Music. The reissue also contains 10 bonus tracks, including the non-album  single Soul Waves (first time ever on CD), and various B sides and  obscurities (check out the instrumental track Troppical). Never again would  Telex equal its mixture of electronic dance tunes, humor, sarcasm and wits  as well as displayed on "Neurovision". If you can buy only one  Telex CD, look no further.
