 It's hard to believe that Modest Mouse has been at it for more than 10 years, yet now find some (modest) mainstream succes with "Float On", which gets constant TV airplay on MTV and Fuse. Yet so it goes. This album proves that Modest Mouse is more than "Float On". "Good News for People Who Love Bad News" (16 tracks, 48 min.) starts off with the Dirty Dozen Brass Band's "Horn Intro" and then immediately shifts to the great "The World at Large", a pensive tune, followed by the breakout hit "Float On", which is truly an irresistable tune. It's hard to "label" Modest Mouse, but it falls philosophically somewhere between Grandaddy, Flaming Lipps and such other irreverant bands. "Bury Me With It" rocks hard, and is another standout. Band leader and song writer Isaac Brock pulls no punches, and is as confident as ever. Check out "This Devil's Workday", with again the Dirty Dozen Brass Band's input upfront, just great, as well as "Satin in a Coffin", with some banjo thrown in for good measure! "Blame it on the Tetons" finds the band at its most reflective, another standout track. The album is a bit overlong and drags towards the end, but no matter, this is thoroughly enjoyable.
