 David Bowie originally issued the live "Stage" double album in late 1978, after a wildly successful world tour. The album was not received very well by either critics or the buying public, but this reissue will hopefully correct that once and for all.  The reissue of "Stage" (2 CDs, 20 tracks, 84 min.) is vastly different from the original double vinyl album. For one, the sequencing of the tracks follows the actual concert (hence starting off with the somber instrumental "Warszawa"). For another, two tracks have been added ("Be My Wife" and "Stay"). CD1 concentrates on songs from the then-current "Low" and "Heroes" albums, with a great "Speed of Life" and "Breaking Glass" as highlights. CD2 showcases older songs like "Ziggy Stardust", "Station to Station" (this live version also shows up on the "Christiane F." soundtrack), and a truly excellent "Stay" (hard to understand why this was left off the original album, it's one of the best tracks on here). It should also be noted that the remastered sound is a remarkable improvement over the original album.  The packaging of this reissue is first class all the way. The CD opens up very cleaverly, it's hard to explain until you actually have it in your hands. There are insightful liner notes from producer Tony Visconti, and to top it off there is a listing of all the dates on the 1978 world tour (interesting to see how many of the US concert sites of those days are no longer around). In all, the new-and-improved "Stage" is essential for any serious Bowie fan.
