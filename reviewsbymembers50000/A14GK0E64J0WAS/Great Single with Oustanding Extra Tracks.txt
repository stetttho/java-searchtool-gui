 The Cure were riding a high with the "Disintegration" album in 1989. This single (make that EP) runs 5 tracks, 27 min. and is really great all around. "Pictures of You", the outstanding track of "Desintegration" shows up here in a slightly different (remixed) version from the album and, more importantly, not the full length version, reason I cannot rate this 5 stars. The extra tracks, though, are outstanding. They contain live versions of "Last Dance", "Fascination Street" (since then a concert fave), an outstanding "Prayers for Rain", and last but not least an 8 min. live version of the title track of "Disintegration". Just fab.
