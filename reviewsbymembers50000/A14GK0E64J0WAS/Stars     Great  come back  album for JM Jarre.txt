 Jean-Michelle enjoyed global success in the late 70-early 80s with his synthesizer-based albums "Oxygene", "Equinoxe", and "Magnetic Fields". After that, Jarre went on a wild spree of soundscape experimenting, steadily losing audiences. He finally put a stop to that with this 1997 release.  "Oxygene 7-13" (7 tracks, 41 min.) is what the title suggests, a straight sequel to Jarre's debut album, and a so very welcome return to the analogue (sounding) synthesizers of the 1977 "Oxygene" album. The tracks flow great from one to another. "Oxygene 7" is the excellent 11 min. opener that sets the table for other tracks. "Oxygene 8" is a terrific upbeat track, tipping the ol' hat to the influence of more modern club  trancing music. Another highlight for me is "Oxygene 11", with synths and moogs bobbing hard. The last track is a funny one, not unlike "Magnetic Fields Part V", tongue firmly in cheek.  If you stopped caring for Jean-Michel Jarre after the "Magnetic Fields" album (as I pretty much did), this album is a true return to the sound of Jarre's early albums, you won't be disappointed!
