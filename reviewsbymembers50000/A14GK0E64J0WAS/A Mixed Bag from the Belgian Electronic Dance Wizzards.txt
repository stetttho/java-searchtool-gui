 This reissue is a straight compilation (no bonus tracks) of Telex's last 2 CDs, Wonderful World (1984) and Looney Tunes (1988). Wonderful World (4 stars) continues their move into a heavier sound first explored in the  "Sex" album. It contains the singles L'Amour Toujours (a great  song but unfortunately not the "12 inch club" version which is  much better than the album version--where are bonus tracks when you need  them?), Raised by Snakes and The Voice, as well as a few other jems such as  the title track and Vertigo. Looney Tunes (2 stars) is by far the weakest  Telex effort ever. It is an attempt to return to a lighter sound but  somehow resulted in a bunch of nervous irritating songs. Looney Tunes  contains the singles Temporary Chicken, Spike Jones (which is a tribute to  "the funniest comedian ever") and Peanuts. It also contains the  most annoying Telex song ever: Baby, When? A disappointing way to bow out  but it cannot stain the brilliance amply demonstrated in earlier albums.
