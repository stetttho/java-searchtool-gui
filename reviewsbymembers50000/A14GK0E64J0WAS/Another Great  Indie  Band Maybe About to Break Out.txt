 I kinda stumbled onto this album through a friend, and just loved what I heard. Hot Hot Heat has been around for a while, and with this release may finally be finding the larger audience it deserves. 10 songs in 32 min., "Make Up the Breakdown" takes charge from the opening track, and doesn't let up. One great track follows after another. Best songs include the single "Bandages", "Naked in the City Again", "No Not Now", "Talk to Me, Dance with Me", and "Aveda". Needless to say, HHH does not find any airplay on radio stations, but (this is an old tired song), it is telling about the state of radio. Great album!
