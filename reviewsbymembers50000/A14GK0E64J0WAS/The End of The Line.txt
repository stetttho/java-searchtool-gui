 In the mid-to late 80s, Tangerine Dream cranked out soundtracks like Ken Griffey Jr. hits home runs: in bunches. This 1987 soundtrack, for a less-than-interesting "scary" movie, turned out to be the end of the line for me. I had still hung in there, with "Underwater Sunlight" and the "Legend" soundtrack in 1986, but barely. I didn't know it at the time, but I simply stopped buying new TD releases, because their music was gradually becoming... uninteresting, which is the worst complaint one can make. This soundtrack demonstrates the worthiness of the "skip" or "program" button on your remote. If you pick and choose, there is some decent stuff on here. In particular some of the longer tracks are worth exploring. "Pick Up At High Noon" is atmospheric and dark (near dark?). "Bus Station/Rae's Theme" is the best track of all, an 8 min. piece that starts out haunting and midway through becomes more reflective. "She's My Sister" and "Father & Son" also are worthwhile. After that, it's a very mixed bag. "Good Times" is a short piece that shows TD is not a rock'n'roll band: just aweful. Overall, this soundtrack is slightly better than, say, their soundtracks for "Three O'Clock High" or "Shy People" from the same era, but keep your remote handy: you will need it!
