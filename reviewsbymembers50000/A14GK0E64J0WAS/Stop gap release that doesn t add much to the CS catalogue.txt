 I am a huge fan of Collective Soul, have been since the early years, saw them in concert in 1995 opening up for Van Halen, and have seen them many times in concert since then. After their impressive run of mega-hits came to a close with the 2001 "Greatest Hits" album, Collective Soul took a long sabbatical, and finally returned with the excellent "Youth" album in late 2004. Six months later, they released this EP.  "From the Ground Up" (8 tracks, 31 min.) is unlike anything CS has released. Ed Rolland's liner notes indicate this was recorded in a mere 2 days. This collection is not a collection of demo-tapes, but instead a recreation of demo-tapes, and a stripped-down, acoustic only, sound of CS. Four tracks on here are from the "Youth" album, with a couple of older songs thrown in, including the only hit "December", and with one new song, "Youth", which presumably was meant to be included on that album, but for whatever reason wasn't. Most songs on here is just is Ed Rolland solo on acoustic guitar. The best of the bunch here is "Counting the Days", a nice band effort.  I'm not sure what to make of this EP (which sells at an album price, though). Collective Soul now self-releases its music, and I guess this is just another release to generate revenue, the cynic in me tells me. Up next from Collective Soul is next month's release of their great show with the Atlanta Youth Symphony Orchestra from May, 2005, and I am much more excited about that than this curious EP. It's not bad, but it doesn't add much to the Collective Soul catalogue.
