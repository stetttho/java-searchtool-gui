 The days of Amy Grant's mainstream success in the mid-90s with hits like "Lucky One" are far behind Amy. Instead of trying to refind that mainstream success, Amy instead returns again to her earlier Christian roots, with excellent results.  "Rock of Ages" (13 tracks, 45 min.) is an excellent sequel to 2002's "Legacy" album, again covering well known and not so well known old time hymns and religious material. The album's opener, "Anywhere With Jesus" is a delight, with a long instrumental intro that gives way to Amy's soaring vocals, just beautiful. There are many highlights on here, such as "Sweet Will of God", with the vocals-only intro, and "O Master, Let Me Walk With You", among others. Country superstar Vince Gill (Amy's husband) co-produced the album, with great results.  This album will not bring Amy renewed mainstream success, nor was it intended to (presumably), although it of course would be nice if this delicious collection sold millions. "Rock of Ages" proves that Christian music doesn't have to boring. This album is a delight from start to finish. Highly recommeded!
