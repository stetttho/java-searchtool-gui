 Band of Horses is a "new" band, in the sense that this is their debut album, but these guys have been around for quite a long time. Ben Bridwell and Matt Brooke, the main creative forces behind Band of Horses, were in a previous band, Carrisa's Weird, for many years, but that band never got anywhere.  "Everything All the Time" (10 tracks, 36 min.) brings a sound reminiscent of early My Morning Jacket, with a mix of The Band and Neil Young, and quite terrific at that. The opener "First Song" sets the table, but followed by the harder-rocking "Wicked Gil". The standout is the current radio single "The Funeral", a 5+ min. melancholic tune that resonates long after you hear it and makes you want to hear it again and again. Other highlights include the pensive, acoustic "I Go to the Barn Because I Like Her" and the closer "St. Augustine".  If you are wondering where I found out about Band of Horses, they get a lot of airplay on the internet-only station WOXY.com, the best indie-station in the country, bar none, check it out. Band of Horses is coming to Cincinnati in June, and I can't wait to see how these songs translate in a live setting. "Everything All The Time" is an outstanding album, highly recommended!
