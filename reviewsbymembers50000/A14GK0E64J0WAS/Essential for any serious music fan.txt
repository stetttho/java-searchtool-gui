 I'm not a native English speaker (moved to the US 20+ years ago) and one of the annoying things of Bob Dylan albums is that, for whatever reason, they don't come with the lyrics to the songs. I'm a big Dylan fan, and as much as I enjoy listening to the albums, I've always wanted to better understand the lyrics. Well, consider that problem solved with this book.  "Lyrics 1962-2001" is the solution to my problem, a 600 page (hard cover) book, containing the lyrics to all Bob Dylan's songs. The book is arranged album-by-album, and song-by-song within those albums, and contains in addition the words to other songs that were not originally on any album.   Bob Dylan towers over the music scene like few others, and his word-crafting has no equal. This book is essential, not just for Bob Dylan fans, but for any serious music lover. I bought this book from Amazon.com, for a mere $27 (S/H included), 40% off the cover price, one of the best bargains ever. "Strongly recommended" doesn't do justice, this is simply essential.
