 I fully realize that Wings Wild Life is generally dismissed and one of the least liked McCartney/Wings efforts. Yet after all these years I continue to find it a fascinating, raw, adventurous, and top notch album. This album comes right after Paul's RAM album (billed to Paul & Linda), and was recorded in very little time (anywhere between 3 days and 2 weeks, depending on who you believe). The opening track "Mumbo" sets the stage: the band unleashes an energy that pops out at you, with few (and hard to understand anyway) lyrics. Ditto for "Bip Bop". "Love is Strange" is reggae-influenced, and irresistable. The title track (concluding Side 1 of the album) is Paul and Linda's earliest environmentally themed song. The best songs are yet to come!! "Some People Never Know" may be Paul at its very best, period. Linda delivers "I Am Your Singer", a sweet 2'15" track that flows well in the scheme of things. "Tomorrow" is the most commercial track of the album. "Dear Friend" closes out, with Paul on the piano, supposedly addressing John Lennon. If you are thinking of buying this excellent album, by all means AVOID this domestic pressing, and instead buy the "import" version (also available on Amazon) which is remastered AND has better bonus tracks: "Give Ireland Back to the Irish", "Mary Had a Little Lamb", "Little Woman Love" and "Mama's Little Girl". If your idea of Paul at his best is "My Love" or "With a Little Luck", avoid this album. If on the other hand you've always wished for Paul to think "outside the box" musically, he most certainly did on Wings Wild Life. You won't be dissapointed.
