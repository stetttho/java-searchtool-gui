 Genesis toiled away in relative obscurity after the "Tresspass" and "Nursery Cryme" albums, but gained major attention with "Selling England by the Pound" (8 tracks, 53 min.), issued in November 1973 (can it be already 30 years ago?). The reason for gaining the attention was that the band's songwriting had taken a quantum leap. It is demonstrated immediately by the opener "Dancing With the Moonlit Knight", a gorgeously crafted track. It was also helped by the single "I Know What I Liked", a likeable singalong and modest hit in the UK. But the strenght of the album lies in the epic "Firth of Fifth" and "Cinema Show", both showcasing Tony Banks on keys, and concert staples for many years to come. "More Fool Me" is an unassuming little track, famous now for having drummer Phil Collins singing lead (which would prove ominous after Peter Gabriel left Genesis in 1975). In all, "Selling England" is, despite the rise in acclaim and attnetion, the last album Genesis album "under the radar screen" but the test of time proves that this is as good an album Genesis released in their "art-prog-rock" era. Simply essential.
