 At last count, there are 588 reviews of this on Amazon, so what can I, a "serious music lover" add to this? A different perspective perhaps, which adds up to "guilty pleasure", nothing more, nothing less. Evanescence has come out of nowhere, really. Two tracks on last year's "Daredevil" soundtrack has caused all the buzz, and now we have their debut album, which is a mix of "goth" tracks such as the terrific "Going Under" and "Bring Me to Life" and ballads such as "My Immortal" and "Hello". The thing that catches me are the rocking tracks, with Ben Moody's catchy guitar hooks. Amy Lee's vocals are outstanding as well throughout. Do I think that Evanescence will make a lasting impact on the music scene? I doubt it, frankly. But "Fallen" is a thouroughly enjoyable listen all the way through. What a guitly pleasure!
