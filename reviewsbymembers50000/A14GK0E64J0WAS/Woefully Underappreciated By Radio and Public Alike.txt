 Shea Seger can be thrown together in a group of high quality female singer/songwriters that are woefully underappreciated by the media and the public alike (others include Miranda Lee Richards, Leona Naess, etc.). Shea's debut album is "The May Street Project", a London-recorded collection of personal songs, backed by all kinds of instruments and scratches. Think of halfway between Jewel and Beck. The album's first 2 songs are among its strongest, and not surprisingly were also the (overlooked) singles: "Last Time" is an upbeat pop song, and "Clutch" goes one further, with its irresistable bass-driven dance hook. "Blind Situation" even has a  rap line or two. "Shatterwall" is a mesmorizing quiet song. "Twisted (Never Again)" is a toned-down Alanis rant, very good. The title track, the last song on the set, sums up the album very nicely: heavy beat, good groove, well done! This album came out over a year ago, and basically has gone completely ignored. What a shame. For anyone interested in more than Britney, Christina or any other latest flavor of the day, check this out. You will not be disappointed!
