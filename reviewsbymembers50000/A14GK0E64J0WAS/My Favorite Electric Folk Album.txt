 Steeleye Span had its commercial breakout success in 1975 with "All  Around My Hat", both the single and the album of the same name. Their  next effort, 1976's "Rocket Cottage tanked commercially, and I could  not understand then, and cannot now, why. As a whole, I find this album  more enjoyable that "All Around My Hat". The opening track  "London" (also the lead-off single) is exactly in the vein of  "All Around My Hat" and if anything sounds a little too close  like it. Other standout tracks include the mesmorizing "Fighting For  Strangers" (play it loud!), "Sir James the Rose", "The  Twelve Witches" and "The Brown Girl" (Maggie Prior's vocals  in fine form!). Quite frankly, there isn't a weak song on the album. I  decked one star from my rating because this is a straight reissue (the CD  clocks in at 43+ min, where are the extra tracks such as single B-sides  and/or live tracks?), the sound quality is acceptable but not brilliant,  and while there are fine (if straighforward) liner notes on Steeleye Span's  career as a whole, there is no information whatsoever on the recording on  this album (when, where, etc.), although the CD does include the lyrics to  the songs. In the end, enjoy the album for its fine songs. Electric Folk at  its best!
