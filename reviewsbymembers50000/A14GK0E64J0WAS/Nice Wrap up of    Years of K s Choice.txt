 Last year K's Choice, one of Belgium's best rock bands ever (headed by brother/sister Gert and Sarah Bettens), unexpectedly called it quits, after 4 albums and 22 singles. This is then the last chapter in the Choice saga: an overview of their biggest and best singles. Rightfully, this compilation emphasizes the singles from 1995's "Paradise in Me", K's Choice breakthrough album in the US, with 5 tracks including the signature song "Not an Addict" (still haunting after all these years), but also "Mr. Freeze", "Little Man', "Wait" and "Dad" (I wish they had substituted the latter for "A Sound That Only You Can Hear", a much better single). 1998's "Cucoon Crash" is also represented well with 4 singles, including the terrific "Believe" and "If You're Not Scared", but regretfully missing the title track, a great single. All 3 singles of 2001's "Almost Happy" are on here: the title track, "Another year" and "Busy". Even though K's Choice debut album was a smash in Europe (7 hit singles!), it's virtually unknown in the US, and hence only gets 2 tracks ("The Ballad of Lea and Paul) and "I Smoke a Lot"). Appearing for the 1st time on a K's Choice album is "Virgin State of Mind", from the 1999 Buffy the vampire Slayer soundtrack, another great track. The new track "Losing You" is not K's Choice at its best, unfortunately. In all, this is a very nice collection of K's Choice greatest hits. They were always bigger in Europe than in the US, even though for a moment or two in 1996-97 it looked like they were going to make it "big" here as well. Meanwhile, Sarah Bettens (K's leadsinger) is readying her first solo-album for release sometime in 2004. Looking forward to that already!
