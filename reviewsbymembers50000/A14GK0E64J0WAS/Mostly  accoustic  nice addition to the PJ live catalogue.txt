 Pearl Jam has released every single show of its 2000 and 2003 world tours on CD.  This show is actually a one-off charity gig from October, 2003, several months after the conclusion of the tour. Even more interestingly, this is a (mostly) accoustic show, and that makes this show stand apart from the 'regular' live sets.  "Benaroya Hall" (2 CDs, 26 tracks, 129 min.) brings a great mix of well known tracks (such as Immortality, Black, Off He Goes, Daughter and, my favorite, the show-opener Of A Girl), and more obscure songs and covers (a truly great cover of Bob Dylan's Masters of War, but also PJ nuggets like Man of the Hour, Down, and Dead Man). Eddie Vedder is in superb vocal shape throughout the night, and for having been off the road for months, the band nevertheless sounds incredibly tight.  A (mostly) accoustic live show is a risky thing to do, as it is hard to keep a crowd that really wants to rock out, interested. Pearl Jam carries off the task without problems. But just in case, the band closes the evening with a very electric and excellent "Yellow Bedsetter", reminding us that PJ remains  one of the best live acts today. It's a shame they don't tour more often. In all, this is an excellent addition to the already rich and vast Pearl Jam catalogue, and certainly a 'must' for any serious PJ fan.
