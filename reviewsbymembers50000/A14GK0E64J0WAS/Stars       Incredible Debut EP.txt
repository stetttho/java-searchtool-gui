 So out of nowhere come a bunch of teenagers from Texas (4 siblings plus a friend, the female lead singer is 15, yes you read right) with this debut EP, which is nothing short of incredible. Musically, Eisley reminds me of a dreamier version of Sixpence None the Richer, with a splash of Poe and also Libbie Schrader (Think of England) for good measure. "Laughing City" (5 tracks, 18 min.) starts of with arguably its weakest song, a tentative "I Wasn't Prepared", but after that all cylinders are on. "Telescope Eyes" comes on with a great guitar riff in the chorus. "Tree Tops" is the best song here, with great interplay between keyboards and guitar riffs. "Over the Mountain" is another hard-charging tune. The EP closes with the reflective title track, just beautiful. Since the release of this EP in Spring 2003, Eisley released an equally stunning follow-up EP ("Marvelous Things") in late 2003. I can't wait for the debut album later this year. Meanwhile, by all means, buy this!
