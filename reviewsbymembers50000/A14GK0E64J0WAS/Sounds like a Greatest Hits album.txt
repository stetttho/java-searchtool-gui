 This review is of course written with the benefit of 6 years in retrospect since Radiohead released "The Bends". But at this point the album sounds to me like "Greatest Hits" album, basically each track being a classic (similarities to Oasis' "Definitely Maybe" come to mind... each track there also being a classic in retrospect). From the opening sounds of "Planet Telex", this shows "Brit Rock Invasion" at its best. "The Bends" (the track) just rocks, giving way to the tender sounds of "High and Dry" and "Fake Plastic Trees", perhaps the best track on the album. You know all the songs by now. "My Iron Lung" is another fave of mine, as is the last tracak "Street Spirit (Fade Out)". With the different sound/avenue in the last year of "Kid A" (which I love) and "Amnesiac" (which I don't "get"), the real question for us Radiohead fans is... where does the band go next? If you know... you know more than I do.
