 Contrary to the Editorial Review, this compliation does not gather the best of Kayak from 1973 on (the EMI years ran '73 through '75), but picks up after the Royal Bed Bouncer album, in 1976 when they switched to the  Vertigo label. The by-now less progressive rock band from Holland  nevertheless still produced a number of very enjoyable songs, as  demonstrated on this collection. The opening track "Keep the  Change" is a gentle song, and reminds of the Royal Bed Bouncer era.  The songs Ruthless Queen, Starlight Dancer and Phantom of the Night form a  trio of high drama songs, with full orchetra, and should be heard in  succession. Want You To Be Mine is Kayak's idea of a "disco"  song. As to Lyrics (originally on See See the Sun) and Chance For A  Lifetime (originally on Royal Bed Bouncer), don't be fooled: the versions  found on this collection are live versions (and not bad at all, actually,  in particular Lyrics is reworked beautifully). This collection is ideal if  you are interested in only the very best songs of Kayak in their post-EMI  years, rather than buying all the various albums. Very satisfying CD.
