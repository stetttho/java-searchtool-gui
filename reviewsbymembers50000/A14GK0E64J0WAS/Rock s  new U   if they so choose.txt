 "Rush of Blood to the Head" is the excellent follow-up to Coldplay's debut album "Parachutes". Long in the making, the album more than delivers and manages to meet the highest of expectations. Less "simple" than "Parachutes", "Rush of Blood" kicks off with a pulsating "Politik" and never lets up. "In My Place", a long-time concert staple and the first single, is as close to "Parachutes" as it gets. Everyone has their own favorite tracks, and for me the title track towers above the rest. It is a nice capsule of all that is Coldplay 2002: dramatic and lush musical landscape, thoughtful lyrics, and Chris Martin's unique vocals. It is amazing how fast Coldplay has developed as a band: compare "Rush of Blood" to 1999's "Blue Room EP" and you will see what I mean. While I don't want to "jinx" the band by overloading them with praise, "Rush of Blood" really puts them in a position to become the "new U2" for the next couple of decades, if they so choose.
