 I grew up a big Telex fax while living in Belgium and seeing the original albums reissued with obvious immense care is very satisfying. Marc Moulin (a one-time jazz panist and then part-time DJ on Radio Cite), co-synthesist  Dan Lacksman and singer (and one-time architect, if my memory serves me  right) Michel Moers create synthesized disco (remember, their first album  "Looking for St. Tropez" came out in 1979) dance tunes and other  electronic wizzardry. Think a mix of Kraftwerk/Gary Numan with a sense of  humor. This reissue contains the 9 originals tracks (including the  "hits" Twist a St. Tropez, Moscow Discow, and Rock around the  Clock--yes, the Bill Haley tune!) and 5 bonus tracks, including some  obscure B sides and the last track Avec Fifi, an instrumental, which must  be heard to be believed (I won't spoil the surprise here). In the US, Telex  achieved brief notoriety with the underground club version of Moscos  Discow, which since then has been imitated often, but never equalized. This  reissue includes both the "regular" and the "12 inch  underground club" version of the song. If you like good synthesizer  dance music, you cannot go wrong with "Looking for St. Tropez".
