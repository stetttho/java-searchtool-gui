 Ryan's label, Lost Highway Records, refused to release "Love Is Hell" as the proper follow-up of "Gold" in Spring 2003, as orginally contemplated, fearing "Love Is Hell" is not commercial enough. (These are probably the same suits that refused to release Wilco's Yankee Hotel Foxtrot.) So they "suggested" to Ryan to come up with something else (which he did, with the dreadful "Rock N Roll"), and as a bonus we finally do get "Love Is Hell", albeit in 2 EPs. "Love Is Hell (Pt. 1)" (8 tracks, 34 min.) is a great listen, and flows very well from where "Gold" left us. The opener "Political Scientist" finds Ryan on piano, beautifully moping as only he can. Other standout tracks include: "This House Is Not For Sale", a nice upbeat tempo rune with a tip of the ol' hat to the Smiths, "The Shadowlands", another beautiful ballad, and the haunting Oasis cover "Wonderwall", oddly enough the best track. Why the record label refused to issue "Love Is Hell" as a proper album is incomprehensible. But at least now the music is out, well half of it (the rest comes in December). For anyone wondering whether to buy this or "Rock N Roll", the choice is very clear: "Love" may be "Hell", but at least Ryan makes it sound great.
