 It's been a mere 4-5 years that Travis overtook Oasis as the biggest band in the UK, with the magnificent album "The Man Who", but alas it was not to last long. Uneven albums afterwards and lil' thing called Coldplay took care of that.   I don't know what Amazon's editorial reviewers heard, but the "Singles" album that I have does not have 29 tracks as listed on here, but instead 18 tracks (63 min.), all of Travis' singles, plus one new track (the unremarkable "Walking in the Sun"). There is a lot of great music on here, no question about it, including the 5 singles from "Good Feeling" and the 4 singles from "The Man Who". Most annoyingly the songs are not presented chorologically. Thus the beautiful "All I Wanna Do Is Rock" from their debut album is followed by "This Beautiful Occupation", a lame song from the lame "12 Memories" album. This collection does contain the essential "Coming Around", a mega-hit in Europe in the summer of 2001 and previously only avaiable as a single.  As a big Travis fan from the early days, it pains me to see how Fran Healy and the boys have lost the pedals in recent years. While "Singles" is not a bad collection, if you really want to hear Travis at the top of their game, purchase "The Man Who", which in the US was released with several bonus tracks that are essential in the Travis catalogue, including "Blue Flashing Lights", "20" and "Only Molly Knows".
