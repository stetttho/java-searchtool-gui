 Living in Cincinnati since the late 80s, I have seen Dayton's Guided By Voices a number of times over the years, yet I had never actually purchased a GBV album, because I felt that the live act always was the better of the studio act. But when this collection came out, I decided to cave in and get it. I'm happy I did.  "Human Amusements at Hourly Rates: The Best of Guided By Voices" (32 tracks--yes, you read right; 77 min.) is all over the maps as far as GBV's studio output is concerned, but centers more on the latter era GBV (considering the band celebrates 20 years this year). There are 4 songs from "Bee Thousand", the best known GBV album, including the great "Echos Myron" and "I Am A Scientist". Most songs run in the 2 minute range, scarcely wasting time, getting to the hooks right away, and moving on to the next song before you can settle in, not that that is a bad thing.  Guided By Voices is an underrated and underappreciated band (not unlike, say, Cincinnati's Afghan Whigs when they were around) and Robert Pollard recently announced that GBV will hang it up for good after this Fall's 'farewell' tour. Don't miss them if they come to your town. I know I will be there when they come to Cincinnati in late October! Meanwhile, this collection is a great introduction to the band and a handy overview if you don't feel like buying any of their many albums.
