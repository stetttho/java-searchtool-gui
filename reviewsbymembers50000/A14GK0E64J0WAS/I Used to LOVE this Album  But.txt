 I have several Steve Winwood CDs, which admiddetly I don't play much anymore. But when I recently saw this CD in a second-hand store cheap I couldn't resist. I mean, I used to LOVE this album when it originally came out in 1980. I played it over and over in those days. "Arc of a Diver" (7 tracks, 40 min.) contains the hits "While You See a Chance" and "Second-Hand Woman", and the title track is well known too, but it all sounds a bit... 80s synth-lite now. The only track that really remains a stand-out now is the brooding, grooving "Night Train". This album set the stage for the commercial blockbusters "Back in the High Life" and "Roll With It". With the hind-sight of 20 years or so, it is strangely clear to me that Steve Winwood's solo output simply hasn't aged well. It was exciting music then, but isn't now, sorry.
