 Franz Ferdinand is a band from Scotland which in less than a year has become a sensation in the UK. This is their first single, and is simply outstanding. "Darts of Pleasure" (5 tracks, 16 min.) starts off with the title track, an immediate burst of energy, with a high pulse of guitars and bass. The song reminded me as a mix between Hot Hot Heat and Interpol, I know that's hard to imagine, but trust me, it works! And you have to hear the German (!) singalong chorus at the outro, just great. "Van Tango" pits the guitars more up front. "Shopping" is the least appealing song, albeit not bad. The two demos are very interesting: "Tell Her Tonight" is haunting (and appears in full band mode on the debut album), and there is also a demo of "Darts". It's clear that Franz Ferdinand has "it" (however you want to describe it) and is going places. The band would go on to release their debut album in March 2004, and the album only confirms the promise of the excellent "Darts" EP. Strongly recommended!
