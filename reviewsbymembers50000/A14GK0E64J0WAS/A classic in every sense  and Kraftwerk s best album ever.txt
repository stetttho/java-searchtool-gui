 It's now been 26 years since Kraftwerk released "The Man Machine", the second of the classic trilogy of albums started with 1977's "Trans Europe Express" and concluded with 1981's "Computer World". I'm gonna have to disagree with the London reviewer a couple of reviews below, and believe that the album has clearly stood the test of time. In my opinion, Kraftwerk synthesized everything here, and this album noses out "Computer World" as their best ever. "The Man Machine" (6 tracks, 36 min.) can be divided up in 3 parts: (1) the singles "The Model" and "The Robots" are irresistable (I remember being in France the summer of '78 when this just came out and the discos were blasting "The Robots", make sure you crank up the volume on this one); (2) the (mostly) instrumentals "Spacelab" and "Metropolis" are nice; (3) the most important, and best, tracks are the 2 last: "Neon Lights" is mostly instrumental, with an incredible hypnotizing outro, just amazing; and the title track is a dark, yet highly "robotic" danceable song that sums up the album perfectly. At 36 min., there is not a second, not a moment wasted. How many albums can make that claim? Also, if you haven't checked out "Tour de France Soundtracks", Kraftwerk's 2003 'come-back' album, make sure to do so. It is a delight, unexpectedly so in my opinion after a 17 year break.
