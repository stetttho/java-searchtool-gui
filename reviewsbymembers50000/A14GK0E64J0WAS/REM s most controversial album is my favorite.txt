 "Monster" is dissed by many REM fans, but for me it was (and is) their favorite album. Coming off the crowd-pleaser (and terrific) "Automatic For The People", REM refuses to make "Automatic 2" and instead dishes up an all-out rock-and-rough "Monster". What band would have dared that? "What's The Frequency Kenneth" kicks things of and sets the tone: this is all-out, dont-take-any-prisoners rock, with distorted guitars all over the place, and loud, LOUD, no "Everybody's Hurt" here! Standout tracks include "King of Comedy", "Star 69", "I took Your Name", "Let Me In" (all distorted Peter Buck guitar whaling), and the best of all "Bang and Blame", the outro of which is ohh so good..., the best part of the album (it was left off the single version, I guess for "radio format" reasons) REM has made so many great albums, and as always it comes down to personal preferences. For whatever reason, I tend to play this more than any other REM album. Give it a chance and you wont be disappointed!
