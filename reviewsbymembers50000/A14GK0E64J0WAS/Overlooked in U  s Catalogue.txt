 Somewhat surprisingly U2 came back one year after the seminal "Achtung Baby" with another album. What initially was going to be an EP of a couple of songs was fleshed out into a full-blown album while the band was doing the "Zooropa" tour. "Zooropa" (10 tracks, 51 min.) is overlooked in U2's overall output as an "afterthought" but in fact is a strong, albeit more experimental album. The title track is one of U2's best songs, epic in every aspect. The single "Numb" is one of U2's most misunderstood and underappreciated songs. "Lemon" is U2's idea of "disco", and works just great. "Stay (Faraway So Close)" was later used as a soundtrack for a Wim Wenders movie. "Daddy's Gonna Pay" is a great experimental "scratch-and-grind" track. The close-out track "The Wanderer" finds Johnny Cash on lead vocals, eerily preminicious of his later 90's albums. Beware: there is a "hidden" track after that: a 30 sec. electronic "bleep" of sorts... wow! In all, this is a great U2 album, although not as commercially accessible as "Achtung Baby" and hence regretfully overlooked. Give it a chance, you won't be disappointed.
