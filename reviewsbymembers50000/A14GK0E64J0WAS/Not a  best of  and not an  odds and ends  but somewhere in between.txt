 Is Alanis hanging it up? After the startling mediocre acoustic remake of the classic "Jagged Little Pill" album earlier this year, we now receive the first overview of Alanis' 10 year career.  Simple titled "The Collection" (18 tracks, 73 min.), this is a somewhat awkward bringing together of many (but not all) of Alani's greatest hits and many (but not all) of her odds-and-ends tracks. Of course the emphasis is on "Jagged Little Pill", and rightfully so, but despite the 5 tracks from that album, no "All I Really Want", which was a huge radio hit. "Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie" gets only 2 tracks ("Thank U", now renamed "Thank You", and "That I Would Be Good", but no "Baba" or "Unsent"), the outstanding "Under Rug Swept" album gets only 1 song ("Hands Clean"; contrary to Amazon's listing above, "So Unsexy" is not on here; also no "21 Things I Want In a Lover" and "Precious Illusions"), while the mediocre "So-Called Chaos" album is represented with "8 Easy Steps" and "Everything". The remainder half of the CD is a hosh-posh of soundtrack contributions (including the classis "Uninvited" from City of Angels), B-sides, a song from the MTV Unplugged album ("Princess Familiar"), and one new song, the Seal-cover "Crazy", which is not bad, but certainly not essential.  I think the public at large would've been better served with a straight-up "Greatest Hits", while the more in-depth fans would've been more interested in a true cleaning of the vaults. That said, there is no denying that there is a lot of good music on "The Colletion".
