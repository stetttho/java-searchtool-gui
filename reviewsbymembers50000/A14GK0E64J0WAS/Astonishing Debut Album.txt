 The Stills in Summer 2003 released the intruiging (albeit too brief) "Rememberese" EP, and followed it up with thei debut album "Logic Will Break Your Heart" (12 tracks, 49 min.). The album traces its musical roots to late 70s/early 80s bands like New Musik, The Cure, Joy Division etc. but to say that the Stills "imitates" those bands is doing injustice to the Stills. "Logic Will Break Your Heart" starts off very strongly with "Lola Stars and Stripes", with a dark wall-of-sound that sets the tone for the rest of the album. "Gender Bombs" is in the same vein. "Of Montreal" is my favorite and the stand-out track of the album, with intricate guitar interplays and riffs. "Ready for It" is another up-tempo rocker. "Let's Roll" is a chilling song about 9/11 ("Don't Be Afraid to Be Afraid With Me... Let's Roll!"). Debut single "Still in Love Song" strangely is not a great fit on the album, as it's too catchy and straighforward in comparison with all other tracks. "Yesterday Never Tomorrow" is an appropriate closing track, with a nice fade-out and an underlying drum straight from New Musik; it's my second-fave track on the album In all, this is nothing short of a terrific album. Perhaps not as perfect as Interpol's debut album, but it's not far off. A cool band from Montreal, who coulda thunk?
