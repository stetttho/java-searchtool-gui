 Will Ackerman started the Windham Hill label in 1976, essentially to self-release some albums of "new age" guitar pieces he wrote (Ackerman detested any reference to "new age"). Much to his (and anyone else's) amazement, these early albums started selling beyond anyone's expectation. Soon Will signed other like-minded new age artists to his label, and before he knew what hit him, the Windham Hill label took off like a rocket. Being the label's CEO didn't stop Will from recording new music himself. And so on the 10th anniversary of the label, Will issued what would turn out to be his very best album ever.  "Conferring With the Moon" (1986, 11 tracks, 53 min.) continues the musical growth heard on the previous 2 albums, 1981's "Passage" and 1983's "Past Light". On "Conferring" it all come together just perfectly. On the title track, in which he is accompanied by piano, you can just "hear" Will talking to the moon. "Improv" is 'back-to-roots' Ackerman solo work. "Lago de Montanoas" finds Will accompanied by the pan-flute, you can just feel the "Inca-spirit" in your room! Other highlights include "Processional", "Shape of the Land" and the sweeping "Last Day on the Beach", with a great violin solo over Will's guitar work.  Will Ackerman has issued only 10 albums in his 28 year career to date (2001's "Hearing Voices" being the most recent). "Conferring With the Moon" stands the test of time, and is in my opinion his best work ever. Highly recommended! (Please note that the original vinyl album was replaced by CD in 1990, which in turn was reissued in a remastered version in 1998 that sounds miles better than the 1990 release.)
