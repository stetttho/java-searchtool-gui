 Music: 3.5 Stars; DVD: 3 Stars; Economic Value: 4 Stars  I've lost count but I guess DMB now has 'officially' released about 5 or 6 live albums (not counting those available through its website), and it's getting harder to come up with fresh ideas but, hey, here's a good one: instead of bringing a single show, let's take songs from the three night stand at the Gorge, and even better, let's put some on CD and others on a DVD.  "The Gorge" (2 CDs, 14 tracks, 112 min.) actually has a lot of great music on it. Highlights for me include the opener Rampunzel, The Song that Jane Likes (from "Remember Two Things"), the somber and touching Gravedigger, the pleasant Everyday (check out the crowd's singalong at the very beginning), and the hard charging "Kit Kat Jam". Not nearly as good are the 2 monster tracks Two Steps (19 min.) and Lie in Our Graves (17 min.).  The DVD (120 min.) contains 9 more songs, with 3 mini-documentaries and the video for Grace is Gone. As to the concert clips, this coulda, shoulda been wonderful. Alas, the editor truly made a mess of it by changing non-stop, literally EVERY SECOND, the camera angle. After a while it becomes so annoying, I could hardly stand it anymore. Among the songs, Halloween and Ants Marching are standouts. The most revealing moment actually comes after the credits when the band retreats backstage after one of the shows and comments on that evening's performance.  Because the songs are diced and sliced, this may not be the best DMB live album, but I will say that you get great value for your money. Two hours of music and another two hours of DVD, and all for about $20, that's hard to beat!
