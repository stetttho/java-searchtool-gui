 The Vines came out of nowhere with their debut album "Highly Evolved" which got a lot of buzz due to several high-energy tracks, and they followed that up with the "Winning Days" album, which "evolved" naturally from the debut album. But then Craig Nicholls, the Vines' singer-songwriter, couldn't handle the pressure of touring and without that, the album kinda fizzled. Two years later, the Vines are back.  "Vision Valley" (13 tracks, 31 min.) continues the proven formula of short, high-energy tracks, mixed up with more reflective tunes, only now to the extreme. Yes, 13 tracks, in just 31 minutes, with most clocking in under 2 minutes. There are several irresistable sing-along, head-bobbing tunes that grab your attention, including "Don't Listen to the Radio" (first single), the opener "Anysound", and "Gross Out". Then there are the more reflective tracks, such as the title track "Vision Valley", "Take Me Back", and the 6+ min. closer "Spaceship".  The album whizzes by in no time, and before you know it, you want to play it again. Musically, there is no radical departure from the previous albums, and that's a good thing in my book. The Vines have a "winning formula", and they do it well. What remains to be seen is whether the band (and Craig Nicholls in particular) finds the stamina to go on the road. Stay tuned....
