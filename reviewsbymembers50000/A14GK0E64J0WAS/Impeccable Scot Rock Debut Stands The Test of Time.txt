 Let's start with this note: for anyone considering buying Big Country's debut album, do not buy the "blue cover" original album, but go instead for the "red cover" updated version, remastered and with 4 bonus tracks, amounting to 69 min. of music. Scot-rock was never better. That said, it is really amazing how well this 1983 album has stood the test of time. The original track list of 10 songs does not contain a single weak track, making it Big Country's best album by far. It contains of course the now-classic "In A Big Country" as well as "Fields of Fire", but check out for example "Inwards" as well as "Harvest Home", which could have (and should have) been another radio hit, with irresitable "bag pipe guitar" hooks. The 4 bonus tracks are very intruiging. Recorded at the same sessions, they didn't make the original album set list (presumably due to vinyl time limitations that existed then still). It's great to have them now. Best of the four is the track that gave the album's name, "The Crossing", an epic 7 min. track that's as good as any of the original 10 tracks.  Finally, this note: I'm not sure why the listing here refers to a German import. I bought this from the Amazon.co.uk website and this is now the "regular" CD in the UK. BUY IT!
