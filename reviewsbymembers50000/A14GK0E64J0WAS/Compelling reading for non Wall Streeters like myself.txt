 Dan Reingold was a telecom industry analyst from 1989 to 2003 for some of the top Wall Street investment banks (in turn, Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, and Credit Suisse First Bank) and thus had a first hand (if not insider) look at the amazing run of the bull-market in the 90s, only to see it come crashing down.  In "Confessions of a Wall Street Analyst: A True Story of Inside Information and Corruption in the Stock Market" (348 pages), the author gives a fascinating first-person account of the workings of Wall Street investment banks analysts. The best part of the book for me is the first half, in which Reingold describes his humble beginnings at MCI, only to be recruited to Morgan Stanley to give his analysis and recommendations to investors at what turns out to be the best possible time (some years before the bull-market started its seemingly never-ending run). Major issues that come up time and again are the inherent conflicts between the investment bankers and the analysts working for the same firm, and the incomprehensible lack of SEC action to do anything about it, in fact aggrevating at times the situation (when the SEC went to the "No-Action" letter practice). I don't understand Reingold's seeming never-ending rivalry and fascination with his No.1 analyst competitor Jack Grubman (who eventually gets nailed for using insider information). The other thing that stuck me is that these guys don't have a life. I mean, I work hard (or so I think), but guys like Reingold and others in Wall Street work 24/7 it seems.  Being a lawyer, but in no way connected to Wall Street, I really enjoyed Reingold's book, for many reasons. It's now going on 6 years since the bubble burst, and it's still hard to phantom all that went on in the crazy days of the late 90s, and how WorldCom and others were able to completely fool and defraud everyone around them. Highly recommended!
