 Over The Rhine (these days the husband-wife team of Karin Bergquist and Linford Detweiler, with assorted studio guests) has been around since 1992, but "Films for Radio", their first album of new material since the 1996 (independent) release of "Good Dog Bad Dog" (re-released in 2000 with extra tracks) is an attempt to re-connect with the mainstream folk/rock, and almost accomplishes that. This album thankfully abandons the "I can hear a pin drop on the floor" intimate sound of recent albums.  There are 4 key tracks of "Films for Radio": the opening track "The World Can Wait", which features a heavy drum beat and some of the band's best lyrics ever ("So fade to black and white now/Roll the movie of my life inside my head"). Then there is "Give Me Strength", the Dido-penned remake that is the most radio-friendly track on the album, with Karin's vocals soaring; it reminds me of recent Tori Amos. Then there is the fabulous "The Body Is a Stairway of Skin", a jazzy, sensual, if not erotic track based on loops and scratches, just beautiful! The album's closer is "When I Go", with Karen on an intimate accoustic guitar, eventually soaring with a wicked electric guitar solo, very very nice! This is clearly OTR's best album since "Eve". The question remains whether it will find a mainstream audience. I have my doubts, quite frankly. But it is a refreshing album for all the OTR fans out there (and you know who you are!). Finally, if you can catch them on their current tour (the opening of which I saw last night), go! Run! It is a fabulous evening! They play most of the "Films for Radio" tracks, and dig up some great nuggets from the past.
