 The last Whiskeytown album was released in May, 2001, more than two years after the album was actually completed (and just months before Ryan Adams was to release his SECOND solo album, "Gold"). It sat on the shelf for that long after Whiskeytown's label Outpost imploded and before it found a new home at Lost Highway. "Pneumonia" (14 tracks, plus "hidden" track, 57 min.), really sounds quite different from Whiskeytown's previous releases, and in spirit is closer to Ryan's first solo album "Heartbreaker" than, say, Whiskeytown's previous album "Stranger's Almanac". Excellent producer Ethan Johns (who also produced "Hearthbreaker" and "Gold") likely is one of the main reasons for that. Ryan has a hand in all tracks, writing 6 tracks by himself, and co-writing the rest with either Caitlin Cary and/or Mike Daly. Standout tracks include "The Ballad of Carol Lyn", "Jacksonville Skyline", the almost Beatles-esque "Mirror Mirror", the eerie "What The Devil Wanted", and "Easy Hearts", the very best on this album, with Caitlin's violins (for once) prominent and Ryan lamenting "I've Had a Pretty Hard Life/But Such an Easy Heart". Whiskeytown split in 1999. The following year Ryan issued "Heartbreaker", and the rest, as they say, is history. Caitlin has come on strong as well, with decent solo albums in 2002 and 2003. "Pneumonia" is a very nice album to finish that chapter, but I so wonder if we'll ever see a live album released from Whiskeytown's illustrous live sets...
