 Some months ago I fell upon a book called "What I Wish My Christian Friends Knew About Judaism" by Robert Schoen, an excellent book. Just recently I fell upon this book, and again I was attracted to read it.  "Jewish Ritual: A Brief Introduction for Christians" is a more focused, less general book that "What I Wish", and in that sense a great complimentary read. "Jewish Ritual" gives a great overview of various Jewish rituals such as the observing the Sabbath, those complicated (to us Christians anyway) dietary laws (what is kosher, and why does it matter?), the practice of covering the head (when and how), etc. The authors do an excellent job at the conclusion of each chapter to discuss to what extent, if any, there is a similar practice in the Christian faith.  The book is brought with obvious care, and respect for us Christians. Mutual respect and understanding is sadly lacking too often in our society. For that reason alone, this book is highly recommended. But if you have acquaintances in the Jewish community, or are simply curious to understand certain Jewish rituals better, this book is indispensable.
