 Black Rebel Motorcycle Club returns 2 years after their dark debut album that made them indie-superstars in the UK (but not the US). "Take Them On, On Your Own" is better than the debut album, by far. The tone is set with opener (and first single) "Stop", which reminds me of the brash early-Oasis sound, just great. The first 6 songs of the album are sequenced just perfectly. "We're All In Love" has a great wall-of-sound, as does "In Like the Rose". "Ha Ha High Babe", with its threathening bass and intricate drums, is another highlight. The second half of the album is not as strong, altough "Shade of Blue" (one of the few slower songs on the album) and "Rise and Fall" are other standouts. It will be interesting to see whether this album will get BRMC the recognition in the US that it deserves but has eluded so far. Altough a bit overlong (55 min.), this is a great album, and one of the nicer surprises of 2003.
