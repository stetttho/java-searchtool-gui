 First things first, this album easily claims the title for having the worst cover in a long, long time... What is up with that? But what about the music on Leyy Kravtiz's 7th studio album?  "Baptized" (13 tracks, 54 min.) cover familiar territory for Lenny Kravitz, and while some of it works, a lot of it doesn't. The best tracks are the 1-2-3 punch (midway through the album) of "California", "Sistamamalover" and "Where Are we Runnin", a total of 9 min. of pure musical guilty pleasure, just great. But the rest is a very mixed bag. Worst are "I Don't Wanna Be a Star", as disengenuous as you will ever find (hey Lenny, quit the music business then!), and "What Did I Do With My Life", as if we should feel sorry or sympathy.... Not! There are too many lazy songs, with wafer-thin musical ideas (example: "Flash", with its Rolling Stones-like intro, falls flat after about a minute or so).  At 54 min. the album is just WAY too long. Chop off some 3-4 songs, and we may have something to work with here. But alas, as it stands, "Baptized" is a very mixed bag at best, with a couple of highlights.
