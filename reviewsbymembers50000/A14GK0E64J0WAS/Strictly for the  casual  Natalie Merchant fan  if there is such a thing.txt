 Since Natalie Merchant went solo 10 years ago, she has released only 5 albums, and that includes the "Live in Concert" album, so really only 4 studio albums.   "Retrospective 1995-2005" (13 tracks, 60 min.) brings a nice chronological overview of Natalie's greatest hits, and the use of that term is loose at best, as there really have been only a few mainstream hits on the first 2 albums. It makes sense then that the bulk of his collection centers around those songs: 8 of the 13 tracks are from the "Tigerlily" and "Ophelia" albums, including the true hits "Wonder", "Carnival" and "Kind and Generous". The last third of the album gives us the best tracks from "Motherland" and the independently released "The House Carpenter's Daughter". While these songs are not hits, they are mesmerizing nevertheless. Check out "Motherland" and "Sally Ann". At 60 min., they could easily have added a couple more songs, such as "Just Can't Last" (from "Motherland") and "Space Oddity" (from "Live in Concert")  If you are a casual Natalie Merchant fan (if there is such a thing), this collection will do the trick. Or you may want to stick with just "Tigerlily" if you are looking for the 10,000 Maniacs sound. But for the fanatical Natalie Merchant fans, who have all the albums already, it makes no sense to buy this collection. Instead, head on over to the "Limited Edition" of this set, which includes a second CD with covers, duets, rarities, and unreleased tracks. I rate that collection close to 5 stars.
