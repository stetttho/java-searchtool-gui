 This is the greatest hits compilation that Axl and Slash (unsuccesfully) sued Geffen Records over, in an effort to prevent its release. Among the reasons Axl stated: (1) Geffen had not consulted them in the track-listing (note to Axl and Co.: Geffen OWNS the rights to these tracks!); and (2) releasing this album would "endanger" the release of the long-awaited new album "Chinese Democracy" (I haven't laughed that hard in a long time!). In any event, "Greatest Hits" (14 tracks, 79 min.) is indeed a flawed compilation that nevertheless contains some great music. Not enough emphasis is given to "Appetite for Destruction", with only 3 tracks (no "Mr. Brownstone"?), and too much emphasis is given to "The Spagetti Incident" (2 tracks, including the out-of-context "Since I Don't Have You") and to cover songs (5 of the 14 tracks on here are covers). "Use Your Illusion I and II" rightfully provide half of the album's songs, even if "November Rain" is as self-absorbant and bombastic as ever. This compilation is noteworthy for the inclusion of the (so-so) cover of "Sympathy for the Devil" which appeared on the "Interview with the Vampire" soundtrack, and now appears for the first time on a GnR release. Liner notes are skimpy, and this does smell of a quick money job, but frankly, can you blame Geffen? The label has been waiting TWELVE YEARS on the new studio album, and at this point do you really believe that "Chinese Democracy" will ever see the light of day? I'm not holding my breath... Meanwhile, this will satisfy the many out there that simply want GnR's best known songs (which are not necessarily their best songs) on a single CD.
