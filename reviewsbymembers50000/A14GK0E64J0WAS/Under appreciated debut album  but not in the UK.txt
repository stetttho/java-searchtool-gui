 SF-based trio Black Rebel Motorcycle Club became an indie sensation in the UK with their debut album (issued in 2001). So far, the US has barely noticed, but that may change with their just-released follow-up album "Take Them On, On Your Own". This is a dark, brooding album (11 tracks, 57 min). The tone is set on the opener "Love Turns". The best track immediately follows: "Red Eyes and Tears" has a searing and distorted but irresistable guitar hook. "Whatever Happened To My Rock and Roll (Punk Song) is not punk, but an all-and-out rock assault, another highlight. "Awake" is an accoustic strum-along crashing into a wall-of-sound (oft-mentioned comparisons to the Stone Roses are understandable). Other highlights include the slow-burner "As Sure As The Sun" and the heavily distorted "Spread Your Love". It is easy to see why the BRMC's debut album made such a big splash in the UK. Although a bit overlong ("Head Up High" feels out of place), this is a great collection of songs. Here's hoping that BRMC finally finds the recognition it deserves in the US with their even better follow-up CD, just released.
