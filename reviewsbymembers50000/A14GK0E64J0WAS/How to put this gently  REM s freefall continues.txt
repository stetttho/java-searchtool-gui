 It's been another three years, and like clock-work, R.E.M. delivers another studio album.  "Around the Sun" (13 tracks, 55 min.) starts off promisingly with "Leaving New York", a gentle, mid-tempo ballad. "Nice Straw" is also good, another gentle song, here with great accoustic guitars from Peter Buck. Those are the few highlights on this album. The album lacks life, and fun. It all feels so anemic and oh so serious. In case you were wondering, there isn't one single song that could be considered anywhere close to an up-tempo, rocking song. All songs are pretty much in the same (take you pick: lazy/gentle) mid-tempo.   You play this album a few times, and then you realize that, when all is said and done, there isn't as  much as one memorable song on here. Even the below-par "Reveal" had a few memorable tunes ("Imitation of Life", "All the Way to Reno (You're Gonna be a Star)"), but no such luck here. As a long-time fan of R.E.M. it pains me to say it, but "Around the Sun" is the band's worst album ever (yes, even worse than "Up"). Simply put, R.E.M.'s freefall into irrelevance continues and is now at 9 years and counting.
