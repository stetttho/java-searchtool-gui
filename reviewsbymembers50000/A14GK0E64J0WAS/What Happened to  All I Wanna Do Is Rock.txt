 It was about 4 years ago when Travis ruled the music world with the stunning "The Man Who". In June 2001 "The Invisible Band" followed, not as good as "The Man Who" but with enough great songs to satisfy the fan basis. Since June 2001, a lot has happened for Travis: 9/11, a nearly fatal pool diving accident last year for the band's drummer, and a little band called Coldplay. Almost without any pre-release hype we now receive "12 Memories". As a Travis fan going back to the early days, this album is shockingly mediocre. Gone apparently are the days when Travis would take chances, musically. The album's mediocirty is best illustrated by its first single "Re-Offender" (a song about domestic abuse). Compare that to "Flashing Blue Lights" of 1999, a song on the same theme, but with much more urgency and musical "meat and bones". Fran Healy, the band singer-songwriter, also feels compelled to address the war in Iraq in 2 (of the first 4) songs, but without any compelling lyrics or music. The best tracks are towards the end: "Love Will Come Through", and even better, "Happy to Hang Around". I only wish there were more tracks like that! I am very disappointed with this album. What happened to the band that proclaimed "All I Wanna Do Is Rock"? Instead we are treated to a middle-of-the-road set of songs that does not have any sense of urgency to it. Newcomers to Travis should check out either of "Good Feeling" or "The Man Who" instead of this album.
