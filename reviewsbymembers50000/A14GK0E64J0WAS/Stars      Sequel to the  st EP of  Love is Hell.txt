 By now we all know the story: Ryan records the "Love is Hell" album, record label refuses to release it because it's deemed too "dark", and "suggests" to Ryan that he make another album, which Ryan (the prolific songwriter he is) does in no time. Record label releases "Rock N Roll", to less than great acclaim.  To throw a bone to the fans (and maybe part of a deal with Ryan?), the label releases the "Love is Hell" album as two EPs. The first one was released a few weeks ago. "Love is Hell Pt. 2" (7 tracks; 27 min.) starts off with a very subdued "My Blue Manhattan", and stays in the same vain with subsequent tracks "Please Do Not Let me Go" and "City Rain City Streets". Then follows the standout track "I See Monsters", one of Ryan's best songs, ever. That song alone is worth buying this. Almost as good is the final track "Hotel Chelsea Nights", with distorted guitars all over. In all, "Love is Hell" EP2 is not as strong as EP1, but still lightyears ahead of the dreadful "Rock N Roll" album. It's still a mystery to me why the suits at the Lost Highway label rejected "Love is Hell" as the proper follow-up to the "Gold" album. Recommeded to any Ryan Adams fan of "Heartbreaker" and "Gold".
