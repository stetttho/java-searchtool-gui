 For all you Human League fans (and you know who you are!... guilty pleasure)... the wait is over. Phil, Joanne and Susan Anne are finally back in fine form, 6 years after the underrated "Octopus" album. "Secrets" covers 16 tracks in 51+ min, 9 "real" tracks with 7 short instrumentals interwoven. The leadoff track, also the 1st single, is "All I Ever Wanted", with an instantly likeable hook reminiscent of old times. In contrast to the more introspect "Octopus" album, "Secrets" has primarily upbeat tracks, with more "techno beats" than we have heard before. There is only one ballad of sorts, "Never Give Your Heart", giving Joanne and Susan Anne the lead vocals. The instrumental interludes are quite fun, most of them in the 1 to 2 min. range. They do not interrupt the flow of the album, on the contrary. The best track of the album is "Reflections", a 6+ min. blow-out of funk techno pure danceable music, check out in particular the last 2 min. outro, just great! (At times the album reminds me of Depeche Mode moods.)  In all, a very welcome back for Human League. Now the question is... when will they tour the US again?
