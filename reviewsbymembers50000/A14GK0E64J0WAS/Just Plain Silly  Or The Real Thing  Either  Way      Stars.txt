 The Darkness have come out of nowhere and have taken the UK music scene by storm in a matter of 6 months. "Permission to Land" (10 tracks, 38 min.) is now also released in the US (it has held the top spot in the UK charts for weeks), and I just had to buy it, sound unheard. Do I have buyer's remorse? If you're unfamiliar with The Darkness, imagine 80's Big Hair rock meets AC/DC meets David Lee Roth meets Freddie Mercury. That about sums it up. All the songs stand or fall with the guitar hooks. If they work, like on the opener "Black Shuck" or on "Growing on You" (one of the UK hits), it's pretty cool. But when it's bad, it's bad. On "I Believe In a Thing Called Love" (another UK hit), lead singer Justin Hawkins shrieks so bad in the chorus, it makes me wince, frankly. The second hald of the album really flounders compared to the first half. On most of the songs, The Darkness goes so over the top that it's hard to tell whether the band is just having a laugh or whether they take this serious. In the end, I find other recent "party albums" like The Donnas' "Spend the Night" just better. Not that "Permission to Land" is a bad album. I hear that as a live act The Darkness is absolutely thrilling, probably a major reason for its success in the UK.
