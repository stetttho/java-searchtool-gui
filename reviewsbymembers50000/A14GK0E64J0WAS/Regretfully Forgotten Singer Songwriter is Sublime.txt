 Judie Tzuke made a huge splash in Europe with her first 2 albums ("Welcome to the Cruise" in 1979 and "Sportscar" in 1980) and then slowly but surely drifted into obscurity, regretfully. Tzuke was on a par with, say, Joni Mitchell at that time. Fiona Apple may have sounded like this if she started her career 15 years earlier. This compilation captures the best of the initial 2 albums, with some additional later tracks. Tzuke's "claim to fame" is of course her song "Stay With Me Till Dawn", as beautiful a ballad as you will ever hear. But Tzuke can also rock, as tracks like "Sportscar" and "The Choices You've Made" show. If you are not familiar with Judy Tzuke, please check her out. You will not be disappointed! BUY IT!
