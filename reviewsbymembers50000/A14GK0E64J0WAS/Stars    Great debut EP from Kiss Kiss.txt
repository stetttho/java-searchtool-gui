 I'm not sure where my 16 yr. old daughter heard about this band, but she put this on her Christmas wish list. She has played this quite a bit since then, so I can't help but listen to it as well, and I actually like this quite a bit.  "Kiss Kiss" (5 tracks, 21 min.) brings high energy songs that stop-and-go, with a very ecclectic feel to it. The electric violin is featured prominently and officially has made a come-back due to bands like Yellowcard and Kiss Kiss. None of the 5 songs on here is weak as such. That said, my personale favorites are the rocking "College Film" and the 'ballad' "Drifts and Pulls".   Singer-lyricist Joshua Benach and voilinist Bob Pyciar, who write all of the band's music, are definitely on to something good, and I can't wait for the proper debut album sometime later this year. Meanwhile, buy the EP, you won't regret it!
