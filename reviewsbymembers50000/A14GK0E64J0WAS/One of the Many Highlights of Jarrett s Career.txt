 Keith Jarret made his first mark with "Koln Concert", the 1975 double vinyl solo piano concert CD that actually made some dents in the charts. Imagine that! (It was the same era when Tangerine Dream made the charts with "Ricochet", can you imagine it today?) This CD gives one 70 min. set of Jarrett's 3 night stand at the Blue Note (the complete recordings are also available as a box  set), and what a marvel it is. The best is the lead-off track, the standard "Autumn Leaves", a 26+ min. blow-out of the trio (joining Jarrett are Gary Peacock on bass and Jack DeJohnette on drums), with bass and drums getting their due in solos, but Jarrett's piano playing is what drives this track, as elsewhere. If you are not a a die-hard jazz fanatic (as am I), don't worry. This is music (in its most general sense) at its best. Buy it.
