 The Libertines are another one of the "new" fast-rising bands out of England. "Up the Bracket" is their debut album (13 songs in 43 min.), and quite good. Many make the comparison to The Strokes, which puzzles me a bit. The sound of the Libertines is rougher, for one. It rather brings The Jam to mind. Mick Jones (The Clash) is at the helm as producer, and it shows. Best tracks include the opener "Vertigo", "Time for Heroes" (which is the current UK single), "Radio America" (which reminds me in spirit of "Radio Clash"), and the title track. What is really great about this US version of the album is that it includes the Libertines' first 2 singles (not on the UK version of the album): "What a Waster", independantly released and what got the band a major label deal, really a terrific song, as well as "I Get Along", their second single. It will be interesting to see if the Libertines can break out of obscurity in the US...
