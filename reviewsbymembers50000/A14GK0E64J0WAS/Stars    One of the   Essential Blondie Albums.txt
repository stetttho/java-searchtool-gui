 Original released in Fall of 1979, "Eat to the Beat" is one of the 2 truly essential Blondie albums (the other one being 1978's "Parallel Lines"), and the last good Blondie album, period, with hardly a bad track on it. "Eat tot the Beat" (16 tracks, 59 min.) starts off with its best song, the blockbuster hit "Dreaming". The musical direction on the album is all over the place, from punk-ish to new wave to reggae (on the great "Die Young Stay Pretty"), but ultimately the band at this point is a great pop band. Other outstanding tracks include "The Hardest Part", "Atomic" (great fusion of rock and disco), and "Accidents Never Happen". The album lags towards the end (the last 3 tracks are mediocre).  The bonus tracks on this reissue (with nice remastered sound) are a very nice addition: a smoking live version of "Die Young Stay Pretty" (recorded on 12-31-79, with Debbie announcing toungue-in-cheeck "Good evening from Radio Blondie, congratulations, you've made it through the 1970s", haha!), the Holland-Dozier-Holland cover "Seven Rooms of Gloom" (from that same show), the Bowie cover "Heroes" (done surprisingly effective), and the Cash cover "Ring of Fire" but with a decidedly Blondie-country twang, truly outstanding! I saw Blondie in concert last month for the first time in 25 years, and was really surprised how good they sounded still, and by golly, Debbie sure does not show her age. "Stay Pretty" indeed!
