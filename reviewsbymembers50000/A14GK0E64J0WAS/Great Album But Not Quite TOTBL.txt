 Let's face is, Interpol's 2002 "Turn On the Bright Lights" was one of the most accomplished debut albums in a long LONG time. I mean, there was not a bad song on it, and that's an understatement. So how to follow up that?  "Antics" (10 tracks, 41 min.) starts of curiously with the very subdued "Next Exit" (which the band is starting off with on their current tour), but which pales to "Untitled", which starts off TOTBL. But then follows "Evil", an all-out blast and one of their best tracks ever. "Slow Hands" (the current single) is another up-beat song that works well, and ends the first cycle of 5 songs. What follows is the best yet, "Not Even Jail" is the jewel on "Antics", just tremendous. After that, things level off, although the long concert staple "Lenghts of Love" is great too.  This is a great album. What worries me is that half of the tracks are old concert staples of the last few years, meaning these guys have been playing the same songs over and over and over again, with few new songs. What comes after this? That's a question to be answered by the next album. Meanwhile, "Antics" is a fine album, but not as great as "Turn on the Bright Lights".
