 The Donnas self-released their debut album in 1997 (it was re-released a year later by Lookout! Records). It's amazing to see how in a matter of 5 years the Donnas have musically matured from this to the 2002 album "Spend the Night". "The Donnas" (23 tracks, 41 min.--and that's not a typo!) is in essence one long track, as all the songs pretty much feature the same three chord riff. For that reason it's difficult to point out highlights, although the 2 covers (the Beach Boys' "Drive-In" and Phil Spector's "Da Doo Run Run") are hilarious. The sound is definitely low-fi, and in a strange way it's quite fitting with the overall feel of the album. In all, this is a fun, but certainly not an essential album for anyone who, like me, thought that "Spend the Night" was a great album. The Donnas show us how the Ramones live on!
