 5 years after its release, "Paradise in Me" remains a thoroughly enjoyable record. K's Choice stormed onto the US music scene with its breakthrough hit "Not An Addict" (which has been misunderstood  and in actuality is an anti-drug song). The album is a top-notch  "alternative rock" CD, starting with "Not An Addict",  but containing many more instant recognizable hooks like "A Sound Only  You Can Hear", "Mr. Freeze", "Paradise in Me" and  the show-stopper at all of K's Choice's concerts, the sing-along  "Something's Wrong". While K's Choice worked the US tour circuit  hard, they never could really quite make it "big" in the US.  Nevermind, this album marked the band at its top, and remains the Belgian  band's pride and joy. Give it a listen, and you won't be disappointed.
