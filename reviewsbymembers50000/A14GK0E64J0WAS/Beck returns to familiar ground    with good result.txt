 After the ambitious (and, let's face it, pretty boring) 2002 album "Sea Change" that did very little at the box office, Beck figured it was time to retreat to the more familiar ground of the "Odelay" album, and with generally great result.  "Guero" (13 tracks, 50 min.) mostly goes down real easy, like a smoothie in summer time. From the opener "E-Pro", many of the tracks make you feel like singing and/or dancing along. There's plenty of scratching, semi-Spanish shout-outs, and plenty of other irreverence. Highlights for me include "Que Onda Guro", the lazy mover "Earthquake Weather", the funny "Hell Yes", the clap-along "Black Tambourine", and "Go It Alone". The album is overlong, and starts to drag a bit toward the end (chop off the last 3 songs, and we're talking a 4.5 star album). But in the end, "Guero" is miles better than "Sea Changes", no question, and restores Beck's (commercial) confidence.  I happen to catch Beck open for the Rolling Stones not long ago. He and his 5 piece band put on a blistering 40 min. set that just oozed with energy and was great from beginning to end, playing all the classics, including "Loser", "Where It's At", etc. alongside "E-Pro" and "Girl" from "Guero". The people behind us asked us to sit down (we were dancing all the way through). As if!
