 2 person rock band, guy and girl, delivering high energy rock. Sounds familiar? I know that I am probably in the minority, but I just don't "get it" as far as the White Stripes is concerned. I thought "White Blood Cells" was a disaster. Here, though, is the real thing. Falling somewhere between an EP and an album, the Raveonettes (Sune Rose Wagner and Sharin Foo) rock out in short 8 songs, totalling 21 min.  The opening chords of the lead-off track "Attack of the Ghost Riders" at first had me thinking B-52s era-Wild Planet, but they go way beyond that. Other outstanding tracks include "Do You Believe Her", "My Tornado" and the closer "Beat City", recalling a surfer beat that's irresitable. The Raveonettes may not have the fame yet of the White Stripes, but my guess is that they'll give'em a good run for their money. This first recording is very promising, and I'm already looking forward to the "Forthcoming Sequel to Whip It Up" (as announced on the CD cover).
