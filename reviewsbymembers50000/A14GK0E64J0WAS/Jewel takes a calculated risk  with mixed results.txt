 So I approached Jewel's "0304" album with an open mind, knowing full well that the days of "Who Will Save Your Soul" are long behind us. It's not the out-right "bad" album that I had feared, but it's also not a "classic" by any stretch of the imagination. "0304" (14 tracks, 53 min.) starts of nicely with "Stand", with its light-beat dance rhythms. "Run 2 U" and "Intuition" follow along the same vein, and then it starts to set it: the songs all sound pretty much the same! Oh no! That's the trouble with an album that goes on WAY too long, it all starts sounding the same. Admittedly, there are a couple of outstanding tracks: the dramatic (and non-dance) "Haunted", and the name-dropping and culture-referencing "America". Overall, this is an average, somewhat bland album. What surprises me is that in the liner notes, Jewel writes that this album is "the first record I enjoy listening to", which in a way is a put-down to all the fans that have loved her earlier albums. It makes me ache for the knock-out punch of "Deep Water/What's Simple is True/Hands", from the Spirit album: Jewel was never better.
