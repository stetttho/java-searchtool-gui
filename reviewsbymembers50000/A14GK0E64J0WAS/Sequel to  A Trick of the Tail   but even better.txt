 1976 was quite a year for Genesis. In February the band released "A Trick of the Tail", affirming that there was life after Peter Gabriel. Less than 10 months later, Genesis came back with another full-length album, "Wind & Wuthering". (Can you imagine it today?) "Wind & Wuthering" (9 tracks, 50 min.) is musically more developed and fleshed out than was "A Trick of The Tail", you can just sense the band (and Phil Collins in particular) becoming more confident. "Eleventh Earl of Mar" starts the album off with a blaze. The standout track is the majestic and epic "One for the Vine", has Tony Banks written a better song before or since? A radio-shortened version of Mike Rutherford's "Your Own Special Way" became an unexpected modest hit (paving the way for the more commercial Genesis years starting with "And Then There Were Three"). Steve Hackett's fingers are all over "Blood On the Rooftop", with beautiful Spanish guitar solos. The instrumental "Unquiet Slumbers"/"Quiet Earth" medley remains a fave of mine. As any long time fan of Genesis knows, this album really is the end of prog-rock Genesis. Although the band would certainly continue to record prog-rock songs here and there, no album would ever be able to recall the heights of "Wind & Wuthering". My very first "real" rock concert ever was when I saw Genesis on the Wind & Wuthering" tour in Brussels in June, 1977 (that tour was memorialized with the live album "Seconds Out"). I remember it as if it was yesterday. It has fueled  my love for live concerts ever since.
