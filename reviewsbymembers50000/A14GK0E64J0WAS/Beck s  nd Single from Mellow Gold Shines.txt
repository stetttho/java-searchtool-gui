 "Beercan" is the 2nd single off of Beck's breakthrough album "Mellow Gold", 5 tracks (24 min.) of which 4 are not on the album. "Beercan" is a great song, not as "essential" as "Loser" obviously, but a great dance tune. The 4 extra tracks are what make this a necessary addition to any Beck fan's collection. "Got No Mind" is a lazy accoustic song, just great. "Asskizz Powergrudge" is Beck at his experimental best. "Totally Konfused" is another accoustic song, just great. "Spanking Room" is a 9 min. blowout of alterna rock, totally in line with 1994 (when this EP was issued). Beck has done many different things, but he was never better than in the "Mellow Gold" era. By all means, buy this!
