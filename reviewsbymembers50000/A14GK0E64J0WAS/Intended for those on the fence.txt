 One year after the Killers' debut album "Hot Fuss" was released, it is now re-released as a "limited edition", with 3 additional tracks that have been available on various singles.  "Hot Fuss Limited Edition" (14 tracks, 56 min.) brings the original 11 tracks first. By now, the first half of the album sounds like a "greatest hits" album, that's how familiar tunes like "Jenny Was a Friend of Mine", "Mr. Brightside", "Smile Like You Mean It" and "Somebody Told Me" now are. But the rest of the album is quite good as well, with tracks like "Andy You're a Star", "Change Your Mind" and "Everything Will Be Alright". The bonus tracks are quite good as well, in particular "Glamorous Indie Rock & Roll" (although the Killers by now are hardly indie). "The Ballad of Michael Valentine" is so-so, but "Under the Gun" is grade A quality and would have fitted nicely onto the album proper.  This re-release is intended to tempt those on the fence that for whatever reason hadn't bought the album yet. Like me. (My 15 yr. daughter had bought it, so I was familiar with the album.) I'm glad that I bought this. If on the other hand you're REALLY into the Killers, your probably have those additional tracks already.
