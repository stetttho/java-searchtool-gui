 These are facts: in the 5 years since 2000, Oasis has released 2 albums, on which Noel Gallagher, the band's main creative force, wrote exactly 11 songs in total, half of the songs on those 2 albums. In contrast, in the 3 year span 1994-1997, Oasis released 3 albums and multiple B-sides, and ALL of them (about 50 songs or so) were written by Noel.   "Don't Believe the Truth" (11 songs, 43 min.) has been hyped by the Gallagher Brothers as "the best album since Definitely Maybe" (just as was Heathen Chemistry supposedly was). Is ANYONE really buying that? They really are urging us to "[Not] Believe the Truth"... All that said, there are some pleasant moments on the album, this is Oasis after all. If you can get over the blatant rip-off from the Stones' "Street Fighting Man", then "Lyla" (first UK single) is a pretty good stomper. "The Importance of Being Idle" (second UK single) is a bit quirky but pleasant enough. "Keep the Dream Alive" is a surprisingly strong contribution from Andy Bell. The closer "Let There Be Love" sounds out of place (and it is--it's a song rescued from the "Standing on the Shoulder of Giants" sessions).  Look, the problem with Oasis today is that the muse has left Noel, it's that obvious. And until that changes, nothing is going to bring Oasis back to their former heydays. Compared to the majority of music out there, "Don't Believe the Truth" is not a bad album. But the truth is also that, in comparison to the rest of the Oasis catalogue, this is unfortunately the weakest album yet.  I have read that the songs from "Don't Believe the Truth" translate surprisingly well in a live setting. I have not had a chance to catch Oasis in concert this year, but would love the opportunity to find out for myself...
