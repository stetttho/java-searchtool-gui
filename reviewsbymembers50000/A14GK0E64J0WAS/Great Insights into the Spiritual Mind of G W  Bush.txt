 If you know that Paul Kengor, the author of this book, also wrote "God and Ronald Reagan", you know, even before you have read a single page, that more likely than not, you will be reading a worthwhile book. I was not disappointed.  "God and George W. Bush" continues along the path of the earlier "The Faith of George W. Bush", which was an excellent book. The main difference between the two is that Paul Kengor is focused more on how Bush transplants his religion into nut just his every day life, but even more so in political action. One of the more noteworthy things I came away with from this book, is how Kengor shows (and backs it up with plenty of research and footnotes--about 60 pages worth of them!) how the 'separation of church and state' issue is misunderstood and even misconstrued. Did you know that the expression 'separation of state and church' is not in the Constitution? The author then goes on to demonstrate how the founding fathers commonly and openly had a place for their faith in God in their public lives.  "God and George W. Bush" is a winner because of the care the author took in setting forth positions. The positions are based on facts and research, not on some 'gut feeling' or instinct. Over the years, as people in the US have come to known the President better, it is clear that a majority is comfortable with the way the President lives by his faith and 'walks the walk". This book elegantly shows how.
