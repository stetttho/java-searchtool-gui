 "Flowers in the Window" is the third single from Travis' "The Invisible Band" album, and somewhat of a letdown. After the first 2 singles ("Sing", "Side") were obvious choices, there are a lot of good, but-not-quite-outstanding songs on "The Invisible Band".  "Flowers in the Window" is a mid-tempo gentle sove song, with the banjo again feateured prominently (as in "Sing"). There are 2 additional tracks on this single: "Central Station" is a great rock song, penned by Andy. "No Cigar" is somewhat of an oddity, with the refrain going like "We were close... but (--then thundering voice out of nowhere--) NO CIGAR!" Strange. This is CD2 of "Flowers in the Window", and the additional tracks on CD1 include a cover version of George Harrison's "Here Comes the Son", as well as Dougie's "A Little Bit of Soul". Travis is to be commended for trying to put our meaningful B-sides. However, in comparison to some earlier singles, such as "Side", "Writing to Reach You" and "Turn", "Flowers in the Window" does not reach the same heights.
