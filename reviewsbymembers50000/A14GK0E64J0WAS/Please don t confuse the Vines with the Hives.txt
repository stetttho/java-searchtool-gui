 Due to the airplay of two songs, "Highly Evolved" and "Get Free" (both very short, high-energy tracks) the Vines are thrown in the same bag as the Hives (and the Strokes, for that matter). Please don't make that mistake. The Vines are their own, and this album shows it. If you go behind those 2 well-known tracks, you will find that the Vines' music is much more than that. There are many slower-paced tracks (such as "Autumn Shade", "Country Yard", "Mary Jane", and the beautifully aching "Homesick"), even a reggae-flavored tune ("Factory") for that matter. "In The Jungle" reminded me of 60's brit-rock, and pretty good at that! The album wanders a bit at times, but it in the end, it really rewards. The last track, the 6+ min. epic "1969" ("It's 1969 in my head") sums up the album nicely, a melody and guitar driven song that shows us where the Vines are at. Nice!
