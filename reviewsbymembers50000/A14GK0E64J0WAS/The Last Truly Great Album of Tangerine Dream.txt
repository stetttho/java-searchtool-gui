 Poland, originally issued in 1984 and as a double album, is the last truly great "must have" album of Tangerine Dream. This album is the first post-Virgin Records (74-83) era album, but in spirit it belongs with  the Virgin releases. This CD contains all 4 (side-long) songs of the  original double album (great value too: about 75 minutes on a single CD).  Best songs are the title track (which opens with an incessant beat and  builds from there), and Barbakane, which features an amazing guitar solo of  Edgar Froese ("his longest ever" according to the liner notes) in  the midst of the usual moogs and synhesizer sounds we have come to  appreciate and love from Tangerine Dream. Unfortunately, shortly after this  album, TD decided to become more "accessible" and make shorter,  more dance-oriented songs. What a shame. Enjoy this gem, though!
