 In 1999, while still in between labels, Over The Rhine issued this sequel of sorts to "Besides", their 1997 collection of odds and sodds. "Amateur Shortwave Radio" is a collection of live tracks of the band's first ten years. It is a superb collection. "Like A Radio" starts things of beautifully, with a haunting solo from Ric and crystal clear vocals from Karen. There are 2 covers, both from 1990: a faithful take on the Stones' "Ruby Tuesday", and more interestingly the Beatles' "Blackbird", which OTR makes totally its own.  The album includes the long-time concert staple "Jack's Valentine", here in a 1999 recording. Linford brings it with just the right amount of wit and sarcasm. There are also 3 new songs on here: "Moth", a truly soaring "Anyway", and "I Will Remember", with newest OTR member Jack Henderson's ripping guitar solo. It is an appropriate ending for this exquisite collection of songs. In many ways, this album is better than many of the band's "regular" albums.
