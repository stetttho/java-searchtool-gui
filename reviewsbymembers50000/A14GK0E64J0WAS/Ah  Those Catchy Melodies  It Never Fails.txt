 On vacation this past July in Europe, I noticed that Roxette had come out again with a new album. Not that anyone in the US would seem to care. No airplay anymore for this former chart-topping band of catchy melodies ("Joyride", "The Look") and sweeping ballads ("Crash Boom Bang").  Well, US audiences don't know what they're missing! The Swedish duo is back with a thoroughly enjoyable album. As tradition requires, the album starts off with a couple of up-tempo songs with killer hooks ("Real Suger" is perhaps the best track of all, although "Centre of the Heart" is great too, and what would YOU do when you find that your heart is a "Suburb of the Brain"? haha!) "Fool" is great too, as is "Make My Head Go Pop", which has some funky underlying synth beats to it. I must admit I've never been a big fan of Roxette's arsenal of ballads. Thankfully, there are fewer of them on this album than usuanlly is the case. The last track "My World My Love My Life" is supposed to be a "meaningful" song, but frankly, it didn't do much for me. Regardless, despite the flaws, there are far enough good tracks on here. So what if US radio bypasses Roxette, you can buy it and make your own great radio sounds.
