 First things first: I am a huge fan of "The Apprentice", one of the better reality TV shows out there. The author brings us a bunch of interesting tidbits about the show. Such as: after a fired contestant takes a cab and gives his/her last thoughts and you see the cab taking off into the NY traffic, then off-camera the cab goes around the block because of course all the contestants are quarantined for the duration of the entire season's shoot (just like in "Survivor").  But on to the book itself, "TrumpNation" (276 pages). The author, a NY Times business reporter, makes clear that he has had plenty of access to the Donald, even for the writing of the book. And the image that comes through is that in real life, the Donald is a successful business person, for sure, but one who has made plenty of mistakes. The best part of the book is a chapter called TrumpBroke, where the author examines the REAL wealth of Trump: "Donald doesn't control [a number of] Manhattan properties that bear his name or are closely associated with him today, including Trump Tower". The author also refers to Donald's many books of business advice as "nonfiction work of fiction".   Trump has had a lot of ups and downs and we'll never really know how many millions (or billions, per the Donald) he is really worth these days, but it's clear that the "Trump" brand still resonates after 20+ years. The book reads like a breeze and on that account is successful.
