 Music: 5 stars; Compilation: 3 Stars  For anyone who is new to Bob Dylan or for anyone who is just looking for a single release of his biggest and best known songs, this is a decent place to start. "The Essential Bob Dylan" (2 CDs, 30 tracks, 124 min.) thankfully provides a chronological overview of those 'essential' songs. CD1 (56 min.) covers the period through 1967. Inexcusably absent are "A Hard Rain's Gonna Fall" and, even more so, "I Want You", a genuine hit (from "Blonde on Blonde"). CD2 (68 min.) covers the late 60s through the Oscar-winning "Things Have Changed" in 2000. Again inexcusably absent are "Changing of the Guard", the hit from "Street Legal", and "Simple Twist of Fate". Why Columbia didn't take full advantage of the 80 min. capacity of CDs is a mystery to me. They could've easily added another 30-35 min. on this collection. But the music that IS on here, is top-notch, obviously.  Interestingly, the release of "The Essential Bob Dylan" here in Fall, 2000 coincided more or less with the release in Europe of "The Best of Bob Dylan Volume 2", which followed the release in 1997 of Vol. 1 (both of which are available here on Amazon). Take those 2 CDs together, and you have a better and deeper compilation of the "essential" Bob Dylan songs.
