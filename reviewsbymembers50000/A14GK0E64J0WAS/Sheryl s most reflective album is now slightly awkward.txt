 When Sheryl Crow released her fifth studio album in September, 2005, things couldn't have been peachier for her: a million-selling music career, and her very public romance with Lance Armstrong (their engagement was announced that same month). We're now seven months later, and Sheryl is single again (circumstances behind the break-up are still fuzzy), and "Wildflowers" is the first flop in Sheryl's stellar career. What went wrong?  "Wildflower" (11 tracks, 46 min.) is the complete opposite of Sheryl's previous studio album "C'mon C'mon". Gone are the cheery, sunny, catchy songs, and instead we receive  introspective songs, with Sheryl reflecting on how good life basically is. The opener "I Know Why" sets the tone for the album. The title track is just Sheryl on acoustic guitar, with sparse strings accompannying her. "Lifetimes" and "Live It Up" are the only uptempo songs on the album. "Always on Your Side" is a beautiful piano-based ballad.  So why has "Wildflower" been a chart disappointment? For the answer, look no further than "Good is Good", the radio single. It is not a bad song per se, but it doesn't grab you. And that's pretty reflective of the entire album. A lot of easy-flowing songs with not enough attention-grabbers. The liner notes' prominent dedication to Lance, and the plentyful references to love in the songs, now come across awkwardly, frankly.
