 Mark Isham nowadays is associated primarily with his ample soundtrack work and his trumpet skills. However, Isham made a one-time expansion into the world of synthesizer moods on this 1983 album, which remains overlooked in his oeuvre. The album is built around 4 essential tracks (unfortunately, none of which you can sample here on Amazon): "Sympathy & Acknowledgment" is a superb piece of weaving synthezisers into a mesmorizing sound caleidoscope. "On the Threshold of Liberty" (probably his best known individual piece, as a result of the plug Windham Hill gave it on sampler albums and compilations) is a Bolero-like build-up from very faint to an all-out burst of trumpet and synths. "Raffles in Rio" and "Men Before the Mirror" are two more beautifully crafted "minimalist" synth pieces. The rest of the album are shorter pieces. "When Things Dream" and "Something Nice For My Dog", both soft piano/background synth pieces, truly are "album-fillers", reason I cannot give the album 5 stars. Following the surprising success of "Vapor Drawings", Isham decidedly turned away from the synthesizer wizardry (one can consider his next album, the "Never Cry Wolf" soundtrack, a transition album), and ultimately disavowed "Vapor" if not in words, then certainly by his actions. (Wanna have another hit, Mark? How about "Vapor Drawings 2"?) I guess making Hollywood soundtracks was more challenging. Nevertheless, "Vapor" remains required listening for any serious synthesizer fan.
