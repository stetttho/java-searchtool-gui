 Wow... Where did Miranda Lee Richards come from with this stunning debut album? This supposed former model (I confess I've never heard her name before) blows onto the music scene with an album that is polished and hauntingly beautiful. The CD is reminiscent of Sheryl Crow's debut album (think "Run, Baby, Run"-style). From the opening notes of "The Beginner", Miranda Lee Richards takes us onto a journey of despair, love, hope, and life. Among the stand-out tracks are "Folkin' Hell", "I Know What It's Like" (With lyrics such as "I Know What It's Like/I've Been here Before/Please Believe Me/You Know It Breaks My Heart/The Way You Are So Untrusting") and "Seven Years". The album also contains a nice cover of the Stones' "Dandelion", quite appropriate given the overall dreamy atmosphere of the album, as well as "The Landscape", its lyrics based on the French poet Charles Baudelaire's poem of the same name. In all respects, this is a fantastic album, and I don't know why it has not gathered more attention since its release in August. I suspect that if Sheryl Crow has heard this album, she did a touble-take and wondered how she herself can come up with something as good for her next release. By all means, BUY THIS.
