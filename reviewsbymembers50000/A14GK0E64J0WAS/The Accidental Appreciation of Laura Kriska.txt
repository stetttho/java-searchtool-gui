 Ms. Kriska recently gave a presentation at the Japan America Society here in Cincinnati, which I attended at the last minute, by accident so to speak. Following her lively presentation, my curiosity was peaked enough to  buy the book. As it happens, I had to fly to Los Angeles a few days later,  and settled in for 4 hours on interrupted reading. Ms. Kriska writes as she  comes across in person: witty, smart, engaging, understanding, forgiving,  yet always with an agenda to be accomplished (in her book: the  "uniform policy" episode; in her presentation: to get the  audience to buy the book), for which she does not apologize (nor should  she). Ms. Kriska's eye for details is impressive, even more so realizing  that the book was written some 8 years after the events. Unexplained both  at the presentation and in her book is what exactly caused the long delay  in starting and/or finishing the book. That aside, anyone looking for a  good international "human interest" story or for that perfect  summertime poolside reading, this is a can't-miss book, guaranteed to make  you smile along the way. And it made my flight to/from Los Angeles  seemingly so much shorter!
