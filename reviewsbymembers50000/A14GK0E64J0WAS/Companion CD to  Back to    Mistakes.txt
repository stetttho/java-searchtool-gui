 "Back to 19 Mistakes" (see my review there) gives the essentials of the first two albums "10 Mistakes" and "Back to 78" of Gruppo Sportivo. This album is essentially a companion piece, giving an overview of the rest of their recordings, including singles, B sides and other miscellaneous tracks. Interestingly, the music is presented in reverse chronological order (tracks 1 dates from 2000, track 24 from 1976). Of the 24 tracks, only 5 overlap with the "Back to 19 Mistakes" compliation. "I Don't Think So"/"Click Here" is their double A-sided "reunion" single of Summer 2000, continiung their well-established style of short pop songs with funny/sarcastic lyrics to match. 1988's "Mexican Radio" was Gruppo's last commericial success before the reunion. The album is a true smorgasbord of tracks, with the good and the not-so-good. "Buddy Oder is a Gas", issued in 1980 under the "Buddy Odor Stop" bandname remains a funny little tune. Most intersting are the last 2 tracks, which were their initial singles before hitting it big with "Beep Beep Love". Almost 25 years after hitting it big in Europe, there is renewed interest in Gruppo Sportivo, and deservedly so. Buy this AND ALSO "Back to 19 Mistakes", and you will have all the best of their music, listening pleasure guaranteed.
