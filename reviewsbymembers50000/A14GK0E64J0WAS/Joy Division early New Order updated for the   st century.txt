 She Wants Revenge consists of Adam Bravin and Justin Warfield. Working with drum machines and an array of keyboards and synthesizers, augmented by the occasional electric guitar, the duo has gradually been building buzz in the last 18 months. This is their debut album.  "She Wants Revenge" (10 tracks, plus one hidden track; 64 min.) is so deeply rooted in Joy Division and early New Order, you are going to enjoy this album tremendously if you like those bands. If you don't, don't waste your time or money. There are really no weak tracks as such. First single "These Things" is an enjoyable hum-along. "Out of Control" is a great club-song ("The Lights That Move Sideways and Up and Down/The Beat Takes You Over and Spins You Round"). The best is saved for last: first there is the new single "Tear You Apart", which both musically and lyrically is a derivative of Joy Division's "Love Will Tear Us Apart", but oh so catchy! Then there is the "hidden" bonus track, which plays as track 66 on my CD player, a great 7+ min. epic song and a perfect way to end the album.  While She Wants Revenge often gets mentioned along the same lines as Interpol due to the connection to/influence by, musically She Wants Revenge is in fact much closer to, say, the Faint. I saw She Wants Revenge live about a year ago, and immediately took a liking to their music. The debut album is finally out, and one of the best releases of early 2006. BUY IT!
