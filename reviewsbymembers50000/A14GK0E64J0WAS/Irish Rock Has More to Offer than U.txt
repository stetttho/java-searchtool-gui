 JJ72 released their debut album 18 months ago, and it's still trying to find its way to the general public in the US, nevermind that it's 3 singles found some success in the UK ("October Swimming", "Oxygen" and "Snow"). Tireless touring (opening for among others Coldplay and the Stereophonics here in the US) will hopefully change that. The JJ72 sound is a mix of hard rock and intimate songs, and it works very well. "Oxygen" typifies the sound, and it soars. The album also contains several very intimate songs, just band leader Mark Greany on accoustic guitar.  Considering all the drivvle we hear on the radio today, one can only exasperate that this album cannot find a larger audience. I can't wait for the next JJ72 album (supposedly out later this year). And seeing U2 winning all those Grammys last week, we shouldn't forget that Ireland has more to offer than U2. JJ72 proves it with this excellent album!
