 "Antique Dreams" is an assortment of "rare" tracks,  outtakes and live tracks and, like many such collections, is worth digging  through. The tracks date from 1971 to 1990, with the bulk of them from the  1981-1986 era. The best tracks are, perhaps not surprisingly, the longer  tracks. "Calymba Cali" (1981; 8+ min) is the very best track,  with a strong synth bass sound prevalent, a track that would fit in very  nicely on the "Thief" soundtrack album. "Cool Breeze of  Brighton" (1986; live; 10+ min) has more an upbeat tempo and features  a long Froese guitar solo. "Edinburgh's Castle" (1982, live, 8+  min) is a more gentle track that takes its time to develop. "Sorcerer  and Thief" (1981, live, 6+ min) does excatly what the title suggest: 2  segments of the main themes of the respective movies, bridged nicely into  one. "Oedipus Tyrannus Overture" (1974; 4+ min) is a preview of  the sound to come in "Rubycon" and another great track.   "Southend Mall" (1985, 4+ min) is an outake from the "Le  Parc" sessions and has the same feel to it. I found tracks 4,5 and 7  (all soundtracks to German TV shows) not particularly interesting. The  strangest track of all is "Ultima Thule Part 1" (1971) which  according to the liner notes was a TD single; it features louds guitars and  drums and doesn't sound like TD at all (if anything, it made me think of  the Dutch band "Earth & Fire" on their single "Wild and  Exciting" from the same era, minus the female vocals of course.)  Overall, there are enough golden nuggets in this bag that make this CD  another welcome addition in the TD "Classics Collection" series.  I'm looking forward to more!
