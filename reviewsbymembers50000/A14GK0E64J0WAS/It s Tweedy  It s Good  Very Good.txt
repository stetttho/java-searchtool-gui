 I have not seen the movie, but bought this album simply on the strength of Jeff Tweedy's reputation as a gifted, daring and innovative musician. I was not disappointed! 9 of the 12 tracks aqre Tweedy penned, most of them instrumentals performed by Tweedy and Glenn Kotche. Several of them are truly mesmorizing, including the "Opening Titles", with guitar-distorts all over, "Frank's Dream", "The Wallman" and, best of all, the 11 min. "Finale" with it's haunting guitar riff and overlaying piano playing. There are 2 tracks attributed to Wilco: the "new" track "Promising" sounds like Tweedy solo, and the other one "When The Roses Bloom Again" is from the Mermaid Avenue sessions with Billy Brag, quite beautiful actually. As with many movie soundtracks, this is a "mood album", and I find it very engaging, altough it's probably not for everyone.
