 David Gray reached critical and commercial acclaim with his 4th album, the 1999 album "White Ladder", a blockbuster in the UK that burned slowly in ths US but ultimately made him a big indie star in the US a year later, and deservedly so. His next album, 2002's "A New Day at Mignight", was a hit-and-miss affair, and now comes his latest.  "Life in Slow Motion" (10 tracks, 45 min.) retreats from "New Day" to bring a "White Ladder"-like sound. Some of the songs certainly achieve that goal, if not that same standard. First single "The One I Love" is a great "mood" tune. "Nos Da Cariad" is the best tune on the album, with a nice up-beat tempo. Other standouts include "Hospital Foods", another upbeat track. Yet too many songs are stuck in the same "ballad"-like atmosphere, without actually delivering.   While "Life in Slow Motion" is certainly an improvement over "New Day", it simply does not match the heights and musical and critical ambition of "White Ladder", to which Gray's output will be eternally compared to. (It reminds me of Damien Rice's dilemma, having delivered an outstainding album "O", with no subsequent musical equivalent. In fact Rice has not released anything since "O".) That said, David Gray will be visiting Cincinnati shortly, and I am looking forward to see how he translates his songs in concert.
