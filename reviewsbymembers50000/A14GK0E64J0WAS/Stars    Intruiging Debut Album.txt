 Kings of Leon has (unfairly) been tagged as a Southern-version of the Strokes. I don't see the comparison, quite frankly. Kings of Leon is not nearly as dark as the Strokes, for one. And musically, their influences are (among others) much more Allman Bros. and, yes, Led Zep. Of course touring as the opening act for the Strokes in the recent US tour has only amplified Strokes comparisons. "Youth and Young Manhood" (11 tracks, 46 min.) is KoL's debut album (after a couple of EPs). Opener (and first single) "Red Morning Glory" is a stand-out, as is "Wasted Time" (2nd single). "Joe's Head" is a great "throw-away" unpretentious tune. "California Waiting" is the song that has invited the comparisons to the Strokes, with the tight guitar licks, quite good actually. "Molly's Chambers" is another good, hard rocker. "Dusty" drenches in Led Zep "Going to California" influences.  What stops me from giving this 4 stars is Caleb Followill's lead vocals, which I would say are an acquired taste. I'm still not convinced. Great songs, slightly annoying vocals is how I'd put it. Nice debut album, now let's see where Kings of Leon goes from here.
