 The Stills issued their debut EP (in June, 2003) on the strength of 1980s sounds and atmosphere. "Rememberese" (4 tracks, 14 min.) starts off with "Still in Love", with an instantly catchy bass riff that drives the chorus of the song. "Killer Bees" is blazing, with a darker sound to it; it's the best song on this EP. "Talk to Me" is a short, accoustic guitar-driven track, and very different musically from anything else on the EP. "Still in Love (12" Extended Remix) is thankfully not so de-constructed that is becomes unrecognizable (which seems to be prevalent on remixes these days) but, keeping in the 80s spirit, essentially just a longer version of the original. In all, a very promising beginning for the Montreal band. The Stills released their debut album "Logic Will Break Your Heart" in Fall, 2003.
