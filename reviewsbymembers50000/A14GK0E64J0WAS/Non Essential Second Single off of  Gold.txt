 "Answering Bell" is the second single off of "Gold" and, after the brilliant first single "New York New York", is somewhat of a let-down. Not that there is anything wrong with the song "Answering Bell": it is Ryan Adams as Van Morrison-reincarnate (early 70s), and the song really works well. The let-down comes from the other tracks on this single. Instead of non-album tracks (which as we all know, the prolific Ryan Adams has plenty of), the extra tracks are live versions of Gold's "Touch Feel and Lose" and "Answering Bell". The live songs are good, but quite honestly, if you want to relive that Ryan Adams concert you saw, I'd suggest you swing over to eBay and buy one of the many excellent-sounding concert bootlegs available there.
