 The Sterophonics' second album offers a refreshing offering of Brit Stomp Rock (except they are Welsh). What a great album, full of great guitar hooks and band leader Kelly Jones' personal views of life and relationships. The album starts of with a rousing "Roll Up and Shine", as good an album opener as you will find. The next track "The Bartender and The Thief" (one of the album's highly succesful singles in the UK) is an up-uptempo rocker, just great. "Hurry Up and Wait" (another of the singles) is an accoustic-based slower song, contemplating the question of why we wanna hurry up all the time. "Half The Lies" is one of the album's best tracks, another stomp-along tracks, and the same can be said for the ironically titled "Is Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow", demonstrating Kelly Jones' smart lyrics. "I Wouldn't Believe Your Radio" (another single) stems from a dream Kelly had about "Ringo Starr and George Harrison singing in front of my parents' house", and while originally intended to be sung by drummer Stuart Cable (in the vein of Ringo Starr), in the end Kelly has lead vocals on this one. This album was the break-through for the Stereophonics in the UK and it's easy to see why: great melodies, great guitar hooks, and interesting themes. The band has made some headway in the US this year (most recently opening for U2), but they deserve much better. BUY IT!
