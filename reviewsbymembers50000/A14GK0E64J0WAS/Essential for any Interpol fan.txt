 The "Interpol EP" was originally issued in June, 2002 as a "preview' of their debut album "Turn on the Bright Lights". Even though 2 of the 3 tracks on the EP would wound up on the album, it nevertheless is an essential CD for any Interpol fan. "PDA" is one of the best songs from the "Bright Lights" album. It comes with a hard-driven, yet mesmorising beat, and the last 2 min. "outro" is genius. "NYC" is the most inward looking song (don't call it a ballad!) from the album, and the one that would give the album its title. "Specialist" is the last track, and the one that makes this EP, er, "special". The song is completely in line with the dark atmosphere of the album, and similar in energy to tracks like "PDA" and "Obstacle 1". (It is also a staple on Interpol's current set list. If you have a chance to see them live, don't hesitate!) Buy all means, BUY IT!
