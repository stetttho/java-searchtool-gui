 Creed made 3 albums, all one bigger than the other, between 1997 and 2001, and then called it quits. The Florida band came out of nowhere with 1997's "My Own Prison", which truly was a classic album, with not a weak track on it, the perfect soundtrack to  alternative rock in its heydays.  The other 2 albums (1999's "Human Clay" and 2001's "Weathered") were far more mixed bag.  "Greatest Hits" (13 tracks, 63 min.) is a straight-forward compilation of Creed's biggest hits and best known album tracks. The songs run chronologically, 4 tracks from each of the first and second album, ending with 5 tracks from the last album. Admit it, Creed had an amazing string of hits in that 5 year period: from "My Own Prison" to "One" to "Higher" to "With Arms Wide Open" to "My Sacrifice" to "One Last Breath", just to name a few, wow. Nevertheless, I cannot rate this compilation "higher" than 4 stars for a couple of reasons: (1) the first album, by far the band's best, is underrepresented with only 4 tracks. Where is "In America", a genuine radio-hit? (2) there are no rarities on here. Why not add the Doors cover "Riders on the Storm" (from the Doors tribute album "Stoned Immaculate"), which also was a radio hit? At 63 min., both of these songs could've easily been added without exceeding the 80 min. capacity of a CD. The bonus DVD brings all of the music videos, along with some live performances.  In all, "Greatest Hits" does a pretty good job, although it falls *this* short of the perfect compilation of Creed. Meanwhile, 3 of the 4 Creed members have gone on to different things (forming "Alter Bridge"), but who knows what has become of lead-singer Scott Stapp, who seemingly has vanished from sight.
