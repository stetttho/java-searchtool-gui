 It's hard to keep track of the number of compilations of Vangelis. Off the top of my head, I can think of "The Best of", "Greatest Hits", "Themes", "Portraits", and "Reprise". But they never got it right, something was always off, or one period or another of his career was not covered. Now comes "Oddisey: The Definitive Collection". While it may be pushing your luck to proclaim anything as a Vangelis "definitive" compilation", given his prolific output over the years, I am here nevertheless to tell you that this compilation is as good as it will get. "Oddisey: The Definitive Collection" (18 tracks, 78 min.) in my opinion truly does compile all of Vangelis' best know tracks and greatest hits. Most of the tracks on here will sound immediately familiar, many because they are movie themes (Chariots of Fire being the most famous of course, but also The Missing, Blade Runner, thankfully containing both the beginning and end titles, Mutiny on the Bounty, and others), and other that became well known in commercials (Hymne, L'Enfant, among others). There can be no denying the creativity and talents of Vangelis. There are 2 bonus tracks, "I'll Find My Way Home" and "State of Independence", the 2 best known tracks of Jon & Vangelis, a nice touch to the album. I share my frustration with other reviewers here that there is tons of great Vangelis music out there that remains unreleased. To be sure, Vangelis deserves a box-treatment of rare and unreleased tracks. But if you are looking for a single-disk overview of his best known songs, look no further: "Oddisey" is it. Released in Fall, 2003, it is a nice way to commemorate Vangelis turning 60 (say it ain't so!).
