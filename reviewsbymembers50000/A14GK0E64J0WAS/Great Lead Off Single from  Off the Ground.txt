 Paul McCartney found true international success for the last time with the 1993 album "Off the Ground". The album was preceeded by this single.  "Hope of Deliverance" (4 tracks, 16 min.) starts off with one of Paul's best songs in memory. It is reminiscent of "Deliver Your Children" from 1978's "London Town" album, just a georgous, dreamy track with superb vocal harmonies. "Big Boys Bickering" is a laid-back tune, with country influences, really nice. "Long Leather Coat" is a rockabilly tune and works really well. "Kicked Around No More" is perhaps the best tune of the 3 B-sides, a pensive tune that could've/should've been on the album (replacing, say, the dreadfull "Biker Like an Icon").  Off all the singles from "Off the Ground", this is the one to get: great title tune, and superb B-sides. Not to be missed by any Macca fan!
