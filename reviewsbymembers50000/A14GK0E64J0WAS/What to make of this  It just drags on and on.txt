 Before you jump on me, just know that I've been a huge Tori Amos fan since the first hour. I put Tori's excellent 2002 album "Scarlet's Walk" in my top albums of that year.  So it was with great anticipation that I bought "The Beekeeper" on the day it was released. I've waited to post my review, as I wanted to make sure what I felt was not just a "first moment" reaction.  "The Beekeeper" (19 tracks, 79 min.) frankly puzzles me, from beginning to end. I've listened to it time and again, to make sure I wasn't missing anything. But it's been several weeks now, and the truth is that this album doesn't "grab" me, not a single song makes me sit up and take notice. The entire album muddles along the same lazy, mid-tempo tune. And it does go on and on, for an hour and 20 min., jeez. Tori self-produced this album, but the truth is she sorely lacked a producer who would've stepped in and tightend things up. Cut the album by 30 min. or so and maybe we have something to work with.  I can't stress enough how disappointed I am with this album (not unlike the Donnas' "Gold Medal' album last year), especially on the heels of the truly excellent "Scarlet's Walk". That said, Tori will be touring with her excellent band mates Jon Evans (best bass player out there) and drummer Mat Chamberlain later this year, and I sure plan to catch that.
