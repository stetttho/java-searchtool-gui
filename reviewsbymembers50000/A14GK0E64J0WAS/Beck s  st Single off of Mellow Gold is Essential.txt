 "Loser" is the song that put Beck on the musical map and this EP (5 songs, 23 min.) is essential to any Beck fan's collection. For one, none of the 4 bonus songs are on the "Mellow Gold" album. "Corvette Bummer" is in the same vain as the "Mellow Gold" album, with an irresitable beat. "Alcohol" is an accoustic reflective tune, quite nice. "Soul Sucking Jerk" is a 6 min. scratch-and-rap tune, also irresistable. "Fume" is the only weak track of the bunch. Beck has done many different things since "Mellow Gold". I loved "Midnite Vultures" but I just didn't "get" his latest CD ("Sea Change"). However, Beck's output from the "Mellow Gold"-era remains unsurpassed, and this EP is essential.
