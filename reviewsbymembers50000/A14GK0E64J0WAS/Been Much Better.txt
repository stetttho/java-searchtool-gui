 As a big 311 fan (been to many concerts), it regrets me to inform you that "From Chaos" just doesn't measure up to their best CDs (the "blue" album and "Transistor" specifiaclly). The album starts of promisingly with "You Get Worked", an uptempo great mix of what we've always expected of 311. But then the album loses touch until we reach track 7 "Champaigne" which goes back to 311's love for reggae, and it shows. The album really hits full steam with tracks 9 through 12, starting up with the up-tempo "Wake Your Mind Up", and then with the best track of the album "Amber" (dissed by the press for it poor lyrics, but who cares... it's a great tune), and on to the final track "I'll be there a while" which goes back to 311's tried and trusted "relaxed" reggae beat.  In all, too many filler songs to rate this better than 3 stars. If you are new to 311, check out instead "311" (the blue album).
