 Recorded (and first broadcast) almost 25 years ago to the day, "Grateful Dead: The Closing of Winterland" (2 DVDs) is THE music DVD release of the year, in my humble opinion. Not only is the music here nothing short of top notch, but the extras on the DVD (not to mention the packaging of the DVD) make this a no-miss musical and visual bonanza. The actual concert is 3 sets (which the Dead kicks off exactly as the midnight hour strikes!), with many highlights, including "Scarlet Begonias" on Set 1, and "Not Fade Away" on Set 2. But Set 3 is almost flawless throughout, including "Dark Star->The Other One->Dark Star", and in the encore "Casey Jones". (The 28 page booklet that comes with the DVD, has an all-telling picture showing a fan's banner from the show that says "1535 days since last SF Dark Star"...) The DVD bonus materials are just awesome. "Winterland: A Million Memories" is an in-depth documentary of Winterland as a concert venue, and the Dead's 60 or so shows at Winterland. The interviews with the fans are hilarious. The bonus concert tracks of the opening acts (the Blues Brothers and the New Riders of the Purple Sage) are somewhat out of place. Then there is the 2 AM interviews of Bob Weir and Mickey Hart. In all, this is a most welcome release.
