 It's another year, and therefore there must be another Bee Gees compilation. Just in time for the 2005 Christmas shopping season brought us "Love Songs". Earlier in the year, this release was issued, without much fanfare. As to the claim of all songs being "numnber ones", the liner notes state that all songs made No. 1 somewhere around the world, or were on an album that made No. 1 somwhere around the world, but other than that there are no further details, and we just have to take the label's word for it...  "Number Ones" (19 tracks, 73 min.) brings a chronological selection of the songs. The first third of the collection brings the 1960s songs that, if anything, have gotten better with the years. "World", "Words", "I Started a Joke" etc. have that instant classic feel, and are the best songs on here. After that we get a couple songs of the transition phase of the early 70s, before diving full head into the Bee Gees' most successfull period 1975-1979 centered around the "Saturday Night Fever" songs. The songs are a soundtrack to the era, but for me personally I prefer the 60s Bee Gees. Only one song on the compilation comes from after 1979, the likeable "You Win Again". The album closes with the 2001 Maurice Gibb tribute track, "Man in the Middle", which is touching but musically unremarkable. This limited edition also comes with a 5 song live DVD, which includes an outstanding version of "Massachusetts".  You cannot call this a "greatest hits" album. For that, too many essential songs such as "New York Mining Disaster 1941", "Nights on Broadway", and "More Than a Woman" are missing. While "Number Ones" certainly contains a lot of great music, the better Bee Gees compilation is the 2001 2CD album "Their Greatest Hits: The Record".
