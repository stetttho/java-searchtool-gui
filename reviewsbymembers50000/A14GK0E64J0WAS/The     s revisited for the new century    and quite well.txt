 The Faint's 2001' album "Dance Macabre" is getting renewed interest, in part because of the just-issued "Dance Macabre Remixes" album. "Dance Macabre" (9 songs in 35 min.) is the culmination of The Faint's growth so far. Elements of the synth-driven band can be found in 1985-era Depeche Mode, late 80s/early 90s New Order, Love & Rockets, even early Spandau Ballet. The best songs on the album include the opener "Agenda Suicide", "Total Job", and best of all "The Conductor", with vocoders all over and an irresitible dance-heavy beat, just great! I cannot wait for the next "real" Faint album. I don't care much for the new "Remixes" album, but meanwhile, we will continue to enjoy this fun and enjoyable album.
