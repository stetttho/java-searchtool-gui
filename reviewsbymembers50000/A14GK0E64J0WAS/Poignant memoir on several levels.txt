 Gail Caldwell is a Pulitzer Prize winner for writing book reviews for the Boston Globe. In this book, she looks back on growing up in Texas and, perhaps more importantly, her relationship with her dad.  "A Strong Wind West" (228 pages) brings us the story of what it was like growing up in Amarillo, Texas in the 50s and 60s. Gail was one of 2 daughters in the Caldwell family, and she has a strong bond with her father, which eventually grows more troublesome as Gail moves away to college, first in Lubbock, then later in Austin. For a while, it looks as if the author is going to focus (too) much on the anti-war, feminist movement of the late 60s and early 70s, but then she turns her attention to the many different family members, both past and present, and the author paints a complicated, yet compelling portrait, in particular how her relationship revolves over the years, ultimately finding peace again with her father, and for that this book ultimately makes a good read.  Particularly insightful is the author's retelling of her academic experiences at Austin, where she dropped out 8 weeks before graduating, only to take up the thread years later and to then go on and take a Masters. Her insights on how certain professors engaged her, or not, are really good. In the end, this is not a revelatory memoir, akin to Frank McCourt's tales in "Angela's Ashes" and its sequels, but it still makes for an enjoyable book all around.
