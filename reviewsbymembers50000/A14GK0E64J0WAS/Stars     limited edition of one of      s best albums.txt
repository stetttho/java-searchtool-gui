 It's been exactly a year since Interpol's second album "Antics" (10 track; 41 min.) was released. I like the album now even more than when it first came out, and it easily remains one of 2004's best albums, period.  A "limited edition" of Antics has just been released, with a bonus disc of material. The bonus CD (5 tracks, 29 min.) contains one 'new' song, "Song Seven", which Interpol has been playing on and off for years (I already had it on a 2002 release called "B Sides + Rarities", excellent if you can find it). In the other tracks, each of the band's members remixes a song: Paul remixes "NARC", which now is just an accoustic guitar and Paul's vocals; Daniel remixes "Not Even Jail", with good effect; Sam remixes "Length of Love" into a house/techno-like stomper (not my favorite). Not surprisingly, the remix of "Public Pervert" by Carlos D (who frequently DJ's at Interpol's after-show parties) is the best of the bunch, a creative retake on the original without abandoning the original structure altogether. On top of that, the bonus disc contains the videos for all 3 of the singles from "Antics".  If you don't have "Antics" yet, there is no more excuse! BUY IT! If you do own the original release, whether you want to trade it in for this depends on how much you like Interpol. I was quite happy to "trade up" and get the bonus disc.
