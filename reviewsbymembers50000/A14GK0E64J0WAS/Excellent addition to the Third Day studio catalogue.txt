 Third Day has been around for about 10 years, and is with Jars of Clay one of the best "Christian rock" bands out there, bringing a string of very enjoyable albums. This is their 7th studio album.  "Wherever You Are" (12 tracks, 51 min.) starts off with a romping "Tunnel", reminding me of Travis' "Writing to Reach You", just great. Other highlights include "I Can Feel It", bringing urgency and uptempo rock; "Keep on Shining", with uplifting lyrics, and "How Do You Know", another hard-hitting rocker. "Communion" brings a great reflection on what communion is about. There are a couple of great "power ballads" such as "Carry My Cross" and "Love Heals Your Heart", just beautiful. The epic 6+ min. closer "Rise Up" is a fitting end to the album.  Third Day continues to prove that "Christian rock" doesn't have to be boring, in fact the band has never been better than this. "Wherever You Are" is a great listen from beginning to end, and is highly recommended! And if you have a chance to see Third Day in concert, don't miss them, they do rock!
