 Ever since the long-delayed official release of 2002's "Yankee Hotel Foxtrot", Jeff Tweedy has done a lot of touring, both with Wilco and solo, and even with the band going through some line-up changes, if you have seen Wilco touring behind the "ghost is born" album, you know that this is one of the tighest-sounding bands on the road these days.   "Kicking Television: Live in Chicago" (2CDs, 23 tracks, 113 min.) brings the best of a 4 night stand at the Vic Theatre in Chicago in May, 2005. Rightfully so, the setlist is heavy on the YHF and ghost albums. For me the best song on the entire set is the 11+ min. epic "Spiders (Kidsmoke)", which live sounds miles better than it does on "ghost". The highlights are many: "I Am Trying to Break Your Heart", "Muzzle of Bees", "Poor Places" and the 2 Guthrie-worded songs "One by One" and "Airline to Heaven" (from the "Mermaid Avenue" CDs)  are my personal favorites, but there really is no weak song on the entire album. The other band members are equally strong throughout.  If you've seen Wilco live, do yourself a favor and buy this, you won't be disappointed! In a sense, this live album almost feels like the closing of another chapter in Wilco's journey. Maybe Tweedy is ready to embark on another musical experiment altogether, to which I say: sign me up!
