 "Superstar Car Wash" was the Goo Goo's major album label debut and fell pretty much on deaf ears when it was released in 1993. They would hit it big 2 years later with "A Boy Named Goo", primarily because of the breakout hit "Name", which ironically is not representative of their fast-rock sound. This album is Goo Goo at its best. From the opening track "Falling Down" on, the band serves up great fast, club-rock tunes with great guitar hooks. The only slow track is "We Are The Normal", a predecessor to "Name" of their next album. Standout tracks include "Lucky Star", "Girl Right Next to Me" and ""Stop the World". Following the astounding succes of "Name", the Goo Goos would tone down their sound and become truly succesful. Good for them! However, this album captures the band at their raw best. This album truly rocks, and is most faithful to their punkish fast rock origins. BUY IT!
