 "Save it for a Rainy Day" is the (close to) title track of the Jayhawks' latest, and delightful, album, "Rainy Day Music". The song is an absolute gem, with a nice blend of folk, grass and country, one of the standout tracks on the album. This single comes in a radio-edit, which is nearly identical to the album track, as well as a nice live version and interestingly, a demo version, with just Gary Louris on guitar. The last track of the single is a live version of "Tailspin", also a great track from the "Rainy Day" album. In all, this is a great single, even for those that have the "Rainy Day" album. Highly recommended!
