 There is no denying that Evanescence's debut album "Fallen" was one of the big suprises of 2003, continuing to sell strongly into 2004. The band has marched on without the departed co-founder and songwriter Ben Moody, seemingly without missing a beat.  "Anywhere But Home" (14 songs; 61 min.) was recorded in late Spring, 2004, at Le Zenith in Paris, a great concert venue. What jumps out immediately is how tight the band sounds. It shows how quasi-nonstop touring pays off. Given that the band only has material from 1 album, it plays those same songs night after night. Amy Lee nevertheless manages to sound invigerated and at the top of her game on this album. Of course all 10 songs from "Fallen" are on here (with "My Immortal" the standout track). In addition, there is a very effective cover of Korn's "Thoughtless", as well as a couple of promising new songs, including "Missing" and "Breathe No More". The bonus DVD includes an at times hilarious "behind the scenes" look at the Paris show.  This is a strong set, although one has to wonder the rationale behind releasing a live album after just one studio album! (Can you spell "m-o-n-e-y"?) Now we wait on new studio material from Evanescence. Hard to believe but soon it will be a full 2 years that "Fallen" was released. And then we will know whether Ben Moody really will be missed or not.
