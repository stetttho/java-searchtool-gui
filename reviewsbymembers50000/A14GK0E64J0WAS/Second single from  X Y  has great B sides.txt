 "Fix Me" is the second single from Coldplay's "X&Y" album. Anyone that has seen Coldplay on their recently completed US tour, knows that "Fix Me" is the final song of the evening, and a very appropriate, almost cathartic, send-off.  "Fix Me" (3 tracks, 14 min., plus 1 video) also contains great B sides. "The World Turned Upside Down" is another solid "dramatic" song that for some reason is included only on the Japanese version of "X&Y", but really should have been included in all international versions of the album, as it starts of with the verse "X and Y, the land, see, rivers, trees, the stars, the sky" and thus in a sense is the title track of the album. "Pour Me" is another song from the "X&Y" sessions, brought here in a live version from Coldplay's show at the Hollywood Bowl earlier this year. Finally, pop the CD into your PC and you can play the video of "Fix Me".  Coldplay is one of the few bands (Oasis being another one) that releases singles that are worth seeking out for the B sides. "Fix Me" is another great example of that. Recommended for Coldplay completists.
