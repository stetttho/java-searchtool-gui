 Trent Lott's auto-biography comes at a curious point. He's not retired from politics, so why this book at this point? Lott was the Republican's majority leader untill he ran into a massive wall following insensitive remarks at Senator Thurmond's 100th birthday party. A good portion of the book is devoted to that.  "Herding Cats" (312 pages) has some interesting moments, in particular in the early part of the book, where Lott retells the early part of his life. Lott was a student at Ole Miss in 1962 when the university broke segregation and the first black student enrolled. Lott offers some interesting insights on what the atmosphere on campus was like. I wish the book was more like that. Unfortunatly, too much of the book is devoted to a retelling of Lott's recollections of meetings on the Hill as a House Representative and later as a Senator. "I caucused with so-and-so, which lead to the adoption of such-and-such bill", I am paraphrasing, obviously.   As to the infamous Thurmond incident, Lott keeps to his often-stated explanation that "I was just paying an old friend a compliment". Reading his book, I am convinced that Lott is a decent man, and not a racist or one who is pining back to the days of segregation. That said, "Hearding Cats" simply does not make for compelling reading, but for certain passages.
