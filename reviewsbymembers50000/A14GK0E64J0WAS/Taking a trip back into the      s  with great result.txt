 Thee Shams (simply pronounced The Shams) bring a revival of the 1960's blues-grounded rock found in early Rolling Stones and, gulp, even Syd Barret-era Pink Floyd music. This is their second album.  "Sign The Line" (12 tracks, 43 min.) continues the line of their debut album, but even better. The five-piece, fronted by the brothers Gabbard (who write all the songs) starts the album with an incredible 1-2-3 punch of "Not Gonna Make It", "Something Happening" and "Everflowing Tune", the latter being the best track on the album, a smart and in-your-face updating of that 1960's blues/rock-rooted sound for the 21st century. But even when the music gets lighter and low-key, as on "Survive", the band shines. "No Trust Blues" sounds exactly what the title implies, a take-no-prisoner, hard challenging wall of music that just rocks great. The second half of the album flaters a bit, but still contains a couple of great tracks, including the sweet closer "Hallelujah".  A sweet shout-out to my town Cincinnati, where Thee Shams is based. I've seen these guys in concert a number of times, and they brings a TON of energy to their live sets. Thee Shams is starting to get some national recognition, and if you have a chance to see them live, don't miss them, you won't regret it. Meanwhile, "Sign the Line" is a fine album, and full of promise of what the future may bring. I can't wait!
