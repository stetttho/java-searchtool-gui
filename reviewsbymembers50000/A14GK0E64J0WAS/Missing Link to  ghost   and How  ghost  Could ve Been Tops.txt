 As we all know, YHF was finally released in April, 2002, but the songs were really written in mid/late 2000 and recorded in early 2001. Since writing YHF, Jeff Tweedy has been a busy man: soloing the "Chelsea Walls" soundtrack in 2002 (released ironically on the same day as YHF), the Minus 5 album "Down with Wilco" in 2003, and most significantly, last year's Loose Fur self-titled album, which is excellent and easily the best of these various side projects. Loose Fur consists of Tweedy, drummer Glenn Kotche and multi-instrumentalist/producer (and unoffial member of Wilco) Jim O'Rourke. Sounds familiar? It's striking how similar in tone the Loose Fur album sounds to "a ghost is born", and in my opinion it is the missing link between YHF and "ghost". "a ghost is born" (12 tracks, 67 min.) contains a LOT of good music. My fave tracks include the gentle "Muzzle of Bees" and "Hummingbird", the twisting "Wishful Thinking", the singalong "Company on my Back" (with great outro), "Theologians" and the closer "The Late Greats" (about the greatest song never heard).  Unfortunately "ghost" contains TOO MUCH music: at 67 min. it simply drags at times. Over-indulgence on 2 tracks ruin what could have been the best Wilco album ever. Cut "Spiders" in half, and end the white noise outro of "Less Than You Think" after 2 min. instead of 12 min., and it would have benefitted the overall flow of the album tremendously, without undermining the integrity of either of those songs. In all, "ghost" is a good album, but not as good as YHF (which was my "Album of the Year" in 2002). Meanwhile, check out the Loose Fur album, which, incidentally, clocks in at 39 min. and passes by in a breeze. A similar restraint would have made "a ghost is born" tops in the Wilco catalogue.
