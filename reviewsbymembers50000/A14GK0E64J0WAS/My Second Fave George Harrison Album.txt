 My favorite George Harrison album is "Living in the Material World", and the 1979 "George Harrison" album follows after that. It is regarded by many Harrison fans as one of George's lesser albums, but for whatever reason it really struck a cord with me then, and still now. I still view "George Harrison" (11 tracks, 43 min.) as having the vinyl A and B side, and on that score, I rate the A side 5 stars and the B side 3 stars. Indeed, the opening 5 tracks are as close to perfect as you can get. The opener "Love Comes to Everyone" is a classic Harrison "love" song. "Not Guilty" is a song written in the latter Beatles days (which incidentally you can preview on "Beatles Anthology 3"), and just beautiful. "Blow Away" is one of George's best tunes ever. The B side is not nearly as good. "Faster" (an ode to Formula 1 racing) is the better of the lot, but the Spanish-tinted "Dark Sweet Lady" misfires badly. The closer "If You Believe" is another classic Harrison tune, though. This remastered edition comes with a demo-version of "Here Comes the Moon", a nice touch but not essential. The liner notes are great, with George commenting on how all the songs came about (extracted from his autobiograpgy "I Me Mine"). In all, a great album.
