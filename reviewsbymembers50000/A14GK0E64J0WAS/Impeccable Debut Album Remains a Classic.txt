 In 1973 the Dutch band Kayak came out of nowhere with this most impressive debut album See See The Sun. The album was preceded by their first single Lyrics (which appears on the album), a perfect introduction to the band: a combination of strong melody and intelligent "lyrics". Musically,  think of Kayak as a combination of (early) Genesis and ELO. The album is a  mix of shorter songs (Mammoth and the title track were also issued as  singles in Europe, with considerable success) and the longer (6-8 minutes)  more "experimental" progressive rock songs such as Mouldy Wood,  Lovely Luna, Forever Is A Lonely Thought). This album is the first of 3  albums Kayak recorded for the EMI label, and it is this trio that contains  the "definitive" Kayak sound, culminating in Royal Bed Bouncer,  Kayak's best album (see review there).
