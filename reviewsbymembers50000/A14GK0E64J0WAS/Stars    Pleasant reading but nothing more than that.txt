 So the mystery of "Deep Throat" has finally been solved. In the ultimate irony for author Bob Woodward, it was revealed not by himself, but by Mark Felt's family (in a May, 2005 article in Vanity Fair).   "The Secret Man" (238 pages) was rush-released in mere weeks after the Vanity Fair article. Woodward clearly had the basis of the book ready to go, "just in case" (i.e. if and when Deep Throat passed away), and then put the finishing touches on it. Couple of things: (1) the book clearly does feel rushed, almost unfinished, at times; (2) more importantly, there never was much of a deep relationship between Woodward and Felt, and therefore there isn't a whole lot to talk about. Woodward rehashes certain events in a historical context that have been described much better and in greater detail in other books before (such as "All The President's Men" and "The Final Days").  This is not a 'bad' book per se, but there is not much remarkable about it either. We don't really learn a lot new. Carl Berstein gets to add a chapter  at the end, basically to tell us that, even though he is a contributing editor to Vanity Fair, he had no idea the revealing article was about to be published. Ok, Carl. As for Woodward, he's written a lot better books, and I'm sure he realizes that too.
