 Looking for some books to read before going on vacation recently, I was drawn to "Suburban Safari" for a number of reasons, not in the least because I live in the 'burbs myself, with a backyard, and not much of a gardner frankly.  "Suburban Safari: A Year on the Lawn" is the hilarious tale by the author of how she experienced life in her yard for one whole year. It's amazing what all happens. Bugs, plants, birds, flowers, grass, it all grows and interacts in one way or another. From the book inside cover, I gather that Hannah Holmes has made her name through various science-related writings. It goes to the author's credit that she keeps the book as unscientific as possible, and with a healthy dose of humor. The pages just fly by. In all, if you're looking for a fun yet informative read, "Suburban Safari" easily fits the bill. Highly recommended, and I know that I won't look at my backyard ever the same way again!
