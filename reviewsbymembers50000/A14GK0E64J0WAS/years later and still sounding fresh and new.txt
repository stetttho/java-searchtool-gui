 It's hard to believe but it's been almost 5 years since twin sisters Heather and Jennifer Kinley stormed onto the country music scene with their debut album "Just Between You and Me". Breezing through 10 songs in just over 34 min., the album today retains its fresh sound. The title track (and hit single) is one of the best songs, giving Heather and Jennifer a great song to showcase their voices as well as their song-writing abilities (they co-write about half of the songs on the album). Other great tracks include "Talk to Me", "Crazy Kind of Love Thing" and, perhaps the best track of all, the intimate "Contradiction". As far as "traditional" country goes, it does not get much better than this album. I'm not particularly big on country music, but "Just Between You and Me" easily appealed to me on the strenght of its melodies and harmonies.
