 Pete Yorn scored a major hit in 2001 with his debut album "musicforthemorningafter", and followed it with a much less acclaimed (critically and commercially) "Day I Forgot" in 2003. Hard to find is the excellent 2001 limited release "Live at the Roxy", capitalizing on the debut album's success (it contains an excellent cover of Springsteen's "Dancing in the Dark", a concert staple in those days.)  "Live from New Jersey" (2CDs, 20 tracks, 91 min.) was recorded in Fall 2003 and actually has been available throught Yorn's website since January of this year, but now gets an "official" release. This release gives a full concert performance of Yorn, and he shines. The set mixes up tracks from both studio albums, but rightly emphasizing the stronger debut album (10 of its 14 tracks are featured here, including all the classics such as "Strange Condition", "On Your Side", "Black" and of course "Life on a Chain"). There are 7 tracks from "Day I Forgot". The remainder tracks are covers and one new song. Pete Yorn is at his best throughout, and thorougly relaxed, with much banter throughout. Check out in particular the closing track, a medley of the Springsteen cover "Atlantic City" with his own "Murray", just beautiful.  While it makes you wonder why another live album, "Live from New Jersey" is Pete Yorn at his best. The question is of course whether his next studio album will match the quality of "musicforthemorningafter" or the disappointment of "Day I Forgot", only time will tell. Meanwhile, "Live from New Jersey" is a thorougly enjoyable listen throughout.
