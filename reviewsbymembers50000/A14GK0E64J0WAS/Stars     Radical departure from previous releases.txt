 True story: I bought the new Raveonettes and Ryan Adams albums on the same day, and popped them into my CD player. The CD started to play and for about 30 sec. I thought I was listening to Ryan Adams before I realized it was the Raveonettes! Talk about a change! No, this is not "Attack of the Ghost Riders"!  "Pretty in Black" (13 tracks, 44 min.) is a radical departure from the Raveonettes 2 previous releases. But is that such a bad thing? Well... it depends. If you are looking for more of the 'surfer-punk-rock' sound that the Raveonettes brought earlier, you will be mighty disappointed. Yet once you get over that, "Pretty in Black" has some great moments. Highlights include the current single "Love in a Trashcan", an irresistable hum-along, "My Boyfriend's Back" (with lead vocals from Sharin), and "Twilight". Most telling is "Ode to L.A.", with guest vocals from none other than the Ronettes' Ronnie Specter. Can the connection be any clearer? The R(ave)onettes! And that is how this album really feels... a disguised ode to the spirit of the Ronettes, and well done at that.  Sune Rose Wagner's obsession with the US era-late 50s is well documented, and it has never come across so much more than on this release. With "Pretty in Black" I don't know what it'll mean long-term for the Raveonettes, we'll just have to see. This is certainly not a bad album, but a such a radical departure from their previous sound. That said, the Raveonettes are coming to Cincinnati soon, and I know I don't wanna miss that!
