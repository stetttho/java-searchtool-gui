 If Over The Rhine had ever hopes of hitting it big, it was with "Eve', their third studio album, issued in 1994. Remember, this was the time "alternative" rock was ruling the nation, and with this album, OTR rode the alternative wave (while staying true to its own ingenious roots). The original line-up (Karen, Linford, Ric and Brian) had been playing together for 5 years by now, and really hit all cylinders on this one. The opener "Happy With Myself" was the radio-friendly track and hoped for "mass" exposure track. Great tunes follow one after another, including among others "Within Without", "Conjectures" (with Ric's awesome guitar licks), "Sleep Baby Jane" (still a concert fave after all these years), "Daddy Untwisted", the bluesy "My Love Is A Fever". Wow... what a collection! OTR was never better. On the (literal) "eve" of the album's release in August 1994, OTR gave a free concert at Cincinnati's Eden Park. I remember Karen urging everyone the go out and buy the album in the first week of release, in the hope of getting on the Billboard 200 chart. The hoped-for mass success didn't materialize, for whatever reason, but no matter. This is OTR's best studio album, period. "Films For Radio" comes close, but not quite. This is OTR in their classic line-up at their best. BUY IT!
