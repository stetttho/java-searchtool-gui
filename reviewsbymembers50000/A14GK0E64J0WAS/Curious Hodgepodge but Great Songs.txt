 "Sparks" is one of the better songs from Coldplay's debut album "Parachutes". It is issued here in combination with some other already-released songs in a curious hodgepodge, but the quality of the songs is never in doubt. "Careful Where You Stand" was originally issued on the "Shiver" single from "Parachutes". The song starts off with Chris Martin only on accoustic guitar, and gradually giving way to additional (yet sparse) instrumentation. Chris' lyrics are ever as sensitive (for example, "I Am Cured When I'm By Your Side"). "Yellow" comes in an accoustic version, from the same British TV show that has "Shiver (Accoustic)" on the "Trouble" single. The best song perhaps is "See You Soon", which originally appeard on "The Blue Room" EP in 1999. It's an absolute gem, with Chris solo on accoustic guitar. For good measure this release also has the "Yellow" video. I'm not sure whether this was ever intended as a commercial release or whether this is just a promo release, but either way it contains some great early-Coldplay songs. You won't be disappointed.
