 In early 1993, Depeche Mode released "Songs of Faith and Devotion", a superb album. The subsequent "Devotional" tour was probably DM's best ever. I happen to catch it several times. Then, at the year's tail end, the band releases this live album, making people everywhere scratch their heads, "huh"?  "Songs of Faith and Devotion Live" (10 tracks, 52 min.) brings the songs of the album live, in the exact same sequence of the album. Nothing more or less. Wow... As they were at their peak, DM for some incomprehensible reason decided not to release a representative album of the tour, including other fan favorites played on the tour such as "Halo", "The World in My Eyes", "Enjoy the Silence" etc. (all of which would wind up as B-sides of the many singles from "Faith and Devotion"). What were they thinking? There are nevertheless some great tunes on this album, such as "I Feel You" (with Alan Wilder on live drums), the gorgeous "Condemnation" and the biting "Get Right With Me". But most jarring, the traditional (and dramatic) tour opener, "Higher Love", is now the last track.  This live album, if memory serves me right, entered the Billboard 200 at the 199th position (!), and promptly dropped of the charts the next week. This album is one of the worst record-release decisions ever, no question about it. If you wanna see what DM live was really about in 1993, buy instead the just released "Devotional" live DVD, a much better, indeed a superb reflection of Depeche Mode at its peak.
