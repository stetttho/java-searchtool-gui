 Bob Marley's songs have been collected for "greatest hits" on 2 CDs: "Legend" and "Natural Mystic". While "Legend" contains more of the better known songs, I venture to say that "Natural Mystic" is the stronger compilation. The flaws on "Legend" are many, primarily a remixing of several songs that really tank that album, in my opinion. No such funny business on "Natural Mystic". From the opener title track, the album showcases Marley at his reggae best. Among the many highlights are a biting "Crazy Baldheads", one of Marley's best tracks ever (Marley was never shy to give social commentary in his songs, so well demonstrated here) "So Much Trouble In the World", "Africa Unite", "Sun is Shining" and "Roots, Rock, Reggae" (with the self-effacing lyrics "We're bubbling on the top 100, just like a mighty dread", haha!) To top things off, there is a rebel-rousing live version of "Trenchtown Rock", if that doesn't wanna make you get up and dance, nothing will! In all, 55 min, of Bob Marley's best songs. No, they may not be the best known songs found on "Legend", but this collection demonstrates Marley's genius better than "Legend". Buy it!
