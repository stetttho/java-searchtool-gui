 Coming on the heels of one good "deep space" album (the self-titled "Spacecraft") and one classic ("Hummel"), I had high expectations for more of the same. Alas, what a disappointment  then this album must be viewed as. "Earthtime Tapistry" is quite  different from "Hummel", with a much lighter sound, almost new  age-ish (argh!). No "deep space" here! While it still makes for a  pleasant listen (hence my rating of 3 stars), this album stands in the  shadow of the "Hummel" predecessor and cannot find a way out of  it.
