 Hard to believe, but it's been a good four years since the original release of Coldplay's debut album in the UK (the US release would follow in Nov. 2000), and as the phenom called Coldplay is getting bigger and bigger, it's now clear that "Parachutes" is a classic, in every sense of the word. By now, the original 10 tracks of the album all have become so instantly familiar, yet never tiresome. There is of course "Yellow", the US break-through single but for me probably the weakest track on the set. Check out instead "Shiver", "Don't Panic" (with the immortal line "We Live in a Beautiful World"), "Trouble" and Sparks", 4 other singles from the album (all of them still available on Amazon).   This import version of "Parachutes" (13 tracks, 49 min.) comes with 3 additional tracks on a separate CD: "Help is 'Round the Corner", which is a b-side from the "Yellow" single, and then also "Careful Where You Stand" and "For You", both of which are the b-sides from the "Shiver" single. All the bonus tracks are from around the same time as the "Parachutes" recording sessions, and are a great fit with the original tracks of the album.   Who knows whether the next Coldplay album (rumored for Sprong 2005) will be any good, but for sure it's gonna be a monster, and Coldplay is well on its way to be the next U2. Meanwhile, enjoy the humble and intimate debut album which I dare say Chris and the boys will never surpass.
