 Rating: 3 stars compared to Heartbreaker/Gold, 5 stars compared to most what's out there  Ryan Adams, the self-appointed 'savior of rock' has had a couple of rough years. After the excellent double whammy of the 2000 "Heartbreaker" and 2001 "Gold" albums, Ryan lost the pedals for a while (under pressure from his label), resulting in the dreadful "Rock'n'Roll" and the somewhat better "Love is Hell" albums (I'm leaving out the "Demolition Tapes" out-takes album). "Cold Roses" is supposed to be the return to the 'real' Ryan Adams sound.  "Cold Roses" (2 CDs, 18 tracks, 76 min.) indeed does mark a return to the alt-country sound of "Heartbreaker", but hey, guess what... it's just not nearly as good. Listening through the 18 tracks, they are pleasant, but... not really memorable. I have listened to this album a number of times, and honestly, I can't recall any of the tunes when I'm done listening to it. I know it's not fair, but compare this to "Heartbreaker", when every single tune grabbed you and was instantly memorable. Same (to a slightly lesser degree) with "Gold".   Interesting is that this album is credited to "Ryan Adam & the Cardinals". All the songs are also credited to the full band. I saw Ryan and his band perform some months ago here in Cincinnati, it was the weakest of all of his shows I have seen over the years. I don't know what Ryan needs to do to right the ship, but it definitely feels right now that Ryan hit his peak in 2000-2002, and that now he's just trying to recreate that. "Cold Roses" is a good attempt, but it falls short. Still, compared to the majority of the music on mainstream radio, this is a masterpiece of course.   PS Can someone tell me why this album is on 2 CDs when it would have easily fit on 1 CD? The wonders of the music industry...
