 People in Planes is another UK band that comes to the shores of the US with great music and among rising buzz. Musically, the band is Muse-meets-Readiohead-with occasional heavy guitars. After releasing an early single in 2005 and a great EP last Fall, the band has now released its debut album (which ironically is currently only available in the UK as an import!).  "As Far as the Eye Can See" (12 tracks, 56 min.) blasts off with, strangely, the least characteristic track of the album, a guitar-heavy "Barracuda", but then the band really fins a groove with the 1-2 punch of "For Miles Around (Scratch to Void"), inviting the Muse comparisons, and the first single "If You Talk Too Much (My Head Will Explode)". "Moth" and "Rush" (incidentally, 2 band names...) are 2 further highlights, the latter really bringing the Radiohead comparison to head (not the "Kid A" era). "My Black Widow" is another guitar heavy, but quite catchy song and I could see it as a single. The album lags just a bit in the last third, but the epic closer "Narcoleptic" is a great and fitting end.  This album is a very nice surprise, and surely one of the best releases of the year so far (along with Film School's self-titled album, check it out). People in Planes is coming to Cincinnati in a few weeks, and I can't wait to see how the songs from "As Far As the Eye Can See" translate in a live setting. Meanwhile, this album is highly recommended!
