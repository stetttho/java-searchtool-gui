 It's been taking Depeche Mode 4 years now to get us a new album since the early 90s, from 1993's "Songs of Faith and Devotion" to 1997's "Ultra" to 2001's "Exciter" to now "Playing the Angel". Other than the very disappointing "Exciter" album, they have been great albums. So how does "Playing the Angel" stack up?  "Playing the Angel" (12 tracks, 52 min.) is, thankfully, a LOT better than the less than exciting "Exciter", which is no doubt the weakest outing of Depeche Mode. The new album can easily be divided in 2 parts. The first half of the album is outstanding, and is a return to the soundscape of the 1990 album "Violator", DM's most popular album. First single "Precious" is a carbon copy in sound of "Enjoy the Silence" and the standout track of the album. "A Pain That I'm Used To" reminds me of "World in My Eyes". Lead vocalist David Gohan (coming of his 2003 solo album Paper Monsters) contributes 3 tracks, including the great "Suffer Me". I rate the first half of the album 4.5 stars. Unfortunately the second half is less enthralling and simply drags on too long, although it contains the great track "Lilian". I rate the second half of the album 3.5 stars.  Depeche Mode celebrates its 25th anniversary this year. Who could've imagined in 1980 that this band would be around for so long, and still be relevant? "Playing the Angel" is a nice album, no question about it. But for DM at its peak, check out "Violator" or "Songs of Faith and Devotion". That said, DM remains a superb live act, and if you have a chance to see them on the "Touring the Angel" tour, don't miss them!
