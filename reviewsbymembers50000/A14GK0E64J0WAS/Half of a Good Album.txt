 Not counting the soundtracks, "Underwater Sunlight", issued in 1986, is the very last TD studio album that could carry my interest. There are some interesting moments in here, which make it worthwhile. The essential song of the album is "Song of the Whale (Pts 1 and 2)", a 20 min exploration of the soundscapes underwater. Part 2 of the track, which starts with a gentle piano intro, eventually bursts into a soaring synth solo for which the album is best known. The remaining 20 min. of the album are evenly spread over 4 tracks, sounding very much like "Le Parc II". "Scuba Scuba" is the best of the lot, with a mesmorizing percussion. Tangerine Dream of the "Underwater Sunlight" period is a gentler, "lighter" TD than what I came to enjoy. The melodies are pleasing to the ears, but perhaps too easily pleasing for my taste, if you know what I mean. Consider this: a mere 2 years before this album, TD issued "Poland", their last truly great album. How quickly it all changed! This is not a bad album, but certainly not a great on either, considering the legacy TD carries with it.
