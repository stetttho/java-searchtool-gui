 The Strokes came on the music scene ablazing with 2001's "Is This It", one of those perfect "once-in-a-blue-moon" debut albums. 2003's "Room on Fire" was a far too predictable sequel to "Is This" and thus a disappointment, while pleasant in its own right at times. But it was clear that the Strokes needed to expand their musical pallet. And that, they have!  "First Impressions of Earth" (14 tracks; 52 min.--and that's not a typo!) feels like the first really full album of the Strokes, and not just because of the length of it. Singer-songwriter Julian Casablancas is not rushing songs, instead taking the time to let them blossom musically. I divide the album in 2 halves: songs 1-7 and 8-14. While many feel that the stronger songs appear on the first half, I actually feel differently. Not that the first half is weak. Songs like "You Only Live Once", "Heart in a Cage", "Razorblade" (with the eye-wink to Barry Manilow's Mandy!) and "On the Other Side" are great songs. "Ask Me Anything" is a curiosity: just Julian and orchestral instrumentation, if you can believe that. But then the album really takes off: "Electricityscape" blasts through your speakers with urgency, and you just want to play it again and again. Same with "Ize of the World", the other truly outstanding track on here. "Fear of Sleep", "Killing Lies" and "Evening Sun" are almost as perfect too. Wow!  If you came looking for a third serving of "Is This It", there is no question you will find this a difficult, if not disappointing, album. I, on the other hand, am excited that the Strokes have matured and expanded musically. "First Impressions of Earth" is a tremedous, almost epical, musical statement. The Strokes have thrown the gaunlet down early for the best album of 2006. It'll be interesting to see who, if anyone, can respond to the challenge...
