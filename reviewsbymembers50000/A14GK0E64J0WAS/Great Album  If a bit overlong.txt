 The Jayhawks 7th studio album finds a return to their earliest efforts, a beautiful blend of folk/country/roots music. It is one of the best albums so far in 2003, but shy of what could've been a classic, in part due to its overlong second half. (The album has 14 tracks, clocking in at 50 min.) The first 6 songs are impecabble. The opening sounds of "Stumbling Through the Dark" reminded me of the Byrds, or CSNY. "Tailspin" and "Save it for a Rainy Day" find Gary Louris in top notch form. "Eyes of Sarahjane" reminded me of Ryan Adams, and surely producer Ethan Johns (who has produced Adams' Heartbreaker and Gold albums) has something to do with it. The album starts to drag a bit in the second half. "Tamps to Tulsa" and "Will I See You in Heaven" (tracks not written by Louris) are below par. Nevertheless, this album is a breath of fresh air in today's music scene. Strongly recommended.
