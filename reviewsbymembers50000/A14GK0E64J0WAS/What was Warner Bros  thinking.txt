 By now the tale is well known... Warner Bros. in 2001 rejected the album for not being a commercial enough follow-up to the great "Summer Teeth", leading Wilco to a long road that finally saw the release of "Yankee Hotel Foxtrot" in 2002 on Nonesuch. What was Warner Bros. thinking? "Yankee Hotel Foxtrot" is the best Wilco album to date, bar none (yes, even surpassing "Being There"). The album is, simply put, just flawless, and easily one of the very best albums to come out so far in 2002. From the beginning of "I am trying to break your heart", Jeff Tweedy (Wilco's principal songwriter) takes us on a journey of America, and American music at its best. "Kamera" and "War on War" stand out for their upbeat, accoustic guitar-driven sound, but the sound tweaking is what drives this album (check out the intro of "I am trying" and the outro of "Ashes of American Flags", reminiscent of Radiohead era-Kid A.... just beautiful!  Seven years since their debut album, Wilco seems to get better and better. Can't wait for the next album, but meanwhile enjoy YHF, alt-rock doesnt get much better than this!
