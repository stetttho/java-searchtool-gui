 I admit I had never heard of The French Kicks, but I saw these guys live recently and they blew me away. I purchased "One Time Bells" on the spot. The album is now a year old, and I venture to say that while the album is good, the live act is better, presumably due to extensive touring. Live they sound very tight, and boy, do they rock! The band is compared to The Strokes, and to a degree, the comparison is fair. Songs like "Right In Time" and "Crying Just for Show" show a band with instantly likeable guitar licks and a tight sound. Other great tracks include "Trying Whining", "Close to Modern", the title track, and the bonus track "Piano". At the show, the band played a couple of new songs, which sounded just great. It makes me look forward to the next album. The Strokes they are not, but they have a lot of potential.
