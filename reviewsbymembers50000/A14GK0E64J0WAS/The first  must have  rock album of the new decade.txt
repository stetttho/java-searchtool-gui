 After hearing and reading about Travis for all these months, it is quite astonishing that when I bought "The Man Who", it actually still  met my high expectations, and then some. I knew that Travis is an Oasis  fave, and with the opening sounds of "Writing To Reach You",  Travis sounds just like you-know-who (the references to  "Wonderwall" in the song make it all the more obvious). However,  after this song Travis settles down and takes us on an unforgettable  journey. There's not a bad track on this album, but check out in particular  the haunting "She's So Strange", the blistering "Blue  Flashing Light" (with which Travis closed their show on the recently  concluded US tour with Oasis), and the gentle, almost  "sing-along" songs Why Does It Always Rain on Me, Driftwood, and  Turn (all hit singles in the UK). This album remains in the very top of the  UK charts after almost a year, and it's easy to see why. Now if only the US  public at large can be convinced. In summary, a "must have" album  and much more than that.... (As an aside, I had the fortune of catching the  Oasis/Travis tour, and while I still love and appreciate the Noel/Liam  show, Travis easily stole the show. If you have the opportunity to see  Travis in concert, do not hesitate! )
