 Actually, this is the marriage of "OK Computer"  and "Kid A", and the results are very satisfying. After the (for me) disappointing "Amnesiac", Radiohead finds a balance between "experimenting" and "rocking out". Case in point: "Sit  Down, Stand Up", which a few years ago might have lingered in (and ending in) the experimental but now finds Radiohead rocking out eventually. The album is helped tremendously by a sense of cohesion, lacking severally in "Amnensiac". Tracks flow great from one into another. Stand-out tunes for me are "Where I End and You Begin" (the best track by far), "There There" (the 1st single), "Sail to the Moon" (an aching beautiful "ballad"), "Backdriffs" (great electronic, yet rocking tune). Keeping the CD from top rating are a couple of dreadful songs, foremost "We Suck Young Blood". Also, the album rambles on towards the end, and is too long (56 min.) Radiohead remains one of the top bands around, and one of the reasons I get excited about new releases. I hope it won't take another 3 years before they release a new album.
