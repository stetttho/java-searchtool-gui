 I had no intention to buy this book, but when I saw this at my local library last week, I couldn't resist picking it up. We've all heard about or seen the recent congressional hearings involving the issue of steroids in baseball. Who can forget Mark McGuire's sad "I'm not here to talk about the past" statement, over and over again?  "Juiced" is Jose Canseco's autobiography and the thing that grabbed me was not that this was an apology, but rather a plea (!) for the use of steroids. Early in the book, Canseco writes "Yea, you heard me right: steroids, when used correctly, will not only make you stronger and sexier, they will make you healthier". Wow, you gotta have guts to write that. That said, Canseco has an ego bigger than his biceps. He claims to have "single-handedly changed the game of baseball by introducing [steroids] into the game". Urr, sure. The book is an easy read, with lots of fluff (such as Canseco's short semi-involvement with Madonna), the pages just fly by.  The merit of the book is not the book itself. Rather, I am glad that this brought the issue of steroids in baseball to the forefront. It is ridiculous, looking back, how some of baseball's long treasured records have been blemished by steroids. Here's hoping that something will be done about that once and for all...
