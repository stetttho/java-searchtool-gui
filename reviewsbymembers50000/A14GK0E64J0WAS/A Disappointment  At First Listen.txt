 On the heels of last year's excellent "Dosage", the Georgia band comes back with "Blender", a collection of 11 tightly scripted songs (all clock in between 3'10 and 3'50, the entire CD comes in under 40 min.) The set starts off with 3 rompers, including the opener "Skin" and, even better, "Why Pt 2". Other notable songs include track 4, the beautiful ballet "Ten Years Later" and track 8, the up-tempo "Perfect Day", with Elton John on piano and sharing lead-vocals with Ed Roland. After that it is a very mixed bag. Overall, this collection less inspired than previous outings, clearly suffering by comparison to 1995's "Collective Soul" (still their best album to date) and last year's "Dosage". Perhaps the album will grow on me with repeated listening. At this point in their career, Collective Soul might have benefitted from a live album, to document their exciting stage efforts. Instead, we are treated to "Blender", which contains too many uneven moments and sounds a bit "bland" for me.
