 "Babylon by Bus" was, when originally issued in 1978, the second official live album by Bob Marley (1975's "Live" being the first). "Live" of course is best known for the definitive version of "No Woman No Cry", but I will go out on a limb here, and suggest that "Babylon by Bus" is not only better than "Live", but one of the best live albums, ever. Things immediately kick off with a blaze with "Rastaman Vibration", and the party never stops from there. Bob's backup band and singers are in top form througout. Highlights are many, including "Punky Reggae Party", "Rate Race" (surprisingly, perhaps, a tune written by Rita Marley, Bob's wife), "Concrete Jungle" and "Rebel Music". It also contains the better known "Is This Love" and "Jamming". If there is one Bob Marley I would recommend to anyone, this is clearly the one. Furthermore, at 73 min. (originally a double vinyl album), this is the best bang-for-the-buck Marley album. Essential in anyone's CD collection.
