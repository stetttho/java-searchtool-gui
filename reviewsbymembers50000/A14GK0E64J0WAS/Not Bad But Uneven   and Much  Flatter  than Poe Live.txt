 I bought Poe's debut album (which in the meantime is 6+ years old!) only after seeing her in concert recently. I knew Poe only from the singles "Hello" (which I liked very much) and "Angry Johnny" (which is ok), and so while I had some idea what to expect live, I was very (pleasantly) surprised with what I heard: a heavy and full sound, driven by a fat bass guitar (somewhat reminiscent of the Tori Amos sound during her "5 1/2 Weeks Tour" in 1999).  Poe played most of the songs of the Hello CD at the concert, reason I bought the CD. I am sorry to report that the CD is somewhat of a disappointment. The title track sounds great, but many of the other songs simply sound thin and flat ("Dolphin" and "Beautiful Girl" are good examples. This does not take away from the fact that Poe brings a different perspective to the ups and downs of relationships, that is IF you can stand some biting sarcasm along the way. Meanwhile I've heard some songs from Poe's "Haunted" album, and despite the flaws on the "Hello" album, will probably end up buying that one as well. In sum, not a bad album, but so much better live!!
