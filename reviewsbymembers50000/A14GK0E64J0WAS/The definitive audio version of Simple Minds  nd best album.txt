 If you have, like me, the vinyl album and the CD, the only question is: is it worth shelling out $.. for this remastered version? The answer is: go take your old CD to the used-CD store and sell/trade it in, and order this remastered version immediately! The sound quality is amazing, to hear gems like "White Hot Day", "C Moon Cry Like a Baby" and "The Kick Inside" is amazing, it's like rediscovering a long lost treasure. Warning: this is a Limited Edition, which is not a jewel-case CD but a replica of the old vinyl with the inner-sleeve jacket (no lyrics), which I don't find particularly handy, but no matter. For those casually perusing Simple Minds: "Sparkle in the Rain" is the follow-up to Simple Minds' best album ("New Gold Dream"--see my review there), and just before they hit it big in the US with "Dont You Forget About Me". But Simple Minds is so much more than that "one-hit wonder" (in the US anyway). It rocks harder than "New Gold Dream", and contains the European hits "Up On the Catwalk", "Speed Your Love to Me" and "Waterfront". You cannot go wrong with this one.
