 This is the second single of Travis' "The Invisible Band" CD.  The single is actually 2 separate singles. The one I bought is CD2, which consists of 3 tracks and runs 12 min. "Side" is itself one of the best tracks of the album, no surprise it was picked to be a single. The additional tracks, though, is what makes this worth buying. First there is Travis' take on Bob Dylan's "You're A Big Girl Now", a faithful take on the original, but bringing with it a unique take only Fran can give us. It reminded me of the band's superb version of The Band's "The Weight". After that comes "Ancient Train", a quirky little tune, somehow blending in beautifully with the rest of this single. (CD1 of the single comes with live versions of "Driftwood" and "All The Young Dudes", a concert staple in recent tours.) Bottom line: if you like Travis, you will love this single. BUY IT
