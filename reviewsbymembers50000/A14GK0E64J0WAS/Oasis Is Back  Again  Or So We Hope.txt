 Oasis hit the music scene in 1994 with the incredible debut album "Definitely Maybe". Only 8 years later, the forthcoming album "Heathen Chemistry" is, if I can keep track, touted as their second "come-back" album, after 2000's "Standing on the Shoulder of Giants", viewed by many as a failure but in my book an album with some of their greatest tunes ("Who Feels Love", "Gas Panic!") But I digress... This is the first single of the forth-coming album. "The Hindu Times" is a hard rocking song, reminiscent of the sound on the debut album, and where the title of the song comes from, I have no idea (it is not part of the lyrics). But a great tune, for sure. The "B" sides are both Noel-penned and sung tunes: "Just Getting Older" finds Noel worrying whether he's "cracking up or just getting older" (hint to Noel: yes are are getting older!), and "Idler's Dream", a beautiful piano-based ballad. I'm looking forward to the new album, out in July, to see whether Oasis is really, truly back in the saddle. Stay tuned.
