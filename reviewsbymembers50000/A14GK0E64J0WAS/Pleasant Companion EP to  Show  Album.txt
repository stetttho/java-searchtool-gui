 In 1993 the Cure issued "Show", essentially a "greatest hits live" album. This EP runs 5 tracks, 19 min. and covers 4 tracks not on the "Show" album. The initial track is "Tape (Intro)", a 3 min. instrumental that is not "live", not sure where it fits in with the "Show" to be honest. "Just Like Heaven" is the only overlap with "Show", and meant to be the "single" off of "Show", it's a great song. The remaining tracks are from the same Auburn Hills, MI show that produced the "Show" album, but are not on that album. "Fascination Street" has been a concert staple of the Cure ever since it came out on "Disintegration" and shows up here in great form. "The Walk" and "Let's Go to Bed" are familiar tunes, and should've been on "Show" but presumably left off due to CD length restrictions. Great tunes, though, and they showcase the Cure in great form live. All in all, a great EP.
