 Music: 5 stars;    Economic Value: 1 Star Not counting the Anthology albums in the 90's (which are not hit compilations anyway), the Beatles have in the last 30 years been compiled only once, on 2000's "1", an excellent overview for what it is, their best known and biggest hits. The 1973 "Red" and "Blue" compilations remain in print, and I guess are still selling. While the "Blue" 1967-1970 compilation justifies its continued availibility on 2 CDs, one really has to question why the "Red" 1962-1966 compilation does. "The Beatles 1962-1966" (26 tracks) clocks in at 62 min., way below the capacity of a single CD, yet remains on the shelf as 2 CDs (along with a heftly $31 retail price). This is nothing short of ripping off the buying public, in my opinion. The reason given by the label management is "to keep the integruity of the original vinyl issue", but is anyone really buying this? Shame on them! The music on the "Red" album is of course stellar, that's not the point. Maybe it's too soon yet after the "1" compilation, but hasn't the time come for a definitve 2CD compilation of the Beatles, along the lines of, say, "The Essential Bob Dylan", maximising the capability of 80 min. of a CD?
