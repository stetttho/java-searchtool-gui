 It took K's Choice 3 years to follow up their magnificant break-through album "Paradise In Me" (see my review there). After the alternative rock single smash of "Not an Addict", K's Choice came  through with another great album, which unfortunately for them did not  contain the instant radio-friendly song or hook as "Not An  Addict", and hence the lack of appreciation in the US. Yet,  "Cocoon Crash" merits attention as the band has matured and  brings great songs such as "Believe" (a great tune which I think  should have been the lead-off single), "Everything For Free" (the  song pitched as the lead-off single and somehow was hoped to be the next  break-through single, but failing to do so), "20,000 seconds",  and "Cocoon Crash". Overall, a very satisfying album, but not  quite as strong as "Paradise In Me". Belgium's best rock band at  this point has a lot to offer, but will US audiences find them? One final  thought, if you have a chance to catch them in concert, don't hesitate! K's  Choice puts on a great, no-gimmicks rock show everytime I've seen them.
