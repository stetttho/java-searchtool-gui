 Filmed last July at Dayton's Fraze Pavilion, I was there so I just had to buy it, if nothing else as a souvenir of the concert. Surpirse then, but as it turns out this DVD is actually very good.  "Sheryl Crow C'Mon America 2003" (21 tracks; 125 min.) stands as the definitive "greatest hits live" collection of Sheryl Crow: "My Favorite Mistake", "If It Makes You Happy", "Leaving Las Vegas", "Strong Enough" "All I Wanna Do", "Everyday Is a Winding Road", and also the most recent hits "Soak Up the Sun", "Steve McQueen", "You're an Original" and even "The First Cut Is the Deepest" (rock version, thankfully--the country version can be heard as the after-concert fade-out), it's all here. Last but not least there is a blazing cover of Led Zep's "Rock and Roll", an appropriate show closer. Sheryl's back-up band is in top form throughout.  Ultimately, this live collection is much better than 1999's "Sheryl Crow and Friends: Live at Central Park" CD, which was marred by too many "friends" appearances. The focus here is on Sheryl, and that works just fine. The DVD does contain some in-between banter from Sheryl, but otherwise does not contain any "extras".
