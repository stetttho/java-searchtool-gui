 The White Stripes cap off another successful year with the December '05 release of this E.P., which contains some interesting live bonus tracks.  "Walking With a Ghost" (5 tracks, 19 min.) starts off with a sweet shout-out to Tegan & Sara, covering their "Walking With a Ghost" from their 2004 album "So Jealous". But the real meat on this E.P. are the 4 live tracks. Tracks 3 and 4 are radio in-studio live versions of "As Ugly As I Am" and a rousing "The Denial Twist" from the "Get Behing Me" album. "Same Boy You've Always Known" is a Jack-only accoustic take on the "White Blood Cells" track. The best is saved from last: a 5+ min. "Screwdriver" that showcases why the White Stripes are such an exciting live act. Jack and Meg are on the top of their game on this track, just great.  This E.P. is not "essential" in the White Stripes catalogue, but I look at it as a nice end-of-the-year gift to WS fans. While I'm not always sold on the WS albums, I have seen them live in 2005, and they surely are one of the most rousing live acts around, and this E.P. does justice to that.
