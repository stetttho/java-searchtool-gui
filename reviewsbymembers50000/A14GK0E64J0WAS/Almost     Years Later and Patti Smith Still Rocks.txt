 I will readily admit that I have not heard much of the latter day (i.e. post-1988) work of Patti Smith, although the buzz on her last album, 2000's "Gung Ho" was quite good. Out of curiosity I picked up this album, and I must say I was shocked how good this CD is.  "Trampin'" (11 tracks, 63 min.) is Patti Smith's 9th studio album. But in sound and spirit, it is a sequel to her debut album "Horses" from 1975. Not surprisingly, there are some heavy political undertones to this album. Musically, there are no weak tracks here. The songs can essentially be divided in 2 groups: the "rockers" and the "ballads". Among the former, the monumental "Gandhi" (9+ min.) and "Radio Baghdad" (12+ min.) are standouts. Among the latter, the title track (featuring Patti's daughter on piano), and "Trespasses" are the best. Patti's band, including long time guitaris Lenny Kaye, sound tight throughout.  I cannot emphasize enough how much this album took me by surprise. Patti Smith has been around for a long, long time but clearly she still has some things on her mind, and finds a way to write strong new songs. One negative about the CD is that there is virtually no information about the album in the CD case. I literally had to look hard to even find the song titles (forget about hoping for the lyrics of songs!). That aside, this album is strongly recommended!
