 In the 3+ years since "Ophelia", Natalie seemingly has been busy listening to new sounds, and chose to explore herself how it would translate into her familiar lyrical themes of love, regret, environmental concerns, etc. The result is "Motherland", a beautiful album which I suspect will not be readily accesible to many, but has so much to offer. Arguably the best track on the album is the opener "This House Is On Fire". Could you have imagined Natalie doing a reggae-based track on "Ophelia" or "Tigelily"? Well, here she does, waking up the neighborhood with the line "This house is on fire!/Kick off your boots, come and sit a spell/Listen to me worry, come and listen well". The reaggae sounds are supplemented by oriental sounds. It is one of the best songs Natalie has ever written. The title track "Motherland" (with Van Dyke Parks on accordion!) goes to more familiar musical territory, with Natalie shaming urban crawl. Other standout tracks include "Henry Darger" (with lush orchestration), the accoustic guitar-driven "Tell Yourself" (reminiscent of the 10,000 Maniacs sound), and the closing track "I'm Not Gonna Beg You" (a hauntingly vulnerable Natalie, singing "Scared now, what are you scared of?/Afraid I might fall on my knees and break down?/I'm not gonna beg you for nothing/I'm not gonna beg you for your love"...wow!) The first single "Just Can't Last" is perhaps the least imaginative track on the album, sounding like a rehash of "Kind and Generous". "Motherland" is a very rich album, both musically and substantively. As usual with Natalie, this is not the type of album for anyone in a hurry. Take your time and enjoy.
