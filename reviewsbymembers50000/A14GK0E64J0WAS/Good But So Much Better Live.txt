 I happen to catch The Album Leaf open for Sigur Ros recently, and was blown away by what I heard. I bought the CD on the spot. The album is quite good. Running at 60 min., there is a lot of pick and choose. The key track is "The Audio Pool", a really superb interplay between Jimmy Lavalle's heyboards and the drums supporting his vision. The 35 min. opening act I saw was full of energy I do not always detect on the album. The guitar noodlings on, for example, "Hang Over" I can do without. The album is strongest when there is a real "band" feel to it, even though Jimmy pretty much recorded this by himself. Bottom line: this is a good album, but if you have a chance to catch Album Leaf live, go see them!
