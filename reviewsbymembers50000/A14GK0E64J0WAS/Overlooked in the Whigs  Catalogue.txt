 "Uptown Avondale" is the last of the Whigs' releases on Sub Pop, and while somewhat of an oddity compared to the rest of their albums, it nevertheless is a great addition, and generally overlooked. "Uptown Avondale" (5 tracks, 21 min.) contains 4 R&B covers and one Greg Dulli song. The best covers here are Freda Payne's "Band of Gold" and the Supremes' "Come See About Me". If you didn't think that grunge-meets-motown can sound gorgeous, the Whigs prove it right here. The only Dulli tune is the 6 min. "Rebirth of the Cool", which made me think of the Stone Roses' "Fool's Gold", another classic song. This EP may not be "essential" in the Whigs' catalogue, but it contains some really great songs. BUY IT! (Incidentally, in case you wonder about the title of the EP, "Uptown Avondale" refers to a neighborhood in Cincinnati, which of course was the home base of the Whigs for most of their 15 or so years.)
