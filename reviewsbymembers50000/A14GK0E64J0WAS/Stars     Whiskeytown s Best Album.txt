 It's hard to believe that Ryan Adams ("David Ryan Adams", according to the liner notes) was only 22 when this album was recorded, the second of Whiskeytown's short career. While debut album "Faithless Street" found the band (and main writer Ryan) still looking for solid footing, the band hits all cylinders here. Ryan wrote most songs by himself, with Caitlin Cary or Phil Wandscher pitching in on the other tracks. "Strangers Almanac" (13 tracks, 51 min.) is true to Whiskeytown's country/alt-country roots, with a tip o' the old hat to Uncle Topelo, among others. Highlights include "Excuse While I Break My Own Heart", with Caitlin Cary's violin upfront in the mix, "16 Days" (a minor hit on country radio, actually), "Houses on the Hill", the electric "Waiting to Derail", and the closer "Not Home Anymore", which sounds more "pop" than country or rock. While I find the production at times lacking, there is no doubt that musically, this album is the best album of Whiskeytown, and as such it is highly recommended for any Ryan Adams or Caitlin Cary fan, or for that matter for anyone into alt-country.
