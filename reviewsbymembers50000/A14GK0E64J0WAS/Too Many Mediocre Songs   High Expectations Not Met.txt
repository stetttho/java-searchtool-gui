 In a way, "Heathen Chemistry", Oasis' 5th studio album (not counting the superb "The Masterplan" compilation of B sides), is undone by the great single "The Hindu Times", released 3 months ago, and creating great expectations. I ended my review of the single by writing that this album would confirm if Oasis is "really, truly back in the saddle". We have the answer now, and regretfully it is a clear "no". "Heathen Chemistry" is book-ended with high-energy tracks "Hindu Times" (to start) and "Better Man" (to end). The 9 tracks in between are a very mixed bag, with simply too much mediocrity, certainly compared to the "Definitely Maybe" and "Morning Glory" albums. Surprisingly, Liam contributes 3 good tracks, the sweet "Songbird", the epic "Born on a Different Cloud" and the earlier-mentioned "Better Man". Gem Archer and Andy Bell each contribute one song, both just filler. So what is the problem with Noel? He contributes a mere 6 songs, none of which are truly classic, the exception being "Hindu Times". Could it be that his muse simply has left him? In the years 1994-1996, great songs came out of Noel like water out of a faucet. Can somebody turn his inspiration on again? This is not a bad album, but it's certainly not a great album, not better than "Standing on the Shoulder". Anyone new to Oasis should not buy this album, but instead stick with "Definitely Maybe" and "Morning Glory". For the dedicated Oasis fan, this is a necessary but disappointing addition to the catalogue. PS there is a "hidden" track, 30 min. after "Better Man", a 4 min. lazy instrumental that begs the question... why?
