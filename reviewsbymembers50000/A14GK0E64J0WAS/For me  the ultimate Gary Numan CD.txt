 The reason this is the ultimate Gary Numan DC for me, is because I was at the concert: September 28, 1979, Hammersmith Odeon, London. I was a 19 yr. old kid then, hanging out in London for a few days with my best friend, as we did every year because London was the ultimate for us then. We couldn't believe our luck when we saw Gary Numan was playing the famed Hammersmith Odeon. We decided to check it out, of course it was sold out, but we managed to scalp to 2 tickets in the nose-bleed scetion. We didn't care. We were there! (Incidentally, Orchestral Manoeuvres In The Dark was the opener, before they hit it big.) When Numan hit the stage, we saw a never-to-be-forgotten stage spectacle (check out the CD cover pic to get an idea). Bombastic was the word! Numan was at the peak of his popularity, touring behind "The Pleasure Principle" that hit Number 1 in England. I had the "Living Ornaments 79" album on vinyl, and it's amazing to me it's still around after all these years, and available on CD. (Beware, stay away from the companion album "Living Ornaments 81" which is compared to this a mediocre live album.) All the fans' choice cuts are here in their glory: "Cars" of course (which I've always found to be one of the weakest tracks on "The Pleasure Principle"), the sweeping "Conversation", as well as "Are 'Friends' Electric?"and many others. The best tracks, however, are "Bombers" and the cover "On Broadway" which Numan reworks after the familiar lines and truly soars. It's been 22 years, but Numan's music as captured on this CD has aged very well. If you like Numan, you'll find him at his peak here. Buy it!
