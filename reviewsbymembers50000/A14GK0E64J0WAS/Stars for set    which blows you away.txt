 Phish continues its "Live" series with this set from a show in July, 1994 from Dallas. "Live 18" (3 CDs, 186 min.) is remarkable for set 2 of the show, and a treasure for any Phish fan.  CD1 (70 min.) is OK, but nothing remarkable as such, except for a great "Split Open and Melt". But CD2 (78 min.) is really where it's at. After a tentative "Loving Cup" and "Sparkle", the band gets grooving into a 70 min. long jam that is as good as Phish ever gets, starting with a terrific 25+ min. "Tweezer" that jams just terrific. According to Mike Gordon's liner notes, "we decided to jam the whole (2nd) set... all songs connected... song list abandoned", and it shows, with great tongue-in-cheek covers of, among others, The Who's "Sparks" and Prince's "Purple Rain", you can just feel the band having fun and rocking out. "Tweezer" shows up a few more times in various forms, bookending the set. CD3 (38 min.) contains (besides the encores) a great 22 min. instrumental jam from a November, 94 show in Missouri.  The "Live" collection contains many great shows, but "Live 18" is one of the stand-outs, as Set 2 is Phish is as great as you'll find them anywhere. Highly recommended!
