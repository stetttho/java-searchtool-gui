 (Music: 1 star. Historical Value: 5 stars) Imagine a rock star/group issuing a totaly unlistenable album at the height of his/her/its commercial peak. It's unthinkable and has never been done EVER, except by Lou Reed. After scoring big with the "Transformer" (1972), "Berlin" (1973) and "Sally Can't Dance" (1974) albums, Reed came back with the (then double-vinyl) album "Metal Machine Music (An Electronic Instrumental Composition)", a 64 min. oddisey of guitar-whaling, feedback cacophony. It dropped jaws in the music biz then,,, and now. Reed himself said that "Anyone getting to Side 4 is dumber than me". No, I don't play this album often. And when I do, it's for a 5 min. or so, just making me shake my head... what was Lou Reed thinking? Reed has been very silent over the years about the reasons for doing it. What we are left with is this reissue, which comes with nice liner notes. Not a must in anyone's CD collection, except to own a little piece of rock's history.
