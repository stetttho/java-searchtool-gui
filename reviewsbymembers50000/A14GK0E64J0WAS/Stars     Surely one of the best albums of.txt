 The Von Bondies found themselves some notoriety when frontman Jason Stollsteimer got suckerpunched (literally) last Fall by The White Stripes' Jack White, who incidentally produced the Bondies' debut album "Lack of Communication" in 2001. I hope that will not distract attention from the Bondies' excellent second album. "Pawn Shoppe Heart" (12 tracks, plus "hidden" track, 40 min.) is nothing short of brilliant. The opening track "No Regrets" shows the way, rocking all out, as does "Broken Man". "C'mon C'mon" is the irresistable single, just brilliant. Other standout tracks include "Not That Social", with Carrie on lead vocals. "Mairead" and "Right of Way" shows the bluesy side of the band, reminding me of Led Zep's hard blues songs. Don't miss the "hidden" track, the cover "Try a Little Tenderness", showing up some 3 min. after the last song, it just thunders! This surely is one of the best albums of 2004 so far! And if you have a chance to see the Bondies live, don't miss them! I caught them on their current tour, and they raised the roof, playing many of the "Pawn" tracks but also throwing in some nuggets from their debut album. A terrific show, period.
