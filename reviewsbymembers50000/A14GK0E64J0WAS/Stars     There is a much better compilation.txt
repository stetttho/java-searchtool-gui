 Jean-Michel Jarre was an immediate superstar in Europe with the release of his debut album "Oxygene" in 1977. Since then he has made a lot of albums, some great, some not so.  "Images" (20 tracks; 78 min., released in 1997) is what I would call a "politically correct" overview of his work. It covers all the phases of his work, and that is the drawback for me. Too many tracks of his later not-so-relevant CDs are included. There are only 6 tracks of his earliest, most famous and beloved albums on here. Beware, it does not have any tracks from Jarre's great "come-back" album "Oxygene 7-13", which came out shortly after "Images".  A much better compilation is "The Essential Jean-Michel Jarre" (14 tracks, 50 min., released in 1983 (and out of print), not to be confused with the similar titled 2005 release), which I had as a vinyl when it came out in 83 and which I stumbled upon the other day at the used bin of my local independent CD store. I couldn't believe my luck! It has the best tracks of his then 3 albums to date (Oxygene, Equinoxe, The China Concerts) and it is candy to the ears from beginning to the end. Check it out. If you see it by chance, grab it! I rate this 4.5 stars.
