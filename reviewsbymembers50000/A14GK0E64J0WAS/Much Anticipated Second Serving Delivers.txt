 The pre-release buzz of Turin Brakes' second album was that it would be (a lot) more electric-sounding than their debut "The Optimist". There is some truth to that, but overall "Ether Song" is a logical follow-up, staying close in spirit to "The Optimist". The album gently slides from one song to the next, and creates its own pace and mood. Best tracks include the opener "Blue Hour", "Self Help" (one of the few songs where the electric guitar does come to the forefront), "Falling Down", "Summer Rain" (which could be a great summertime singalong single), and "Little Brother", the "rockiest" track on the album. I bought the "limited edition" version, which comes with a 2nd CD of 4 songs, all demos with one non-album track, "Brightest Golden Lights", quite good. I doubt that Truin Brakes will find a big audience in the US, but whose loss is that? This is a really nice album and anyone looking for more "good" UK import music will not be disappointed.
