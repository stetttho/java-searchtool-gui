 Paul McCartney hit a writer's goldmine when recording the 1993 "Off the Ground" album. In addition to the album's 12 tracks, he recorded as many B-sides, which are featured on the 4 singles from the album.  "C'Mon People" (4 tracks, 19 min,) is the 3rd single from "Off the Ground". The title track is a somewhat shortened version (5'45" instead of the 7+ min. album track) but it retains its strength, a great song, reminding me of "Hey Jude". "I Can't Imagine" is a nice mid-tempo song that would've fitted nicely onto the album. "Keep Coming Back to Love" is a jazzied/R&B tune, and works quite well. "Down to the River" is a county-flavored tune, not unlike, say, "I Lie Around".  This single is not as essential as the "Hope of Deliverance" and "Off the Ground" singles, but still quite nice, and of course a necessary addition to any Macca completist.
