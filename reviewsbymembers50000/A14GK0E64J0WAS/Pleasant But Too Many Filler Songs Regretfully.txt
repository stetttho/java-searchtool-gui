 Sixpence finally see its long delayed (due to label implosion and other contractual issues) sequel to the hugely sucessfully 1997 self-titled album. I am a long-time 6pence fan and it regrets me to inform you that, after repeated listenings, "Divine Discontent" doesn't measure up. The album starts off very promisingly. The opener (and first single) "Breathe Your Name" is a classic 6pence sounding tune. Even better is track 2 (and 2nd single) "Tonight", which finds Matt Slocum (the band's main writer) at top form. After that the really good tunes are far and few between: "Waiting on the Sun" is beautifully reflective; "Paralysed" finds 6pence rocking out great; "I've Been Waiting" is a nice balad. However, there are way too many filler tracks. Among them, the cover of the classic Crowded House track "Don't Dream It's Over" simply misses the mark and sounds uninspired. What this album is missing is an overall coherency which made the 1997 album so great. I don't know whether it is caused by the long lay-off between albums. Fab drummer Dale Baker (who still appears on several tracks) has left the band, unfortunately. He was a great musical influence, and his departure shows. Only time will tell whether 6pence can regain their musical peak. Hopefully it will not be another 5 years before their next album comes out.
