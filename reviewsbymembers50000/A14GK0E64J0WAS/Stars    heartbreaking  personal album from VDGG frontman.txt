 Peter Hammill was a busy man in the mid-to-late 70s. Van Der Graaf Generator, the prog-music band he headed, was in the middle of its famous "second phase", and its critical and commercial heydays.  "Over" (8 tracks, 46 min.) was released in 1977, and recorded in a 2 week period. It captures Peter Hammill's feelings following a recent hard-to-take relationship break-up. The opening track "Crying Wolf" throws down the gauntlet, a musically agressive track that would have fitted nicely on any Phase 2 VDGG album, yet showing clear bitter feelings about what has gone wrong. Many of the following tracks are much more mellow, introspect, even sad (and clearly make this a solo album, not some VDGG-clone), check out "Autumn" and "This Side of the Looking Glass", with orchestral instrumentation, or the epic 8+ min. "Time Heals" (the title speaks for itself). The closing track "Lost and Found" thankfully ends this dark and emotional album on an up note.  I have loved this album for almost 30 years, and it still resonates with me as much today as it did when it came out in 1977. For another such bare and personal album that really works well (even if musically it is totally different), check out Over the Rhine's 2005 release "Drunkard's Prayer".
