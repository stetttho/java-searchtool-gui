 To say that I did not like "White Blood Cells" would be an understatement. Yes, there were a couple of songs that I liked, including of course "Fell in Love With a Girl", but overall I thought that album was a bunch of noise without much melody or warmth. Switch to "Elephant". Of course I had heard the single "Seven Nation Army", which I liked. For Christmas my 14 yr. old daughter had "Elephant" on her wish-list, so I got it for her. And of course I listened to it as well. Much to my surprise, I liked what I was hearing! Over the last couple of months, I have to come to actually like this album, a lot.  "Elephant" (14 tracks, 50 min.) still is touch-and-go for me, but there are more than enough highlights. "Black Math" is my favorite track, period, it just rocks beyond belief. "In the Cold Cold Night" finds Meg on vocals, and quite effectively. The monster track is "Ball and Biscuit", an epic song that finds Jack whipping out heavy guitar solos, just great. Other highlights include "Little Alcorns" and the short (less than 2 min.) "Hypnotize", a surf-rocker as good as you'll find. Meg's drumming, a hot topic, is quite good throughout the album. So almost a year after this album came out, I finally "get it". "Elephant" in my opinion is a quantum leap from "White Blood Cells" as it shows the 2 person band actually sounding as a full band, with songs that have melodies. Can't wait what the next White Stripes album will bring.
