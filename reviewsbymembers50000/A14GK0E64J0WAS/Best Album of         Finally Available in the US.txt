 The Cooper Temple Clause follow up their 2002 debut album "See This Through and Leave" with "Kick Up The Fire" (10 tracks, 53 min.), with excellent results. For those not familiar with TCTC, think Hawkwind-meets-Radiohead-meets-Pink Floyd, but with more guitars. "Kick Up the Fire" is making serious waves in the UK, with the singles "Promises Promises" and "Blind Pilots", both of which are pretty straight-forward power-rock tunes. But it's on the more adventurous tracks that TCTC really shines. Take the opener "The Same Mistakes", sounding ambient yet pulsating. Even better is "New Toys", which is what Radiohead should sound like if they had the guts. The album's "piece-de-resistance" is the closing track "Written Apology", an epic 10 min. blow-out of piano, guitar and electronic noodling, fantastic!  To entice US fans even more, the US version of the album comes with 2 bonus tracks (live versions of the debut album tracks "Been Training Dogs" and "Did You Miss Me"), and the video for "Promises, Promises". Released last Fall in the UK, I named this album my favorite album of 2003, and I still feel that way. Thankfully the album has finally been released in the US: better late than never! TCTC continues the wave of high-quality UK bands ready to conquer this side of the Atlantic. If you like "alterna" rock, you cannot go wrong with this album.
