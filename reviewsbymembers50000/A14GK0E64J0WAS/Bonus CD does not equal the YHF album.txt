 (YHF Album: 5 Stars Bonus CD 4 Stars) The YHF album of course rates 5 stars, and we dont need to go into details here. The question is how the bonus CD (6 tracks, 22 min) stacks up. It was at first supposed to be issued as an EP in the US, but that has been shelved--permanently (although it now is available as a free download if you own the YHF CD). The answer is that it is a mixed bag, not up to par to YHF. "Camera" is a rockier (and distorted) version of YHF's "Kamera", and quite frankly not as good. "Handshake Drugs" is quite good. "Woodgrain" is a short tune (less than 2 min.), finding Jeff Tweedy solo on guitar. "A Magazine Called Sunset" is another short, yet beautiful, upbeat tune. "Bob Dylan's 49th Beard" is a song Wilco has played regularly live on the tour supporting YHF, and it is the best song on here. "More Like The Moon" rounds out the CD, a mid-tempo, reflective tune, with a beautiful accoustic guitar solo. It is very instumental that Jeff Tweedy decided to leave these songs out of YHF's final track listing. YHF is so much more daring, and for that matter cohesive. In the end, the bonus CD is nice, but not essential, for anyone (like me) believing YHF is one of the best albums in recent memory.
