 Ryan Adams's latest CD "Gold" is finally receiving well-deserved attention, primarily due to the haunting video for "New York, New York" ...The fact that the song is actually great, is helpful too... Anyone expecting another "Heartbreaker"-type album, will be shocked at the evolution Ryan Adams has gone through in just a year. The "Gold" album I bought actually consists of 2 CDs, the "regular" album supplemented by a 20 minute-long "Side 4" CD, the prolific Adams thus giving us a total of 90 min. of music! Besides the familiar New York, New York", the standout tracks include "Firecracker" (with Ryan belting "I just wanna be your firecracker/I just wanna burn up bright and hard!", which he very well might, looking at the energy he displays at his concerts), "Answering Bell" (think 70's Van Morrison or the Band), "La Cienega Just Smiled" (think Jackson Browne-like), the hard rocking tracks "Gonna Make You Love Me" and "Touch, Feel & Lose" (with horns!), the achingly beautiful "When The Stars Go Blue", the 8+ min. "Nobody Girl" (with a great guitar solo), and the piano-based closing track "Goodnight Hollywood Blvd." On the "Side 4" bonus CD, "The Bar Is A Beautiful Place" stands out. One more track deserves special mention: the end-of-relationship song "Harder Now That It's Over", which musically reminds me of "Harvest"-era Neil Young; at the end of the song, Ryan keeps repeating "I'm sorry...I'm sorry...honey, I'm sorry" but in concert he turns the song completely around by mumbling at the very end "...but not really". Wow! At the age of 26, Ryan Adams is just getting warmed up with the very rich "Gold" album. He supposedly has 3 new albums in the works already (which he says he may release as a single "best of" album!). I can't wait to hear more.
