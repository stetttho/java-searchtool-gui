 I am big fan of Travis (seen them in concert a number of times; check my reviews on most of their releases). On purpose I have waited 2 months to submit my review of "The Invisible Band" (TIB) At first impression, I really was disappointed with TIB, but I know why: it wasn't the same joy of exploring the unexpected, as was the case with "The Man Who". I mean, how can you follow up such a brilliant album and not be let down? So I was... and hence the delay in reviewing TIB. If I had rated TIB the day it came out, it would have been 3 stars. With the passage of time, I am rating it 4 stars. The opening track "Sing" (also the first single) is one of the better tracks of the album, an ode to the joy of singing (see my review of the single). "Side" is also very good and not surprisingly the 2nd single of the album, with rich string- guitars and a smart lyrics courtesy of Fran. "Dear Diary" is out of place, quite frankly... a downer song so soon on the album (track 2)? "Flowers in the Wondow" is a long-time concert fave, although I remember it quite heavier live than on the studio version here. The album moves along quite nicely, too nicely? "The Humpty Dumpty Love Song" is really good, with its drawn-out outro.  In the end, the album overall just doesn't have the same impact that "The Man Who" had on me. All in all, nice to hear the new Travis album, but it's not the masterpiece that "The Man Who" was. Let's call this one a "victim of impossible-to-meet expectactions".
