 The "Black" EP (6 tracks, 28 min.) is a European-release that contains some interesting finds for Interpol fans. "Say Hello to the Angels" is the lead-track, and one of the better songs from "Turn on the Bright Lights", with great wall-of-sounds guitar riffs. "NYC (Demo)" is the same track that appears on the US release of the "Say Hello" single. Tracks 3 through 6 are live tracks recorded for a French radio program called "Black". For those that have seen Interpol in concert, you know that the live tracks are pretty similar to the studio tracks, and this is the case here as well. "Obstacle 1" remains the band's best track, but "PDA" and album closer "Leif Ericson" are quite good as well. The real treat of this EP is the inclusion of "Specialist", which is as moody and entrancing as any of the album's tracks but does not appear on the album. It makes this single worth buying in and of itself. While Interpol is about to start working on a second album, their label continues to find ways to repackage the limited number of available songs in various configurations. It's not a bad thing, as any new opportunity to give exposure to Interpol is well deserved.
