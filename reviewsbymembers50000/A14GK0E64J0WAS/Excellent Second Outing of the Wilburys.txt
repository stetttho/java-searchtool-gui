 Sarcastically titled "Vol. 3", the second (and last) album of the super-group consisting of George Harrison, Tom Petty, Jeff Lynn and Bob Dylan is more-of-the-same as "Vol. 1", and I mean that as a compliment. "Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3" (11 tracks, 36 min.) starts off with an outstanding "She's My Baby". Accoustic guitars are upfront throughout the album, not a surprise here. The songs move along at a crisp pace (all songs clock in between 3' and 3'30). Other highlights include "The Devil's Been Busy", "Poor House" and of course the silly but irresitable "Wilbury Twist". Many feel that "Vol. 1" is a superior album because of Roy Orbinson's presence (he died shortly after "Vol. 1" was released). Nothing against Orbinson, but I feel differently. "Vol. 3" comes across as a much tighter album, with hardly a minute or a second wasted. Why both "Vol. 1" and "Vol. 3" remain out of print is a mystery to me. The Traveling Wilburys remain a treasure to be (re)discovered.
