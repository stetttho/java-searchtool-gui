 The Cowboy Junkies' 2004 studio album "One Soul Now" was flat-out boring, and the low point of a long way downward from the "Trinity Sessions" days. I didn't know whether the band still had a good record left in them, and I am glad to say that I was wrong.  "Early 21st Century Blues" (11 tracks, 59 min.) finds the Canadian foursome bringing us a mix of originals, covers and traditionals, to great effect. The 2 originals "December Skies" and "This World Dreams Of" are among the best songs Michael Timmins has brought in a LONG time. The covers include 2 from Burce Springsteen, of which "Brothers Under the Bridge" is outstanding, as well as Bob Dylan, Richie Havens, U2 and George Harrison, whose "Isn't It a Pity" is another highlight. The John Lennon cover "I Don't Want to Be a Soldier" is terrible, though, with a... rap (!?!) in the middle of the song. This alone keeps me from giving this album not more than 4 stars.  That said, the band is in great musical form throughout, and Margo Timmins' voice is as beautiful as ever. 2006 marks the 20th anniversary of this remarkable band. "Early 21st Century Blues" is a return to  great form, and makes me excited again what Cowboy Junkies are up to next. If you like CJ, check out a band called Over the Rhine, with a very similar style of music (in fact, OtR and CJ have toured together on more than one occastion), you will not be disappointed.
