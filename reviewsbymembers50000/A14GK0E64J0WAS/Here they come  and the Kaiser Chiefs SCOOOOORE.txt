 Kaiser Chiefs hail from Leeds but named themselves after a soccer team in South Africa. After a commercially under-the-radar but critically acclaimed debut single last Spring, Kaiser Chiefs became a hot commodity, leading to the UK breakout single "I Predict a Riot" last Fall.  "Employment" (12 tracks, 44 min.) starts off with a British humor-bursting "Everyday I Love You Less and Less", with the music just as irreverent and fun. "I Predict a Riot" is the monster track on this album, insanely catchy (similar in spirit to Franz Ferdinand's "Take Me Out" on its debut album). I'm just afraid that eventually this will cross play onto US mainstream radio and it'll get played to death (again, see "Take Me Out"). The first half of the album is near perfect: "Modern Way", "Na Na Na Na Naa" and "Oh My God" are all irresitable (the latter being that obscure debut single, but it's being re-released in the UK). The second half is not as strong, but still quite strong, in particular "Saturday Night", the lite-reggae "What Did I Ever Give You", and the 60s-Kinks sounding "Time Honoured Tradition".  It's not like the Kaiser Chiefs have come up with a new or unique sound, but "Employment" is a fun album with lots of catchy songs, very much like Franz Ferdinand did a year ago. The UK music scene is brimming with good new bands (the Futureheads, Kasabian, Bloc Party, etc.) and Kaiser Chiefs stand proudly at the head of that group. Highly recommended!
