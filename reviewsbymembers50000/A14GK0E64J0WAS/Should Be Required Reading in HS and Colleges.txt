 For whatever reason I have a lot of business contacts, acqaintances and even friends in the Jewish community. I wish I had found a book like this years ago! I stumbled upon this recently, and immediately knew this book was meant for people like me.   "What I Wish My Christian Friends Knew About Judaism" (270 pages) is a delightful book. The author, in plain and simple language, gives an introduction of what "being jewish" is all about. Most chapters are easy to understand 2 to 3 pages addressing particular aspects of Judaism, such as what a bar mitzvah is, what the holy days in the Jewish year are, even explaining the Jewish calendar (just add 3,761 years!). Confused about "Orthodox" versus "Reformed" Jews? It's explained here. Wonder how the Jews feel about controversial issues like homosexuality or abortion? It's in here! Don't understand the concept of "kosher" food? Read about it here! And so on.  The author brings this book with obvious warmth and respect for us Christians. I cannot emphasize enough how important I feel this book is. In my opinion it should be required reading in all high schools and colleges, as it promotes a mutual understanding and respect that is sadly lacking far too often in our society.
