 My Morning Jacket's previous album, 2003's "It Still Moves" was a great album, creating a fair amount of buzz, among other reasons for the band's tireless live tours. Two years later comes the follow-up album, amid even greater expectations. The good news is that the band lives up to it.  "Z" (10 tracks; 47 min.) is a terrific, and challeging but oh so rewarding, follow-up to "It Still Moves". The band expands its musical pallet, with some keyboards more up front, and even dipping into reggae. There is no weak track on the album. The opener "Wordless Chorus" is an off-beat apetizer, which gets filled by subsequent tracks. The best of the album is the reggae-flavored "Off The Record", which simmers into a break-out jam towards the end, just great. No, this isn't MMJ of "At Dawn" or "Tennessee Fire", but hey guess what, the band is evolving (bringing Wilco to mind). Sign up for the journey. You won't be disappointed! Other stand-out tracks include "What a Wonderful Man" (with great guitar licks from Jim James), and the closer "Dondants", an epic 8+ min. tune.  I happen to catch MMJ on the opening show of their current US tour, and the "Z" songs translated even better live. "Off The Record" became a 10+ min. epic, just beautiful. This surely is one of the very best albums to be released this year. Highly recommended!
