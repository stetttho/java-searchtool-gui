 I must admit I never was a big Ben Harper fan. It's not that I didn't like him, it's just that I was never 'moved' by his music. That was, until I saw him live recently. Wow, what a show that was. So of course I went out and bought this album.  "Live from Mars" (25 tracks, 137 min.) comes in 2 parts. CD 1 (12 tracks, 74 min.) is Ben Harper and his band the Innocent Criminals rocking out to the max. There are really no bad songs on this set, but the highlights for me include the opener "Glory & Consequence", "Woman in You" and the closer "Faded/Whole Lotta Love" (yes, the Led Zep classic). CD 2 (13 tracks, 63 min.) is Ben Harper solo and accoustic. It's not bad by any stretch of the imagination, but after a while it becomes a bit too much of the same. Nevertheless, the cover of the Verve's "The Drugs Don't Work" is a classic, showing Harper's versatility in choosing cover songs.  In all, "Live from Mars" is a great live set, although it could've been even better if it didn't so artificially carve up Ben Harper and his band going full tilt from Ben Harper going solo accoustic.
