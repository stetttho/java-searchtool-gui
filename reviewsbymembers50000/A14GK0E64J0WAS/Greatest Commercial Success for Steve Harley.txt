 Only 1 year after the staggering and brooding album "Psychomodo" (see my review there), we find Steve Harley taking a 45 degree turn towards more accessible music and consequently broad commercial success. The original premise of Cockney Rebel (no electric guitars) is abandoned here (albeit only occasionally). 1975's "Best Years of Our Lives" boasts 3 genuine hit singles, including of course the worldwide smash "Make Me Smile (Come Up and See Me)", but the equally delightful "Mr. Raffles", as well as "Mad, Mad Moonlight". Other key tracks include a paranoid "It Wasn't Me", a funky-sounding "49th Parallel", and of course the beautiful title track. Unlike the "Psychomodo" reissue, this album does contain bonus tracks, and what a find they are! First there is "Another Journey", the B-side of the "Make Me Smile" single, a great track that would have fitted nicely on the original album. Even more interesting is the 11 min. live version of "Sebastian", still perhaps the signature Harley song, from a 1975 Hammersmith Odeon show according to the liner notes. While the track initially stays close to the original, it eventually gives way to an ear-splitting electric guitar solo, which must have come to somewhat of a shock to audiences then, given what Cockney Rebel started out as. A must for any Steve Harley fan!
