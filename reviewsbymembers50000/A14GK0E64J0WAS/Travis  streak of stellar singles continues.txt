 "Turn" is the third single from "The Man Who". Like their mentors Oasis, Travis records plentiful of tracks found only on the singles, which are oftentimes as good as any track on the album. This CD-single comes with 3 bonus tracks: first there is a cover of "River", the hauntingly beautiful Joni Mitchell track of her "Blue" album. The last track is the by-now (in)famous cover of Britney Spears' "Baby One More Time", here found in a live version (but different from the live version found on the recently issued US single of "Turn"). As is apparent from the recording, the band members had a blast doing this song in concert. In between those 2 is the stand-out track of the single, "Days of Our Lives". The track starts of with a very quite Fran plus accoustic guitar, eventually becoming more jazzy-stylish, and even cheerful. The lyrics recall a modern, more intravert version of Bob Dylan's "Blowing In the Wind": "How many times have you walked through my door/How many times have you heard my soul before/How many lies until the end of time/These are the days of our lives". Just beautiful! If you like Travis, by all means by this single.
