 (CD 3 Stars; DVD 4 Stars). Only 2 proper albums into their career, and already we receive a (sorta) greatest hits live album from Coldplay. The CD (12 tracks, 67 min.) covers familiar ground for anyone that saw Coldplay on the "Rush of Blood" 2002-2003 world tour, opening of course with the high energy "Politik". "See You Soon" (originally on "The Blue Room EP", the outstanding 1999 EP--still available, including from Amazon) is one of the highlights. "Shiver" is another, and reminds me why I like "Parachutes" so much better than "Rush of Blood". "Moses" is the only true new song on here, quite good actually. And of course the "hits" "In My Place", "Yellow" and "Clocks" are here. In all, not a bad collection, but nothing that made me sit up and take notice. Unlike, say, the other live Coldplay collection "Trouble: Norwegian Live", a 5 song EP from a December 2000 show (still available, including here on Amazon), where Chris Martin works the Oslo crowd into a frenzy. Compare "Everything's Not Lost" on this EP against the "Live 2003" version and you'll see what I mean. The DVD is quite nice, though. For one, it adds 5 more songs including three "hits" ("Don't Panic", "Trouble" and "The Scientist"), inexplicably left off of the CD version (which at 67 min. could have easily added them), and the show closer "Life is for Living". The tour diary is goofy fun but inconsequential. For Coldplay completists only.
