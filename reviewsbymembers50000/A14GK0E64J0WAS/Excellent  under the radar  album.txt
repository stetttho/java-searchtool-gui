 I found out about Aqueduct from the excellent folks at the internet-only station woxy.com ("the future of rock'n'roll"). I loved what I heard and purchased the album. As the liner notes make clear "David Perry is Aqueduct... Aqueduct is David Perry". Aqueduct is pretty much a one-man synth-based band (Perry), assisted on some tracks with drums and guitars. If you're not familiar with Aqueduct, imagine a mix of Flaming Lips with Grandaddy, with a splash of Beck and the Faint, although that description does not do justice to the unique sound of Aqueduct.  "I Sold Gold" (11 tracks, 37 min.) starts off with a blasting "The Suggestion Box". The album mixes up harder charging tracks (the pulsing "Growing Up with GNR"--with multiple references to Axl) with more delicate songs, such as the excellent "Heart Design", the highlight of the album in my book. "Laundry Baskets" is another standout. The instrumental "GameOver" is the weakest track, but it is followed by the excellent closer "The Tulsa Trap", a look back to Terry's origins in Oklahoma.  This album will not sell a bezillion, or even million copies. What a shame. This is an excellent album. Aqueduct is coming to Cincinnati soon, and I can't wait to see how the songs from "I Sold Gold" will translate in a live setting.
