 I loved Calla's 2003 album "Televise", it was one of the best albums of the year for me. So it was with great anticipation that I looked forward to the release of the new album.  "Collisions" (11 tracks, 41 min.) confirms the trend of more upbeat, rockier tracks found on "Televise" (the sound of "Scavengers" is rarely heard), witness the opener tracks "It Dawned On Me" and "Initiate". That is not at all to say that Calla has gone the way  of "poppy rock and roll beats" (as another reviewer puts it), not by a long shot: "Pulvarised", "So Far, So What" and "Stumble" are dim and gloomy, to say the least. The album clips along at a great pace, and before you know it, it's over and you want to play it again.  "Collisions" is a great album (certainly compared to most of the dreadful "mainstream" stuff that's being released these days). That said, it's not as good as "Televise", which is in my book a classic of moody rock. That aside, Calla is terrific in concert and don't miss them if you have a chance to catch them live.
