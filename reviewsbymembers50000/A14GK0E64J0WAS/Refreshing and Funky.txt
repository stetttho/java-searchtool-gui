 Nikka Costa has blown onto the music scene with her single (and cool-looking video) "Like a Feather". Her debut album is of the same high quality. "Like a Feather" is the opening track and in case you haven't heard the song, imagine a funkier sounding Janis Joplin style.  Other stand-out tracks include the heavy "Tug of War", the happy, clap-along title track "Everybody Got Their Something" (in which co-producer (and significant other) Justin Stanley is a veritable one-man band, playing all instruments), the slow and sad "Nothing" (detailing how there once was love, and now nothing) and the album closer "Corners of My Mind" (note: after this last track, there is about a 5 min gap of silence before the album closes with about 20 seconds worth of audience applause from what sounds like a jazz club). All in all, a very convincing album. It is hard to believe that this is Nikka Costa's debut album. The confidence she displays in her songs would one expect this to be a middle-of-career album. Come find the familiar "Like a Feather" and stay around for the remainder of the album!
