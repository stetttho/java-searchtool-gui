 Too bad "Der Kommisar" didn't actually listen to the "Greatest Hits" CD. If he had, he would know that the CD in fact does run 79+ min., and therefore is as full as a single CD will allow. This is not to say that "Greatest Hits" is good. The liner notes and packaging are skimpy, and it does smell like a quick money job by Geffen. But can you really blame them, when they have been waiting for 12 years on new studio material from Axl? In unrelated news, Axl yesterday announced that GnR is pulling out from performing at the "Rock in Rio/Lisbon" festival in June. Is anyone really surprised by that? Meanwhile, back to the "Greatest Hits" CD: good music, but flawed compilation.
