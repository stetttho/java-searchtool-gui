 By complete coincidence, I happen to catch Sarah on the "Afterglow Live" tour in early November in Antwerp, Belgium, while I was there on business. Unlike her shows in North America, which usually are in large arenas (reflecting the big star she is here), the show was in a small venue, maybe 2-3,000 seats at most. It made for a memorable evening, frankly.  Only weeks later now comes the "Afterglow Live" CD (15 tracks, 67 min.). Couple of general observations: (1) If you don't like the "Afterglow" album, don't buy this. 8 of the 10 "Afterglow" tracks are on here. (2) If you bought the "Mirrorball" live album, be aware that 6 tracks on here overlap with "Mirrorball" ("Adia", "Hold On", "I Will Remember You", "Angel", "Building a Mystery" and "Sweet Surrender").  So why buy this then? (1) First and foremost, as a souvenir if you happened to have seen Sarah on this tour. One thing that struck me is that the setlist of the Antwerp show that I saw a few weeks ago, is virtually identical to the setlist on this album. I looked into this a bit, and conclude that the setlist hardly ever changed from show to show. (2) The DVD of course. The DVD comes with 8 additional tracks, including such gems as "Fumbling Towards Ecstasy", "Blackbird" and "Ice Cream". In all, this release is really intended for the Sarah McLachlan fans, more so than the public at large. Within that context, I give "Afterglow Live" 4 stars.
