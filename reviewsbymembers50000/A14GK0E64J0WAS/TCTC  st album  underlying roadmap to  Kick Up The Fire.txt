 I admit I had never heard of TCTC, but by chance I saw these guys open for (and blow away) Jane's Addiction in London last Fall. I bought their new album "Kick Up the Fire" album on the spot, and it turned out to be my favorite album of 2003 (it's finally now also released in the US). So how about TCTC's debut album from 2002? Not bad, not bad at all. "See This Through and Leave" (11 tracks, 55 min.) is jam-packed. It starts off with the electronic-flavored space-rocking "Did You Miss Me"? (think Hawkwind updated for the 21st century), but from there goes straight into "Film-Maker", one of the 5 singles from the album, a hard rocker, followed by the even harder charging "Panzer Attack" and "Who Needs Enemies" (both also a single). "Let's Kill Music" is the TCTC 2001 single that put the band on the UK music map. "555-4823" is great electronic noodling, along the same lines of Radiohead's "Kid A". "Murder Song" is the epic 9 min. blow-out closing track. So I rate this album "only" 4 stars simply because, while great, it is not as good as the "Kick Up the Fire" album. Did I mention that was my favorite album of 2003? If you like indy, adventurous, quality music, by all means check out TCTC
