 I've seen The Music a couple of times in recent months (opening up for The Vines and Coldplay, respectively). I liked what I saw, and bought the CD. This is not a  bad album by any stretch of the imagination but it demonstrates again that sometimes it's difficult to catch a band's sound in the studio. There is much debate about the band's sound, and whether it owes any debt to Led Zep (no IMHO, but lead singer Robert Harvey does bring to mind a young Robert Plant). From the opening track "The Dance" the album is heavy and really doesn't let up. After a while, all the songs start sounding sort of the same, and as a result I find the album to be too long (56 min). Best songs include the single "Take the Long Road and Walk It", "Turn Out the Light" and "Disco". I hope that with future releases the band will open up their sound, and inject some variety. Live, however, the band sparkles with energy, and playing a tight 40 min. opening set goes by quickly. Very entertaining.
