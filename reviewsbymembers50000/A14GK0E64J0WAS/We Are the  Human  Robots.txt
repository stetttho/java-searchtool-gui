 Air's excellent new album "Talkie Walkie" made me revisit their previous (2001) album "10,000 Hz Legend", which frankly I hadn't listened to in quite a while. My loss! It's an outstanding album. "10,000 Hz Legend" (11 tracks, 60 min.) starts with one of its very best tracks, "Electronic Performers", which invites comparisons to Kraftwerk's "We Are the Robots" both musically, as well as lyrically with lines like "We Are the Synchronizers/Machines Gave Me Some Freedom". But it's not all about syntesizers: piano and accoustic guitars come through as well in the album. Other stand-out tracks include the brooding "Lucky and Happy", "Radio #1", a coulda-shoulda been radio hit (which it wasn't of course, given the dismall state of US radio generally), and a wildly pulsing "Don't Be Light". Guest artists appear on the album, including Beck singing on "The Vagabond". It's difficult to categorize Air, and that's one of the strenghts of the French duo. It'll be interesting to see if Air can cross over to the main stream with their new "Talkie Walkie" album. "10,000 Hz Legend" is equally a great album.
