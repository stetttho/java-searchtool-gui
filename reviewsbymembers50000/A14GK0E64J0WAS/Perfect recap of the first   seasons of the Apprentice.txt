 I got into "The Apprentice" about half-way into the first season and have been hooked ever since. There are so many dynamics going on in the show (such as short term goals, i.e. winning the assignment; relating to team members; and of course dealing with The Donald, and his side kicks George and Carolyn), that makes it compelling viewing all around. Don't underestimate the Donald's factor. For proof, check the oh-so-lame new Martha Stewart Apprentice show.... boring!!!  "Lessons from the Apprentice: Secrets to Success from the Boardroom to the Business World" (176 pages) is a high-end, glossy page book that takes you back to the first 3 seasons of "The Apprentice". While the book is structured to offer "lessons", it really is a fun look back of what worked and what went horribly wrong in the teams various assignments. With 20-20 vision, many of the mistakes that the losing teams made were so obvious (Ivana dropping her pants to "sell" chocolate bars? Danny's "Triple Play" act to get people into Burger King? etc.). There are plenty of pictures and quotes from the Donald, George and Carolyn, but also from the various business executives whose company products were on the line, and in that sense, yes, the book offers lessons.  In the end, though, this is an irreverent look back at the first three seasons of "The Apprentice", and a good one at that. In a way, it reminds me of the 3 (so far) Simpsons books that "dissect" the episodes. If you are a fan of "The Apprentice", you will love this book!
