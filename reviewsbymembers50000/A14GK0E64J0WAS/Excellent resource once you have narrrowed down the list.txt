 This book is in essence a companion book to "The Complete Book of Colleges", which is also published by the Princeton Review.  "The Best 361 Colleges (2006 Edition)" (810 pages) narrows down the short reviews of about 1,800 colleges presented in "The Complete Book". Each college gets 2 full pages, with lots of useful information, both objective (such as average SAT/ACT, tuition/room/board info, etc.) and subjective ("admission rating" (i.e. selectivity), lots of "students speak out" quotes, etc.).  I'm not sure how this book keeps growing the list of "best" colleges. The 2005 Edition brought 357 "best" colleges, up from the original 350 some years ago. I do know this: we have a lot of the college resource books, and my daughter has spent more time with this book than with any other. This book is not the first palce to start the college search, but once your son or daughter has narrowed down the his/her field of choice, and assuming those colleges are featured in the "best 361", this book clearly is the best resource and the last step before a campus visit.
