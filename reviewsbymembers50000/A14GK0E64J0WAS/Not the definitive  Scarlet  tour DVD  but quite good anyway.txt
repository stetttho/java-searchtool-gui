 After the 15 min. teaser DVD that was added to the "Tales of a Librarian" compilation last Fall, we now get the real thing: the entire performance of the last show on the long "Scarlet's Walk" tour last September in West Palm Beach. First things first: the performance that Tori gives is exquisite. Watch also for the very fine work by Matt Chamberlain on drums and Jon Evans on bass (in my opinion the very best bass player out there nowadays). Stand-out songs include A Sorta Fairy Tale, Sugar, Cornflake Girl, and Tombigbee. The reason I cannot rate this the "definitive" Scarlet tour DVD is that, for whatever reason, Tori plays only 3 tracks from the Scarlet album, which is most certainly not reflective of most shows on that tour. Thus regretfully no Sweet Sangria, no Pancake, no Taxi Ride, just to name a couple of frequently played Scarlet tracks on that tour. But other than that, it's a thoroughly enjoyable performance. The set also includes a bonus CD: "Scarlet's Hidden Treasures" (6 tracks, 33 min.), which is a mixed bag. Mostly very quiet and introverted songs, such as Apollo's Frock and Indian Summer, both 8 min. (and overlong) tracks. The best of the lot is Tombigbee, which appears also on the DVD performance. In all, a great addition to any Tori fan's collection. Can't wait for what she'll bring next!
