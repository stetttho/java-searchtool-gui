 The Offspring formed in 1985, and they are facing the question other "aging" punk-rooted bands (like Green Day and the Chili Peppers) have faced: how to stay relevant and fresh? The Offspring's previous album, 2000's "Conspiracy of One", frankly was not their best, but hey you can't hit a home run (or triple) every at bat. Fortunately, "Splinter" (12 tracks, 32 min.) finds the Offspring in much better form. It seems the time off since the previous has helped Dexter & Co. te re-energize. The album is full of all-out fun rockers, starting with "The Noose", but also with the single "Hit That". One of my fave tracks is "Race Against Myself", taking its time to reach a more dramatic chorus. "The Worst Hangover Ever" is a fun reggae/ska-flavored track. I don't "get" the closing track "When You're In Prison", which is a 1930-40's send-up, with cracks-in-the-vinyl-sound and all. Despite the curious last track, "Splinter" is a good album, moving along at a great pace and not once boring. Looks like the Offspring have faced the question on how to stay fresh, and found the answer. In concert, the band still puts on a blazing set, as when I saw them this Spring here in Cincinnati.
