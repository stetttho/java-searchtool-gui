 The Yeah Yeah Yeahs return after an almost 3 year absence following the "Fever to Tell" breakthrough album with a new album ("Show Your Bones") and this preceding single from it.  "Gold Lion" (4 tracks, 14 min.) brings the opener track from the album. The sound on "Gold Lion" is less raw and garage-oriented than the "Fever to Tell" sound, but it is undeniably catchy and Karen O.'s vocals are in great shape. "Let Me Know" is a demo of a new song that did not make the final tracklist of "Show Your Bones". It is very accoustic, and nice, but an even further moving away from the garage sound that put the YYYs on the map.   The last 2 tracks are remixes of the "Gold Lion" song, and not much to write home about. I'm not for remixes, and these are quite mechanical and industrial-sounding, definitely not my cup of thee. But the original "Gold Lion" song is quite good, and I'll be interested to see how the entire album sounds like.
