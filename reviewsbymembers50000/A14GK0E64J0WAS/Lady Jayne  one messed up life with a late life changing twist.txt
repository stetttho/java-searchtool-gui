 I saw this book at my local library and couldn't resist picking it up. Couple of things right off the bat: 1. I just cannot believe it that Jane Fonda (whose birth-given name is Lady Janye Fonda--she decided to shorten it to just Jane at age 13) is now 68, I mean, when did that happen all of the sudden? 2. I had a hard time reading through the (long) section in the book where Fonda describes her anti-Vietnam efforts, and in particular the infamous visit to Hanoi, sorry.  The best part of the book is the first 200 pages or so, where Jane goes into details of her childhood, in particular what is was like to grow up the daughter of Henry Fonda, as cold a father figure you will find anywhere. I really felt sorry for Jane (and others around her having to deal with Henry Fonda). It's no surprise then that Jane spends the next 40-50 years of her life going from one failed relationship to another, including 3 marriages (Roger Vadim, Tom Hayden, Ted Turner).  As we get towards the end of the book, and you almost come to the seemingly inevitable conclusion that Jane Fonda, despite all her fame and fortune, really has had one long messed-up life, then comes the revelation that Jane has become a Christian a few years ago. Good for her! That seems to have given Jane a new sense of purpose and focus in life. Godspeed to you Jane!
