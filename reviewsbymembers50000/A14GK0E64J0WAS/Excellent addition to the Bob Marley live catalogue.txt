 "Live at the Roxy" is the third official live album of Bob Marley(after the 1975 "Live" and the 1978 "Babylon by Bus"), and it's a most welcome addition. Bob Marley is one of the best live acts, ever, and this 2CD only confirms it (13 songs, 85 min.). Fitting chronologically in between the 2 previous live albums, this is the complete recording of the May 26, 1976 gig at the Roxy, a small venue in LA (contrary to Europe, Marley never really hit it big in the US till his very late years). There are many gems here, including "Them Belly Full" (another biting social commentary by Marley), "Rebel Music" and "Rat Race" (in a better version than on "Babylon by Bus" and a track written by Bob's wife Rita). The very best is in the encore, a 23 min. medley of "Get Up Stand Up/No More Trouble/War", just fab. Oh to have been a fly on the wall on that gig!  I had one opportunity to see Marley live, in 1980, in Brussels, Belgium. That concert coincided with Belgium's soccer team unprobable bid for the European championship, a once in a lifetime, and I decided to watch the game instead, thinking I'd have another chance sometime to see Marley.... I never did (and to add insult to misery Belgium lost the final). The irony! Bob Marley was a soccer affectionado. Meanwhile, enjoy this excellent live set. A must for any Marley fan.
