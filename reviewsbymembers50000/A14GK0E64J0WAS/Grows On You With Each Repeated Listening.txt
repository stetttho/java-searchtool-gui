 After last year's strange and IMHO disappointing "detour" with the covers-only Strange Little Girls CD, Tori storms back to form with "Scarlet's Walk". Ok, it's a concept album (which concept, frankly, is hard to make out, and the Amazon editorial review strangely focues on, to the exclusion of the music). I'd rather focus on the music: are these good songs?? The answer is an unequivocal YES. The overall sound of the album is a mix of "Venus Orbitting" (the studio side of "To Venus and Back") and "Under the Pink". Among the 18 songs, there are many highlights. One of the things of Tori's nowadays sound that gets not enough credit is the amazing work from bassist Jon Evans and drummer Matt Chamberlain, both among the top-echelon in their respective crafts: "Sweet Sangria" and "Pancake" demonstrate that so well. (In concert Tori Amos works as a trio, with just Jon and Matt, yet creating an amazing "wall of sound" on the harder songs.) What keeps this from getting a 5 star rating is that "Scarlet's Walk" is, at 74 min., simply too long. Musically, there are about 4 or 5 filler songs that could have been deleted and made the album much tighter. In all, this is a most welcome return of Tori after last year's disappointing cover-album.
