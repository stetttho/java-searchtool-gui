 Peter Gabriel is in my humble opinion a monument in the rock  scene, from his days in Genesis to his solo work. Gabriel has two compilations out on his solo work, this one and 2003's 2 CD "Hit: The Definitive Peter Gabriel" (which is far from definitive).   "Shaking the Tree" (16 tracks, 77 min.) was originally released in 1990 and is now available in remastered sound. But is it a good compilation? Alas, it is not. That said, there is a lot of great music on here. There are 5 tracks from Gabriel's 1986's commercial breakthrough album "So", but "In Your Eyes", a major hit is not on here. Even more troubling is that there is not a single track from 1978's "Peter Gabriel 2": no "On The Air" and no "D.I.Y.", both hits, as minor they were. (As an aside, PG2 was equally ignored entirely for the 2003 "Hit" compilation. I guess Peter doesn't like that album?) For die-hard Gabriel fans (count me one), the reason to own this is the inclusion of "Shaking the Tree", a "Biko"-like song you can't find anywhere but here, and the new recording of "Here Comes the Flood", as a piano-and-vocals only cover, just great.   It is clear to me that the definitive Peter Gabriel "best of" is still to be released. Both this album and 2003's "Hits" have serious flaws. That said, there is no question there is a lot of great music on here. As to "Shaking the Tree": only for die-hard Gabriel fans.
