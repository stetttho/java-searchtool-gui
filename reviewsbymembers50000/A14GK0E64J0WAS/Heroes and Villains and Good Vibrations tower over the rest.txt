 Music: 3.5 Stars; Production: 4.5 Stars  I like the Beach Boys, but they're not in my top 10 or top 20 of all-time favorite groups. Nor am I one of those who have been waiting for decades for the release of the original "SMiLE" album. But was I curious what all the hoopla was/is about? Of course!  "Brian Wilson Presents SMiLE" (17 tracks, 47 min.) starts off with an incredible "Our Prayer", a vocals-only track. What is immediately apparent is how "warm" the album sounds, and how much attention was given to the production details. "Heroes and Villains" remains my all-time favorite BB song, easily still after all these years. After that there are quite a few really short songs, intermixed with another couple of peaks, such as "Cabin Essence" and "Surf's Up". The last third of the album really starts to drag, only to be rescused by the closing "Good Vibrations".  I believe that one of the reasons Brian shelved the original "SMiLE" album, was the release of the Beatles' "Sgt. Pepper" album, and the realization that he could never top that. Well, on that count he is right. This is not bad, even a good album, but to say that this is a long-lost treasure, sorry I just don't see it. Kudos to the production, though, as it is recorded, mixed and produced with a perfect feel for "the sound of the 60s".
