 After 21 years, Dayton, Ohio's Robert Pollard has called it quits on Guided by Voices (promising to go on solo). This is the last GBV album of original material.   "Half Smiles of the Decomposed" (14 tracks, 45 min.) is one of (if not THE) most accessible albums ever issued by GBV. The album kicks off with "Everybody Thinks I'm a Raincloud (When I'm not Looking)", reminding me of one of those Foo Fighters' arena-sized power crunchers. "Sleep Over Jack" is more quirky-sounding, something Beck might have sounded like 10 years ago. "Girls of Wild Strawberries" is a nice ballad (gasp!). The middle section of the album has a very British feeling to it, and that's not a bad thing at all. I could imagine "Window of My World" blending in wonderfully on the Who's Tommy. "The Closets of Henry", "Tour Guide at the Winston Churchill Memorial" and "Asia Minor" also have that early-70s sound, just excellent. After that, the album lets up a bit, but does go out with a bang on "Huffman Prairie Flying Field", one of the highlights of the album.  As a swansong, GBV could've done a lot worse. The quality of Pollard's songwriting is generally high, and the production is excellent (thankfully no low-fi songs here). Guided by Voices was to Dayton what Afghan Whigs was to Cincinnati: the premier rock band in town. They will both be missed. And Robert Pallard better make good on his promise to release solo material soon...
