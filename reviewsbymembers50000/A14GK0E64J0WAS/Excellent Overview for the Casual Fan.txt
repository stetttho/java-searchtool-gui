 Growing up in Belgium in the seventies, I can't remember that the Dutch band Golden Earring was ever NOT big. That was 30 years ago! I left Belgium in the early 80s, and admittedly I've lost track somewhat of Golden Earring since then. When I saw this collection during a recent visit to Belgium, I looked at the tracklisting, and immediately knew this would be perfect for me.  "The Devil Made Us Do It: Golden Earring 35 Years" (39 tracks, 155 min.) is thankfully presented in chronological order. CD1 cover 1965-1975, and is by far the most interesting. From the very first single "Please Go" one can follow the evolution of Dutch pop/rock in the 60s, just fascinating. The band really starts to hit all cylinders on the hard-charging "Back Home" (from 1970) and "Buddy Joe" (from 1972), both big hits. The monster hit "Radar Love" is of course on here. CD2 covers 1976-2000, and contains big hits like "Bombay" and "Sleepwalking". As mentioned already, I lost track of the band in the mid 80s, after their last big international hit "Twilight Zone". But the band has continued to churn out hit after hit (and album after album) in their home market (Netherlands and surrounding areas).  This collection is highly recommended for the casual fan who just wants all the hits and best known tracks in one convenient place. As noted elsewhere, there is also a 4 CD box, issued at the same time as this collection, and (confusingly) also named "The Devil Made Us Do It", which contains much more.
