 You put on this sprawling (2 CDs, 140 min.) set and just enjoy the sounds coming from the speakers. The opening track sets the stage, a terrific "The Way You Do The Things You Do", with Jerry's fingers crawling all over his guitar and bringing us an unhurried, great solo. From there we go to Bruce's Cockburn "Waiting for a Miracle" (which tells you something about who Jerry's fave artists were!). This set is best known for its Dylan covers: no less that 4 here, including a truly superb "Simple Twist of Fate", but also "I Shall Be Released", "Senor" (not a very obvious Dylan cover, but done justice here!), and "Tangled Up in Blue". (Listening to this, it makes you wonder how the "Dylan & the Dead" album could have turned out as bad as it did... but I divert.) There's plenty of other choice cuts to go around. Check out for example "Stop That Train" (a Peter Tosh cover)! The main feeling, though, is one of a relaxed Jerry, taking his time for whatever solo comes his way. Sit back, relax and enjoy. Oh yea, that leads me to the "Dead vs JGB" debate: who cares? In whatever format, Jerry on many occasions brings us superb music, and this live set is a great example.
