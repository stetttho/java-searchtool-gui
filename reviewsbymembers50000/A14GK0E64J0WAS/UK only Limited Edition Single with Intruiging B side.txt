 "Nuclear" is the UK-only issued single that was available only for one day: issued and withdrawn on September 16, 2002. "Nuclear" is the lead-off track from "Demolition", and is pleasant but not crucial and a bit bland. The song reminds me a little, ok more than a little, of Bryan Adams. (The same can be said even more so regarding "Starting to Hurt", the worst track on Demolition). The B-side track is the non-album track "Blue", which makes this single a lot more interesting. It shows Ryan basking in the glory of retro-sounding guitars, you could say twanging. In the end, this single is not necessary but for the Ryan Adams completist.
