 This is the first CD single from the terrific "The Man Who" album. This CD single, consisting of 5 songs, is 17 min. of pure pop bliss. "Writing To Reach You" is a tribute of sorts to Oasis, with the references to "Wonderwall" in the lyrics, and a with this awesome guitar lick kicking off the song. "Green Behind The Ears" is a great up-tempo song. "Only Molly Knows" is Fran Healy solo (think "20") and one of the hidden tracks on the US version of "The Man Who". "Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah" is a hard rocking singalong, along the lines of "U16 Girls" of their "Good Feeling" album. "High As A Kite" starts of with the band members chatting "Get on with it" in their best Scottish accent and then romps, just pure rock! Of all the CD singles from "The Man Who", this is the best. Not only does it boast 5 songs, of which 3 are totally new to US audiences, but it demonstrates Travis at its best. By all means, if you like Travis, buy this!
