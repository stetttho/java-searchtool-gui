 A year after the release of the Secret Machines' second album "Now Here is Nowhere" comes this EP, offering one new song and 4 covers. "The Road Leads Where It's Led" (6 tracks, 37 min.) starts off with the title track, taken from the album. It's not the best track on that album, but what's really annoying is that the opening 30 sec. instrumental has been chopped off. "Better Bring Your Friends" is the new song, and ok, but nothing remarkable.  This EP is worth seeking out, though, for the 4 cover songs. There is Van Morrison's "Astral Weeks", which is transferred to a heavier beat. Motown's "Money (That's What I Want)" is an excellent 7 min. slowburner. But for the words you wouldn't recognize the tune, but it's excellent. The German band Harmonia "(De Luxe) Immer Wieder" is done very well. The "piece-de-resistance" on here, however, is a 9 min. cover of Dylan's "Girl From the North Country", a magnificant introverted spacey mood piece, just awesome, and worth the purchase for this alone. You will find no jubilant tracks on this EP like "First Wave Intact" or "Sad and Lonely" from the album, this EP is a primarily a mood piece.  "Now Here Is Nowhere" was one of my top albums of 2004. Can't wait for the next proper album from these guys, presumably in 2006. Meanwhile we will do with this stopgap. And if you have a chance to see the Secret Machines live, don't miss them, they are one of the top live acts today, really. (They are touring this summer with Kings of Leon, no less!)
