 The "Zabriskie Point" soundtrack was re-issued a few years ago, and this is a most welcome reissue, overseen by the (as usual) reliable folks at Rhino. What originally was a single CD soundtrack now comes to us in 2 CDs. CD 1 (11 tracks, 36 min.) contains music by a variety of artists, including 3 tracks from "The Pink Floyd" (sic). It shows the band in pre-Atom Heart Mother/Meddle mode (all Floyd music for the soundtrack was recorded in Nov/Dec 1969). "Heart Beat, Big Meat" is a great mood piece along the lines of "Speak to Me"; "Crumbling Land" could have fitted nice along Meddle's "Fearless"; "Come in Number 51" is a retooled "Careful With That Axe Eugene". Jerry Garcia contributes the "Love Scene" accoustic guitar solo. Strangely there is also a 2 min. excerpt from the Dead's "Dark Star" that starts and ends with no rhyme or reason and begs the question: why? (Deadheads know what I mean). CD 2 (8 tracks, 55 min.) is completely new. It is divided up between 4 Jerry Garcia tracks (more accoustic "noodling"), and 4 Pink Floyd tracks. The latter are fascinating, and what makes this reissue so good. "Country Song" is another one of those classic early-Floyd ballads; "Unknown Song" (a/k/a "Rain in the Country" on bootlegs) is a great instrumental with many undertones. "Love Scene Version 6" is Pink Floyd doing the blues. "Love Scene Version 4" is Rick Wright in piano solo (even if credited to the entire band). In addition to the new music, the reissue comes with a fascinating 40 page booklet, with great liner notes and quotes (Roger Waters on the recording sessions for director Antonioni: "It was hell, sheer hell", haha!). For any Pink Floyd fan, or anyone interested in a slice of 1969/70 psychedelia, this is very much recommended, even if (like me) you've never seen the movie.
