 Who would've/could've expcted this? 17 years after their last album, the so-so "Electric Cafe", Kraftwerk comes charging (almost) out of nowhere with "Tour de France Soundtracks", 12 tracks (of which 11 new), 56 min. Ralf Hutter and Florian Schneider, Kraftwerk's "brains", are well known biking-affectiondos, having done the Tour de France stages as amateurs, and of course demonstrated in the 1983 single "Tour de France" (tacked on here as track 12, albeit newly recorded). Prompted by the 100th anniversary this year of the Tour de France, they took it upon themselves to provide new "soundtracks" to TdF. And what a delight it is. "Etape 1-2-3" is essentially a 14 min. mini-suite of minimalistic music, just a warm up of things to come. The album really starts cooking with "Vitamin", an 8 min. free-flow electronic landscape reminiscent of "Spacelab" on the Man-Machine album. Wait, things get even better! The "Aero Dynamik/Titanium" suite is an 8 min. blow-out of unstoppable electronic dance groove, the best tracks on the album, and the best Kraftwerk have sounded in 25 years. Other great tracks include "Elektro Kardiogramm" and "La Forme". I came close once (in 1998) to see Kraftwerk live, one of the few bands I really want to see live but haven't. Kraftwerk doesn't tour much, I hope Ralf and Florian will take this album on the road. It is an unexpected pleasure, and one of the best albums of 2003. Buy it!
