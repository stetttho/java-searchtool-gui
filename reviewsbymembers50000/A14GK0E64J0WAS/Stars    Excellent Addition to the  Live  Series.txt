 This is No. 20 in the "Live" series of Phish concerts, and boy, is this a good one. "Live 20" (2 CDs, 17 tracks, 145 min.) features a concert from December, 1994 at the Providence Civic Center. Things start off with a blast, "Runaway Jim->Foam", you can just tell the band is on fire that night. Other highlights on CD1 include the gentle "If I Could", and "The Horse->Silent in the Morning".  But the true highlights (for me anyway) are found on CD2, starting off with a 35 min., shall we say, workout (mostly instrumental) of "David Bowie". It's probably not for everyone's taste, but I think it brings out the genius of Phish.  But "Halley's Comet->The Lizards" is equally delicious. The Neil Diamond cover "Cracklin' Rose" falls flat (poor vocals) but Trey & Co. fire back with a great "Good Times, Bad Times" Zep cover. The encore of the traditional "My Long Journey Home" and "Sleeping Monkey" put the "!" on a great show.  This particular show reminds me of how much Phish owes to the motherlode of all jam bands, the Dead, with quite a few "traditional American"-sounding tunes (in particular on CD1--check out "I Didn't Know" with the delightful "Luke Skywalker" interlude). In all, a great addition to the on-going (I hope?) series of the "Live" recordings. Highly recommended!
