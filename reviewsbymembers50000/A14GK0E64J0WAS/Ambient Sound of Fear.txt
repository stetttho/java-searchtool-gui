 This CD came to me highly recommended, and not really knowing what to expect (other than ambient--which says everything and nothing), I was quite taken by this CD, albeit somewhat taken aback at times as well. The CD consists of 6 tracks, each running in the 8 to 10 min. span. "Subjective Loss" starts off very slowly, no melody to speak of, with whispers in the background and an occasional ear-splitting feedback, like someone left the mike open and shook it around, but ending with several minutes of gorgeous sounding synths, like electronic waterfalls. "Elevatorium" features an electric piano, with a radio faintly playing in the background, birds whisteling, a dreamy atmosphere all around. "Aging Cone" is another dreamy piece, it reminded my of Mark Isham, era "Vapor Drawings". "Grass" starts with a dampened gun shot, has dreamy space music with constant talk in the right channel on "what you can achieve in the Marines", eventually leading to an angry crown yelling "Kill Kill Kill"... wow! "Cycles", the last track, starts with dreamy synths, backgrounds whispers, and a fat base line that continously pops up, and ending with women talking about domestic violence... wow again! I've really come to like this CD, although the "Grass" and "Cycles" tracks are a little unsettling. It is hard to review ambient CDs because oftentimes, as is the case here too, it is more about the overall atmosphere than the sounds on the individual tracks. Few melodies to speak of, but lots of undercurrents, with each subsequent listening revealing more and more details. Call this the ambient Sound of Fear.
