 It's hard to believe that it's been more than 7 years since the Verve hit a (commercial) nerve with the beautiful and haunting single "Bitter Sweet Symphony" of the "Urban Hymns" album, but as the years roll by, their biggest hit stands the test of time.   The US release of the "Bitter Sweet Symphony" single (4 tracks, 21 min.) includes 3 addititional non-album tracks that makes this a perfect combo. "Lord I'll Guess I'll Never Know" is a pensive song. "So Sister" is lead singer Richard Ashcroft's at his achingly best, just a beautiful ballad. But the closer "Echo Bass" is the best of the bonus tracks, an up-tempo song reminiscent of the Stone Roses' "Fool's Gold".  After the "Urban Hymns" album, Richard Ashcroft went solo, and he never reached the high of that album. This single presents the best of the Verve, and of Richard Ashcroft. Highly recommended!
