 As we all know by now, it was not the record label that held back the release of Fiona Apple's third album. Instead it was Fiona herself, unhappy with the songs recorded with Jon Brien (the producer also of Fiona's  first 2 albums), who shelfed the results. It took another producer, Mike Elizonda, to get the project back on track. All but 2 of the original songs were re-recorded, and so finally, 6 years after "When the Pawn", "Extraordinary Machine" gets an official release.  "Extraordinary Machine" (12 track; 50 min.) starts and ends with the Jon Brien-produced songs and they do feel out of place compared to the rest. The overall feel of the songs is less intimate than the previous 2 albums, and it hurts the overall sound of the album. Of course there are a number of highlights, including the uptempo tracks "Get Him Back" and "Window", and the gentle "Parting Gift". A lot of the songs sound pleasant, yet lack that certain hook and as a result nowhere does the album reach the peaks found on "When the Pawn" and "Tidal".  As to my 4 star rating: while "Extraordinary Machine" in my opinion is Fiona's weakest album yet (3.5 star compared to the previous CDs), this is of course better than, say, 90 percent of the crap that you'll hear on mainstream radio nowadays (4.5 stars). And let's hope it's not gonna be another 6 years before Fiona issues a new album...
