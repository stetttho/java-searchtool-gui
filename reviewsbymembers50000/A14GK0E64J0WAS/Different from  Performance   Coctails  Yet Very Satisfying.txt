 The Stereophonics' third album is a departure from the "stomp rock" album that was "Performance & Coctails", and may take a while to get used to for those looking for a repeat of that album, but in the end is a very satisfying album. The album starts off where "Performance & Coctails" left off: the opening track "Vegas Two Times" is a great guitar-riff based romper. However, things change very quickly: track 2 "Lying in the Sun" is a very gentle, accoustic guitar-based song, quite pleasant, and very representative for the overall "feel" of the album. "Mr. Writer", a big hit single in the UK, sounds great musically, but leaves to be desired lyrically (lead singer Kelly Jones whaling against and dissing music journalists... yeah, Kelly it's hard to be famous!). Tracks 4 and 5, "Step on My Old Size Nine" and "Have a Nice Day", (both of which also were hits in the UK) are much gentler again, and much more intimate. (I had the good luck of seeing the band in their " US accoustic tour" earlier this year and those songs were fab live.) "Everyday I Think of Money" is one of the other great tracks, with smart lyrics from Kelly. Electric guitars and hooks are not nearly as prominent as they were on the band's previous albums, but no matter, the album provides a more mature sound of the band. "JEEP" is a great album... BUY IT!
