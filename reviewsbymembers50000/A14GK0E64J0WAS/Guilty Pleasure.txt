 Dashboard Confessional's latest album (what's with the title, though?) is one of my 14 yr old daughter's faves, and I must admit that I also like the album.... Let's classify this under "Guilty Pleasures" (not unlike Justin Timberlake's "Justified" album). "A Mark, A Mission, A Brand, A Scar" (13 tracks, 51 min.) starts off with a blaze: the single "Hands Down", "Rapid Hope Loss" and "As Lovers Do" are just excellent. "Carry This Picture" is a bland ballad, though. "Ghost of a Good Thing" is another stand-out track, as is "Am I Missing", with great support for band leader (and songwriter) Chris Carrabba from the rest of the band. The second half of the album lags a bit, although "So Beautiful" is, well, beautiful. Dashboard Confessional has been tagged the poster-child of emo, but to be honest, I don't see it that way (give that tag to Brand New!). Chris Carrabba just writes great songs. Relentless touring has rightfully put DC on the musical map, and this album just confirms it.
