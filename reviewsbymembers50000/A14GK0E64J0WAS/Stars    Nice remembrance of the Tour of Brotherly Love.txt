 I am not a huge fan of the Black Crowes, yes I like them, but nothing more than that. In 2001 the Black Crowes and Oasis co-headlined the Tour of Brotherly Love, one of the best "package tours" I have seen in a long time (I am a huge Oasis fan). I enjoyed that evening tremendously! "Live" is culled from that tour. CD1 (10 tracks, 55 min.) is heavy on tracks from the "Lion" album, which I actually like a lot. "Midnite from the Inside Out" is the show opener and a terrific track. CD2 (9 tracks, 49 min.) is heavier on the hits, including "She Talks to Angels", "Hard to Handle" and of course "Remedy". In all, a nice remembrance to a joyful evening I had a few years ago. The quality sound is not as good as it could be, but that's minor quibbles. With the Black Crowes on indefinite hiatus (and Chris doing solo stuff), who knows whether we'll ever get more of the brothers Robinson. This is a good, but not great live album. But for me this album carries some emotional attachment, and that's good enough for me.
