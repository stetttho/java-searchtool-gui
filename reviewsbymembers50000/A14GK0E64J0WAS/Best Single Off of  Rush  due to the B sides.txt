 "Clocks" is the third single off of Coldplay's "Rush Of Blood to the Head", and by far the best. 5 songs clocking in at 22 min., giving us the best of Coldplay. The version of "Clocks" here is the radio-edit, somewhat shorter than the album version, but still one of the most exciting songs of Coldplay. The other tracks are what make this a "must have" for any Coldplay fan. "Crest of Waves" is a great upbeat track. "Animals" is the best track here, an old concert fave from the 2001 tour and one that was long expected to be on the "Rush" album, but for whatever reason didnt make it on there. It remains a great song, and for the long-time fans, this is the main reason to buy this single. The live tracks are nice too. "Yellow" here is just Chris Martin on the piano, turning the concert-fave into a piano ballad. "In My Place" is from the October 2002 show at Manchester's MEN Arena and finds the fans singing (make that screaming) along, a nice memento for any having seen Coldplay in concert on their "Rush" tour. In all, a top-notch single.
