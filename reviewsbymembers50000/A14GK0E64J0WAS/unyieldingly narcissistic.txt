 I flipped through this book, and it looked like this could be a fun read, with lots of "insider" music references. The stated premise is that the author goes on a roadtrip to visit the actual sites where "famous" (some more than others) rock musicians have died.   "Killing Yourself to Live" (235 pages) is written by rock journalist Chuck Klosterman. It could've been a good book: Klosterman drops names like Interpol, Elliot Smith and Falco (just to pick those) at the drop of a hat. But instead of writing an irreverent book, the author somehow turns the book into an evaluation of his relationships with various women, and how weird and complicated it all is. After a while, the book becomes totally self-absorbed and I really had to drag myself to even finish the book. That said, there were a couple of passages that made me smile, such as Klosterman's visit to Graceland, concluding that "20 million Ellvis fans can, in fact, be wrong". Then there is the author's premise (and analysis) of how Radiohead's "Kid A" album (released in October, 2000) foreshadowed 9/11. I don't buy into the premise, but it made for a couple of entertaining pages.  Too bad the book wasn't more like that throughout. Instead, the author felt he had to share with us what his ups and downs are with the female species. As if we care! The most ironic line in the book comes when the author describes his dislike for LA, among other reasons, because people there are "unyieldingly narcissistic". You don't say Chuck!
