 "Good Dog Bad Dog: The Home Recordings" is the band's 4th album, and the emphasis is on "home recordings". As Linford explains in the liner notes, due to circumstances beyond the band's control (read: label imploded), a batch of songs had been started for the next album but sat unfinished. The band finally touched them up, and self-released them in 1996. (The album was re-released in 2000 by BackPorch/Virgin with one extra track, "It's Never Quite What It Seems".) Contrary to most, if not all other reviews here, I don't find "The Home Recordings" to be one of OTR's best. Instead, I find the album sparse, stark, almost downbeat. For sure there are some really good tracks, in particular the 1-2-3 punch of "Later Days", "All I Ever Need" and "Etcetera Whatever", all of which remain a concert staple these days. After that, though, most of the tunes are just Karen on vocals accompanied by either piano or accoustic guitar. Call it "OTR Unplugged". If that is what you prefer, then this is OTR's best record. I personally like the fuller sound of the whole band. "Good Dog Bad Dog: The Home Recordings" is not at all a bad album, as much as it is a "mood" album and not for everybody's taste. For the casual OTR fan (if there is such a thing!), stick with one of the more accessible albums such as "Films for Radio", "Eve" or "Amateur Shortwave Radio" (the oft-overlooked but brilliant collection of live songs).
