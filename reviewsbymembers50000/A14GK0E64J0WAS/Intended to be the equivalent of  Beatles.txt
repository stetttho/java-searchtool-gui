 (Songs: 5 stars. Compilation: 4 stars. Sound Mix: 3 stars.) I read somewhere that there are now officially more Beach Boys compilations than people, and it's meant to be ironic obviously. Coming on the heels of the "Endless Summer" compilation, this set is supposed to be the equivalent of "The Beatles 1" and "Elvis 30 #1 Hits". In that light, this compliation succeeds... to a degree. Nobody can really question the 30 song selection, many (but not all) of the hits (major, and minor) are here, nor can anyone question the musical genius of Brian Wilson, the "brains" behind the band. What is disappointing is that 13 of the 30 tracks are in mono (albeit in remastered mono). One would have thought/expected that stereo mixes would have appeared, as they are available in many cases. That aside, the Beach Boys are really the sound of summer. Apart from the (many) surfer songs, there are some true gems to be (re)discovered, the best being "Heroes and Villains", in my opinion the best Beach Boys song ever. Listen to this 1967 song carefully, and marvel at the intricate vocals interplay of the band... just beautiful. If you are looking for the "ultimate" Beach Boys studio album, go to "Pet Sounds". For the casual fan, this compliation will do quite fine.
