 A couple of years ago Tangerine Dream teased us with the release of "Soundmill Navigator", a 1976 live album, supposedly setting the stage for a stream of "classic" TD live releases. And then... nothing happened, until now! Here comes "The Bootleg Box Set Vol. 1", a 5 concerts, 7 CD extravaganza containing about 6 hrs of live music covering 1974-1976, with the classic line-up of Egdar Froese, Chris Franke and Peter Baumann. The Sheffield concert (audio recording; 10-29-74; 44 min.) is a Phaedra-era stream of conciousness, not much melody to speak of. The Royal Albert Hall concert (soundboard, 4-2-75; 103 min.) is the highlight of the box, shifting easily from mood pieces to sequencer-driven hard-charging sets, reminiscent of the Rubycon studio album of the same era (and the band is introduced by John Peel, no less!). The Croydon concert (audio; 10-22-75; 61 min.) contains elements of the Ricochet live album, with again great sequencer-driven tracks. The Bilbao concert (audio; 1-31-76; 111 min.) is in the same vein, but not as focused. The Berlin concert (audio; 6-27-76; 31 min.) is the real puzzler on this set: the same concert as "Soundmill navigator" but hardly sounding the same (the sound quality doesn't help), begging the question: why is this included here? In the end, these are minor quibbles. This set is an excellent addition to the Tangerine Dream catalogue of their "classic era" music. I've been waiting for years for a collection like this, and recommend it strongly to any TD fan of the Phaedra-Rubycon-Ricochet era.
