 The "Monster" album remains controversial for many REM fans but in my book it remains my favorite album of REM. This DVD captures REM at the end of the "Monster" tour, and the band is in peak form.  The "Road Movie" DVD (94 min.) is a faithful transfer of the original VHS movie, without any extras or bonus features, but with a noticably better sound quality. The song selection features most of the "Monster" albums tracks (8 of the 20 songs), and then some additional similar-sounding songs that would eventually end up on REM's next album ("Untertow", "Binky the Doormat" and "Wake-Up Bomb"). The sound is of course electric guitar-heavy and distorted, and if that is not your favorite REM sound, this DVD is not for you, although there are several more "traditional" REM songs such as "Losing My Religion", "Everybody Hurts" and "Man on the Moon". Peter Buck, not Michael Stipe, is the star of this movie (and it's hard to outshine Stipe), just watch him for example on "Star 69" and "Let Me In", wow.  In all, a great concert movie, with outstanding audio quality, and with REM at its peak. But that's just my opinion.
