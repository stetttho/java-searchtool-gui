 For those of you who, like me, have had the vinyl and then the CD, the (only) question is: is it worth shelling out another [$$] to get this remastered version? Answer: take your old "New Gold Dream" CD to the used CD store and sell/trade it in, and immediately order this remastered version! To hear gems like "Colors Fly and Catherine Wheel", "Big Sleep", the title track, "King Is White" and, best of all, "Hunter and the Hunted" in this remastered version is like rediscovering an old friend you have forgotten for years. Warning: this Limited Edition" is not the standard jewel case, but a replica of the old vinyl album, with inner sleeve jacket (but no lyrics). It's not particulary handy in my opinion, but no matter. For those casually perusing Simple Minds, the band is so much more than "Dont You Forget About Me". This is by far their best album, and a true classic of the 80s, and  yes, containing some "real" hits as well, in Europe anyway ("Promised You A Miracle", "Glittering Prize" and "Someone Somewhere in Summertime"). In short, a no-miss. BUY IT!
