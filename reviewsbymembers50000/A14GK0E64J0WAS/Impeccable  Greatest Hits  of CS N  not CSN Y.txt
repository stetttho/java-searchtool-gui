 On the heels of the excellent 'politically incorrect' (no recent (post-1992) material as it doesn't qualify as a hit) Neil Young "Greatest Hits" CD some months ago, now arrives an equally excellent greatest hits compilation of Crosby Stills & Nash.  "Greatest Hits" (19 tracks, 76 min.) thankfully is not worried about representing all phases of CSN's long career. It focuses on what the title implies: the greatest hits, nothing more, nothing less. As a consequence, you will find no songs from the more recent albums, in fact there is no music on here that is any more recent than 1982's "Daylight Again" album. The highlights are many. All but 3 tracks of the classic debut album are on here, as is about half of the "CSN" album. Even better, 3 non-Neil Young tracks from "Deja Vu" are on here. (To those wondering why "Woodstock" is not on here, Neil made it pretty much his song--courtesy of the blistering guitar solo, even though he didn't write the song.) The 1982 songs have aged surprisingly well: "Daylight Again", "Southern Cross" and "Wasted on the Way" are very easy on the ears. The remastered sound is outstanding.  So with the Neil Young Greatest Hits album and now the CSN Greatest Hits album in the bag, what remains to be done? How about an equally definitive single-CD Crosby Stills Nash & Young greatest hits compilation?
