 The release of Jeff Tweedy solo and Tweedy-related projects is really rolling along now: besides this album, there is Minus 5's "Down With Wilco" (just released), the pending release of new Wilco material on the "Camera" EP, not to mention of course YHF and "Chelsea Walls", both released in 2002. The trio that makes up Loose Fur consists of sound engineer/producer Jim O'Rourke (who worked on YHF) and Wilco's Tweedy and Glenn Kotche. The album covers 6 songs in 39+ min. Opener "Laminated Cat" and closer "Chinese Apple" are the best tracks (both Tweedy-penned), with that could-have-been-a-YHF-track feeling to it. The other tracks are quite good as well, combining lots of accoustic sounds ("Elegant Transaction") with sound scratches and twists. "So Long" reminds me of Pink Floyd's "San Tropez" (from "Meddle"), updated musically for 2003. Don't expect this to be "YHF 2". It's beyond that, perhaps less ambitious, but in its own right very much enjoyable (more so than the "Down With Wilco" album). As he did on "Chelsea Walls", Tweedy invites you to trust him that he will deliver out-of-the-ordinary, enduring music. And right he is! You won't be disappointed.
