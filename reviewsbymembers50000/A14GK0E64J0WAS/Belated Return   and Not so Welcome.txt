 I am a big Kayak fan (see my reviews of Royal Bed Boucer, Classics, See See The Sun).... and it pains me to tell you that this album doesnt live up to the promise... The "classic" line-up returns (Ton Scherpenzeel, Max Werner, Pim Koopman, Bert Veldkamp) and I thought I'd be in for a nostalgia trip back to the See See the Sun/Royal Bed Bouncer.. but I was in for a disappointment. The trip back is to the "Ruthless Queen" era (which song incidentally is redone, but, not surprisingly, not as good as the original). The album is perfect AOR... all rather mid-tempoed, if not slow, but nice melodies. Not to say that there aren't any good songs on the album. The opener "Close to the Fire" is an 8 min. mini-epic that sets the tone for the album, mid-tempo, soaring melodies and vocals.  All in all... 65 min of "Ruthless Queen/Starlight Dancer/Phantom of the Night" type music... If that is your idea of Kayak, then this is a most welcome return and it'll be a 5 star CD. For me, I was hoping something more adventorous... hence the 3 star rating.
