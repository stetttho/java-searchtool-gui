 I got this this CD from someone in Belgium (where I'm from originally). Hooverphonic is a Belgian band and is pretty big in Belgium and the rest of Europe, with a reputation of fusing danceable, almost ambient tracks with R&B and hip-hop. I hadn't heard anything from this band, so I was kinda curious what I would hear. My own verdict is that this is good, nothing spectacular, but quite a nice and pleasant listen. "Jackie Cane" (which apparently is a concept-album, although you wouldn't pick that up from just listening to it), starts off slowly. The main riff of "Sometimes" reminds me suspiciously of The Verve's "Bittersweet Symphony" (which of course in turn samples the Rolling Stones). Things get interesting on the instrumental "Jackie's Delirium", and the hazy reggae-flavored "Others Delight". Not good is the Spanish-inspired "Day After Day". In all, I was not awed, but it is an album that goes down easy like a smoothie. Before you know it, you find yourself playing it again.
