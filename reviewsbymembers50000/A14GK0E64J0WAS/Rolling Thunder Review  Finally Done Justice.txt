 Until now, the only remembrance of the historic "Rolling Thunder Review" tour has been the 1976 "Hard Rain" live album, which was not bad but not great. This album solves all that, and then some! Interestingly, there is only 1 track overlapping with the "Hard Rain" album (namely that very track), making it even more revealing. This is Zimmy at the top of his game. The highlights are plenty, too many to name. For me personally, the best tracks are the live versions of the 6 songs that were to appear on the "Desire" album, which was about to come out shortly after the tour concluded: a magnificant "Romance in Durango", "Oh Sister" "Isis", "One More Cup of Coffee", "Hurricane", and the aching "Sara".  To fully appreciate "Rolling Thunder Review", I highly recommend the book "On the Road with Bob Dylan", the 1978 book by Larry "Ratso" Sloman (recently reissued), a personal account of that tour, and a truly engaging read.
