 Sarcastically subtitled The (Almost) Integral Telex 1978-1993, this 4 CD set complies all original albums issued by Telex, each supplied with many bonus tracks. (The albums can be bought separately--see my reviews there.)  The set comes with extra booklets containing lyrics and, most entertaining,  tongue in cheek liner notes from Telex's Marc Moulin on each of the songs.  Example (talking about the track Lakele): "A song about twins and  lookalikes. We recently heard that the words might mean something dirty in  Japanese. We were rather surprised to learn that there even could exist  something dirty in Japanese." Or talking about the track Basta:  "We called this number Basta because as soon as it starts to play, you  immediately feel that you've had enough." Haha!  A must for all  serious Telex fans. For the more casual fan, stick with the  "Neurovision" or "Looking for St. Tropez" CD. The  appeal of the Telex sounds endures, 12 years after they issued their last  album, as is evidenced by the seemingly non-stop issues of various Telex  remix albums.
