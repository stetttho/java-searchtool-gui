 Lou Reed released the "The Raven" album in 2003 to less than critical or commercial acclaim. He toured in support of the album, and this live album comes from that tour, documenting the entire concert at the Wiltern in LA in June, 2003.  "Animal Serenade" (20 tracks, 2 CDs, 128 min.) finds Lou and his band with just guitar, bass and piano or cello on most of the tracks. That's right, no drums. Lou nowadays is more a story-teller/singer, and if you can accept that this is not going to be the Lou Reed of the "Rock & Roll Animal" live album of exactly 30 years ago, this in fact turns out to be a great album, perfect for an evening with friends over or a book to read. Smartly, Reed only includes just 4 songs of the disappointing "Raven" album, and instead delves deep into the catalogue, but presenting those songs into a new light, check out for example "Venus in Furs" and "Sunday Morning".  I will gladly admit that I did not expect this album to be as good as it turned out. For the disappointed reviewers that wanted the live Lou Reed of yesteryear, please check out "Live in Italy" (1984) or "Rock & Roll Animal" (1974), but for those wondering what Lou Reed is doing nowadays, this is highly recommended.
