 To hear this 1959-recorded album today, in remastered sound, is a true joy. Miles Davis has recorded tons of albums, but this remains the most famous of them all, for good reason. "Kind of Blue" is the pinnacle of "improvisation in jazz", as the really great liner notes put it. Starting with the first track "So What", the album puts on display the genius of Miles Davis, over and over again. Despite the free-flowing arrangements (or maybe because of them), the album does create a "blue mood", to great effect. Very interesting also is the addition of the bonus track, an alternative take of "Flamenco Sketches". Even for those that are not die-hard jazz fanaticacs (such as myself), you will thank yourself for buying this album. An essential in anyone's CD collection.
