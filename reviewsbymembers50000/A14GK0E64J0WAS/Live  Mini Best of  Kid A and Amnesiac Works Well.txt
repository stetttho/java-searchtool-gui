 Originally intended as a CD single for "I Might Be Wrong (Live)", Radiohead issued this short (40 min.) live album to remember their 2001 tour. It is an unintended "best of" compliation of the Kid A and Amnesiac albums, and works quite well. The album contains pretty straight-forward live versions of "The National Anthem", "I Might Be Wrong", "Morning Bell", "Idioteque", and "Dollar and Cents". The album really delivers with different takes on "Like Spinning Plates" and, foremost, "Everything in its Right Place", giving a truly grand outro of synth distortion. The inclusion of Thom Yorke solo on "True Love Waits" is the icing on the cake. Almost a year after this came out, for whatever reason, I find myself playing this CD more than either of Kid A (which is superb) or Amnesiac (which I found a disappointment). This is a great 40 min. of music, period.
