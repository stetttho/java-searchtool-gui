 When The Afghan Whigs released "1965" in the Fall of 1998, nobody knew of course at the time that this would be the final release of one of Cincinnati's very finest bands ever (sorry, I had to get that in here). Now 5 1/2 years later, the album remains as fresh at is was then, and it truly is the proper exclamation point to the Whig's stelaar output. "1965" (11 tracks, 41 min.) finds Greg Dulli writing darker songs than ever, with great result. Recorded in New Orleans, it broods. The sound is opened up, with some horns (quite a change from the grunge sound of "Up in It" and "Congregation"). Somehow it all just mixes beautifully. There's really not a single bad song on the album, but if forced to select some highlights, my fave tracks include "Crazy", "Uptown Again" (a reference to "Uptown Avondale"?), "Neglekted" (no, not a typo), and the instrumental "The Vampire Lanois".  "1965" found zero commercial success, regretfully. It doesn't diminish from the album's greatness. And while we're at it, isn't it time for a Whigs' box-set treatment? The Whigs disbanded in 2001, and Greg Dulli has found new life with the Twilight Singers. Check out their excellent 2003 album "Blackberry Belle", in spirit an excellent follow-up to "1965".
