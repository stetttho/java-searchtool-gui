 In anticipation of their upcoming "Masterworks Tour" (which I plan to catch when it comes to Cincinnati), I rediscovered their 1973 live album (then 3 LPs, now 2 CDs, remastered). It is "progressive  rock" at its finest, without a doubt. It is essentially a  "greatest hits live" album of all of Yes' finest work to date,  and in many instances, it surpasses the studio versions. Best tracks are  "Siberian Khatru", "Perpetual Change", and "Close  to the Edge". I still get a kick out of the "solo" pieces,  the best one being Rick Wakeman's "Six Wives" excerpts. By all  means, if you're looking for an introduction to Yes, look no further!
