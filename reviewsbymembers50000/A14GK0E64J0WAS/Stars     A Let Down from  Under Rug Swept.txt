 As a huge Alanis fan, I was really looking forward to the release of her new album. Now that I have it, and have listened to it a number of time, I can't help but feel somewhat of a letdown, certainly after the brilliant "Under Rug Swept" album, which in my book remains the best album Alanis has made to date. "So-Called Chaos" (10 tracks, 41 min.) starts off with another recipe to men for living the Alanis way: "Eight Easy Ways" invites comparisons to "21 Things I Want in a Lover" from the previous album. "Out Is Through" is also quite good. After that, however, the album starts to lag. The use of sitar on "Knees of My Bees" sounds out of place (and what is with the song's title?). The title track, the best on the album, gives a much-needed boost of energy, only to then drop off again on "Not All Me" and "This Grudge". The closing track "Everything" (and very curious choice for first single) is reflective of the album: promising but not enough catchy hooks. I do give Alanis credit for keeping the album at 41 min. (similar to the "Under Rug Swept" album). Many artists nowadays feel obligated to fill the CD with 70+ min. of music, even if they have not nearly enough quality material.
