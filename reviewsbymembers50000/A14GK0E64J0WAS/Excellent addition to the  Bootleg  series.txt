 As the years go by, and Zimmy grows older, his shadow and legacy looms ever larger over the music world, in part as a result of the continuing unearthing of Dylan's unreleased and live recordings. What started in 1991 with the 3CD set "The Bootleg Series Volume 1-3 (Rare and Unreleased) 1961-1991" is now up to Volume 7.  "No Direction Home: The Soundtrack (The Bootleg Series Vol. 7)" (2 CDs, 28 tracks, 144 min.) is in my mind (more so than the earlier mentioned "Rare and Unreleased") the equivalent of the Beatles' Anthology 1: a tracing back of Dylan's roots. Not surprisingly, CD1 (16 tracks, 72 min.) is the real treasure. Among the many highlights: "When I Got Troubles", a low-fi 1959 recording (Bob was a senior in HS then), and reportedly the first Dylan song ever recorded; "Dink's Song", a December 1961 recording in a MN hotel room; "Master of War", from a 1963 Carnegie Hall show (the words are chilling to this day); and "Chimes of Freedom" (from the 1964 Newport Jazz Festival). I rate CD1 a strong 4.5 Stars. CD2 (12 tracks, 72 min.) contains mostly alternative takes to well known songs. However, it also includes "Maggie's Farm", one of the 3 songs Bob did electric at the 1965 Newport Jazz Festival (the audio quality is surprisingly strong--too bad the other 2 songs are not included), check out the ear-splitting solos by Michael Bloomfield, I can only imagine the shocked faces in the crowd. Also included are 2 "smokin' hot" songs from the infamous 1966 UK tour: "Ballad of a Thin Man" (from a show 3 days later than the show on Bootleg Vo. 4) and of course the "Judas" version of "Like a Rolling Stone", which already appeared on Bootleg Vol. 4, but for historical perspective is included here as well. Given that I'm not a great fan of "alternative takes", I nevertheless rate CD2 a decent 3.5 stars.  As the liner notes state, "this is not a soundtrack in the traditional sense". I can't wait to see what famed director Martin Scorsese has made of "No Direction Home", due later this month. Meanwhile, this Bootleg  Vol. 7 continues the high standard of this series set previously.
