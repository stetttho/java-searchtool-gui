 This is Chicago's second album, released in 1970, originally a double (vinyl) album, and released now with historical perspective by the fine folks at Rhino (is there a better re-issue label around? and no, they didn't pay me to say that!).  "Chicago" (25 tracks, 73 min.) is best known for its 3 hit singles "Make Me SMile", "Colour My World" (never understood why the British spelling was used) and "25 or 6 to 4", but I enjoy some of the lesser-know tracks just as much, if not more. Take "Poem for the People" for example, with exquisite interplay by the horns, which in 1970 was still pretty novel for a rock band. The "It Better End Soon" suite (tracks 19-23, side D of the original album) is Chicago at its non-commercial, progressive best. This reissue comes with great liner notes (but not the lyrics) and the bonus single versions of "Make Me Smile" and "25 or 6 to 4", which isn't really necessary but hey, it's a nice way to round out the 79 min. capacity of a single CD. I have never seen Chicago in concert, and for a fleeting moment I was tempted to go see them recently here in Cincinnati on the double-header with Earth Wind & Fire. Couldn't do it, for fear of disappointment. "Live in Japan 1972" is such an incredible live recording that I knew I would be disappointed.
