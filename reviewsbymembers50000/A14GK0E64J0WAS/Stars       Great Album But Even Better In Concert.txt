 Album: 4 stars; Live: 5 stars  The Secret Machines have been making some waves with the catchy single "Nowhere Again" on alternative radio. I liked the song, but I wasn't really compelled to buy this album until I saw the band in concert recently twicein a matter of weeks, once headlining a small club gig, and then opening for Interpol. I was blown away, it's just that plain simple.  "Now Here Is Nowhere" (9 tracks; 50 min.) is bookended by two epic 9 min. tracks. The opener "First Wave Intact" is the best track of the album, with the baddest drum playing in a long time (when the band played this in concert, I thought of the drummer "this is John Bonham incarnate!"). The closer is the title track, starting off very sweetly but then exploding into another heavy drum-driven rocker, just great. In between are some other gems, in particular "Light's On" and "Pharaoh's Daughter".   Musically, the Secret Machines are indebted to many different influences, including Led Zep, U2, heck even Flaming Lips and let's throw in Radiohead for good measure. But the trio creates a sound of their own, with great result. One of the better albums of 2004. And in case you hadn't gotten the message yet, check these guys out live, you will be rocked!
