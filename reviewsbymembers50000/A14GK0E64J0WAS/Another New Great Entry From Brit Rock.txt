 Starsailor has created quite a stir in England, where the group is hailed as the next (take your pick) Radiohead/Coldplay/Travis. Let me tell they are not good as any of them, but they are still quite good! "Love Is Here" is an engaging album, lead by 21 year old James Walsh telling us stories of his young life so far. The album boasts 4 singles so far: "Lullaby", "Alcoholic" (with haunting lyrics like "Dont you know you have your daddy's eyes/Your daddy was an alcoholic"), "Fever" and of course "Good Souls", the song that has captured the (limited) attention of US radio. They are quite good, no question. Check out also the beautiful title track ("Cant you feel it? Love is here!"). The comparisons to other groups such as Coldplay are quite unfair, and I hope StarSailor will given a chance to find their own place. Meanwhile, check out this engaging debut album!
