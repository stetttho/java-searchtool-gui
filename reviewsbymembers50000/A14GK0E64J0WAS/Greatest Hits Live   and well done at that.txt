 15 years into the Goo's career, the band has resisted releasing a proper "greatest hits" album. 2001's "Ego, Opinion, Arts & Commerce" compilation was a mixed bag of some (but not all) hits, early songs and obscurities.   Now comes "Live in Buffalo" (20 tracks, 77 min.), which for all practical purposes is a "greatest hits live" collection. All the classics are here, from "Name" (their biggest hit, as unreprestative as it is of their overall sound), to "Black Balloon", "Slide", "Broadway" and of course "Iris". While of course Rzeznik is the prime writer behind the Goo's, I'm glad that Takac gets a few tracks, including the excellent "January Friend", "Smash" and "Tucked Away", all of them all-out rockers, reminiscent of the early Goo days.  While near impossible to detect from the CD audio quality, the accompanying DVD shows that a torrential down-pour almost brought the show to a halt close to the end of the show. So the better for the band to soldier on! I've been a fan of the Goo's  since the early days, and unlike some fans, do not begrudge at all the mainstraim succes the Goo's have obtained, straying from the early day "punk-rock" sound. Until we get a proper "greatest hits" CD, this is as good as it gets, and well done at that.
