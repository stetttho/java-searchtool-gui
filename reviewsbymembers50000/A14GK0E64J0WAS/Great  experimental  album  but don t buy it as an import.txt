 How strange things can go sometimes... The Coral's second album "Magic & Medicine" was released in Europe last summer. As a stop-gap until the full-fledged third album comes out, the Coral released this "limited edition mini-album" in the UK in January, 2004. Meanwhile, "Magic & Medicine" was finally released in the US earlier this month, and it came with a bonus CD, you guessed it, this very "mini-album"!  "Nightfreak and the Sons of Becker" (11 tracks, 28 min.) was recorded "live" in studio in a matter of a week. The sound is clearly "rougher" and less-produced than their earlier albums. But those songs!! The quality just oozes out! Musical styles are all over the place. From straight-on rock to reggae-flavored to Beatlesque pop to 80's punk, the Coral don't tie themselves down, and to great effect. Best songs include "Grey Harpoon", "Migraine", "Precious Eyes" and "Sorrow or the Song". For obvious reasons, there really is no point buying this release separately when you can get it for free with the purchase of the US version of "Magic & Medicine. But "Nightfreak and the Sons of Becker" is a fine album on it own nevertheless!
