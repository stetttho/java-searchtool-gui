 This is the long-rumored "best of" CD of various recording sessions Ryan collected during 2001, and while it is a mixed bag, and certainly not up to par to either "Heartbreaker" or "Gold", it contains enough good stuff to tie us over to the proper follow-up to "Gold", due Spring 2003. At 45 min. (compared to the sprawling "Gold"), this is a more focused serving of Ryan's wandering mind and music. "Nuclear" (issued as a single in Europe) is a great start.  The Ethan Johns-produced and influenced tracks (3 of them) are great and could have fitted nicely on "Gold", particularly "Hallelujah". The best track on the album is the intimate "Reason to Cry". Haunting also is the sad "Tomorrow" (co-written by Carrie Hamilton (Caroll Burnett's daughter), then Ryan's significant other, who subsequently passed away and to whom the album is dedicated). Other great tracks are "Dear Chicago" and "Chin Up Cheer Up". Not good at all is "Starting to Hurt", with Ryan sounding like a Bryan Adams clone (urrghh), raspy voice and all. I am really looking forward to the next "real" Ryan album. Meanwhile we will do with this.
