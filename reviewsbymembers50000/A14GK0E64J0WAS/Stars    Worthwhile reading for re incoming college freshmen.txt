 My son and I went through the college search process in the past year (he'll start college next month), and we actually had quite a good time doing the college campus visits, narrowing down his choices, etc. Now that he is about to start college, I fell upon this book by accident.  "Making the Most of College" is from some professor at Harvard whom I readily admit I've never heard about before. But the author actually makes a number of (seemingly) good points that I thought made a lot of sense (disclaimer: I did not go to college in the US but in Belgium, so I cannot easily compare it to "the old days"). The book does get tedious at times,and as such is not geared to/written for incoming freshmen but more for parents and teachers. I cannot imagine too many incoming freshmen reading through the whole thing (my son certainly did not), but I did discuss certain passages of the book with him. What good (if any) it will do him, who knows... only time will tell :-)
