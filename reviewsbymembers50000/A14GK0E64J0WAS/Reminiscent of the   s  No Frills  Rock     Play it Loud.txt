 The Akron-based duo Black Keys (not to be confused with that other white color-named duo from Detroit) serve up their latest serving of 70s influenced rock-and-blues garage sound, and this time better than ever. This album just explodes with energy!  "Rubber Factory" (13 tracks, 41 min.) starts off with a blazing "When the Lights Go Out", and doesn't let up from there. "The Desparate Man" sounds like The Jimi Hendrix Experience revived right here in your veru own living room, as does "Girl Is On My Mind", really outstanding. "The Lenghts" is the unexpected track, a ballad of some sort (gulp?), but it works somehow. "Stack Shot Billy" and "Aeroplane Blues" are heavy blues-influenced tracks. The album closer "Till I Get My Way" sums up the album perfectly, an all-out rocker with strong guitar-feedback, wow.  The Black Keys are coming to Cincinnati shortly, and that's a show I'm not gonna miss. I can't wait to see these guys bring the songs from "Rubber Factory" in a live setting. Obviously this album isn't gonna be big on the charts, but no matter, this is a great album. And please, play it loud!
