 Leona Naess really established herself on her previous (2nd) album, "I Tried To Rock You", which contained the type of radio-savvy tracks that should reach the airwaves.  They didn't, and perhaps that's why Leona has retreated for her third CD. This self-titled album (11 tracks, 45 min.) is generally speaking much sparser musically than "I Tried To Rock You". The album is produced (and influenced?) by Ethan Johns (primarily associated with Leona's significant other, Ryan Adams). Opening track (and first single) "Calling" is the most radio-friendly track. The problem is that, while I find the song pleasant while it's on, one minute after it's over I can't recall its tune. The best tracks include "Dues To Pay" (which I imagine could have been a Sheryl Crowe tune), "Yes It's Called Desire" and "Ballerina". Not good is "He's Gone", which is too light-weight, and "How Sweet", with is syrup-like arrangement of strings. I don't dislike this album, not at all. But for some reason, the songs don't stick with me, like they did on "I Tried to Rock You". Three albums into her career, one gets the sense that Loena is still trying to find the direction in which to go. I'll be an interested follower of that.
