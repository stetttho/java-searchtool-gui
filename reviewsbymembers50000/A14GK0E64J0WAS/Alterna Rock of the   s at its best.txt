 One of the best concerts I ever saw was in early 1996, a triple header of opener No Doubt (just before "Tragic Kingdom" became a smash hit), GooGoo Dolls (as they were about to hit it big with "Name") and headliner Bush, riding the wave with "Sixteen Stone". 7 years later, Bush has found it hard to sustain that success, but the album remains a testament to the alterna-rock that shaped the mid-90s. The album has little flaws, and remains a strong listen today.  Of course, there are the hits "Everything Zen", "Comedown", "Machine Head" and "Glycerine", but the album goes deeper than that. Check out "Swim", "Bomb", and "Monkey", all tracks that could have also been released as singles. Some years ago I might have qualified this album as a "guilty pleasure", I mean, how cool was it really to find this album good? But the truth is, this album has stood the test of time, period. Too bad that Bush never was able to put together an album of the same quality, but meanwhile we continue to enjoy "Sixteen Stone", a true pillar in the forest of the 90s alterna-rock era.
