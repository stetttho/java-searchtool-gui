 For many "Spend The Night" will come as the "debut" album of the Donnas, but in reality this is their 5th album, yes, you read right! The Donnas have been hard at work since their self-titled debut album in 1997. (Incidentally, the band's name is a take-off on the Ramones, with each member taking on an "alternative" ego.) "Spend the Night" covers 13 tunes in 39 min, and is a basic rock-n-roll band sound, swinging out. Best tunes are the current single "Take It Off", the opener "It's On the Rocks", "Who Invited You", and "Take Me to the Backseat". Prevalent are the ironic lyrics in all those tunes, just great. The Donnas are often compared to the Runaways, and it's a fair comparison, to a degree. But their music ability is much greater (sorry, Joan Jett), and their long-time career outlook is great. They are coming to Cincinnati soon, and it's sure one show I will not miss!
