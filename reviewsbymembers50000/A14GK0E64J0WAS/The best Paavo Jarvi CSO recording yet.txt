 Paavo Jarvi became the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra's musical director in September 2001, and this makes the 8th CD release since then. The CSO is always fighting for the proper attention in the (long) shadows of the Cleveland Orchestra, but with Maestro Jarvi at the helm, this orchestra is reaching new heights.  This recording (68 min.) showcases Dvorak's universally loved (and my personal favorite) Symphony No. 9 in E Minor, better known as the symphony "From the New World", and the recording is A grade all the way, both technically and from a musical sense. I have the LA Philarmonic Orchestra's CD of the same symphony, and even I, not a classical music expert, can hear the difference between the two, the CSO's recording is simply superb. The other symphony on this CD is Martinu's Symphony No. 2, which I personnaly found a curious choice. Other than both composers being from the (now) Czech Republic, I don't see the synergy, not that Martinu's symphony is "bad", but it just doesn't measure up to Dvorak. As an aside, the liner notes from Kyle Gann are very insightful.  I am rating this CD 5 stars on the strength of the impaccable offering of the "New World" symphony. For another superb CD of Paavo Jarvi and the CSO, check out 2003's release of Prokofiev's "Romeo and Juliet" complete suites from that ballet, among others, but there are other CDs on the Telearc label worth checking out as well. The CSO is one of America's best kept secrets, you won't be dissappointed!
