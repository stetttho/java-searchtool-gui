 (Music: 4 1/2 Stars, Compilation: 3 1/2 Stars) I had the 2 vinyl albums from the early 80s, but hadn't listened to Yazoo literally in years until I came onto this "Best of". The good news is that the music you find on here, is mostly terrific. Synth-wiz (and ex-Depeche Mode) Vince Clarke and singer Alison Moyet create upbeat, hard-to-resist-to-dance tracks (such as "Only You", "Situation", "State Farm") as well as achingly beautiful ballads ("Only You", "Ode to Boy", "Winter Kills"). Yet this compilation is flawed. Not only are some key tracks missing (including the single "The Other Side of Love"), the three 1999 remixes at the end are pointless, quite frankly. In the end, until the "ultimate" best-of is issued, we can enjoy this. Yazoo was short-lived (1982-83), but does leave a nice legacy. PS: Did you know that Yazoo came about when Vince, just departed from Depeche Mode, responded to an ad from Alison in Melody Maker, looking for "rootsy blues musicians"? True story!
