 The Vines have logically "evolved" from their first album to "Winning Days", and hit the jackpot again. Mixing high energy songs with more reflective tunes, "Winning Days" is a winner. "Winning Days" (11 tracks, 38 min.) starts off with the current single "Ride", an irresitable stomper, as is the second track "Animal Machine". Things take a much different take in the middle section of the album, with accoustic and reflective tracks like "Autumn Shade II", "Amnesia" and the title track. "She's Got Something to Say to Me" sounds outright Beatlesque circa "Revolver", just beautiful. The album is bookended with another couple of high energy tunes. The perception of the Vines is just about the high energy songs. When I saw them on tour for the "Highly Evolved" album, people were actually booing when they played their more reflective songs of that album! The reality is that the Vines are much more varied than just "Ride". "Winning Days" is an excellent album, if you can look behind the misperception of "Ride".
