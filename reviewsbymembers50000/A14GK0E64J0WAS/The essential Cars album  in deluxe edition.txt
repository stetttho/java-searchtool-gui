 Although the Cars made a number of good albums, their self-titled debut album remains the band's sole truly essential album. It made a big splash when it came out in 1978, and deservedly so.  This is the "deluxe edition" of "The Cars". CD1 (9 tracks, 35 min.) is of course the original album, which plays effortlessly still after all these years. "Moving in Stereo" remain a little gem of a song. Take note also of the Strokes-like running time of the entire album, which of course was pretty much standard in those days. Why do so many bands today feel compelled to issue 60 or 70 min. albums? But I digress...  CD2 (14 tracks, 56 min.) starts with a rousing 1978 live version of "Good Times Roll", recorded at a small Boston club. Next are demo tracks of the 8 other tracks of the album, including the "Just What I Needed" demo that landed the band a record deal. The demos are surprisingly good and polished. Last but certainly not least are 5 unreleased demos, of which "They Won't See You" and "Take What You Want" are the best.
