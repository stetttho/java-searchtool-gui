 I have read a number of the reviews, and am somewhat disappointed that many reviewers take this space to express their own political views (generally along the lines of how "bad" a president George Bush has been), but not enough about the merits and entertainment value of this book. I mean, isn't that why we read books (or listen to a CD or watch a movie)? We want to be entertained, and maybe (hopefully) learn a thing or two along the way. On those standards, "The Right Man: The Surprise Presidency of George W. Bush" passes the test easily. I read this book recently while on vacation, on a beach, to give you an idea of my state of mind while reading this book.  David Frum was a speechwriter on economic issues for about 14 months (early 2001 to early 2002). Is the account of the Bush-insider self-serving to a degree? Sure it is, but what's wrong with that? (Do you believe for one second that Bill Clinton's autobiography is not?) What appealed to me most were Frum's observations and insights on the "power struggle" between Karl Rove and Karen Hughes, and around them. In fact, for a White House administration that on the outside comes across well-disciplined, the overwhelming feeling one gets is that EVERYTHING is a power struggle. How anything ever gets decided anymore, is amazing to me.  The Amazon.com editorial review is sceptical that Frum left on his own device. I never got that impression. Frum's explanation that in a post-9/11 landscape, where economic issues are secondary to fighting the war on terrorosm, and therefore the need for a economic speechwriter is greatly diminished, came across as reasonable and credible to me. Maybe I'm just naive, who knows. In any event, I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and that's good enough for me, although I imagine that many of the anti-Bush zealots may feel differently.
