 I picked up this book on the fly from my local library, as I was getting ready to go on vacation and in need of some "beach reading" (literally). I had vaguely heard about the book, primarily because of the sub-plot involving one of the high school kids trying to get John Mayer to perform at the prom.  As it turns out, this reads like a baby eats candy: effortlessly. The author (a senior writer at Sports illustrated) follows the high school kids at Pennsbury HS (in suburban PA) for the entire 02-03 academic year. He picks about 10 kids around which to focus the main developments through the school year, and it really is a soap. Will the football team QB get a scholarschip at a big school? What happens to the prom queen with the mysterious boyfriend that nobody ever sees? Can the go-get-'em junior really convince then pre-Grammy winner and up-and-coming John Mayer to play at the prom? Before you realize it, you are turning the pages, eager to find out how it all plays out.  When I'm on vacation, on a beach, this is exactly the type of book I want to read: entertaining, engaging, not too complex, yet real. Highly recommended for brainless, effortless summer reading!
