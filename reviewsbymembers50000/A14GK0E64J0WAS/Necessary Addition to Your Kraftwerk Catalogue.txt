 The "Tour de France" single was issued in 1983, and has never been featured on any Kraftwerk album. This 1999 remaster features the 3 original tracks and a video. The 3 tracks (Radio Version, Kling Klan Mix, Francois K. Remix) is in essence a 16 min non-stop medley of the song, which is a tribute to the greatest bike race on earth (Ralph Hutter and Florian Schneider are themselves bike affectionados). The 3 tracks go back and forth between the basic tune and elaborations on drums and loops, quite mesmorising actually! Bottom line: while not the best work of Kraftwerk, a nessesary edition to all Kraftwerk lovers!
