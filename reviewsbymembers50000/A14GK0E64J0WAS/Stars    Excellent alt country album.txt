 I will admit outright that I was not familiar with Kathleen Edwards. She was the opener on a recent My Mourning Jacket tour, that's how she got on my radar screen. This is Kathleen Edwards' second album, after 2003's "Failer".  "Back To Me" (11 tracks, 49 min.) offers tales of everyday life, set to the best alt-country music I have heard in a long time (sorry, Ryan Adams), not unlike, say, the equally great Lucinda Williams. There are many outstanding tracks, from the opener "In State", which Edwards brings with a maturity belying the fact that this is only her second album. Other highlights include "Copied Keys", perfectly scetching the feelings of someone who has moved to another city for love's sake; the sparse "Away" (where vocally she reminds me of Judie Tzuck, the obscure singer-songwriter of the late 70's/early 80s); the rocking title track; and "Independent Thief", with backing vocals by MMJ's Jim James, for me the best track of the album. Edwards' guitar work is outstanding throughout, check out for example the afore-mentioned "Copied Keys".  The irony is that for whatever reason I missed Kathleen Edwards when I saw MMJ in concert 2 months ago. You can bet I will not make that same mistake again! I can't wait to see how these songs translate in a live setting. Meanwhile, enjoy "Back to Me", it truly is an outstanding album.
