 The most popular live album of Neil Young is 1979's "Live Rust" but in truth "Weld" (2 CDs, 16 tracks, 121 min.) is the better and showcases Neil Young and Crazy Horse at their peak in concert. Touring behind the then-just released "Ragged Glory" album, this is Neil in all-out grunge mode.  CD1 (8 tracks, 54 min.) starts off with "Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black)", of course also found on "Live Rust". But things start cooking with "Crime in the City". The Dylan cover "Blowin' In the Wind" is a slowed-down version of the original, and in my opinion it just doesn't work well. Not surprisingly there are 5 songs from the "Ragged Glory" album on this live set. "Love to Burn" and "Mansion on the Hill" are terrific. CD2 (8 tracks, 67 min.) is even better, starting with a scorching "Cortez the Killer". "Ragged Glory" tracks "Love and Only Love" and "Farmer John" are standouts. The 13 min. "Like a Hurricane" is the peak of this set, with Neil's guitar solos going forever, just fab. For good measure we get a superb "Tonight's the Night" after that.  Four years after "Weld", Neil would outgrunge the grunge with "Mirror Ball", but "Weld" is as good a testament to his grunge period as anything else. Early pressings of "Weld" came with a bonus disc "Arc", an incomprehensible 33 min. track of continuous guitar feedback workout, not unlike Lou Reed's "Metal Machine Music". It's not for everyone, but worth checking out. I've seen Neil live a number of times over the years, but unfortunately not on the "Weld" tour. This is a superb live set. Highly recommended!
