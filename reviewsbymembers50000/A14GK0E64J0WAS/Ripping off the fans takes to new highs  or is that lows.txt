 A mere 5 months after the second "Love is Hell" EP was issued, Lost Highway Records now has the audacity of issuing the "Love is Hell" album "as intended by the artist". Presumably to entice the fans, one bonus track is added ("Anybody Wanna Take Me Home") but is anyone fooled by this quick money-grabbing job? (Or might the fact that "Rock N Roll", the label-ordered replacement, and horrible, album rightfully sank like a stone almost immediately upon its release last November, have something to do with this?) "Love Is Hell" (16 tracks, 65 min.) is of course the true follow-up album to 2001's "Gold" and a great collection of Ryan Adams whining and pining at his best. Standout tracks include "This House is Not For Sale", the haunting Oasis-cover "Wonderwall", "The Shadowlands", "I See Monsters" and "Hotel Chelsea Nights".  Nothing wrong with the music here. Why the label rejected this album is a mystery (probably the same suits that rejected Wilco's "Yankee Hotel Foxtrot"). To now issue "Love is Hell" as a true album, mere months after issuing this same collection of songs on separate EPs, is outrageous. I used to think Lost Highway Records was a cool label, not like the "major" labels. Guess I've been proven wrong...
