 This CD is great.  I bought this CD with the belief that AC/DC had only three good songs (Back in Black, You Shook Me All Night Long, and Highway to Hell), but now, after listening to this CD, that's changed.  There are numerable memorable songs, and parts of songs, notably the intro to Hell's Bells, such a great intro to a pretty good song.  Others end up having a huge impact, Shoot to Thrill is a playbook 80's rock song, that turns out great through the screaming of the lead singer and Young's electrifying guitars.  Rock and Roll Ain't Noise Pollution is a relatively simple song that manages to be great.  All the songs have good lyrics if you can decypher them, and the digital remastering really shows.  When I first previewed this new CD before buying it, I noticed right away the difference in You Shook Me All Night Long.  The intro has new depth I could never hear.  If you like this sort of music, this is a must buy, along with AC/DCs other great albums.
