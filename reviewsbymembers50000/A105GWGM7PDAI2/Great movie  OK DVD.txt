 This movie is a great.  A modern classic.  It's one of my top three movies, along with Memento and Chasing Amy.  I'd definatly buy this movie for the movie, but if you're a DVD buff looking for a DVD jam-packed with special features, hold out until November to buy the Special Edition with four DVDs.  The movie itself is great, but the DVD is a little twitchy.  Right out of the box, some parts of it skipped for me.  It seemed to load a little slowly on my new Sony DVD player, and even slower on my Playstation 2.  I don't really like the menus, and the special features are kind of lacking.  But the movie!
