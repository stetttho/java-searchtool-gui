 This is a great CD, but in my opinion, it is not Dave Matthews' best, my favorite of his is Crash, followed by Everyday.  I'd have to say this is my third favorite album of his.  I tend to like Dave's songs when they're more upbeat, and this CD isn't really upbeat.  Its great listening, and is musically very complete.  Even though its not Dave's best, its still a very good CD, so I'd recommend it to anyone who is a fan of his music or soft rock.
