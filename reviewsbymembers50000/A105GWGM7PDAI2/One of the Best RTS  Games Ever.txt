 I've only played through the human campaign, and I'm already hooked on this game.  I have played as the other races in custom games, but I'm not going to tackle Battle.Net (Although I'm sure that is excellent) until I've gone through the game.  Anyway, the game is one of the best RTS (Real-Time-Strategy for the uninitiated) games I've ever played.  The story is engrossing, and I can't wait to play more to find out what happens to the world in Warcraft.  All the races, although very different, are pretty much perfectly balanced.  The aspects that are different from the older Warcraft games are great, such as the addition of two races, the 3D view (You can zoom in to be right in the action), and the addition of the Hero unit is great.  I love the Hero, because it combines an RPG element with an RTS, and I love both.  The union is superb.  The cutscenes in this game are also excellent.  I wish I had bought the Collecter's Edition so I could get the cutscene DVD.  I would buy this game, it is well worth the money.  I hope Blizzard continues to produce games of this quality, and I can't wait for World of Warcraft to come out.  This game, in my opinion, is far better than Starcraft or the other Warcraft games.  Buy it!
