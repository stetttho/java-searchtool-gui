 Counter-Strike is a spectacular mod for a spectacular game.  Half-Life, though somewhat outdated now, is still one of the best FPS games ever made.  The gameplay is superb, and the mods that have spawned from the game are great in their own right.  Counter-Strike is one of those great mods.  Counter-Stike is so great, that Sierra decided to sell a retail version of the game.  This is why I am giving this only one star, in spite of the spectacularness of the game.  Go to pretty much any website where games can be downloaded, and you can get this game, provided you have Half-Life, for free.  Yes for free.  The file however, is fairly large, but even so, it is probably worse to buy a game you can get for free than it is to leave a slow internet connection on all night so you can get this game.  Basically, this game is great, and though it is worth the price, it is still available for free, so that price isn't worth it.
