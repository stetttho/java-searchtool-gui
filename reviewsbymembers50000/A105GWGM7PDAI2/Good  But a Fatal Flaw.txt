 I love the Simpsons.  I love the fact that now, some fifteen seasons later, Fox has finally started releasing the seasons on DVD.  I have both seasons, and I can't wait for the third.  I was suprised by the lack of features on the first season DVD set, and although there aren't very many here, there are more, which is great.  I love most of the episodes in this season, and I think some of them are my favorites, plus, we get the first Treehouse of Horror.  Now, the fatal flaw - Before you get to touch the episodes, you ahve to go through an annoying spin the heads game, where you get the correct heads to go on the correct bodies of characters.  It's always three or something spins before it happens, but it is very annoying after the first time.  I don't like having to go through this annoying feature every time I switch discs, which is frequently, since I browse my favorite episodes, and they're spread over the discs.  Even because of this, all Simpsons lovers, and even occasional viewers should buy this DVD set!
