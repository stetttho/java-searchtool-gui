 The movie itself is a masterpiece, and is one of my favorites.  The DVD makes the movie much more of great experience.  The only problem that I've had with this DVD is that you can't view the movie in its original, theatrical form, but its not too much of a problem because the added scenes really add to the movie, and I now think of the theatrical edition as the lesser edition.  The movie itself had to be split up onto two DVDs because of all the commentaries that are now on the DVD.  With many movies that I've seen, the commentaries will start off strong and interesting, but will soon be reduced into long gaps and the director saying, "I really love this shot here..."  and then trailing off again.  Not so with this DVD.  All I have watched so far is the director and writer's commentary, and it is very interesting, and there are very few long gaps of silence.  This DVD is huge, and it will take me a very long time to get through all the features on it.  As an added bonus, on this DVD you can find the Two Towers trailer that was attached to Fellowship of the Ring while it was still in theaters, and you can also see MTV's spoof of the Council of Elrond scene.  The second two discs have a treasure trove of stuff to go through, and I haven't seen much of it, but what I have seen is very interesting.  This DVD is a must have for any LOTR fan, and is a welcome addition to my DVD collection.  The sound quality seems to have been improved dramatically from the theatrical DVD release.  All in all, this is a great DVD worth buying.  The packaging is even interesting to look at.
