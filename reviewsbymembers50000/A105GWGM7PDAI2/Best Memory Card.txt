 I love this memory card.  I was sharing a memory card with my brother for a while, and I found that some games allowed only one save per card, so I bought another one.  It's great to have my own now, and although you can get cards with more space, they are significantly less stable than the official one.  Buy this one, it's hard to fill 8 megs unless you have more than 8 games with multiple saves.
