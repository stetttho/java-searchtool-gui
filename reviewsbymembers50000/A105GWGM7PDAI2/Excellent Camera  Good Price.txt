 This is by far the best camera I have ever bought.  It is my first digital camera, and it's performance far exceeds the performance of my past film cameras.  For its size and price, this camera is excellent.  Compared to the S330, I would buy the S330, but I couldn't afford it when I bought this. The Good Takes great motion pictures - I took a picture of my fan while it was moving, and the picture came out as if it were still! Size - Nice and small, but big enough that me, with larger hands, can still operate it Movie Mode - Don't buy the camera for this mode, but it's a great toy to fool around with Sturdy - Even though it's small, it feels tough The Bad Included CF - Only 8meg card.  That's only about 12 pics.  I bought a 128meg card, which is much better, because I can hold about 100 high res pictures or 200 med res. No Case - The case isn't included, and is selling for [$$], and Canon could have easily included this Zoom - Only 2x.  Not very helpful, but its better than 1x The Ugly Nothing really So, in short, if you're looking for a mid-priced camera for school, work, or vacation that is good for it's size, go for this camera.
