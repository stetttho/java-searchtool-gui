 Now, I don't actually know if this is the Ultimate Edition, since the preview picture has the cover of the Special Edition, the one with almost no special features.  The Ultimate Edition I bought at Fye, at a slightly higher cost, but I knew it was the right edition.  It has T2 on it in metal foil.  There are so many hidden extras and special features, and the menus themselves kept me occupied for about a half hour.  I recommend this movie to anyone.  ANYONE.
