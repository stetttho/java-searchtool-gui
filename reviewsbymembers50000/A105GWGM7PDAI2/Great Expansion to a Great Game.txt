 The storyline of WC3:RoC continues with FT, and it continues well.  Illidan, who had been MIA at the end of RoC, returns, with the hope of crushing the Lich King for one of the last demon lords still around after the defeat of Archimonde.  Other returning characters are Tyrande Whisperwind, Furion Stormrage, Prince (Now king) Arthas, Slyvanis Windrunner, and more.  The story is great, and its more intriguing than the one in RoC, and we also get some backstory relating to the original two Warcraft games, which is great.  Its amazing how Blizzard managed to integrate the stories of the three games.  I haven't delved into multiplayer much, because one drawback of this game is that everyone is now a Level 1 player to start off, so, as a former Level 5 guy, I'm now playing Level 10 RoC players who have become the same level as me, which is intimidating.  A couple of drawbacks are the lack of cinematics (Only two), and the sad absence of an Orc campaign, replaced by a bonus campaign designed to showcase the new advances in the map editor.  While the new advances are neat, nothing can replace good old fashioned orcs.  Also, some of the new multiplayer maps are terrible.  They brought back boats in this game, but the only real benefits to the boats are troop transport.  While there are battleships and frigates, they are really only there to protect the transports.  The addition of boats was actually a more annoying thing, as now there are missions and maps that split everything into islands, and you need to get boats just to get them.  Overall, this game is great, and a worthy addition to any PC game collection.
