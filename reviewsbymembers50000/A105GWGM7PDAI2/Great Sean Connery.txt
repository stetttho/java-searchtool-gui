 This is a great movie.  I'd recommend the movie to any lover of Sean Connery, Nick Cage, Ed Harris, or action movies.  Any type of movie for that matter. Sean Connery seems made for this role, a bitter British agent improsoned for life without trial.  His cynisism and great quips make this movie a joy to watch.  He constantly will snap back to Nick Cage with a wonderful little quote, my favorite being "Loser's whine about doing their best..... Nick Cage also gives a great performance, and he seems almost made for the role as a reluctant chemical engeneer thrust into an environment he doesn't understand with a man he doesn't trust or know.  The movie plays Cage off of Connery, and the result is great dialouge mixed with awesome action sequences.  Ed Harris plays the angered general who doesn't want his men, killed in top secret missions with him, to have their families go uncompinsated.  You get a great view at his inner torments of wanting his goals to be completed, however, he doesn't want to be responsible for the deaths of many people in San Fransisco.  The movie's action and acting is superb, and it is one of my favorite movies.  I'd definatly recommend it.
