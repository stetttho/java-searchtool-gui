 I was so anxious to get a camera case I almost bought a generic case for my S200 from Best Buy.  Good thing I waited to buy this case, as it is far superior to any generic case I could have bought.  This case is the perfect size for my Elph, it does add size to the camera, making it harder to get in your pocket, but the belt clip works great, so its hardly ever a problem.  Good color for the case, and the front pocket holds enough to help out when you need another battery or flash card.  The strap still comes out of one of the sides of the case, so you can still use it.  Not a case to protect from the elements, but it will protect from impacts VERY well.  For it's price, less than the generic cases, and its great fit and quality, I would most definatly buy this case again if my current one were to ever wear out or become lost.
