 I love this game.  It's occupied a crazy amount of my life.  I have never liked a racing game this much.  I think the only game that occupied my attention this much was my three day rush to beat Summoner so I could return it before it was selling, not returning for full price.  I race whenever I have free time, and it doesn't get old because simulation mode keeps thing fresh, and I will have stuff to beat there for a long time.  I race my friends, and we have great fun doing it.  There are many cars and some are really cool, but sadly, no Porsche.  However, there is RUF, whose body designs are modeled on a German made car.  Guess which German car that car is?  The Porsche.  The game always has something new to offer, and is an all round great game, besides being an excellent racing game.  I think the only way GT4 could top it is if it were the same quality game, but futuristic.  That would be cool...  Buy the game to cure your perpetual boredom!
