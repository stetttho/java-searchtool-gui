 I rather dislike this expansion.  I own all four expansions for the PC Sims, and this is one of my least favorites.  Personally, I don't think the addition of vacation mode adds much to the game after Hot Date, since vacation mode seems just like downtown, but slightly modified.  Also, most of the new items are only available in vacation mode or are heavily themed to the vacation aspect, which, like I said, isn't very good.  So, if you're a big Sims fan and are trying to collect all the expansions or something, or just think that your sims need a vacation, you should buy this.  But for the rest of you, I'd either wait for the price to drop more, or just not buy it.
