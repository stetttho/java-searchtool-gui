 In planning a cross-country trip with my dog (and wife too) for Summer 2000, this proved an invaluable resource. It lists thousands of pet-friendly places to stay in virtually every city and major town in all  50 states. Although the entries for each inn are very basic, they hit the  high points: address, phone, web site, pet policy, and basic amenities.  Places they have visited or for which they have received multiple reader  recommendations are starred. I also like the fact that they cover a wide  range of establishments, ranging from cottages to motels to  bed-and-breakfasts to top-of-the-line hotels. Its not really a travel guide  you'll need, because the information is too abbreviated, but it is a very  valuable reference tool. Highly recommended.
