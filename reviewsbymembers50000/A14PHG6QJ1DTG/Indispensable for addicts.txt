 Penguin's Wodehouse Companion is actually a compilation of two earlier books by Richard Usborne--"Wodehouse at Work to the End" and "A Wodehouse Companion." It combines elements of biography, critical bibliography, and apologia (for the controversial Berlin broadcasts). Brief plot summaries of all 92 novels are included. If you love Wodehouse, but have trouble keeping all the tangled skeins straight, this text will be of immense utility. It could have been improved by an encyclopedic coverage of the characters and key props. Hopefully Penguin will see fit to bring it back into print.
