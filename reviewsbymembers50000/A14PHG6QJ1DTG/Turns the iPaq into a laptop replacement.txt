 I recently upgraded to the Compaq iPAQ from my beloved but battered old Palm III. What a difference! But adding the Stowaway keyboard was the crowning touch to the new machine, for I can now use it as a laptop replacement on most business trips. When I take business trips, I usually need e-mail access and light word processing. With pocket versions of Outlook and Word, the iPAQ meets that need, but anything beyond the shortest messages or notes is hard to enter using either character recognition or the soft keyboard. But with a Stowaway keyboard attached, entering extensive notes and writing long e-mails is a breeze. I was at a conference this past weekend at which everybody around me was using lap tops. I zipped out my Stowaway keyboard, whipped it open, snapped on my Palm and was the envy of everyone in sight. The Stowaway keyboard is really a remarkable device. It folds down to next to nothing - smaller than a paperback novel. It slips easily into a jacket pocket. Yet, it unfolds into a near full-size keyboard with remarkably accurate and 'life-like" action. It is actually easier to type on the Stowaway keyboard than on my Dell laptop. Taking notes or entering multiple contact data, let alone writing e-mails of any length, is now a breeze. Why did I subtract one star? Mainly because I have been unable to get the keyboard to hot dock, which is supposedly can do. Also, the keyboard cannot be used on your lap or other soft surface. Unless you have it on a hard surface, it tends to sag in the middle. Finally, why is there no delete key? Those quibbles aside, however, I highly recommend it to any power iPAQ user.
