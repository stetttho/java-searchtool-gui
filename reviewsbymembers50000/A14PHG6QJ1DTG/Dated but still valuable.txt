 STRUCTURE OF THE CORPORATION is a classic of the traditional school of corporate law scholarship. It provided the blueprint for early drafts of the ALI Principles of Corporate Governance and was especially influential  on California law. Doctrinally dated, but still worth reading by students  of corporate law. It will be of particular utility to those trying to  understand the evolution of corporate law during the turbulent 1970s.
