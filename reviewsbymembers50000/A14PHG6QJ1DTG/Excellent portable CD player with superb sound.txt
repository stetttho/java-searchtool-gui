 With 40 second anti-skip protection, dynamic bass boost, extended battery life, and shock protection this is a fully-featured portable CD player. Then add a high degree of programming flexibility. You can program up to 24 tracks to play in any order and with any number of repeats. With an appropriate adapter, it works well in a car -- even my bouncy old Toyota Tacoma truck didn't faze it. Jogging, walking, and riding the exercise bike also don't bother it -- I've never made it skip. (Although that may say more about my lax exercise habits than the Koss!!) The headphones that come with it are fine, but I swapped them out for Koss' noise reducing headphones. I travel a lot by plane and those headphones block out most noise. The sound is great. Not surprisingly, it is optimized for rock -- classical doesn't work as well. You lose some of the high end of the orchestra. Battery life is surprisingly long. Highly recommended.
