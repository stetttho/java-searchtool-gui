 BUSINESS BASICS is a very comprehensive overview of business issues designed for law students and lawyers. Students taking a basic course in corporations or business associations will find it useful, especially if  they lack a business background. It covers not only corporate law, but also  such broader topics as insurance, retirement planning, real estate  purchases, and the like. Relatively little traditional doctrinal analysis;  more an explanation of how business works. Don't think of it as a study aid  for your corporations class-think of it as a one volume equivalent of an  undergraduate business administration program. On that basis, I highly  recommend it.
