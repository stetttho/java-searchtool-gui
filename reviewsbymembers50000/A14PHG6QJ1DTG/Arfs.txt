 When we arrived in the Boston Metro area with our golden retriever, this  was the first book we bought. It is a god-send! Immensely detailed and  highly accurate, it lists hundreds of places to take your dog in Boston,  the surrounding communities, the Cape, and even as far afield as New  Hamsphire. The book is divided into 12 geographic areas. In turn, each  broad region is sub-divided by town. Within each town, Downey and Lau first  list Parks, Beaches, and Recreation Areas. These are subjectively rated  from 1 to 4 paws. In our experience, one paw sites are only good for a  quick pitstop. Four paw sites, however, are routinely wonderful. Usefully,  a running dog symbol indicates off-leash parks. Directions, a map, and a  reasonably detailed description of the facilities follow. Downey and Lau  also list for each towndog-friendly restaurants, accomodations, festivals,  pet sitters, and the like. So far their advice has been dead  accurate--up-to-date and on the money. If you love dogs and live in the  Boston area, you need this book. Highly recommended.
