 I had great hopes for this book, as I'm always on the look out for fun places to take my dog. Anticipating a cross-country trip during Summer 2000, I ordered it to help plan that trip. Unfortunately, it did not prove  very useful. Although it covers the whole US, the information is typically  too sketchy to be of use. Hotel descriptions, for example, typically  consist of nothing more than name, address, and phone number.  At best,  there is a rudimentary indication of amenities using letter codes, although  many listings lack them. In some cases, the listing does not even include  an address or merely includes a PO Box. Based on the listings for Southern  California, the part of the country I know best, some of the information is  incomplete or inaccurate. In listing California dog parks (pp. 231-32), for  example, Walters omits two well-known Los Angeles parks. In sum, not  recommended.
