 The first two books (other than the Bible) I read when I started thinking about becoming Catholic were Thomas Howard's "Evangelical is not Enough" and "On Being Catholic"--both of which I recommend highly. Yet, neither of those books answered all my questions. Neither is comprehensive and both operate at a pretty high level of abstraction. I also needed answers to questions like "why do Catholics do that"? Wilhelm's "Christ Among Us" was one of the first books I found that answered those sorts of questions. It has three great virtues: (1) It is highly readable and quite accessible. (2) It includes extensive citations to and quotations from primary church documents, which allows you to check what Wilhelm is saying. (3) It is quite comprehensive, covering a very wide range of theological and practical issues. Why then do I not rate "Christ Among Us"ore highly? Mostly because its politics are quite left of center and, relative to other theological works I've read, its doctrine seems pretty liberal too. If what you're looking for is an inclusive politically correct statement of the faith, "Christ Among Us" will probably make you very happy. If you're an admirer of the "beauty of inflexibility," however, you won't find "Christ Among Us" as useful. As someone who finds Catholicism most attractive when it stands for moral truths in a post-modern world, I tend to fall into the latter camp and, consequently, down-grade it.
