 When somebody recently broke into my car to steal my iPod, they also stole the Griffith iTrip gizmo that plays the iPod through the car's FM radio. Although I was basically happy with the Griffith, I was hearing very good things about the Monster Cable iCarPlay Wireless FM Transmitter/Charger for iPod, and therefore decided to try it instead of getting a replacement Griffith. Good choice.  I am much happier with the Monster gizmo. It's much easier to set stations. It offers three pre-sets so that you can change stations on the fly, looking for the best signal. Since I live in a metro area with few truly empty stations, this feature is very helpful. I've found sweet spots for each of the three settings along various parts of my commute and find myself changing stations at least once or twice during the commute so as to maintain the best sound quality. This is MUCH easier with the Monster due to its preset buttons.  The Monster gizmo's overall sound quality is much better that that of the Griffith, as well. Plus, instead of draining your iPod battery, the Monster cable charges it. All in all, a considerably superior solution.  Is it as good as a hard-wired system? No. But it's less expensive and doesn't require screwing around with your stereo/nav setup. The latter consideration is especially apt for those who, like me, lease their cars and must return them in original condition. For me, the Monster gizmo is a very good compromise between sound quality, cost, and convenience.
