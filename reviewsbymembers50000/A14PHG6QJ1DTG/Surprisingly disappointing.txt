 I am a huge fan of alternate history and nobody does it better than Harry Turtledove. The World War series was great, the Colonization series quite good, and his Civil War series is outstanding. Unfortunately, Into the  Darkness stands as one of his lesser works. The premise is ok--a world war  fought in an alternate universe in which magic works. But the execution is  faulty. Indeed, if one did not know better, one might take DARKNESS as a  parody of Turtledove's style. Dozens of plot lines, hundreds of  characters--too many to keep track of and far too many to care about. Worse  yet, the plot line is totally derivative of the Second World War. Only the  names have been changed (to unpronouncable ones). The sex scenes are even  more embarassing than usual. As a result, this was the first Turtledove  book I decided not to finish--quit at about the 2/3 point, skipped ahead,  realized it was a series, and punted. In sum, not recommended. Harry ought  to wrap this series up quick and spend the resulting free time on the Civil  War series.
