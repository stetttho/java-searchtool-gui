 The Anita Blake series is a wonderfully fresh take on a somewhat tired genre. Imagine a female Spencer (cf. Robert Parker) turned loose in a world in which vampires, zombies, were-creatures, and ghouls really exist. Hamilton's originality and creativity even prompted her to have the Supreme Court recognize the constitutional rights of vampires, so that staking them is a crime. A fun combination of the vampire and female PI genres that really works. Several books in the series have been among the few books to which that the old cliche about "not being able to put it down" really applies. For me, Bloody Bones was not one of them. It is something of a transitional novel with two major plot lines that intersect only loosely. Anita's antagonists here are not as fully realized or even as scary as those she's faced in other novels. Yet, I don't want to overly criticize. Hamilton is a wonderful writer and there are some truly great scenes and lines here. "Wounded master vampires get cranky as hell"!! Or the scene in which Anita discovers the pitfalls of French kissing a master vampire. In sum, recommended for fans of the series. It is an important transition in Anita's relationships with Richard and Jean-Claude. NOT the place newcomers should start. Go back to "Guilty Pleasures," and get hooked first.
