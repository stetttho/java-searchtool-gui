 This is the third novel in a wonderfully fresh take on a somewhat tired genre. Imagine a petite female Spencer (cf. Robert Parker) turned loose in a world in which vampires, zombies, were-creatures, and ghouls really exist. Hamilton's originality and creativity even prompted her to have the Supreme Court recognize the constitutional rights of vampires, so that staking them is a crime. As with the first two novels, Circus of the Damned was one of those few books to which that the old cliche about "not being able to put it down" really applies. I stayed up until 1 AM the first night and then woke at 7 am to finish it. A fun combination of the vampire and female PI genres that really works. Although the violence is a little over the top, it is still highly recommended.
