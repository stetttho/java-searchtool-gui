 Those of us who got to know David Weber through his military SF (see, esp., the excellent though interminable Honor Harrington series) likely will be surprised to discover his new fantasy series (does he ever write  stand-alones?). Unlike the Honor Harrington series, which can be awful  serious in places, Oath of Swords is just plain fun. (There is an analogy  some have noted with Heinlein's Glory Road. Like Heinlein, Weber is a hard  SF writer who turned to fantasy and demonstrated a light touch.) As with  others, my major complaint is that Weber does not have a very good ear for  accents. I agree with those who said his scotch accents especially get old.  Having said that, it is still very highly recommended.
