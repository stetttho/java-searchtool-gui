 Mary Sue Miliken and Susan Feniger are two of the top chefs in LA. (And maybe the top female duo.) For those of us who grew up equating Mexican food with Tex-Mex, Miliken and Feniger's inventive take on traditional Mexican cuisine is a revelation. Their "Border Grill" in Santa Monica (4th and Broadway) is a noisy, splashy, foodie haven with superb drinks, a decent wine/beer list, and amazing food. For several years they also produced a fun and informational show on the Food network before that cable network went all-Emeril all-the-time. "Cooking with Two Hot Tamales" captures a lot of recipes and tips from the show. Many of the recipes herein one occasionally sees on Border Grill's menu. The house gucamole recipe is almost worth the price of the book on its own! As a cookbook, Two Hot Tamales is interesting, has an attractive layout, and, by the minimal standards of the genre, is well-written. Unlike their Mesa Mexicana, which I recomend only for the hobbyist chef with access to a decent Mexican grocer and time on his/her hands, Two Hot Tamales can be used on an everyday basis. Few of the recipes involve intensive prep work -- after all, they had to be prepared within the confines of a 30 minute TV show. Equally important for users outside the South-west, few of the recipes require specialized ingredients. Highly recommended.
