 My IT people bought me the HP 2100 for use as a personal printer in my university office. I liked it so much that I bought one for my home office to replace an old HP 4L. It has been an excellent purchase and I highly recommend this printer. When working at home, I now have the print speed to download and print out legal decisions from the web or Lexis, which was too painful to contemplate with the slow speeds of the HP 4L. I get 8-10 pages per minute regardless of whether the printer is set for draft or top quality modes. So only the longest legal decisions take more than a couple of minutes. Of course, as a law professor, I'm not often printing out graphics intensive files. Charts and figures do slow down the print speed some, so a more graphics intensive user might want to look at alternatives. I'm also not using it in a network environment at home and, at work, I don't share it with other users. So, again, your mileage may vary. Both of my HP 2100 have been extremely reliable. They are quiet, the paper never jams, they have a reasonably large main paper tray, handle single sheet feeds fine. I've generated several camera ready texts on my HP 2100 using the top quality print settings and had no complaints from readers or publishers, So for a low-volume, mostly text setting, this seems like an ideal printer.
