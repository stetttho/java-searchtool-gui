 I love my battered old Palm III (with no suffixes!). With PocketMirror's latest synch program on my PC, I have no trouble synching with Outlook 2000. To be sure, I'm almost out of memory, but I muddle by. There is only one fly in my Palm ointment - I have never mastered Graffiti. After years of using the Palm III, I'm still barely at 90%+ accuracy. Consequently, I was an early adopter of the Palm keyboard. One of the great moments was a conference I attended at which everybody around me was using lap tops. I zipped out my Palm keyboard, whipped it open, snapped on my Palm and was the envy of everyone in sight. Palm probably owes me hundreds of dollars in finders fees for that one event. The Palm keyboard is really a remarkable device. It folds down to next to nothing - smaller than a paperback novel. It slips easily into a jacket pocket. Yet, it unfolds into a near full-size keyboard with remarkably accurate and 'life-like" action. It is actually easier to type on the Palm keyboard than on my Dell laptop. Taking notes or entering multiple contact data, let alone writing e-mails of any length, is now a breeze. Why did I subtract one star? First, several friends who bought the Palm keyboard have had hardware and/or software problems. One has had to return the keyboard 3 times. I have had NO dififculties, but your mileage may vary. Second, the keyboard cannot be used on your laptop. Unless you have it on a hard surface, it tends to sag in the middle. Third, I had to fiddle with the settings a long time to get the keyboard delay right. Those quibbles aside, however, I highly recommend it to any power Palm user.
