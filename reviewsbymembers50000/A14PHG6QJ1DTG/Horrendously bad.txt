 This may be the worst book I've ever read. If not, it is darn close. The writing is childish; the philosophy is half-baked; the premise is silly. Millenia ago a group of humans fled their planets of origin to escape a  war. While travelling through space, they discovered that their own  pacifist people were breaking down into factions. (Duh. Read Madison's  essay on faction in the Federalist papers.) So they decided to brainwash  everybody so as to avoid competition and research and so on. The idea was  to prevent the development of military technologies of mass destruction.  (Why not brainwash everybody to be pacifists? Because then there would be  no story.) One group refused to accept the brainwashing, so they got left  off on a pit of a planet. That group becomes soldiers. But they also  develop the ability to travel back in time telepathically and discover the  roots of humanity. They then become the seeds of a conspiracy to undo the  brainwashing. Along the way, the soldiers develop some hairbrained  philosophy that looks to be a bad imitation of Maslow's theories of  self-actualization. I got far enough into the book to get the gist of it,  skipped ahead to the end, and tossed it.
