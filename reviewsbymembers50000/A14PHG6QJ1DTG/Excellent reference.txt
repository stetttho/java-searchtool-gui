 Anyone serious about Roman history ought to own this book. Be warned...it is not a narrative text. Don't expect to linger over it at a coffee shop. Instead, it is more in the nature of an encyclopedia. Organized  thematically, there are 9 chapters covering all aspects of Roman life: A  brief historical overview; military affairs; geography; town life; trade;  language; religion; economy; everyday life. Within each chapter one finds a  series of short essays, numerous very helpful illustrations and maps,  chronologies, and the like.  I have been reading a lot of Roman law lately,  as well as history of the early church, and have kept this handbook by my  side. It has answered almost every question my reading raised about Rome.  If it has any failing, it is that it covers only the historical period up  to the fall of the Western Empire. Information about the later Eastern  Empire is sparse, at best. Having said that, it is highly recommended.
