 The events of April 19, 1775, in Lexington and Concord obviously are central to the American story. In this marvelous work of narrative history, Arthur Tourtellot provides a seminal account of those events. As a visiting professor at a Boston university during the 2000-2001 academic year, I have had the good fortune of living in Lexington. I have spent many hours wandering the Minuteman National Monument, Battle Road, and the Lexington and Concord greens, with Tourtellot's book in hand. The area is quite different today then it was in 1775, of course. On the one hand, the towns obviously  are much bigger. On the other hand, however, many of the cleared farm fields of 1775 are now covered with second growth forest. One cannot, for example, easily see North Bridge--let alone town center--from Punkatasset Hill. Nonetheless, Tourtellot's careful narrative makes the scene come alive. His clear telling of the story makes it possible for one to follow the action quite closely. One of the most interesting aspects of Tourtellot's text is emphasis on the intersection of religion and politics in understanding the motivations of the population of Lexington and Concord. In particular, he puts Rev. Jonas Clarke (Lexington's town minister) at the center of the stage. As Tourtellot persuasively argues, it was Clarke's influence that led to Captain Parker's otherwise rather puzzling decision to take a stand with 60 or 70 men against hundreds of British regulars. In sum, very highly recommended.
