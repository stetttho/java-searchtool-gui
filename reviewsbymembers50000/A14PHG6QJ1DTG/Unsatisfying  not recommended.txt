 It sure would be nice if Dragon worked out of the box, let alone if Dragon delivered the functonalities promised. In my experience, it did neither. (I am running Dragon 6 Preferred on an XP Pro machine using Word 2002 and Outlook 2002.) Within an hour of use, I began having a problem in which Dragon declined to capitalize the first word of a sentence and failed to put a space between words. Resort to ScanSoft's technical support site was dismaying. Contacting a technician by e-mail costs $10. Contacting one by phone is $20. I don't know about you, but I feel that after spending $160+ on a program, and running into a major bug after only an hour of use, I ought to get some free tech support.  Okay, so then I went to the technical notes section. Tried multiple searches. Nothing. Finally started scrolling through the list of recent tech notes. (A depressingly long list, I might add.) I found a recent tech note addressing the words run together problem, which included many of the search terms I had used in the search engine. Why the search engine did not pick this note up, I still don't know. In any event, the note required me to download Service Pack 1. Then it turned out that Service Pack 1 was only for Dragon Pro, not Dragon preferred. Hence, ScanSoft has NO fix for my problem. Additional problems developed thereafter: The "Select and Say" and Correct functions stopped working in Word 2002. Dragon turns out to basically not be usable in Outlook 2002 unless you use Word as your editor, which then means you lose the correction function. This makes it almost impossible to correct mistakes, let alone train Dragon to improve its accuracy.
