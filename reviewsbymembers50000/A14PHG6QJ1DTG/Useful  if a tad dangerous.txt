 The negative review of the Cuisinart mini-prep surprised me. This is an enormously useful little gadget for both the hobbyist chef and casual cook. Obviously, a mini-prep doesn't have the same power as a full-size food processor. If choosing between the two, go with a full-size model. As part of an array of tools, including a full-size processor, a blender, a mixer, a bread machine, and a hand held blender, however, the mini-prep has its uses. (Okay, I'm a gadget freak.) I would slot the mini-prep fourth on that list in terms of importance and utility. What does the mini-prep do well? It has a very sharp blade and a high speed motor. So it is great at tasks like pureeing garlic; finely chopping onions (no more tears) and other vegetables; grinding coffee beans, nuts, and spices; roughly chopping peanuts for pad thai, and making small amounts of pureed sauces. Cautions: The blade is very sharp! I have sliced my fingers several times. Unless you intend to puree the product, never leave the mini-prep unattended. The blade is too sharp and the motor too fast. In fact, don't even turn it on full tilt. Just pulse. Many times I have taken onions past the point of fine dice to soup in the blink of an eye. Hint: Get a couple of extra containers. They're cheap and not having to stop to clean a container after every use is a big time saver. Top rack dishwasher safe.
