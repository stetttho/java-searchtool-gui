 Not up to standards of the Raj series. Lots of vignettes, loosely tied together. I suspect they wanted to do another multi-volume series, but the publisher was only willing to do a single book--so they crammed everything  into that volume. I also suspect this started out as a separate series,  which the publisher told them to connect to Raj for sales purposes. It is  only loosely tied to the Raj series and only by an implausible plot device.   Neither Raj nor Center are central to the working out of the plot. Readers  looking for a contination of the Raj stories will be disappointed. Readers  looking for decent military SF will be modestly satisfied.
