 Because cooking is my main hobby, I'm always looking for better equipment. Once I found Calphalon, however, I stopped looking for cookware. This is very nearly the ideal cookware and the 10-pc starter set the very nearly ideal basic package. Made of heavy-gauge anodized aluminum, each pan absorbs heat evenly and without hot spots. Moreover, all of the pans come with steel handles so that they can go from cooktop to oven and back. Because they are anodized aluminum, moreover, health concerns about using aluminum cookware are abated. Clean up is a breeze. The surface is surprisingly stick resistant, given that it is not non-stick. And any residue that proves stubborn gives way to Comet and a bit of elbow grease. A couple of cautions/quibbles. First, I do not use Calphalon's anodized aluminum pans to cook eggs. For some reason, I can never get eggs to come out right in these pans. Pick up a non-stick Calphalon pan for eggs. Second, I don't cook highly acidic sauces (like tomato) in Calphalon because of lingering concerns about aluminum. I use a Le Cruscet enameled cast iron pot for such sauces. Finally, the fry pans in this set are a bit small. You'll want a wok or larger pan for stir-frying. But that's why they call it a starter set!
