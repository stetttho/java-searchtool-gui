 If you live in Los Angeles, you need this book. Smaus is the garden writer for the excretal Los Angeles Times and one of its sole redeeming virtues. Smaus covers a range of topics, including plantings suggested for our area and timing of various tasks. Unlike most gardening books, which are written  for East Coast or Mid-West audiences, and which are generally unhelpful for  our unique climate, Smaus' advice has proven consistently accurate. The  book's sole flaw is the lack of an index. Because the articles are short  and there is a detailed table of contents, this is not a major problem.  Highly recommended.
