 As an evangelical deeply interested in and sympathetic to Catholicism, I  found Thomas Howard's "Evangelical is not Enough" to be one of  the most moving religious books I've read in years. Howard was born into an  evangelical family, moved into an Anglican communion as an adult, and  subsequent to the first publishing of "Not Enough" became a Roman  Catholic. This is NOT a Roman Catholic apologia. As noted, Howard's famous  (and, within evangelical circles, highly controversial) conversion  post-dates this book. Instead, is an apologia for all the apostolic  liturgical starins of Christianity (including the Anglican and Orthodox  traditions). Although the story is obviously colored by Howard's faith  journey, this is not a biography or memoir. Instead, it is an exploration  of the liturgical tradition written by someone deeply sympathetic to the  evangelical tradition. Howard explores such controverted issues as Mary,  the authority of scripture and church teaching (sola scriptura),  justification (sola fide), and liturgy. I believe (with Howard) that the  evangelical churches have gone too far in rejecting liturgy. A traditional  High Church service touches my soul far more deeply than the modern praise  worship so common in evangelical services. (I was recently in one of those  mega-churches where they serve Starbucks coffee and everybody takes their  latte into the pew. I'm glad there are churches like that for people who  prefer that style of worship, but its not for me.) The hard questions for  me are the touchstones of Reformation theology--sola scriptura and sola  fide. Does the apostolic tradition have authority or is only scripture  authoritative? Is salvation by faith alone or by faith and works? Howard  has struggled with these issues too and has given us a fair, balanced,  honest, and deeply scriptural set of answers. In sum, HIGHLY recommended.
