 (1) The writing stinks. Example: "This evil one is trying to kill me! But I am a greater master of the Force than he." Really. That's what it says. Seriously. Example 2 : "More Jedi. But they are only  women." To which Leia responds, "Vardna Mojaya! You've hurt  Luke." Did he not know that? (2) The plot stinks. DEI brought back the  emperor from the dead and armed him with the usual superweapon. DEII  (surprise!) brings back the emperor from the dead and arms him with a  superweapon. Excuse me? Didn't we just see that in the last episode? Can  you spare an original idea? (3) The artwork stinks. None of the characters  look like the actors. Each frame has only 1 or 2 colors, which are either  garish or washed out. (4) Why is almost everything green? In sum, don't  waste your money.
