 If you haven't discovered Laurell K. Hamilton yet--I envy you. because you have 9 great books ahead of you--the Anita Blake series. This is a wonderfully fresh take on a somewhat tired genre. Imagine a female Spencer (cf. Robert Parker) turned loose in a world in which vampires, zombies, were-creatures, and ghouls really exist. Hamilton's originality and creativity even prompted her to have the Supreme Court recognize the constitutional rights of vampires, so that staking them is a crime. A fun combination of the vampire and female PI genres that really works. Killing Dance is the 6th novel in the series and my personal favorite. To be sure, it is darker and more violent than some of the earlier books. But some of my favorite characters (Jean Claude and Edward) play major roles. (I love Edward the amoral but honorable hit man who befriends Anita.) And some of my least favorite characters get wasted (no telling--no spoilers here!). Mostly, I love Anita. She is coming to grips with the fact that she is a stone cold killer and that she's not ok with that. The depth of characterization among Richard, Jean-Claude, and Anita thus continues to grow. (Even Edward becomes something of a fully realized character.) I can't really tell you why I loved this book without giving away some major spoliers. So just take my word for it--go buy it. (BUT don't start here--if you haven't read any of the Anita Blake series yet--start at the beginning: "Guilty Pleasures.)
