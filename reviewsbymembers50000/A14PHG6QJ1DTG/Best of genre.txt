 Legal scholars tend to assume that law matters; i.e., that people seek to comport their behavior with applicable rules of law.  In what is probably the best sociological study of the role of law in dispute resolution, Robert Ellickson demonstrates that disputes are often resolved without recourse to law and, even more important, in ways different than they would have been resolved in court.  Ellickson begins with a richly detailed case study:  Boundary and cattle trespass disputes in Shasta County, California.  After reviewing the Shasta County experience, Ellickson relates his findings to a theoretical framework grounded in economics and psychology.  The book thus combines the best of both theoretical and empirical approaches to the study of law.  Legal scholarship is increasingly concerned with the way social norms control behavior.  This is the book that started that debate.  It deserves to be read by anybody who is interested in law, economics, or dispute resolution.
