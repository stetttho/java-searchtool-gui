 Since even before Milton Friedman famously contended that the social responsibility of business is to maximize profits, there has been a vigorous debate between those who believe corporations should put purported  notions of socially responsible behavior ahead of profits and those of who  are skeptical that doing so leads to desirable results. One of the chief  tenets of the Friedman-esque position is that responsible corporate  behavior is profit maximizing. That is, the private interests of the  corporation and the public interest are typically congruent. In this  excellent analysis, John Hood convincingly demonstrates that compassion and  capitalism are not inconsistent, but go hand in hand. Hood combines  statistical evidence with telling anecdotes drawn from a plethora of  industries to show that profit maximizing firms consistently also advance  the common good. Indeed, by the end of Hood's text, one is ineluctably lead  to the conclusion that for profit corporations have done far more good than  government or nonprofits. Highly recommended.
