 The Black Company is one of the great creations of modern fantasy. In a  genre in which most stories are starkly black and white--really great good  guys and really bad villans--the Black Company (contra its name) lives in  grey. Shadow Games is the fourth book in a series on the the Black  Company, a mercenary band in a sword and sorcery world. The first three  novels told the story of how the Company came into the service of Lady, a  sorceress of great power who rules a purportedly evil empire in the  northern part of the Company's world. Eventually the Company rebels against  the Lady and joins the White Rose, a reincarnated hero who opposes the  empire. At the end of book three, the Rose, the Lady, and the Company join  forces to defeat an older evil. A related book, Silver Spike, follows the  subsequent adventures of the Rose. In Shadow Games, Lady and the last  members of the Company travel south to the legendary city of Khatover from  which the Company originated many centuries before. I enjoyed Shadow  Games and recommend it (although NOT as an initation to the series). But I  didn't quite like it as much as the first three novels. There is less  character development. Old villans get recycled for reasons that are not  entirely clear. A cliffhanger ending forces you to buy the sequel. Shadow  Games also marks the beginning of Cook's fascination with the quasi-Indian  philosophy and mythology that, in my judgment, detract from the later  books. If I had it to do over again, I probably would have stopped with the  first three novels.
