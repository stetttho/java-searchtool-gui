 The Capresso Coffee team is a bit pricey, but it combines a top-quality coffee maker with an excellent coffee bean grinder into a highly useful package. The timer system works quite well. Before going to bed, I let the dog out, fill the water reservior (which has its own built-in filter), top up the bean holder, swing the filter holder over under the grinder, let the dog back in and got to bed. Come 7 am, the beans grind themselves, the coffee brews, and I'm a happy camper. Being a basically lazy cook, I also like using the Coffee Team to make coffee anytime of day--not having to dig out the grinder, fill the grinder, transfer the grounds, etc.... Okay, so it doesn't save that much time, but I still love it. You will too. Highly recommended. PS: The coffee tastes great too.
