 This is a short, compact cookbook specializing in tomato recipes. It is beautfifully illustrated with some of the finest food photography I've ever seen. The recipes are uniformly straight-forward, requiring only basic ingredients and fairly standard equipment. The modestly competent home cook will have no difficulty with most of the recipes here. If you've ever stared at your tomato patch wondering what the heck to do with all those tomatoes, this is the book for you. I've made almost every recipe herein and loved almost every one. But the tomato spoonbread is my favorite. Its almost worth the price of the book just for that recipe.
