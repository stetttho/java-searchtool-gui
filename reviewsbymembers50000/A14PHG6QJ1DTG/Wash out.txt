 The writing is stilted and juvenile. A single example should suffice: "I can feel the Force moving through me . . . Guiding my hands in the terrible tasks of war." Please. My 10-year old niece can write a  better sentence. In order to pack the maximum amount of plot into the  minimum amout of artwork, about half the sentences are synopses. The color  selection is limited and mostly washed out. In sum, only for those who must  own everything.
