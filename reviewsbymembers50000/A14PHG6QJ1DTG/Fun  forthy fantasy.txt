 Having gotten to know David Weber through his military SF (see, esp., the excellent though interminable Honor Harrington series) I was surprised to discover his new fantasy series (does he ever write stand-alones?). Unlike the Honor Harrington series, which can be awful serious in places, War God's own is just plain fun. (There is with Heinlein's Glory Road--like Heinlein, Weber is a hard SF writer who turned to fantasy and demonstrated a light touch.) War God's Own is the second novel in the series and really can't be read on its own. You'll need to pick up a copy of Oath of Swords first. But OoS is as much fun as WGO, so that's no great hardship. My only complaint is that Weber does not have a very good ear for accents--his scottish accents especially get old. Having said that, WGO is still very highly recommended.
