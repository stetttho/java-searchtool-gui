 Pop is one of my guilty pleasures, and there are some great guilty pleasures on this CD. Starting with "Maria Maria," my favorite Santana song in years. (What a great video it made too.) Not to mention Madonna's "Beautiful Stranger" and Sarah McLachlan's "I will Remember You." All told there are about half-a-dozen songs on this compilation CD for which I would never buy the artist's album, but which as stand-a-lone songs are great. Plus, I've got to hand it to Amazon's service. When I ordered the CD, the jewel case arrived empty. Amazon sent a new one out the next day. Great customer service from my favorite web site.
