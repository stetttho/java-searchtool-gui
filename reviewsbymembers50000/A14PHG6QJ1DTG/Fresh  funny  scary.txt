 This is a wonderfully fresh take on a somewhat tired genre. Imagine a female Spencer (cf. Robert Parker) turned loose in a world in which vampires, zombies, were-creatures, and ghouls really exist. Hamilton's  originality and creativity even prompted her to have the Supreme Court  recognize the constitutional rights of vampires, so that staking them is a  crime. It was one of those few books to which that the old cliche about  "not being able to put it down" really applies. I stayed up until  2 am the first night and then woke at 8 am to finish it. A fun combination  of the vampire and female PI genres that really works. Although the  violence is a little over the top, it is still highly recommended. N.B.:  One of the fun puzzles in the book is trying to figure out just what kind  of critter Anita is: She has super-human reflexes and prefers the dark. Is  she a vampire? Presumably not, because holy water doesn't burn her and she  can wear a crucifix. So what's up? Hamilton has the good sense to keep you  guessing.
