 There was more hard science SF here than is typical of Star Trek novels, and the authors clearly know their science. BUT: They are not very good writers, the characters are cardboard cut-outs, the plot is thin, the  philosophy is weak, and the ending is trite. Not recommended except for the  collector who has to have every ST novel.
