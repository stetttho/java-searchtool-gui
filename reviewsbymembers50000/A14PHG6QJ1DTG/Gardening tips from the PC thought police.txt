 I was fully prepared to enjoy this book.  I love travel and gardening memoirs and am an avid tomato (and rose) grower.  But after reading three chapters, I tossed it.  The author turns out to be a left-liberal who liberally (pun intended) sprinkles his text with snide and insulting remarks about Republicans.  Note to the author: Conservatives garden too.
