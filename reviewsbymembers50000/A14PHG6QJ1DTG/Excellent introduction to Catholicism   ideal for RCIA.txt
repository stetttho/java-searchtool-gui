 We have been using "This is our Faith" by Michael Francis Pennock in our RCIA class. Written in a simple and direct style, "This is our Faith" is an eminently readable and highly accessible introduction to Catholic teaching and theology. Pennock divided the text into four sections that parallel those of the Catechism: The Profession of Faith, focusing on the creeds; The Celebration of the Christian Mystery, which focuses on liturgy and the sacraments; Life in Christ, which emphasizes Christian morals; and Christian Prayer. Individual chapters consist mostly of Questions and answers--making "This is our Faith" sort of a FAQ for Catholics. Each question is cross-referenced to the Catechism. Curiously, the teachers of my RCIA class sort of discourage us from reading the Catechism. (Is that typical?) But I like having the cross-references so that I can follow up where the text doesn't provide enough detail. Pennock's theology seems sound and conventional, yet he reflects both traditional church teaching and current thinking. Anyone in RCIA ought to pick up "This is our Faith."
