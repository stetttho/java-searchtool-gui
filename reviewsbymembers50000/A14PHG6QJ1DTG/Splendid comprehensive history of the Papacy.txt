 I did not see the TV series for which this text is a companion, but it is hard to imagine that anything on television could be as satisfying as this short history of the papacy. Highly recommended. Saints and Sinners is lavishly and splendidly illustrated. Spectacular photography and reproductions of countless major works of art relating to the Papacy. This is prefectly appropriate as one of the major themes of the text is the Papacy's support for the arts and beautification of Rome. Yet, of course, the text is what matters. Eamon Duffy is an important British historian, but this is no dry scholarly treatise. Instead, it is a highly intelligent but eminently accessible narrative. A comprehensive history of a 2000 year old institution, of course, must skimp on some details. Yet, Duffy consistently makes wise choices as to coverage. The chapter on Renaissance popes, for example, focuses not on the big names like Julius II but on the relatively obscure Nicholas V. Yet, as the first of the Humanist popes, Nicholas' story arguably is more important for understanding Catholicism than would be another rehashing of the Sistine Chapel ceiling story.
