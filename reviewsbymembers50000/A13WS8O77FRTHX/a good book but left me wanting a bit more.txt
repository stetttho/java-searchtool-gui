 I always enjoy a Sandra Hill romance, and I did enjoy this one. I love her Viking tales. She brings to life the harsh realities that they faced and gives us just enough actual historical background without making it seem like a history book. I like that she adds humor and passion to her books equally.  This book was enjoyable but it did leave me kind of wanting. I just felt like there was something missing. I'm not really sure what though. This is the story of Ruby Jordan, a modern day 38 yr old woman with two kids, a marriage that is failing and a busy business selling and making lingerie. Her husband of 20 years leaves her and she falls to pieces. She is listening to a self motivational tape when she is suddenly flung back in time to the time of the Vikings. There she meets Thork, the look-a-like to her husband Jack. He thinks her a spy and almost kills her. She soon realizes that no one believes her tale of being from the future and that her very life is really in peril. She must learn to adapt to her new life and its harsh surroundings. Thork is not very nice to her even though he is highly attracted to her and she to him. Of course she tries to tell him that he is her husband and that they have been married 20 years ut he can't believe her because he's never married and has no intention of ever doing so and the fact that she appears to him as 18 again. There is a lot of humor and a lot of tense moments where you aren't really sure what will happen next. I did enjoy this book and plan to read all her other books soon.
