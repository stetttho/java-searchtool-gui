 Well I must say that Connie Mason is one of my favorite authors. Her books are Hot,Steamy,Tender,Loving,filled with danger and just so enjoyable I have to read them all over and over. I had read this books years ago but recently decided to reread it and review it. This is the story of Drake, or as he has become to be known as The Black Knight. He is the bastard son of an Earl who is betrayed when he tries to elope with first love Daria. She is to marry his half-brother Waldo who is the rightful heir. He beleives he is betrayed by her younger sister Raven. After this he is banashied and goes on to become the Black Knight. He shows ups years later at a tournament oly to find Raven is now to marry Waldo. Her sister has died and Waldo has no set his sights for her. Raven hates Waldo and begs Drake to help her. He won't and decides to get even with her and Waldo by taking her virginity on her wedding night to Waldo. She still loves him and gives it freely. When Waldo finds out he is furious and Raven must flee for her life. Drake becomes her protector and together they flee. They become closer to each other and struggle with the evil the Waldo brings into thier lives. This is a touching story and I really enjoyed it.
