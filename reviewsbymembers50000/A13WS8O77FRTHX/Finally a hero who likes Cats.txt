 I was pleasently suprised by this book. I liked the fact that the heroine is not some young, extreamly beautiful girl but a mature(30 yrs old) handsome woman who keeps her hero on his toes. He has been married 4 times and all of his wives have died leaving him with 7 children. He really loves his kids and it is enjoyable to read about him playing with them and even accepting their pets. One of his daughters has a huge, and I do mean huge, collection of cats. I think the count is 25 or more. He even carries one around for a bit and seems to enjoy loving it. He may be a strong, demanding, powerful man but he is also one with deep feelings and passionate love for both his family, his land and his new bride.
