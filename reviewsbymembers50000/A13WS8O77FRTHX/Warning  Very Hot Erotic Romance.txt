 Wow! I have now read two of Robin Schone's books and they just keep getting better and hotter as I go along. Robin blends the erotic love scenes so well with the romance that you feel that the book would be missing pages if they weren't included. Her characters are real and the feelings of desire and despair are true to life. She adds suttle hints of humor and danger to her books tying them all together perfectly. This is the story of a lonely, desperate married woman, who wants to seduce her husband and feel love again. She goes insearch of aid in teaching her the finer points of how to please a man to the Bastard Sheik, Ramiel Devington. Ramiel is half English and Half Arab and the product of his mothers life in Arabia when she was in the Sheiks harem. Society doesn't associate with him because of his parentage but is secretly drawn to him. Elizabeth shows up on his doorstep asking for lessons and he finds that he cannot refuse her. They begin everyday early in the moring. He makes demands upon her that she agrees to but he never touches her. He teaches her that her body is nothing to be ashamed of and that a man finds pleasure in the giving and the taking of pleasure by both parties.  This is a story of how one woman becomes aware of her body and how by recieving pleasure she can in turn give pleasure. She finds her world turned upside down and the only person who can right it is Ramiel. He has vowed to protect her and love her no matter what and when she turns to him for love he willingly gives it everything he has got. This is a tender book in some ways and a harsh book in others. It shows how powerful love and desire is and how much they are needed in everyone's life. I highly recommend this book and can't wait to read others.
