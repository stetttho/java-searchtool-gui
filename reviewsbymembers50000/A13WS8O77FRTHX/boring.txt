 Well I have found with Claudia Dain's book I either love them or hate them. I thought this book might be one I loved but I found it boring. It took me days to read it and I had to force myelf to get through it. The characters didn't really have much interest in each other. The hero didn't seem like there was much passion in him at all. The passion that supposedly drove them apart in the first place seemed like it never exsisted. I found the characters boring and without much depth. I'm sorry but I just didn't like this book at all.
