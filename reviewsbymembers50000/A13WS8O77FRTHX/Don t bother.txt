 Well I was excited by the cover of this book, I like books about ships and sailing but when I read this book I was very disappointed. I thought the characters were weak and not developed enough. The hero is a mean man who doens't really get nicer as the story progresses. The heroine was just too good, maybe saintly is a better term. She has come to take care of her dying sister and her child who is the hero's dead brother's family. The story just never seemed to get my attention.
