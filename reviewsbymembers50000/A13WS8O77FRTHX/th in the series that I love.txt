 Wow! I really love these books. Christine Geehan has a fan for life. I have now read almost all the books in this series so far and I can't wait to get to the next one. Christine makes her characters so human, even though they aren't human at all. I enjoy reading about the Carpathian lifestyle and how its men protect their women to the point of death. The passion that they share is wonderfully erotic and touching at the same time. Its nice to read about men who are just as moved by sex as the women are. Its just as emotional to them as to the women. This is Darius's story. He is Desari's older brother from "Dark Challenge"... The secondary characters are as always wonderful. I would love to see a few of them have their own stories, hint, hint.  I would recommend these books to anyone. I will read and reread them over and over.
