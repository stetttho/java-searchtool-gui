 Well I must say that Jude Deveraux's books are some of my favorites. I love her time travel books and will always by them. This one is confusing at times but after a while you get into the swing of things. I cried and laughed at this book. I stayed up all night reading it, it was  worth being so tired the next day I couldn't keep my eyes open. Buy this book and keep it to read again and again.
