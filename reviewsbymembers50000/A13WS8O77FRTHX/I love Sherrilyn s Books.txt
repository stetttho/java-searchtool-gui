 I have to say it again. I love Sherrilyn's books. Her books are always filled with excitement, danger, humor, tenderness, passion, and love. Her characters come alive and you feel as though you know them personally. I've been lucky enough to chat with Sherrilyn online and she's a wonderful person. I eagerly await everyone of her books whether she is writting under the name Sherrilyn Kenyon or under Kinley MacGregor. This book is the first book in the Dark-Hunter series but it has its roots in the novel FANTASY LOVER. The hero Kyrian of Thrace was the best friend of the hero in FANTASY LOVER, Julian. Both are from ancient Greece. Julian was cursed and has spent the centuries as a drawing in a book only to be released to pleasure women for a short time, that was until he met Grace who freed him and gave him a life. Kyrian was his best friend who gave up his soul to become a Dark-Hunter. He's a protecter of the innocent against Daimons who are "vampires on Steroids with a God Complex" In other words bad dudes. The dark-hunters are also a bit like vampires. They can't go out in the sun and are immortal. Kyrian is doing his job when he finds himself handcuffed to Amanda.  Amanda is a very quiet person. She is the stable one in her family of vampire hunters, fortune tellers, and witches. She doesn't believe in all that and it takes some convincing to bring her around. Being attacked, handcuffed to a vampire and watching him battle Diamons might just do it though. In the middle of all of this they fall in love. Amanda finds a tenderness and passion in Kyrian that has been lost for centuries. He has been deeply hurt before and that pain is what helps drive him. She must show him that she can be trusted with his heart before he can be truely free of his demons. I laughed and cried and laughed some more over this story. Its very exciting and thrilling and is a wonderful lead into other stories. I can't wait to read the future books. This is definately a keeper!
