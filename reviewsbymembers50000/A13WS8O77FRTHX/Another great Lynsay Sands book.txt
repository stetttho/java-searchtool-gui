 Wow is all I can say. I first found Lynsay Sands when I read ALWAYS and I fell in love with how she makes the heroine so innocent and yet so strong at the same time. She has done the same here. The Heroine, Emma, has been married for 2 years but her husband won't "do it to her" so that she can have children. She believes that the marriage was consumated but in reality her idea of consumation of a marriage is a bit lacking, that is until she finds herself newly remarried  after her husbands death to Amaury. He is quite relieved to find his bride quite lovely and is willing to consumate the marriage but hates that he has to rush into it. The two are very attracted to each other and when they do make love its explosive which thrills her but perplexes him. He thinks that a lady shouldn't enjoy making love and is concerned that he has corupted his own wife. How soon he finds out that this is not true and how very lucky he is. This is a wonderful book. I read it in one night, in fact I just finished it and its 2:00 am! Definately get this book and any other of Lynsay Sands others books. I'm going to start THE SWITCH tomorrow and knowing me and these books I'll finish it tomorrow night.
