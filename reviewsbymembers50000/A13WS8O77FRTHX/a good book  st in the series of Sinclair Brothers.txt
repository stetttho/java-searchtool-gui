 I have enjoyed many of Melanie George's books and this was no exception. Its the first of three books about the devilish Sinclair brothers. This one is about the oldest brother Damien. He is a wicked, tall, handsom, rogue that takes on the job of teaching the innocent beauty ...  We get to meet the other brothers briefly and we do gain insight on why the brothers are all "devils". I enjoyed the humor in this book so much that it had me chuckling out loud. The character of Reggie is perfect and quite a suprise. I really lok forward to the others in this series.
