 Ok first off I have to say that this book is not for the reader who has problems reading sex scenes that are very graphic.  Now that that has been said on to the review. Well this is a story of very strong women. In fact those women rule the planet and men are pets. They are wild and captured and sold as pets to pleasure the women. Most don't speak until they are trained to. They serve thier mistresses without question. Now this is the only life the heroine Arness has ever known. In fact she tracks and captures men and then sells them for profit. That is until she meets a captive named Adan. Adan can speak and is fighting to be free. He is a handleful and Arness thinks she is the one to tame him, but soon its a toss up as to who has tamed who. They soon find that they are strongly attracted to each otherand together they must over come thier fears as well as societies rules to be happy. I enjoyed this book and not just for the great love scenes. I found it to be exciting. It also had secondary characters that I found facinating and I looked forward to finding out where their lives would lead them.
