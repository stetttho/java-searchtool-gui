 The love scenes in this book are wonderfully hot and yet also very tender and loving. Both the hero and the heroine really want to please the other. Catherine is a strong heroine who finds herself with Gypsies and she soon discovers that even though she is a countess she likes being just an average person just as much, especially when she is bought by the hero, Dominic. He is half English and half Gypsy and is having a very hard time fitting in in either world. He is fighting his feelings of love for Catherine and his feelings of hate for his father. I actually found him very vunerable and endering.  I am looking forward to reading the Next book "Sweet Vengeance" because I think its about Dominic's best friend.
