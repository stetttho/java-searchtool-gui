 This is the first book I've read from this author and I must say I enjoyed it quite a bit. The story is very well written and the characters are well developed. There is sex but its not the focus of the story. The story starts out with our hero, Jesse, finding a shipwreck survivor on the beach. Jesse is the lighthouse keeper and is a very tormented soul. He blames himself for his wife's death 12 years earlier in a shipwreck so he keeps vigil at the lighthouse to make up for it. The survivor is the heroine, Mary. She is alone and pregnant and needs Jesse's help to survive. She soon discovers that Jesse needs her just as much but it unwilling to to admit that he needs anyone or that he deserves any happiness in his life. Together they must heal each other's emotional scars and fight to stay together. This story is very tender and sad in spots and passionate and fiesty in others. I really enjoyed it and plan on reading others by this author.
