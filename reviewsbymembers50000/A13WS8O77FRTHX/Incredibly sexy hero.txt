 This is the first book I've read from Elizabeth Elliott and it won't be the last. In this story she tells a beautiful story of a Knight who is known to all as the Butcher of Wales. He is a hardened man who has vowed never to marry but ends up doing just that. When he first see's his bride, Tess, he thinks her to be a large mishapened woman,and is greatly releaved to find her a very small and slight woman of incredible beauty. He is wary though of letting himself show how much he comes to care for her because he doesn't want his enemies to use that against him. He has developed two new enemies in Tess's stepfather and her stepbrother. They have hurt Tess many times both mentally and physically. He is outrages to find this out and vows to kill them both. Meanwhile Tess is struggling with her own feelings. She feels a duty to her people and yet her heart really wants Kendric. His love making is is wonderous to her and the fact that he doesn't beat her amazes her. Together they must over come thier commmon enemies and thier own fears to find love and happiness. I liked this story a lot and found the secondary characters wonderful. I would have liked the love scenes to be more descriptive but the lack of discription didn't take much away from the story. I look forward to reading the sequels to this book.
