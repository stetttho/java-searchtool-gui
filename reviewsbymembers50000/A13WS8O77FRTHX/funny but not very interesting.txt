 I was very excited when I bought this book. I mean the cover art and the title made it seem like it would be very hot. Well it wasn't it fizzled. The humor was great. I loved the toy Peter but the main characters of Ian, the Pleasure Master, and Kathy the hairdresser from present day New York, were lacking in substance. I did like the interaction between Neil, the brother and Coco Kathy's lawyer, but that couldn't help this story much. I wish it could have been better.
