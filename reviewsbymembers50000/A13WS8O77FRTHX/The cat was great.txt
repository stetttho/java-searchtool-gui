 Well the cat Zanth was the one bright spot in this book. I laughed at what he said and did. The main characters of this book Rand T'Ash and Danith Mallow were boring to me. They seemed very self involved and really didn't seem to be loving of the other. I wish this book had been better. I liked some of the other secondary characters of the Holly brothers because they seemed more alive and spirited. There were some interesting sub plots but the author didn't really explore them which I think would have made the story better.
