 Well I was excited when i first read about this book and ordered it. Well now that I've read it I wish I had spent my money on something else. This book left me cold from chapter one. The heroine in this book, Golde, is a foul mouthed, crude, hateful mystic who has been telling fortunes even though she cannot see the future. She agrees to help the Baron of Skyenvic, Gavarnie, the hero who is blind for a price. There is an evil plot and it seems to take forever to find out who is behind all of it. There are some mildly funny parts to this book but they are few and far between. I was really disappointed in this book.
