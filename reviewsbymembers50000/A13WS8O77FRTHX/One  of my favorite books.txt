 I love this book. I have read it and reread it many times. This was one of the first Connie Mason books I ever had the good fortune to read and I'm so glad I did. Connie makes her heroines wonderfully strong and her heros just as strong. The characters compliment each other and the supporting cast makes the book come together. I like the fact that there is always a struggle which the lovers must overcome, It seems to make them appreciate thier love more. This book is actually written in two sections. In the first we meet our hero Adam, who is very bitter over what our heroine's father did to his many years back. He is out for revenge. He kidnaps Alexa, placing her aboard a ship captained by the Fox, who is a masked man and he ends up taking her innocence. He leaves her to Adam who also beds her and leaves her in ruins and then leaves her in England while he goes back to his life in America. Alexa is ruined and now pregnant and Mac, Adams friend takes her to Adam. They marry but soon trouble begins. Adam is actually the Fox, who has been aiding the American's in thier fight for freedom from Britian and Alexa is taken prisoner as a traitor for harboring the Fox. She is rescued by the Fox and is totally suprised to find that the Fox and her husband are the same man. She decides right then and there to aid her new country and fool Adam/Fox as well. He leaves her again and she becomes the Vixen. This is where the second part of the book begins. She trains to fight and sail and soon has her own ship and is terrorizing the British as the Vixen on her ship "My Lady Vixen" When the Fox and the Vixen finally meet it is explosive. But the story doesn't end there. There are more troubles ahead and it will take a long while before the two lovers to find happiness.  I would recommend this to book to anyone. Keep up the good work Connie!
