 This is the first book I've read by Candice Kohl and I found it to be very enjoyable. This is the first of three books about brothers who are all knights medieval England. This is the oldest brother's story. Lucien is a landless knight. His two younger twin brothers have taken the land that the king offered to them as payment for their service, but Lucien only wants Eynsham Keep, their former home. Their father had been killed six years ealier by thier uncle Osric who has taken over the Keep. Lucien and his brother have to flee for their lives. It is Lucien's quest to get the keep and the lands back. At any cost. While visiting his mother and step-father, Lucien goes to a fair and meets a beautiful girl who he thinks is a peasant. He is drawn to her beauty and when they meet again their passion for each other cannot be stopped. Lucien doesn't know the peasant girl is really Lady Adrienne the adopted granddaughter of his enemy. He thinks of her as just Addy. When he learns the truth he knows that this can help him in his quest. He doesn't plan on falling in love with her though which may throw a wrench into his future plans. Addy thinks Lucien is a poor peasant and when they make love she doesn't regret it for she knows that she is soon to marry a unknown, unnamed man of her uncles choosing. She wants just one night of love and passion. Later when she finds out Lucien is a knight  she dreams of marriage to him. She knows nothing of his quest only of his love. Together they must fight for their passion and love and not let old wounds and fresh ones tear them apart. I look forward to reading the stories of the twin brothers and maybe the author will even write about the young half brothers.
