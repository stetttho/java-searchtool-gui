 This is the first book by Sara Bennett I've read and I hope it won't be the last. I found her book an enjoyable way to pass an afternoon. She brings to life the characters with such care that you can hear them and feel their emotions. The year is 1070 and England is still a country in uproar. The Normans have come and taken over but there are still those who oppose them, fighting. Lily is trapped between the two sides. She is a widow who is running for her very life. She is hunted by The King's Sword, Radulf. Lily flees to the safety of a old Saxon Church only to be discovered by Radulf. Radulf doesn't know the beatiful woman he has found is the one he was looking for. He is strongly attracted to her and desires to make her his. Soon Lily's lie is uncovered and she must face not only the King but Radulf. She would sooner hurt herself than Radulf. But the rath of Radulf is not all she must face, there is a enemy who wishes to harm her and her love. Together Radul and Lily must fight to keep the peace, bring together a nation, and the love they share strong. This story is definately a keeper and I will re-read this one again.
