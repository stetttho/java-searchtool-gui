 Well I liked this book to a point. I have an older version of it and the cover art is wonderful.Fabio never looked so good! Also I liked the fiestiness of the characters. They had substance to them. I liked  the verbal confrontations between the hero and the heroine. I found the characters to be funny and filled with passion and vulnerable too. The story has the Hero posing as a lowly horse trainer and stable master. He is actually Ambrose St. James, Duke of Wrothston. Now the reasons for his hiding are a bit uncharacteristic but its the only way he's going to meet the heroine. Megan Penworthy is a beautiful young woman who has set her sights on marrying Ambrose in order to show the villiage that she is worthy. She is shunned by most because of her beauty and she has learned to act a certain way to keep men at bay. When Devlin, aka Ambrose, shows up he gets under her skin right away. She is unnerved by him and finds herself strongly attracted to him. He finds Megan to be a brat. but one that he desires to make his own. This is a easy read and enjoyable.
