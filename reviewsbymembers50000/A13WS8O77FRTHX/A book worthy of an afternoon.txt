 I liked this book very much because of the Hero, Marcus. He is driven by a curse that states that he must marry a fabled warrior maiden. He and his clan find this mythical maiden in Avalon but she wants nothing to do with any of it. She tries continually to tell him that she's not the maiden in the legend. That her destiny is of her own making and that Marcus isn't apart of it. Soon though she finds herself drawn not only to him but his people. The struggle for her love and her passion drives Marcus on until they conquer each other. I enjoyed this book and look forward to others by the same author.
