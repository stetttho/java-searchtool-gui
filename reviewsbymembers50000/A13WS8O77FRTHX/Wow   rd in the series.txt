 This is a wonderfully exciting series of books. It starts off with KISS AND TELL. The second book is HIDE AND SEEK. They all tie in with each other although they could also stand alone. The series is about the Wright family. There are several brothers who are all strong, dangerous, secretive men and thier sister Marnie who is just as strong and spunky. They are all somehow involved with a agency called T-FLAC which deals with ridding the world of international terrorists and crimnals. Its extremely exciting and the books are a constant suprise.

He wants her desparetly but is strugling with his desire to love her and his need to use her to get to her father. He has a strong sense of duty to both her and his mission.
