 Well I must say I bought this book for two reasons. First the Cover. Oh my what a hunk!The Second was the story. I liked it  but was left wanting a bit more.  The story takes place in late 1460 and early 1461 in England. The hero The earl of Lynchburg(David) is queen Margaret of Anjou, King Henry the VI's wife, champion. He has won many a battle for her and now is waiting to be rewarded with land. She marries him off by proxy to Lady Jeanette, the Earl of Cornwich's daughter. When he arrives at his new home he finds that Jeanette can never be a wife to him but he is trapped and must have an heir in one years time. This is where the heroine comes in. Her name is Riley and she is the daughter of the slain Lord Snowden, who was killed because he fought for the Yorkist. She is masquerading as a servant and went sent to the new masters room to attend to him she tries to kill him. He is very attracted to her as she is to him. He places her in the dungeon but then thinks up a plan in which she can live and he can enjoy her. She will have his child and he will present it as his wife's. She agrees to this to live and is determined to hate Lynchburg. Only she finds herself falling in love with him. He also is falling for her even though everything seems to be trying to tear them apart from each other. The love scenes are very hot, almost burned the pages. I would have liked for a bit more dialog between the two main characters. The seemed to fall for each other on pure attraction rather without much conversation. I would still recommend this book and I look forward to others by this author.
