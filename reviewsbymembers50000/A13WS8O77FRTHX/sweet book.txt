 Well  I have to admit what drew me to this book in the first place. The fact that our heroine has had 8 lives and that the last just ended. The cause, a bowling ball. Now I don't normally think of a bowling ball as a deadly weapon but after I read this book I certainly kept my eye on the next person to bowl. Anyway this story is a combo Time-Travel/Reincartion romance. Tracy, the heroine has lived 8 lives and been killed horribly in every one of them. She is now given a 9th chance but she's now been thrown back in time to 1875. Now Tracy has had it. She is very aware of her past lives and how they ended. She is ticked and demands that in her next life she have health,wealth and absolutely no chance for love. Love being the cause of all of her past death's. The "Resettlement Committee" in heaven agrees and they place her in the body of a woman in 1875 Montana. Now she has to deal with the fact that she a modern woman is now not allowed to many things just because she is a woman and also deal with the very attractive Seth Murdoch.  Seth has only known Tracy as the sickly woman named Nora. Suddenly she goes from her death bed to wonderous health. Aslo she has become a very strong, independant, beautiful woman who knocks him off his feet. He finds hims self confused by her ways but also very drawn to her. Tracy/Nora, who wanted no chance at love now finds herself dreaming of Seth and wants his love. Together they must overcome obsticals in order to be together. I enjoyed this story and probably will buy more from this author. Its filled with humor and sweetness. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to read a story that will make them smile and laugh and feel great after.
