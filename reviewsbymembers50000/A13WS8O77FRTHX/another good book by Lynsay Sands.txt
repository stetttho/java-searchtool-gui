 I have now read all but three of Lynsay Sands books and I must say I've enjoyed them all. They are filled with humor and passion. The heros are strong yet caring and gentle. The heroines are spunky, willful, almost modern in thier self reliance. The combo of the two makes for great stories. I would recommend any of her books. You'll love them.
