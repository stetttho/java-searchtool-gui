 This is the sequel to Virtual Heaven. I liked the first book ok enough to get the second. I wasn't very impressed with the book. Its the story of Gwen, who runs the virtual reality store where the Game the Tolmac Wars Two is played. the Hero is Vad who we meet in the first book. He is on a quest that he must to to regain his honor. Somehow he is thrust from the game into Gwen's reality. There are some cute scenes while he is in her reality but soon we find them back in the game. Together they must overcome a lot of emotional hangups before they can get together. Not to mention all the problems that keep them in constant trouble and fighting for their very lives. I wish these books had a bit more humor in them.
