 Well I was eagerly awaiting this book but after I read it I felt a bit wanting. I have loved all of the other books that I have read by Lynsay Sands. They have been filled with great humor and wonderful plots that had me wanting to call in sick to work just to finish the book in one setting. This one didn't. It took me three days to read. I liked it. It was a good story but the humor wasn't present and it could have been filled with it. The love scenes were ok but not special and the whole plot left a little to be desired. I would still recommend this book but it wasn't one of her best. I'm now going to start her book Sweet Revenge. I hope its better.
