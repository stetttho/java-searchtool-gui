 Well I've now read several of the Linda Jones, fairy tale books and most have been very cute lite stories that are easy to read and are just perfect for a lazy afternoon.  This book was not up to the standards of the others. I loved the front cover, yum yum! The story was bland. I found the heroine to be a brat. I didn't like her at all. She seemed to be very full of herself. The Hero wasn't very nice either but I liked the hero a bit more but he didn't come alive for me at all. I wish I could recommend this one but I just can't.
