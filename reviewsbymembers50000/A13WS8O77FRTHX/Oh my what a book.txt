 I loved this book! It was so captivating that I read it in one sitting. I couldn't put it down. The story really is of a fantasy lover come to life but only for 30 days. The heroine is a modern day career woman, a Sex Therapist. She is in realy need of a man and her best friend has found one for her. He's a Greek god in a book. All she has to do is summon him and he will be her love-slave for 30 days. Perfect right? Wrong. Grace doesn't want a man, or least her mind doesn't her body has other ideas. She does it on a lark and is shocked right out of he socks when he actually shows up, naked and willing to pleasure her right then. Julian has been trapped in the book for 2000 years by his half brother Priapus. Julian is the half human half God son of Aphrodite. He is betrayed and ends up in the book only free when he is summoned for 30 days of pleasuring. He has dark demons which he has suppressed and is completely baffled when Grace wants to help him confront them. He also doesn't quite understand that she doesn't want him to make love to her and wants him to wear clothes and even go outside. This has never happened to him and it has got him off kilter. ...  This was a very refreshing story and I eagerly await future books. This was filled with tons of humor, very very steamy love scenes and very tender parts that had me crying. I loved it and will read it again and again.
