 I discovered Karen's books about a year ago and I've never been so thankful that I did. I have loved everyone of her books. The characters are larger than life and yet normal too. They have their wants, needs and desires just like everyone else. They can be strong and willful and vulnerable and giving. Karen's books make you believe that true love does exist and that it can conquer all. I have laughed and cried over her books and read and reread them again and again. Dageus is the hero of this tale. He is brother to Drustan, from KISS OF THE HIGHLANDER. Dageus has commited a crime. He used a sacred circle of the druids for his own personal use. Now that use was to save Drustan's life so that he could go to his love but rules are rules. Now he must pay for his crime with his vey soul. He has travelled to modern times to try and find a cure for the curse. He is slowly being taken over by evil and his only was to slow the evil down is with sex. He has become a expert lover who women flock to. All except Chloe. Chloe is a sweet young student of antiquities who stumbles upon his secret and before she knows it is swept back in time with Dageus in search of the cure. She resists the temptation of Dageus until she finds that along the way she has fallen in love with him and he with her. When they do make love its explosive.  I enjoyed this story so much that I read it all in one setting. I was thrilled when we got to see characters from the previous story and a few tie ins with other stories.  If you haven't read this story get it quickly. Its a must for any historial romance readers library.
