 I enjoyed this book even though it was a bit slow at the start. It had humor and serious scenes that were evenly matched. This is the story of Francine a very geeky accountant in 1998 who is about to be married to a geeky accountant that she works for. She has a verry eccetric old neighbor who is always asking her to help her with some project or another. Well this latest project transports her back in time to England in the year 1214!. In order for her to return to her time she must "Civilize" the people here. But here is controlled by the Lord of the keep. Garrick. He's very brave but has a problem that keeps him from falling in love with any woman. Francine must get past his brutish ways to help these people and to get to the heart of Garrick's problem. Along the way she finds new friends and even starts to enjoy herself. She also finds herself more and more attracted to Garrick, who is also fighting his passion for her. Together they must compromise to bring Civilization and love to this brutal time. I enjoyed this book and was really suprised at the end. I hope to read other books by this author.
