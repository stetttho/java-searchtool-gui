 I loved this book! I had previously read Rejar and was at first a bit confused by the references that it made to this book. Now I understand it all. This book is a timetravel book that has our heroine, Deana, having a really rotten day. She's been fired, had a horrid experience on the subway, had to wait for an accident to clear before she could get to her car and was rejected by three editors! She finds a junk shop and while waiting for her car to be released she buys a old necklace. When she gets home and cleans it up she finds out its really a beautiful piece of jewelry. She then suddenly finds herself face to face with the hero, Lorgin. He is drop dead gorgeous! She realizes that he isn't from here but a real life alien! They go to San Fransico for a scifi convention and he fits right in. Then suddenly she is wisked away to another planet and becomes involved with his quest. We meet Yaniff, the old mystic, Rejar, the half man-half Familiar, and Traed a loner who has many demons to conquer. Lorgin teases her and makes her smile so much that she is falling in love with him. I liked the way Dara described the love scenes as being both hot and breathless but tender and gentle at the same time. I can't wait to read more in this series and until they come out will be reading several of her other books. This is a definate buy!
