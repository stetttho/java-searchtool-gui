 Well out of all of the Cynster books this one was just a good book. It didn't thrill me like the 1st, the 3rd, and the 5th did. I found those books to be filled with more passion and I really liked the interaction between the main characters more. This one has a lot of mystery in it which did make for some excitement.  Well it's Alasdair's turn. He's known to most as Lucifer and he's the last of the original Bar Cynster. He decides to leave London and the matchmakers to visit an old friend. When he arrives in Devon he finds his old friend dead and wakes with a aching head. How he gets that aching head is just as much a mystery as who killed his friend. He also finds his match, Phyllida. She is a strong, smart,savy business woman who like Lucifer wants to find the killer. Phyllida, has many suitors who have tried to get her to the alter but none have the stunning effect that Lucifer does. He makes resisting him the hardest thing she's ever done. She's not going to make it easy for him but when she does surrender to his love and passion, she finds all she will ever need. Oh and our old friend Chillingworth makes an apperance and gets more involved with the Cynsters than he ever wanted to. I have enjoyed this series so much and I eagerly look forward to reading about the next generation of Cynsters.
