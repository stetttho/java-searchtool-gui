 Ok I admit it, I'm a Connie Mason Junkie! I love all of her books. I've read and reread them so often I've had to replace them all once!  This is the third and final part of the Outlaw series. The two other brothers, Rafe and Jess, have found wonderful brides who can be gentle and strong at the same time and who have lead them on merry chases. Well Sam already had a bride but told no one of her. They met during the Civil War and were lost to each other soon after marrying. They were betrayed but Sam blames Lacey for it all and Lacey is told that Sam was killed in the war. Sam shows up to work on a ranch and finds that Lacey is the owner. But that's not the biggest suprise, he finds that she has a son who he believes to be the one she had with the man who betrayed him. She knows that her son is Sam's but she is so afraid that he will take him from her she doesn't tell him. She is engaged to marry another man but only to save her ranch. Sam throws a wrench into her plans but she soon discovers that she loves that wrench. Sam struggles with his feelings for her and for the boy who even though there is still a lingering doubt of his parentage, he is starting to love and consider his own. There are a couple of obsticals in Sam's way though of claiming Lacey and her son, the warrent for his arrest for bank robbery is one, even though he knows he is innocent, and the man who Lacey was to marry. He must fight all of this to win her back.  I loved this book and was so happy to find out how the other brothers were doing at the end also. Connie makes her characters seem like part of your own family. I would highly recommend this book as well as anything else she has written. You'll love them.
