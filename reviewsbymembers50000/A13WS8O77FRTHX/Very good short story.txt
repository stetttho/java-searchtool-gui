 Tremors is more like a short story than a full novel but even though its only 76 pages its still a complete story. The heorine, Marie has come to Europe trying to bascially find herself. She encounters Fredrik, the most dangergous,facinating man she's every met. His past is dark and there are horrid rumors about him. She is warned to stay away from him but soon finds that she can't. He wants her and is determined to make her his so he basically traps her.When I first read this story I only gave it a 2. I didn't really like the fact that he was so demanding of her. I reread it and have changed my mind. I can now see the pain that Fredirk was in and how desperately he wanted someone to love him as much as he loved her. The love scenes are pretty graphic but not in the disgusting way. They show true passion. Although if you are embarassed but such graphic scenes this book may not be for you.
