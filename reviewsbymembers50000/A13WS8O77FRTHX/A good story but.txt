 Well I had to rate this on two levels. I liked most of the story, the plot was interesting which inticed me to buy the book in the first place but it seemed to ramble on and then would jump around that it was a bit confusing to read. I thought that the heroine was well done but the hero Luke was unrealized. The book took me days to get through because it tended to drag. I was hoping for more excitement and didn't get much.  I have read others from this author and found them to be more thrilling and they held my interest throughout the whole book I wish this one had also.
