 Wow! I love all of Connie Mason's books but this one was great. It was extreamly hot. In fact the pages could explode! The love scenes in this are the most passionate I've read in a long time. The hero and heroine are both strong and yet tender. Both are thrown into a marriage by the King and neither really wanted it but when they come together they explode. I liked the hero's best friend Raj but other than him the secondary characters don't have much to do in this story. This is a book I'll read over and over. I loved it. Connie is my favorite author and I can't wait to read her next book. Buy this one!
