 I really enjoyed this book. I picked it up and read the whole thing in one night. It was funny, passionate, tender and loving. I liked how the author used the secondary characters to bring this book all together. This is the story of a struggling romance writter with big family problems and big money problems who accepts a all expense paid trip to England to help a sexy, bumbling PhD with his research on Human Sexuality. She goes there and finds herself helping a "Kevin Sorbo" look alike with his "problem" The fun is finding out what his "problem" is. Dexter, the PhD may look like a hunk but he's more like the nerdy professor. He knows all about sex and to make a woman feel pleasure but has no clue about what women really want from a man. He believes that Mallory can help him because she seems to know what women want in her racy, steamy romance books. This makes for some very funny and sexy scenes. I couldn't put this book down. I really enjoyed it and I look forward to others from this author.
