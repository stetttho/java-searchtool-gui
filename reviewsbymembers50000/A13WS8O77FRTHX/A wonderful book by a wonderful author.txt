 I love this authors books! They are so full of humor, passion, excitment, tenderness and love. I can't wait to read others by her. This story is the tale of a young woman named Peachy who has a very unique way of speaking. She's from a place called Possum Hollow, NC. She has just learned for a traveling Doctor that she is going to dye from the disease, Tipinosis. He gives her very little time to live so she is determined to live out her last days as a princess. She has seen all the omens and they have pointed her to a real Prince who has to find a bride soon. She has set her sights on Prince Seneca of Aventine. Seneca has just been told by his father that he must marry the woman he has chosen unless he can find his own bride in the next nine hours. Well that's when Peachy storms the castle and his life will never be the same. Peachy is totally unacceptable as the wife of a Prince but is determined to make Seneca the best wife and friend she can in the time she's got left. It takes quite a bit but finally Seneca and Peachy find passion and love. They must struggle against the snobs and others who are determined that they shouldn't be happy. I loved the way Peachy spoke, I could almost hear her. This book is a joy to read. I can't wait to read others from this author.
