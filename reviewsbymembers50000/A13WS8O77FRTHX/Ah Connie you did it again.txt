 Well I have to say that Connie is one of my favorite writers. I have read just about everything she's put out at least once. This book I originally read years ago when it first came out and I decided to reread all of her books. First off I have to say great cover! And Where can I get a man like that? Oh My! "Fanning myself" Well on to the story. I would almost call this book gothic. It has a dark manor house that is haunted by a beautiful spirit Lady Amelia. She is trying to insure the that Jackson Greystoke doesn't drink, game and carouse himself to death. He is a rogue who needs taming. In steps our heroine Moria O'Toole. She is on the run from a dark secret when she is hit by the carriage that Jackson is riding in. He can't just leave her there do die so he takes her back to the manor.  Now as she heals they discover the strong attraction between the two. They both try and resist but the fates or is that the spirits have willed it. But before they can be happy there is Moria's secret to deal with and Jackson's own fears of marriage and love. There are some very hot love scenes in this book but what would a Connie book be without them? I really enjoyed this book and plan to reread it again and again.
