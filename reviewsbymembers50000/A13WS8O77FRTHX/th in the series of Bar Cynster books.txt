 Gabriel,aka Rupert, is the next in line to get married. At least that's what everyone is saying. His cousin Demon has just gotten married to Flick and now its only Gabriel and his brother Lucifer left of the unmarried Cynsters and they plan to stay that way. That is until Gabriel meets a mysterious woman in a black veil. She needs his help desperately but has taken great pains to keep her idenity a secret from him. He must never find out that she is old friend/adversary Lady Alathea.  Alathea's family is in trouble. He father has made some bad buisness deal and if Gabriel won't help then all is ruin. Alathea has know Gabriel for years. Sparks fly when they see each other and not sparks of passion. Alathea is "on the shelf" and never thinks someone could want her until Gabriel kisses her. The kiss is magical and both are deeply effected. The only problem Gabriel doesn't know who he has kissed. He believes the mysterious lady in black is a widow.  When all is revealed passions do soar and Gabriel realizes that his bride has been under his nose all his life. He won't give her up and decides to fight for her. Alathea can't believe he wants her and tries to persuade him that she's too old for him. Its a wonderful tug of war to see who will win or if both will. I enjoyed the banter in this book. The arguments between the h/h were wonderful and made for a funny read. I liked the fact that a heroine, who was over 25, was the love interest. I highly recommend this book and all others in the series.
