 I liked this book. This is the 1st book I've read by Claudia Dain and It won't be the last. I enjoyed the story of William, the hero who has been given Greneforde Castle as a gift for being a loyal knight by his king. His traveling companions Rowland, Kendall and his squire Ulrich are the best of friends and thier loyalty to each other is plain to see. William takes as his bride the orphaned Cathryn. She is a quiet and beautiful young woman who has protected her people during the long war as best she could. William must overcome many barriers to prove his love for Cathryn. He is tender with her but determined to win her love. This story was warm and touching and I would enjoy reading about the secondary characters in future books.
