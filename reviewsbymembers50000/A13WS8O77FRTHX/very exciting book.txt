 Wow! I really enjoyed this book. This is the second book I've read from this author. The first was "Kiss and Tell" which is tied into this book. Both books are filled with action, passion and humor. The characters are so well written you can actually picture them. The secondary characters bring the whole thing together smoothly. Even the evil people made this book worth every penny of it. This is the story of Delanie and Kyle. Kyle was briefly heard from in the first book. He is the brother to the heroine in that book. In this book he is undercover as an assassian and working with a mad man who wants to sell bio-chemicals to the highest bidder. While on assignment he runs into Delanie. He and Delanie have a past and its soon apparent that they didn't finish everything 4 years ago. Delanie is pretending to be a spoiled girlfriend of the mad man while she searches for her lost sister. Kyle and Delanie are thrown together and soon they have to give into their passions. They must work to gether to save the world and find her sister.  This was an exciting tale that kept me glued to the pages. I couldn't wait until I found out how it all would end up. I hope Cherry Adair continues the series and soon.
