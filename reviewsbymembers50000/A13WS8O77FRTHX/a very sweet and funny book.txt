 This book is a sequel to "A Dance Thru Time". This is Alex Smith's story. He is the brother to the heroine from "A Dance Thru Time". Alex is bored and goes off on his own trying to find a transport to sunny Barbados only to find himself transported back in time. Here he encounters quite a few interesting characters.  The one that has him the most facinated and bewildered is Margaret of Falconberg. She is a strong, self assured woman who has been protecting her keep and people by herself for far to long. She longs for a mate to help her on her journey thru life but is fearful of giving up control. She doesn't realize what a beauty she is and this makes her all the more beautiful. Alex is a thorn in her side. He has strange ways, his speech, his mode of dress and his vow never to pick up a sword again. He has her totally confused by his actions as well. He is also effected by Margaret.He is strongly attracted to her but knows that he can't stay in her time. This is a wonderful romance. Its funny and tender, exciting and thrilling. I look forward to others in the series.
