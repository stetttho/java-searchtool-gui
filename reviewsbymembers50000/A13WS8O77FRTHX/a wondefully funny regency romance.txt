 This is the first book I've read by this author and it won't be the last. I found this book to be filled with wonderful humor and wit. I enjoyed the banter between the two main characters, Simon and Calli. The secondary characters of Simon's mother, Simon's two best friends, Bones and Armand were all wonderful. I hope to see a book about Armand soon.  I loved Lester and Simon's servants. They whole cast made this a very enjoyable book. So much so that I read it all in one sitting until 2:30 in the morning! The plot is zany but well thought out although I would have liked the to see the villian come to a more fitting end. I will read this book again and plan on getting more of Kasey Michael's books.
