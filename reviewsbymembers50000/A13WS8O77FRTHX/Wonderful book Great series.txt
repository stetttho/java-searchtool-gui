 I have found another author that I will read evrything she writes. I discovered her by accident. I started reading one of  the other books in the series and found out very quickly that it was a series and that I had to get them all. I am so glad I did. I found Stephanie's books filled with humor, passion,tendereness, strength and love. I loved how the men are strong and yet vulnerable. The women are independant, fiesty and passionate. Both the men and the women could stand alone but together they are a complete person. This is the first in the series of the Bar Cynster family. Its the story of Devil Cynster, the head of the family. He is the 6th Duke of St.Ives. He meets the woman who will turn his life upside down, Honoria Wetherby, at the scene of a tragic accident. She has stumbled across the dying cousin of Devil. Devil knows its no accident but with Honoria's help he tends the boy until he passes. Honoria and Devil are found the next day alone in the cabin they took shelter in from a storm. Honoria is compromised and Devil decides to marry her. Now Honoria has no plans to ever get married. She wants to have travel and have new experiences and excitements. She soon finds all the excitement she can take. She is drawn into the Cynster family and soon into Devil's arms. He awakens a deep passion in her and she finally agrees to marry him. Now the Devil and his cousin's must find out who killed thier cousin and why. Honoria refuses to be left out and Devil must learn that she is more than just a pretty face and lovely body.  The discussions between the two are humorous and you can almost see their expressions of anger and then happiness and love. I enjoyed this book thouroughly and plan to read it again and again.
