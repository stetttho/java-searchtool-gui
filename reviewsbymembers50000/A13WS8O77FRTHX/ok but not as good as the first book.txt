 This is the sequel to "The Last Viking" which I really enjoyed. I liked the humor in that book and the love scenes were very hot. This book was humorous and the love scenes were very hot but I just didn't really get into the characters as much. The hero is the brother from the first book. His name is Jorund and he has bee sent on a quest by his father to find his brother Rolf. Now this is back in 998 AD in the Norse lands. With the help of a unique killer whale he is transported to modern day Galveston Texas. Where he shows up naked at Orcaworld where he meets up with the heroine, Maggie. She is there with her twin girls enjoying the show when this drop dead gorgeous hunk shows up. She is a psychologists and he is taken to the hospital where she works and she is put incharge of his care. She is very attracted to him as he is to her and when he finally starts to talk it is quite funny. Along the way he becomes involved in her life at the hospital and later her home life. they blend very well but he is trying his best to keep his distance from her kids kids and he keeps his heart out of the picture because he knows he must go back to his time to resume his quest. I liked the secondary characters and was cheering for them. I would have liked it if the twins had played a bit more of a part in this. It was an enjoyable read but not as good as the first.
