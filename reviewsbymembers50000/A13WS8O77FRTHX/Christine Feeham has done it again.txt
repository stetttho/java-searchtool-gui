 This was a great book. I have read several of Christine's Dark series so I knew that this would be a page turner and it was. This one is a gothic historical romance. It doesn't have Vampires or Carpathiansin it  but the lack of those doesn't diminish this book one bit. This is the story of the village healer, a beautiful girl names Nicoletta and the Fierce, dark and cursed Don Giovanni Scarletti. Nicoletta comes to the Scarletti family home which is known by its nickname Palazzo della Morte, or in English palace of death, to help save Giovanni's young niece. She also has to treat him as he is ill also. She is strangly drawn to him even though she resists. After she returns to the village the Don envokes his right of choosing his bride from the villages on his land. She tries to hide but he finds her and makes her his bride. Together they must fight the evil that is threatening to kill them both and over come the Curse. There is many instances of humor and I found myself wanting to read more after the book was done. There are some very interesting secondary characters that I think would make good heros and heroines for possible future books. Get this book. You'll really enjoy it.
