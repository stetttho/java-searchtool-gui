 Lynsay Sands has become one of my favorite authors. I look forward to each one of her books. She adds humor so well that it has caused me to laugh at loud and get strange looks from passersby. In Bliss she has the hero the Lord "hammer" of Holden being wedded to his neighbor the Lady"Tyrant" of Tiernay, after the King who is tired of the feud between the two decides to wed them and le them be each other's problem not his. Well since neither can refuse the king they must go through with it, or at least make the other try and get out of it. Hethe, the hero, decides that he cannot anger the king and since the heroine is beautiful it wouldn't be that great a hardship to go through with it. The would be bride has other ideas. Helen, the heroine, thinks that she can make him back out by playing all sorts of wicked tricks on him but they unfortunately backfire on her and she finds herself wedded to her handsome but supposedly horrid neighbor. Soon though she finds out that he is not the cruel man he has been rumored to be and he finds that he has great feelings for her. They fall in love and together will fight an unknown assasin and bring harmony to both keeps.  I loved this book and would highly recommend it to anyone. And also any of Lynsay Sands other novels.
