 This is the 3rd book in the series. I loved the other two but I really found this one to be the best. This is Hugo's story. He is the younger brother to Rafe who was the hero in "Once Upon a Dream".  Hugo has finally decided tho settle down. He has quit gambling and buys an estate. Nearby this estate is a sanitarium which his mother has asked him to visit in order to find out how one of the patients is doing and to deliver a check. He goes very reluctlantly. While there he sees a vision. An angel walks by the window and their eyes meet and he is left very shaken. He can't get out of there fast enough. He flees to London where he falls back into his old life of gambling and now has lost his fortune and his new home in one hand. He must now marry for money. He soon finds out that the angel he saw at the sanitarium is a missing heiress and is very wealthy. He convinces her to marry and the adventure begins. He never really knows what hits him. The angel is Meggie. She is not a patient but an orphan that was sent to work at the sanitarium. She can read minds but when she sees Hugo she can't read him at all. She is very strangly effected by him and when he comes back to get her she thinks he's mad. She has no idea of her new found wealth and thinks he wants to marry her because he has fallen in love with her at first sight. She soon realizes that she loves him but is afraid to tell him for fear of his discovering her gift. There are two wonderful aunties in this story and we get to find out a bit of what has happened to Rafe and Lucy. This story has a lot of humor in it and the love scenes are hot and steamy. I liked the way Katherine Kingsley made both the hero and the heroine human with emotions that can go awry at any time. I will definately reread this book many times. I can't wait to read other books from her.
