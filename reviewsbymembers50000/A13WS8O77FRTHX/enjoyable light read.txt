 I liked this book. It was a fast, funny, passionate read. The characters were nicely developed and the secondary characters made the book. I especially liked the Old One, as a cat.  This is a timetravel book with a twist. The hero, Brian, comes back to the year 2002 from the future year of 2502 for a vacation. He decides to go to Ireland and see if he can fix the old family castle. When he arrives he finds two American women there also on vacation. Ally and her great aunt Katy. Katy is quite the character. She's an old woman who has never gotten old. She loves life and is trying to get her grand-niece to lighten up. when they meet Brian Ally is knocked for a loop. Brian is drop dead gorgeous and all man. Ally has had a rough divorce and is tired of "pleasing" men where Brian aches to have someone "please" him. You see in his time he is a professional athlete. But not the kind we think of now, you see our sports have replaced with the sport of SEX! Yes Sex! He plays for a team called the Sex Monarchs and was just named MVP(yes there is a joke about that)of the Sex Super Bowl. all his life he has pleased women with his technique but desires nothing more that to be the one pleased by his woman. The sexual inuendos in this book are very funny and made it very enjoyable to read. There is a minor mystery in the story that suprised me. I really enjoyed this book and read it in one day. You can't help but like it.
