 This was the first book I've read by Robin Schone and it won't be the last. I was unsure of what a erotic romance would be. I've read Connie Mason books that have gotten pretty steamy but I was un prepared for this book. Wow! was my first thought! The love scenes are explosive but I was also very please to see that this book had a real plot and tender romantic scenes as well. I enjoyed reading about the characters and found them to be very lifelike and humorous at times. The Story is a time travel out of body book. A modern woman named Elaine suddenly finds herself back in England in the 1880's in the body of a 21 year old named Morrigan. Morrigan has been married to Charles for a year and they just consumated the marriage right before Elaine shows up. Elaine is very disoriented and doesn't understand what has happened to her. Charles is very frustrated becaue the woman he though he had married seemed to have no interest in being married until a year later. Charles is determined to bring out Morrigan/Elaine's passions and sets about to teach her the pleasure that can be had between them. He must also deal with her very prudish family who shows up to take Morrigan back. Elaine soon finds herself falling in love with Charles and joyfully joining him in the pleasures of the marriage bed. I would recommend this to anyone who likes those steamy romances but also likes them to have strong characters and good plots.
