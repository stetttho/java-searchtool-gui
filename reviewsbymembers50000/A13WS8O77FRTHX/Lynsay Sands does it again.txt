 I have enjoyed all of Lynsay's books especially when she lets her sense of humor loose. I had been a bit disappointed with a few of her recent books because the humor wasn't present like it had been, well its back in full force in this book. I laughed until I was crying.  This book has its hero, Hugh trying to court the headstrong Willa. Hugh must marry her in order to fulfill his uncle's will. Hugh is a highly trained knight who has little skills at wooing. And wooing is what he must do to win Willa. Everyone gives him advice and some of that advice has the reader rolling on the floor.  Willa knows that Hugh is the man for her but he must come to her crawling on his belly. literally!, before she can wed him. Her life is a mystery even to herself. There are dangers that threaten their chance at happiness at every turn. Hugh must protect Willa's life for he doesn't he will loose all that he really desires in life, her. If you want a light, quick, funny, passionate story then read this. I can't wait for more.
