 This is the first book I've read from this author and I'm hoping it won't be the last. I found it to be very well written with the characters well developed and a interesting plot. The story centers around the Hero, the Slayer aka Christian. He is a very feared man because of his past deeds that have earned him the nickname. He needs someone to take care of his newborn son after his wife dies in childbirth. That someone is Clarise. She has to lie her way into Slayer's home because she has been sent to destroy Slayer. She has no desire to see his downfall but she has hidden reasons of her own. She soon finds herself taking care of the newborn, Simon and falling in love with both him and his arrogant, dark father. Soon Clarise's deception is uncovered and yet Christian can't send her away. Together they must battle old enemies and find a way to start anew. The author has made me a fan and I look forward to more from her.
