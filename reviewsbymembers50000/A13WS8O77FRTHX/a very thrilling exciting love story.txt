 this book it not what it seems. At first its simply a tale of a lonely man who is thought to be a vampire coming to the aid of a lovely young woman he doesn't know to help her live. Then it suddenly becomes a thrilling mystery and thriller novel. There is a lot of action in this book that has the hero, Alexander and the heroine, Kara running for their very lives several times. I enjoyed this book so much I read it in one setting. The story is that Alexander is asked by Kara's little sister to try and help Kara. Kara has been in a terrible car accident and is not doing very well. He refuses but later finds himself in her hospital room giving her some of his blood. It works and she recovers and he can't stay away from her. He tries but they are now bonded together. She is facinated by Alex and soon finds herself in love with the mysterious man. She knows that there is something different about him but when she finds out what it is she can't handle it at first. Then she realizes that no matter what he is she loves him and that he loves her and they have to be together for the rest of their lives.  all druing their discovery of love they are chased and captured by a evil man who wants their blood for healing miracles at high prices. He is doing everything he can to capture them and use them for his own glory and fame. This story is exciting, fast paced, tender, loving, touching and full of suprises. I loved it and can't wait to read others by this author.
