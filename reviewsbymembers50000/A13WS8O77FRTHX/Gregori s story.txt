 This is the 4th in the Dark series. I have enjoyed all the books even though they take me at least two days to read. Christine Feeham brings to life the Carpathian male so well that you dare not skip a single word. This is Gregori's story. We first meet him in Dark Prince. He is the hunter for his people. He has spent over a thousand years hunting down and killing those of his own kind who have turned vampire and those human vampire hunters who wish to erase all the Carpathians from the earth. He is very close to turning himself as he waits for his lifemate Savannah to grow up. She is the Daughter of his Prince Mikhail and his lifemate Raven. Gregori gives her 5 years after she turns 18 to be free before binding her to him. She flees to the US and becomes a famous magician. When he can wait no longer he claims her as his and the sparks fly. She is very independant and he is over protective. Together they must find common ground so that thier love can grow. She is his light and he struggles with the newly found emotions she brings out in him. I loved the tug of war between them when she wanted to do something and he was reluctant to allow. Together they must fight to save themselves  as well as their people. I look forward to reading about them and all the previous characters in Christine's other books. Buy this series and enjoy.
