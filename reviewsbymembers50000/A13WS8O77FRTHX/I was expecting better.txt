 I have to agree with another reviewer about how this book has so much going on that the romance between the two main characters is overshadowed. I didn't like the way they even interacted with each other. I normally like it when the hero and heroine don't get along right off and then realize that they really love each other but these two just annoyed me. I wish I could rate this higher but I just can't. Hopefully her next book will be better.
