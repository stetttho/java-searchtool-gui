 I had put off reading this book for ages and I am sorry I did so. I found this book to be wonderful. It has humor, excitement, passion and tenderness all wrapped up in a beautifully written story. The characters are enchanting, the settings beautifully described that you almost feel as if you are there talking to the characters. The story is first set in 1996, New York. Our heroine, Elizabeth is a struggling romance writter who has just dreamed the most romantic dream of her life. She can't shake the dream and even imagins she hears the hero's voice. She picks up a book on Scottish history and its Clans, and comes across the Clam MacLeod. She suddenly finds herself not in a New York Park but in the woods in 1311 Scotland.She is taken as a witch and the hero of her dreams, the MacLeod, throws her in the dungeon. He soon realizes that he can't forget her. She has haunted his dreams and now his every waking moment. He is clueless on how to deal with a woman, especially a woman from the future. He struggles with his feelings for her until love wins. Elizabeth is trying very hard to adjust to James and his boarish ways and soom finds that even if she could go home she doesn't want to. The secondary characters are wonderful and I can't wait to read other books in the series to find out what happens to them. I laughed and cried over this book and know that I will read and reread it many times. Its a true romance classic.
