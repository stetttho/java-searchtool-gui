 This is the first book I've read from this author and I'd like to read more. I liked the humor and the passion found in the characters. Also the secondary characters are interesting enough to lead to possible other books. This book starts out with a bet. Connor MacEowan is a dashing, handsome, wealthy laird of Glenarris who has three very interesting friends. His has always won every wager but they think they have come upon the one that he can't win. To make one Gemma Baird fall in love with him as a poor, ugly man. His friends are so sure he will lose  and he so sure that he will win he bets his home, Glenarris.  So off he goes to win the lady. He encounters her quite by accident during a snow storm.  They take shelter in a small cottage for two nights. When he escorts her home the next day he offers for her to save her reputation. Gemma is horrified. She can't marry this arrogant, smelly man. But she soon finds she has no choice.  Soon they are man and wife and he wisks her off to his home. Actually his "home" is a small crofters cottage far to the north. There they begin to start a life. They soon find that they are attracted to each other and passions are soon flamed. But things are not as they seem. Connor is still reluctant to tell his wife that he has feelings for her and the reason he married her in the first place. Also there is trouble brewing from a unknown source. Their peaceful existance is upset and Gemma soon finds herself married to a man she never knew. Gemma who is a strong woman must become even stronger to keep herself and thier marriage together. These two must struggle with not only outside influences that are trying to drive them apart but thier own demons. I found this book to be an easy read and a very enjoyable way to spend an afternoon.
