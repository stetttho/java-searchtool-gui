 Well I finally have now read the 1st book in this series. I read them backwards by accident. I love this series. The Bridgerton family is wonderful. This is the story of the eldest daughter Daphne Bridgerton and The Duke of Hastings, Simon Basset. Simon is an old friend of Daphne's older brother Anthony. He has just returned from a six year long absense from England and is determined not to go to any social functions because he has no intention of ever marrying. He does agree to go to one hosted by the Lady Danbury who had always been nice to him when he was a child. There he comes upon the lovely Daphne and they form an instant friendship. Daphne's mother has her on edge with trying to find a husband. She hasn't had much luck so when Simon thinks up a scheme to help them both out she agrees. As it progresses she falls for Simon and he is strongly attracted to her but is determined not to marry her. He has a deep secret that he keeps to himself. They must overcome his fears, his secret and her family to make this work. This book has lots of humor in it and a lot of tenderness. I have enjoyed these books and can't wait to read more and to especially find out who Lady Whistledown really is.
