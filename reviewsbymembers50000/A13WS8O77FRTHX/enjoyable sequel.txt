 Well I was really looking forward to this book. I really enjoyed the first book "Beyond Innocence" and I was hoping this book would be just as good. It was. I did blush a bit at the erotic love scenes. They are very graphic but they also show that sex is a natural and beautiful thing. I liked the characters and the story line was interesting. I did wish that the heroine was more forceful like she was in the first book. She seemed a bit to demure. She went from being very high spirited to shy. I still found her to be a likeable woman but thought she came across better in the first book. The story starts off with our heroine, Merry, being practically forced into a marriage with a man she likes as a friend but nothing more. She wants her freedom to do as she pleases with her life but her parents won't hear of it. She decides that they only way to get out of it is to do something scandalous and then no one will want to marry her. She decides to pose nude for the the notorious rogue, Nicholas Craven. Nicholas has no clue as to her real identity and thinks that she is a maid that has been cast out and he saves from the street. He is highly attracted to her but is willing to wait until the right time to make her his. He has never had a mistress for more than a few weeks so he is troubled when he finds that he doesn't want to let her go. He tries to shock her over and over and she still stays. He soon finds that he cannot live without her but when her real identity comes to life he may be forced to give her up. This is a very very erotic, passionate tale that keeps you wondering what will happen next.
