 Well I read this book in one afternoon. I really enjoyed it. I am used to time travel books but most tend to go back to Midevil England or Scotland and go back many hundreds of years. This one goes back to 1887 America. Our heroine is a modern day woman who is cleaning and restorying a portrait of Dimitri Karakov, a Prince who was killed at the Chesterfield, a posh hotel now in ruins. She is strangly drawn to the Chesterfield and the painting. She can actually feel Dimitri's warm skin when she touches it. She is so facinated by the Chesterfield that when she goes there and finds a bent name plate that belongs to the painting she is transported back in time to the Chesterfield of old. She is greeted like they knew she was coming and she ends up meeting Dimitri. He is to be king someday and must fight his growing attraction for her. She is there she believes to save his life and keeps trying to warn him. He also must keep his feelings of jealously hidden. His brother Alexi is quite fond of Cynda and since he is the second son can marry whom he likes.  Cynda isfired after Dimitri makes a complaint and he is sorry to have caused her a loss decides to have him paint his portrait, the  portrait. They spend many hours at it and become closer and closer. He loves her spirit and her soul and she loves to make him smile and see him at ease. Together they must overcome thier stations in life and unseen dangers to be together. Along the way we encounter others that may have traveled through time as well. This is the third book in the series and I am going to go back and read the first two and then await the fourth.
