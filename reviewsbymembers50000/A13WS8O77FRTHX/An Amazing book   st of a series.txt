 This book was wonderful. Its actually two books in one. The first one is "One With the Hunger" Its a vampire book,one of my favorite. This is also the first book in a series. The hero is Val, a mysterious, dark, gorgeous, hunk of Vampire who has found his mate. Shai Jordan is a quiet, hardworking woman. She has a wonderful group of very excentric friends who only want her happiness. They decide she needs a man. And guess who is very willing to fulfill those needs. You guessed it, Val. There is more than just hot sexual attraction between these two. Both are tracking a killer, someone who is ruthless and pure evil. I really enjoyed this story and my only complaint would be it was too short! The second story is "Retribution". This is the story of Shai's and Val's friends Jennifer and Conor "Mac" MacNaughton. In this story we find out how Val and Jennifer know each other. Also We find that Jennifer and Mac have a past. Its a past that has tarnished their lives and it will take a lot of trust and compassion on both sides to overcome the hurt. Oh and by the way while this is all going on they all must fight against the evil killer who escaped in the first book. We meet several new characters in this book who go on to have their own stories. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a good hot vampire book. I do have one question though, do all vampires come from the Carpathian mountains? I know that is where the vampires in Christine Feehan's books are from and so I was suprised to read that Val is from there as well. Must be something in the water.
