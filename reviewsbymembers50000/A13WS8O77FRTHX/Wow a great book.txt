 Well this is the 2nd book in Christine Feeham's Dark series. The first "Dark Prince" blew me away so I was thrilled to find this book. The hero, Jaques, is a Carpathian. He must have blood to survive but he hasn't gone over to the darkness tht would turn him into a killing vampire. He is trapped but vampire hunters and tortured. He sends out telepathic messages to a young wonam doctor named Shea. She has her own need for blood daily and because of this is now being hunted by the same hunters. She frees Jaques and together they must heal each other and fight those who hunt them. Mikhail and Raven and Gregori from the first book make appearances which add to the story beautifully. I really enjoy this series and can't wait to read more. Buy this and have a wonderful day of reading.
