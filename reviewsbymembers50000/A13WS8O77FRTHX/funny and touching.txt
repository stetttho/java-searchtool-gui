 I have to add Julia Quinn to my list of favorite authors. I have loved all of her books. This one was very funny and smart. I also found it touching and warm. This is the story of Caroline, a heiress who has been shuffled to several guardians since her parents passed away. Each guardian seems to get worse. This last one is a fortune hunter intent on having her marry his son. Well she spoils that by running away, only to be caught by the handsome Blake who is on a mission for the War Dept. and mistakes her for a traitor. He takes to his home and locks her in a room with the intent of getting her to talk, well she has other ideas. How she avoids talking is truely inventive. When he finally does realize that she is not the traitor he is at a loss as what to with her. He is strongly attracted to her but has demons that he must overcome in order to come to love her. Together along with James Riverdale, the best friend of Blake, they must battle the evil that is threatening the government of England. Along the way they have some very amusing times and endear themselves to the reader. I look forward to reading James's story next. Definately get this book and every other Julia Quinn book you can, you'll really enjoy them.
