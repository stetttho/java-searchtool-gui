 This book made me laugh so hard I almost fell out of my bed. The story is about a woman in modern times who's fiance wants her to sign a prenuptial agreement. This sends her off to climb a mountain. She is minding her own business when her guardian angel in training sneezes and sends her back to the 1890's! She is very confused about all of this and so is the hero and his children who have seen her practically fall out of the sky. The handsome Oklahoma cowboy  is trying to find out who is behind the damage happening to his ranch and is suspicious of the woman who is wearing strange clothing. But he is also highly attracted to her and when they finally admit that they have fallen for each other he is unsure of whether she will stay with him or not. The secondary characters of the guardian angel in training and his trainer are hilarious and had me in tears. The scene with the cow is the best. Pick this book up for sure.
