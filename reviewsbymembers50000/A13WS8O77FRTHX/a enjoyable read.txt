 I bought this book when one of my Amazon.com friends bought it and gave me a discount if I bought it also. I'm glad I did. It was an enjoyable, quick read.  The story is a time-travel-historial one where the heroine is not only transported back in time but into another body. Jocelyn starts off on a bus tour in England where they have stopped to see a reenactment of a Bride sale. She is the chosen "bride" and gets into the costume only to find that everything has changed, including herself. She is sold to a handsome Lord Garren who is only marrying to get his father off his back. He is strongly attracted to her but cannot understand her strange ways and her insistance that she is in the wrong body! He deposits her at his country home and goes back to his old life. Jocelyn soon realizes that she cannot change the fact that she is now someone else and in another time but decides to adapt. She starts with making the new body hers which causes several raised eyebrows. She soon enlists Garren's father to help her win Garren. It is a very amusing plan. Garren soon realizes that he needs her and loves her but is still unable to believe her story. They both must struggle to trust each other and overcome the past and the future. I really enjoyed this tale and I look forward to others by this author. I'd like to see a sequel about the girl who took over Jocelyn's modern body.
