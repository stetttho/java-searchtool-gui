 I loved this book. I couldn't put it down. i have enjoyed all the Bridgerton books and was so excited to see Colin get his story. I also like that the heroine in this story was not the typical heroine. Penelope is not the "young" debutant that most tend to be. She is considered a spinster at the ripe old age of 28! Of course at that time she was off the market. She has been a family friend for years and Colin, even though he has always liked her, he never really looked at her or considered her more that another sister. Well that all changes when he comes back to London. Penelope has loved Colin since the first time she saw him. She has cherished every moment they have spent together and has accepted her fate as a spinster and thinks that those brief memories will be all she will have. How wrong she is. Now that Colin is having Penelope haunt his dreams he can't stay away from her and will do anything to protect her from any harm. Even keep her secrets. Together they shock society and even their own families when they reveal thier love for each other. Also the infamous Lady Whistledown plays a big part in the story like she has done in all the other books.  I'd read these books in the order they came out to avoid confusion even though all the books are so well written they can stand alone. I can't wait for the series to continue.
