 I can't wait to read more from this author. I found this book to be warm, touching, funny, passionate and very enjoyable. I loved the secondary characters of Aunt Sophie and Daniel. I would have liked to read a bit more about them but maybe they will show up in future books. The other characters of Austin and Sarah made me want to read their story asap. This is a time travel/fantasy romance. The hero, Connor is a sorcerer. He can do things that amaze and frighten some. He travels 1000 years into the future to the 1880s in Boston to meet the woman who has been in his dreams since childhood. Laura. Laura is a woman who is trying to be so very proper to help her father. She has had the same dreams of Connor since childhood but when he appears she has no idea what to do with him. He has her very rattled and she gets so very confused about her feelings towards him and doing what she thinks is the right thing. There are also outside enemies trying to break these two apart and its exciting finding out whether or not they succeed. I really enjoyed this book and I'm looking forward to reading others by this author.
