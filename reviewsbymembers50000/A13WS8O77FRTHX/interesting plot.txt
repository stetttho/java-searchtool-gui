 Well at first i wasn't sure I would like this book. I sounded a bit weird. The hero is a character in a virtual reality game that the heroine plays. Something goes wrong and she is suddenly in the game. Maggie, the heroine, is confused, and scared. She wants to go home and the hero Kered has a quest he must complete first before he can help her. They meet up with a friend of Kered's named Vad who has his own story in a later book. I liked this book but it took me a few days to read.
