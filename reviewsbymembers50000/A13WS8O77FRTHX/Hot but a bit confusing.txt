 Well this book is very hot when it comes to the love scenes. I was just a bit confused about the character of Rejar. I think that you really need to read the preceding book or books to get who he is. I liked the fact that he was both human and cat, I'm partial to cats. But it was a bit confusing on how he ended up in Regency England. I liked the secondary characters of Traed and I look forward to his book. I also enjoyed the older brother Lorgin and his wife and I will have top buy thier story. This was a very good book but I think it will make more sense when I read the others in the series.
