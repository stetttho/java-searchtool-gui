 Well this was a first. I've never read a romance were the hero was innocent and the heroine wasn't. I enjoyed this furturistic romance because it was different. Chloe Hall didn't go into great detail about the future but concentrated on the people and thier interactions more. I really liked that. She made the people the story and the outside was just that outside and just decoration. The hero if the story Dekkan is from a planet called Amity. Its a planet where chastity is highly reguarded. So much so that men and women where a patch from puberty  until marriage to stay chaste. Needless to say Dekkan is a virgin. He is engaged but when he has to go to the planet of Mariposa, a world known for its exotic pleasures, he almost forgets his fiance when he meets the very beautiful and very naked butterfly dancer named Ariel.  Ariel and Dekkan's father had met previously and Dekkan's father had lost a family heirloom gambling and only Ariel can help Dekkan get it back. Ariel is very attracked to Dekkan and he is extremely attracted to her, especially since his patch quit working. Together they fight the passion that they are feeling for each other. This is a highly sexual romp where you aren't sure if they will ever actually get to consummate thier passion. I enjoyed this book and it was easy to read. I read it in one afternoon.
