 I was excited by this book when I first read about it. The plot sounded so unique that I jumped at a chance to get it. It took me a while to get into it though and even though I enjoyed it I was looking for more humor and passion. There are several scenes that could have been hilariously funny and only got a mild chuckle out of me.  The plot line has the hero, J.T., coming home to find out what his nutty professor father is up to now. He stumbles into his fathers lab and POOF! He's now invisible. Now his father's assistant is a beautiful woman named Roselyn. Roselyn has a interesting past herself which introduces us to her unique family. Roselyn, J.T. and his father must find the solution to make J.T. visible and also catch a bad guy in the process. This book has some excitement and is cute at times. I found the book enjoyable but I was hoping for more from it.
