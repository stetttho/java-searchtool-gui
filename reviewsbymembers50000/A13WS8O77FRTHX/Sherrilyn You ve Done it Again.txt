 OK now I hardly ever give a book a 5 star rating so this was a first in quite a while. I have to be really emotionaly touched by a story to give it a 5, this story did that. I always knew that Zarek's Story was going to be good. He is such a lost, tortured soul that it would be powerful, I just didn't realize how powerful. Sherrilyn writes of a man who has never known any form of love or compassion. He assumes that he is worthless and that everyone should treat him that way. He has been alone for so long that even though he craves companionship, he has no idea how to talk to someone. You could actually feel how lonely he was and see the pain in his eyes. Astrid is a Nymph (not Nympho, yet) who has come to judge him. She must decide if he is to live or be put to death. She is blind while on Earth and must use her heart to find the truth. When she meets Zarek, she knows that this man is not like any she's met or judged before. There is a real possibility that he is innocent. An evil Dark-hunter killer is sent to dispatch Zarek. He want his revenge and is now after Astrid as well. Zarek must fight the fight of his life to save the one person in the whole universe that means more to him than anything ever has. He is willing to die to save her. I laughed and cried reading this book, mostly cried. I know I just finished this book but I already want to reread it. The love scenes are hot but also so very tender that it makes your heart ache. There is humor in this book mostly provided by Simi and Sasha. There is danger and excitement. There is love. I really can't recommend this book enough. It was simply a wonderful treasure.
