 Well I now must consider Dara Joy one of my favorite authors. I have loved her Matrix of Destiny series but this book and the sequel High Intensity blew me away. This is the story of reporter Zanita Masterson, a reporter for a local paper who wants to take a seminar on Psychics to expose a fake who is preying on sick women. She accidently ends up taki9ng the seminar taught by Physicist Tyberius Augustus Evans, or Tyber to his friends. She soon realizes her mistake but by then its too late. He has spotted her and is determined to make her his. He is a drop dead gorgeous hunk who looks like a pirate not a scientist. She can't seem to stay away from him and when she tells him of her quest to uncover the fake psychic he agrees to help her. There are some really great secondary characters that make this book a whole lot of fun. I would even like to see two of them get their own story. This story is full of laughter and steamy scenes that almost burned the pages. I will definately read this book and its sequel time and time again. Buy this book!
