 When i first discovered Robin Schone's work I was hooked. Her books are filled with excitement, love, understanding and most of all erotic passion. Lots of passion! Her books are not for the timid. Her love scenes are so hot that they can make the most experienced person blush. But even though the love scenes are very graphic they are not pornographic. they don't insult the reader but rather make the reader think about their own wants and desires. This is the first book of two. Gabriel's Woman is the second book. You really need to read them in order to get the full story. This is Michael's story. Michael is a man with a past. He is a former whore. He has made his fortune being with those who could pay for him. That is all behind him now after a terrible accident made him unattractive to  the women who used to flock to him. He now is searching for revenge upon the man who did this to him. During his search a woman approaches him to bring her passion. She is willing to pay him ten thousand pounds. Anne Aimes is that woman. She is a 36 year old spinster. She has pu her life on hold to take care of her elderly parents and now that they are gone she wants to experience something of life and passion before she grows too old. Anne is not a great beauty and yet Michael is drawn to her. He accepts her proposal and soon finds himself not just fullfilling his physical needs but his emotional ones as well. Anne is caught in the same web and longs to be with Michael no matter what. There is an evil that is haunting them. They must conquer it in order to live and to find happiness in each others arms. Michael soon finds that his need for revenge is overpowered by his need to keep Anne safe. I found the characters well developed and I look forward to Gabriel's story.
