 This is the sequel to the book" A Double-Edged Blade" which was the story of Miles and Faith. Well they appear in this book too so you get to find out what happened to them. This is Fiona's story. She is Faith's cousin back in modern England aand after a year of not knowing where Faith has gone to she decides to do a bit of investigating on her oen. She goes to Ireland where her cousin disapeared and finds herself at the same Druid circle of stones that Faith was at. The time portal opens again and she finds her self propelled back in time to the Ireland of 1649. There she meets up with Miles's friend a Scot with an attitude, named Ian. Together they must help Miles and Faith and along the way they fall for each other. Some of the supporting characters from the first book make an appearance here and it makes for a very enjoyable read. I also enjoyed the different ending it had. I would recommend this book and the first one to anyone who enjoys time travel books.
