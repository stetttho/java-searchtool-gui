 This was a very good book. I liked the Little Red Riding Hood twist to it. The Heroine, Molly is a sweet, giving, innocent, loving girl who meets up with the Wolf(thats his name) while walking to her grandmother's house. Wolf is a man who has lived the past 7 years being ridiculed and shunned by stangers and even his so called friends. He is determined not to love Molly. Not even to need her. He marries her with the intention of just bedding her and then leaving and going back to his life in NYC, but somewhere along the way Molly gets under his skin. He suddenly finds that he does need her and takes her along with him to NY. They have many obstacles to over come before they can find the love that they both need to survive. I enjoyed this book and will probably by more of Linda Jones's books.
