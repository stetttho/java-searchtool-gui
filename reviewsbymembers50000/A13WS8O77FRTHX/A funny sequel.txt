 This is the second book by this author that I've read and I loved it. Its not a direct sequel but two of the supporting characters from the first book "The Cat's Fancy" Deena and Hoop are just as wonderful in this book. The heorine is a Superheroine, or at least a would be Superheroine. Zoe Smith is from a race of people that in ancient Greece were know as the Gods. She half human and half superhero. Her mother was human and her father a Protector(superhero).She has super powers like x-ray vision and telekinesis(she's still working on this). She has very heightened senses so that even eating is a challenge. Her mother doesn't know her secret and in oder to become a full fedged superhero she must tell her. She has to do this before her 25th birthday which is approaching fast. If this wasn't enough pressure she soon meets up with a mortal man who drives her crazy. George Taylor P.I. is on a case that he despises. He is broke and needs the money so he accepts the job and meets Zoe. He is knocked for a loop. He is longing for a a normal woman who wants to settle down, he thinks he has met that in Zoe but soon finds himself choved into a world that he can barely comprehend. He has always been the protector and now has to let Zoe protect him and this causes some conflicts. There is also a element of danger thrown into all of this by Zoe's cousin Mordi, who is also a halfing and approaching his 25th birthday. He needs something Zoe has but doesn't know she has and he will do just about anything to get it. The struggle over good vs. evil is wonderfully written and kept me at the edge of my seat. I really enjoyed this book. It was funny, touching and action packed. I can't wait for the next book in the series. I hope there are several more.
