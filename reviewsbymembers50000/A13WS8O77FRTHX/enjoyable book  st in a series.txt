 This is the first book in the Hope Chest series. I had read the 3rd book, "Grand Design" first before I found out it was a series. I really enjoy these books. They have excitment, mystery, passion and humor. All the must have ingredients for a great book. The other books in the series are "Fire With Fire" and "Stolen Hearts" There is a fifth book but I don't have that title as of yet. This story starts off in modern day with our heroine, Gina running away to nurse her wounds after she discovers her fiance making love to her best friend on the eve of her wedding. She ends up in a town called Hope Springs. There she meets our hero or at least his ghost. Drake Manton died in 1885 but is somehow haunting the small hotel she's in. She is the only person who can see him. He has no idea how he died and asks for her help.  When they discover that he died in a fire at the historic Chesterfield Hotel they go to the ruins only to find a chest filled with several items. When gina picks up the melted gun she is transported back to 1885. She has to make a living in the past and unlock the mystery of Drakes death and keep him from dying and she can go back to her own time. The thing is that she really falls for Drake and he for her so the questing is will she go if she gets the chance? I really enjoyed the suspence of finding out. I look forward to other books in this series and other by this author.
