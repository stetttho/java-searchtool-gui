 This is the story of Jackie,a thief who steals into the home of the "giant" Rory to steal his Faberge egg. She is caught however and ends up being chased down by Rory. Rory is a wealthy widower who has a wild six year old to raise. He decides that instead of calling the sheriff on Jackie he will make her his son's new governess. She at first balks at the idea but then agrees to it. She soon finds herself falling in love with Kevin, Rory's son, and also finds herself attracted to Rory. After a compromising meeting they get married and Jackie soon finds herself in love with her "giant". He too has fallen in love with her and evn though they are in love they must still conquer both of thier pasts to live happily ever after. I really enjoyed this story and will read more of Linda Jones's books in the future.
