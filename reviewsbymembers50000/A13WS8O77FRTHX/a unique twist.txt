 Well I've read all kinds of romances but I've never come across one where the hero was dead, or at least a spirit. The hero Dante is originally in love with Bess, but after she kills herself to protect him his is killed himself. He vows that neither heaven nor hell will have him, he is doomed to haunt the house where his Bess lived and died.  One hundred years later Betina, an american who has inherited the house, shows up and he is released from his haunting to find that she is the image of his lost Bess. He soon finds though that she is not his Bess but a strong, bright, loving woman who is so different from his Bess. He falls in love with Betina but she is fearful that he still loves her only because of her resemblance to Bess. The fates weave the hero's and heroine's life strands together again so that they can finally be together like they were meant to be for eternity. A great book Buy it when you see it.
