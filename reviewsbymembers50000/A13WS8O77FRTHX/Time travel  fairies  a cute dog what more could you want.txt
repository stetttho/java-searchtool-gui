 This is the first book I've read by Lisa Cach and it won't be the last. I really enjoyed this book. I liked the fact that the hero was more like an average man. He wasn't extremely tall or very muscular. The heroine was a modern woman who deals quite well with the fact that she has been flung back in time to a period where women were under strct constraints and I'm not just talking about the clothes. The story starts off with Wihelmina, or Elle as she likes to be called, given a note by a homeless person in modern times. She doesn't even look at the paper until she is out with her dog on a walk. The note reads "Coupon Good for: one free husband. Redeem at will". She looks up into the sky and waves the coupon states the she wants to redeem her coupon. She thinks its just a joke when all of the sudden she is surrounded by fairies and they transport her back in time to be the wife of Henry. Henry's bride to be Eleanor is who she is replacing. Henry has no idea anything is different because they apparently look the same. She decides to go along with it so that she can at least get the wedding. I mean every girl dreams of a big wedding with all the trimmings. Then she will go back to her time. Only that doesn't happen. She seems stuck in 1790 with a husband who she doesn't know but is very attracted to. Henry doesn't quite know what to make of his bride. She doesn't seem like the person he met before but he likes this person better. He is puzzled by her lack of knowledge about running a household and her ideas about birth control but can't help but fall for her. Elle fights her feelings for Henry and when she finally lets him into her heart she thinks that she must leave him and go back to her time. This tale is wonderfully written and it made for a very enjoyable read. I look forward to other books by this author.
