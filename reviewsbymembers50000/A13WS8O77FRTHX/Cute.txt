 Ok I want a djinni. I mean who wouldn't. Well the heroine of this book didn't. Her daughter and her wacky neighbor conjured him up and now she has to deal with him. Now if he looked like the cover mode I could think of several ways to "deal" with him but its not my story so I won't go into those.  I liked Simon. He was a marvel. He took his djinni duties seriously but longed for the freedom that had been denied him. I didn't care much for Zoe, the heroine, though. She seemed too interested in her business than in her daughter and of course in Simon. I mean it was good that she wanted her business to succeed but at what cost. I just felt that her character could have lightened up a bit. She did come to her senses a bit toward the end. I did enjoy the secondary characters. They added to the total mayhem and brought lots of humor to the book. I would love to read a book about Darius. I would recommend this book for a lite afternoon read.
