 The Naked Duke is the debut book from this author. I think that she's going to be around for a while. I found this book to be an easy read. I finished it in one day. I was hoping for a bit more humor which the title and the back cover hint at but I wasn't too dissapointed.   The Story has Sarah Hamilton, and American, coming to England to live with her Uncle, the Earl. When she gets here she's mistaken for a lady of the night and ends up in the hero's bed. She is exhausted and has no idea that there has been such a mistake. She falls asleep and never knows the owner of the bed has returned. The Duke, James, is certainly suprised by the red haired beauty naked in his bed. He wants to wake her but is unable to and decides to wait until morning. Well morning arrives and both are found naked by the Dukes relatives and friends. Of course Sara must marry James to save her reputation. The only problem, she isn't sure that's what she wants to do. She ends up living in his home as a companion to his sister and going to London. All the while James is very willing to convince her to be his bride. Oh and there is a very unique plot twist too.   There is also an evil that is threatening to destroy both of them and together they must defeat it.   I enjoyed this tale. It was a good book and I look forward to others by this author.
