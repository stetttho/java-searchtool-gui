 This is a interesting book because of the tie in with the Vikings and North America's Iroquois indians. I like the story because both the h/h were strong but gentle. They both were warriors and they respected each other that way. Which lead to respect of thier feelings for both their families and their feelings for each other. I liked the fact that this book brought together an older couple who had lost each other 30 years earlier back together. This is a good read so if you see it I'd pick up a copy.
