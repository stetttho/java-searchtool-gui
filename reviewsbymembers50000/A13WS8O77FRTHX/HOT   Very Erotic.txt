 This was my first Cheryl Holt book and it won't be the last! I was suprised to find it. I had passed it over many times but when it caught my eye it really caught. I wasn't expecting such a erotic book. I've read Robin Schone's books and thought that they couldn't be as hot, well I was wrong. I would warn anyone who doesn't like steamy sex scenes not to read this book. It will make a person blush and feel very stirred up.  Its the story of a 25 year old spinster, Abigail, who has a problem. Her younger sister is coming to the age where she will marry and is asking Abigail about what the wedding night will be like. Abigail has no knowledge other than the basics. She decides that she must find out for herself before she can tell her sister. So that she can get "hands on" knowledge of love making she enlists the aid of James Stevens. James and his brother are the well known bastard sons of Lord Stevens. They have built a name and a fortune for themselves despite the label. James is intrigued and agrees to teach Abigail. At first all they do is talk and look at some pictures but soon it is aparent that a demonstration is needed. From the moment their lips touch each is lost. They are consummed by their passions and gladdly follow where ever it leads. Unfortunately it leads to ruination of Abigail's reputation. James must over come some long seeded rules to help her. I enjoyed this book so much that I read it all in one setting. I look forward to Michael's story.
