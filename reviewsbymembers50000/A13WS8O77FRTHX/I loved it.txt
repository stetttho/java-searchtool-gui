 I love this author! Her books are filled with tons of humor, tenderness, passion and excitment. I love how they are tied in with each other and yet can stand alone by themselves. This is Adam's story. He is the adopted son of Rain and Selik. He is a healer who has lost the desire to heal. A great tragedy has made him into a hermit for the last two years. That is is until a Viking Warrior Goddess shows up at his home and kidnaps him. She litteraly picks him up and carries him off to save her father. Tyra, is a tall, big warrior princess who needs Adam to save her father. Tyra thinks she is to manish to be wed and needs her father to be alive so that she can divorse herself from the family so that her younger and pretty sisters can marry. Adam is very unwilling at first to try and save her father but soon the desire to heal overrides his arguments. He decides though that the lovely warrior princess must pay for his services. She agrees and is thrilled(secretly) that he finds her attractive but can't quite beleive it. Adam too is having trouble coming to terms with his desire for the too big, too loud, too stubborn Tyra. When these two finally get together they creat fire with thier passions. but unfortuantely its not to be a long burn. Obsticales stand in their way and two very stubborn people must overcome their problems in order to have a life together. I enjoyed this book so much I couldn't put it down. I laughed, cried and felt happy at the end. The secondary characters are wonderful and I'd love to read a book about some of them, Hint, Hint! We get to find out what has happened to some old favorites which I always love to hear about. I hope Sandra Hill continues to write more in this series, they are wonderful.
