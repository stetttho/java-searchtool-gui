 Wow! Oh My! I have loved every book that Christine Feeham writes and this one is no exception. Now this isn't a Dark series book but I'm hoping it could be a start of its own series. Hint, Hint! This is a gothic tale that will have you craving more. The story starts off with the heroine, Isabella searching for the only man who can save her brother. He is shrouded in darkness and mystery. Many have died trying to get to him but she knows that she has no other choice if she wants to save her brother. She soon finds herself infront of the man who is the answer to her problems. The don Nicolai, is enchanted by her even before he meets her. He knew she was coming and why. He will help her only if she agrees to marry him.  Now Nicolai has a deep secret that could destroy them all. He must keep the beast within himself tightly chained at all times. He fears for the future and believes that he can only have Isabella for a short time. Isabella must show him that he means the world to him and that together they can conquer the beast. The love scenes are highly erotic and leave the reader breathless. I highly recommend this book.
