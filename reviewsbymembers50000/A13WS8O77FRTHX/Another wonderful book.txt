 Well this is another book by one of my favorite authors. Connie Mason's books are all keepers! I have read and reread them all several times. I loved the Outlaws series. These brothers are great. This book is about Jess, the Doctor. He is on the run along with his brothers from the law after being falsely accused of robbing a bank. He comes across a female bounty hunter, Meg, who is determined to bring him in. How this story unravels is quite funny and very touching. I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone.
