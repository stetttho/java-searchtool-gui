 This is a wonderful story. It made me cry and that makes it a keeper for sure. Its very tender in its love scenes and the interaction between the main characters was moving. Its a historical vampire story but could have taken place during any time. The story is about a very old, 400 years, tortured vampire, Rayven. He has been alone so long that when he sees a young woman being sold by her father he must buy her. He knows that he must send her away but he can't help being drawn to her and selfishly wants to keep her to make the lonelyness and the despair go away if for only a little while. He hates what he is and wishes to see the sun again so much that he is willing to risk harming her in order to have some of the light that she brings to his dark world. Rhianna, the young girl is sold by her father in order for her younger sisters to be fed. She goes willingly to Rayvens castle but is very suprised that the monster he is supposed to be is very gentle and human in his wants and desires to be loved. She is given eveything she wants or could desire and in turn she is dertermined to bring him light and love. They both love each other so much that they are willing to face anything for the other. I cried when I finished this book because it made me so happy that they overcame so many obsticles. I really enjoyed this book and look forward to reading more from this author.
