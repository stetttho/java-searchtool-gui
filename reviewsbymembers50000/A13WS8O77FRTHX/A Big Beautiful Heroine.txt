 Well I am a big fan of Pat Ballard's work. I love how all her heroines are plus sized beauties and have great hunks who love them that way.I also love that her heroines have class and style. They are strong women who can handle any situation put before them. In His Brother's Child, the heroine,Faith, is pregnant. The result of a one night stand at a party. She is also the victim of a cruel joke. The babies father wants nothing to do with either of them so its up to his brother,Edward to pick up the pieces. The kicker is that to Edward, Faith is a dream come true. He knows he loves her from the get go but because of her distrust of men, thanks to his brother, she is afraid to open up her heart again.  Its not only a love story but a story about hope. How it only takes one person who,with loving patience, can give a person the strength to overcome fears and to embrace life. I hope to read many more of Pat's books. Each one is a treat.
