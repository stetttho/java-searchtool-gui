 First off these books should be read in order. The 1st book is DEVIL'S BRIDE, which is Devil's story. Devil is the cousin to the hero of this book, Vane. Vane and Devil are extremely close almost like brothers. After Devil has found himself a bride its now Vane's turn. Now Vane has decided no to marry. He is a Rake and has no plans to surrender his bachlorhood. That is until he meets Patience. Now patience has no desire to marry. She is "on The Shelf" and is quite content to groom her young brother, Gerrard, to becoming a great man. She and her brother are residing at the home of her Aunt Lady Bellamy. Vane has taken refuge at Bellamy Hall to wait out a storm and soon finds himself involved with a mystery. Someone has been stealing little baubles from Lady Bellamy's houseguests and everyone has pointed the finger at Patience's brother. Now Vane and Patience must prove Gerrard is innocent. This is an exciting fast paced story. You get to meet Devil and several others of the Bar Cynster as well. Its filled with very passionate love scenes and quick humor. I highly recommend it and the whole series.
