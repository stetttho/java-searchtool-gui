 This was a quick read for me. I was able to finish it in one setting. The plot line is dark and mysterious and kept me guessing. I found the characters to be fairly well developed but I would have liked to have the "Shadowing" explained in a bit more detail. It was a bit weak in that respect. The love scenes were wonderfully written. I enjoyed the struggle that both main characters had to go through to finally find happiness.  I would like to read more from this author in this same style. Great cover art as well. It's what first drew me to the book.
