 I had never read any of Julia's books but was happy that someone recommended her to me. This is a series that you do need to read in order. The books all tie in with each other. This one is about Adrian Spence, Earl of Albright. He has just done a deed that will haunt him for the rest of his life. He is struggling with that and his scheming father when he comes across a great plan. He will marry and hurt his father. Lilliana Dashell is being courted by his brother Benedict. He sweeps in and makes an offer for her that her family cannot afford to pass up. Lillie soon finds herself married to the handsome yet cold Adrian. He fills her bed with passion and heat but then in the light of day is as cold as ice to her. Only when a terrible accident happens and Adrian is forced to depend upon her does he thaw. She is utterly confused by his actions. She has fallen in love with him and can't understand what makes him act the way he does. Adrian is also confused. He is afraid to reveal his feelings to Lillie and so actually turns her away from him. the struggle for them to find the love they share is so well written that you feel as though you are watching it on a screen. I cried at this story and laughed a bit too. I look forward to reading others in this series.
