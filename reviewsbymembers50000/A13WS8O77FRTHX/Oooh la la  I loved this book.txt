 When i first bought this book I admit I didn't think I would be very impressed. I was very wrong. I loved this book. The first thing I loved was that the heroine Kate wasn't a perfect size 3. She was a real sized woman. And it was nice to finally see one of real sized women have a drop dead gorgeous man fall for her and find her incredibly sexy. Robin is a wonderful hero. He is attractive, tender, passionate, strong, brave, and caring. I would like to read more of Karen's books. I liked the secondary characters of Kate's Dad and Robins friends Nic and Anne. I will definately buy more of Karen's books.
