 Ok what happened to Connie? This is not like any of her other books I've read. I hated it. I found the hero to be totally unlikeable, the heroine wasn't much better. There was no romance here, just sex and even that wasn't too hot. I didn't find any love or tenderness at all in this book. I hate to say it but this is a bad book.
