 I have to agree with some of the other reviewers that the characters were a little lacking in depth but the love scenes are very erotic and graphic. If you are not a person who likes to read very erotic love scenes then I wouldn't get this book. Its a story of how two people are brought together by the heroine's mad husband, to mate so that he may have an heir. The Hero, Fawkes, was sent to couple with the heroine, Lady Nicola. He never realized how that one night would effect him for the rest of his life. Now 3 1/2 years later he has returned a victorious knight to claim Mordeaux Castle and the Lady Nicola. Nicola's life was also profoundly effected by that one night. It was the only night of pleasure that she's ever had. Her husband was a cruel man, and now that he is gone she is both thankful and fearful. She doesn't recognize the knight Fawkes as the tender lover of years past. She is afraid of him and keeps many secrets. But even though she fears him she is strongly drawn to him as he is to her. The passion they share is explosive and they are unable to fight it. Soon passion leads to love but when the secrets are reveiled all could be ruined. I look forward to more from this author.
