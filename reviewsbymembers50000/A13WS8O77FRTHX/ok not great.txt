 I wasn't real excited about this book after I got into it. It was good but nothing special.  The story takes place in 999 just before the turn of the millennium. In other words Y1k. There are all the doomsday believers who think that the world will end with the coming year. There are also those who believe that the new century is a time for new beginnings. Rafael Leonhart is one of those people. He is apart of a leggend that states that the land of Alderich will change hands and no longer belong to the Rune. So to help insure that this does happen Rafael takes Serath Rune hostage. She is the granddaughter of the Ruling Rune. The only problem is that Serath's grandfather has no love for her at all. This puts a crimp in Rafael's plans but what effects those plans even more is his growing attraction and feelings for his hostage. She is feared by many but he knows that she is not what she appears to be. It was a good book not a great one but a good one.
