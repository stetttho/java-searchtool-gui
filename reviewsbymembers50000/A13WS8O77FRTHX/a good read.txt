 Well this story takes a bit of time to develope but when it does it develops into a good story. There is not a lot of love scenes in this book so don't be expecting a lot of passion. This story is very mental. I enjoyed reading about The cursed and scarred Anatole St. Legar, heir to a legacy of stange and unusual powers. And is bride Madeline who is ever so practical. She has come hoping to find the man she sees in a portrait, kind, gentle and caring, and what she finds is a cold, scarred, lonely man who has never known love. Together the must try and love each other and battle the demons of the legends. I look forward to reading the sequel to this book, the Night Drifter.
