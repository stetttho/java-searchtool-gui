 Well I must say that I really enjoyed this book. Samantha James brings us a real person in the form of the heroine Heather. She has a limp. I like it when the characters are not perfect. The hero is Damien who is trying to track down the killer of his brother Giles. Damien takes a position at Heather's estate as the overseer. Well they find themselves very attracted to each other and manage to fall in love even though society still shuns Heather because of her limp. Damien makes it well known that he cares not about her limp but loves everything about her. I would like to read a book about Heather's parents because they seem so much in love also.
