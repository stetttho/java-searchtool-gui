 Ok I loved this book, plain and simple. Katie did a wonderful job of bringing to life my greatest fantasy, of meeting a Scotsman and falling in love and living in Scotland. Actually I have to change that a bit, its more like "of meeting a Kilted Scotsman, who is a big hunk and has a brogue that can bring a woman to her knees. The rest is pretty much the same. I wonder if Katie was reading my mine when she thought of this, hummmmmmm. Well On to the book. Its packed with incredible humor. It had me laughing so hard I was freaking out my cats. The love scenes were so hot and so well written the pages almost ignited. The characters of Iain and Kathie so compelling that you were rooting for them the whole way. I loved the fact that they weren't extremely young and innocent. I like to see heroines closer to my own age. Plus it proves that sex ain't just for the young! The supporting characters were real and truely added to the book.  This is going to go on my keeper shelf. I know that I will read and reread this book until it falls apart and I have to buy it again. I highly recommend it to everyone.
