 I have enjoyed all of Lynsay Sands' books but the I have noticed that the last few I've read are missing one key feature. Humor. The first book I read of hers "Always" was packed with humor and it made the story so memorable. This book was sadly lacking in it. It made for a good read but I don't think I'll reread it anytime soon. I liked the hero, Galen with is rare red hair. He seemed fair and gentle. The heroine Kyla is a strong willed wounded woman who was Galen's equal. I wish there had been a bit more conversation and maybe a bit more of a struggle between the two before they fell in love. I did enjoy the secondary characters in this book. The were the only humor to be found.
