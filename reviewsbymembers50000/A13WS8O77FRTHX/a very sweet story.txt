 I liked this story. Buttercup Baby is sort of a sequel to Prince of Charming. In this story Ariel a fairy is sent to check on Robin Goodfellow's baby. She see's the baby and has a sudden desire to have achild of her own and in order to do that she must find a mortal male. Well she finds one alright in Rand Thayer, a friend of Robin and Kate's. She sort of attaches herself to him until his passion gets the better of him and they make love and concieve a child. Ariel ends up staying with Rand during her pregnancy and being drawn into his large family. There is a very interesting and funny scene with green Jell-o that you can't miss. This book is a nice afternoon read. I will enjoy reading more books by Karen Fox.
