 Well I've read several other books by Flora Speer and I've always enjoyed them. This one was ok, not great. The back cover sounded better than the story turned out to be. There really wasn't much interaction between the hero and the heroine. Even the love scenes were so mild I wasn't sure that they had done anything. The Hero Dain has agreed to marry the daughter of his enemy to settle a feud that has been going on for generations. Emma, the heroine is sent instead of her 7 year old sickly sister. She is a magician but fears that if she tells Dain the truth he will hurt her in some way. She falls for him and he is hopelessly drawn to her even though he fights it. I didn't like the fact that he had very short cropped hair which looks like on the cover like it's been bleached. He looks too modern. I think this could have been a better book with a bit more passion in it and more interaction between the main characters.
