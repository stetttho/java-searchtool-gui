 Well I have to agree with several of the other reviewers that this book didn't quite live up to the back cover. I have enjoyed several of Margaret Moore's other books and was expecting this one to be as enjoyable as those. The best i can give it is an ok rating.  The story is of a lonely penniless knight trying to make his way in a world were you are ruled by your actions. He has fallen out of favor with the king and now is working to rebuild his life. The heroine is the beautiful, dutyful daughter of a man who has no will to live. She has had to take over the running of the castle at a very young age as well as bringing up her younger siblings. She is being courted by an evil man who turns her stomach. When the hero and heroine meet by accident they soon realize thier feelings for each other but know that they cannot act upon them. I liked the secondary characters more that the major players. I would like to see books with the brother and sister as the leads. I liked the book but just didn't get into it like I thought I would.
