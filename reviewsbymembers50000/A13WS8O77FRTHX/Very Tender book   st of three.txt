 Well this is the first book of what I call the Marine books. the other two are "Shadow of the Hawk" and "Always Faithful". All three books are wonderful. The heros are tough and strong and yet can be tender and vulnerable. In this book the hero, Brodie, is a immortal. He has been cursed to live forever by an evil sorcerer, who's daughter he accidnetly killed. He will carry the scars of his many battles on the outside forever, but its the scars on his heart that the heroine, BJ, wants to heal. BJ is a computer wiz who has a problem. Someone is sabotaging her company and using her programs to do it. Brodie comes to her aid to help find the real culprit. This book had me crying and laughing. I hated for it to end. i was thrilled when I found it had sequels. I would definately recommend this book and the other two.
