 I did something I've never done before I didn't finish the book. I skimmed it and never found any romance in it. I'm not sure what the other reviewers found but it wan't in my copy. I disliked the main hero and would have liked to have read more about the secondary hero although he did sound wimpish. the two heroines were ok but nothing special. I got bored with this almost from the first. I would not recommend this at all.
