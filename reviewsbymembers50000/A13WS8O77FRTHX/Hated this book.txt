 Yuck! I was excited about this book. I mean the title makes it sound wonderful, so does the back cover. It was horrid. I kept wondering where the romance was? It was BORING! I felt like it more of a book about the heroine and her mental problems. The hero and the heroine spend out five minutes in each others company and they are supposed to fall in love. Yeah right. I'm sorry I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. I think I even threw it across the room a few times.
