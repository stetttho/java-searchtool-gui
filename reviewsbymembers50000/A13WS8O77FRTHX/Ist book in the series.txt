 This book has a interesting twist. It is both a historical and a modern romance. Time travel isn't involved but I still found the story compelling. This is the story of Raven St. James, a witch born in England in the 16 hundreds. She is tried for witchcraft and hung along with her mother but survives because she is immortal. Duncan, is a young preist who tries to stop the murder because its not only wrong but he suddenly has strong emotional feelings towards the witch who he doesn't even know. He thinks that she has died but she escapes to the New World to a aunt and a town called Sanctuary. There she lives free for several years until the townfolk become suspicious. There she meets another immortal witch Arianna who helps guide Raven. Duncan also flees to the New World and ends up in Sanctuary and soon finds her again and love grows between the two. But soon the suspicions are to great and the town decides to get rid of her. Duncan again tries to save her but dies in the process. Now 300 years later, Raven has come back to Sanctuary and discovers Duncan again. He looks the same,but has no memory of her. He is strangly attracted to her and can't figure out why. Together they must rediscover their love and learn to trust each other. Also evil is lurking and must be overcome for their love to continue. Maggie Shayne has written a wonderful book and I will really enjoy the next in the series which is Arianna's story.
