 Master of Seduction is the story of Black Jack Rhys and Lorelei, who I first read about in A Pirate of Her Own. I read them backwards. They both are stand alone books but it is enjoyable to read about Morgan from the second book in this one and Jack and Lorelei in the second book. Jack is a notorious pirate and Lorelei is helping her English fiance track him down. Jack kidnapps her when he realizes she knows who he really is. He is very strongly attracted to her and she to him but they try and fight thier attraction until passion wins out. Jack is deeply troubled by his past and Lorelei must break thru it all to get to the good man beneath the hard shell of Pirate. This book is filled with humor and adventure and passion and tenderness. I really enjoyed it and look forward to more by this author. I would really like to read a book about Kit Jack's son when he grows up.
