 Wow! I've always avoided anything to do with werewolves because they scared me so as a child but when I picked up this book I couldn't put it down until I was done.  The heroine of the story is an american who goes to England to take over her inheritance, Haskell Hall. She is the last of the Heiresses and has no idea of the link her family has had with the hero's family. The horrible deaths of the previous hieresses makes her curious and she seeks answeres from Ian, our hero, only to find more mysteries and things which should make her run back to america as fast as she can. But its the pain and longing in Ians eyes that draws her to him and to discover his secrets and to help him build a life. I stayed up all night reading this exciting, sensual book. I'd recommend it to all.
