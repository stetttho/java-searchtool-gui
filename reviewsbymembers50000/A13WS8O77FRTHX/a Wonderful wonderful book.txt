 I loved this book. It made me laugh and cry and I even found myself breathless after a few of the love scenes. This is the story of Gierolf, or Rolf, the hero, who is a Real Live Viking from the year 997. He is in a boat wreck and somehow ends up in 1997 off the shores of Maine. Our heroine, Meridith, or Merry-Death as Rolf calls her, is a professor at a nearby collage. She is trying to complete a project started by her late grandfather. A Viking Longboat. Rolf arrives just in time to help. He is fasinated by all the modern conviences but she is still not quite sure that he is telling her the truth about his time travel. The fall in love but he must try and go back in time to complete a task so this causes a rift between them. How this rift is overcome is a ending I wasn't expecting. The secondary character of Mike is wonderful and I liked Thea the niece also. Sandra Hill has a definate winner here. Make sure you have kleenex when you read this.
