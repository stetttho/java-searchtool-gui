 Lord of the Keep is definately a Keeper! I loved this book. I have read An Lawrence's Virtual heros romance and liked them but I really enjoyed her other Lord book which actually follows this one. Her historicals seem to be more enjoyable to me because the heros have real fears and real problems that they must overcome to find happiness. In this story our hero and heroine first meet when Emma's uncle drags her before Lord Gilles's court to be judged for being unpure and refusing to name the man. She is not afraid to stand alone because she believes that her love will do right by her because even though they haven't spoken vows infront of a priest they spoke them to each other. Gilles is drawn to her imediately and admires her courage and convictions. When next they meet 2 years later. Gilles has just saved her and her babe from sure death by wild dogs. He takes her to his keep and into his life. Gilles is not a young man. He is 40 and is starting to really feel his age. He is feeling that time has passed him by and he can't compete with the younger men. He feels some jealously over how the women seem to flock to a his bastard son William. He fears that Emma will also like William over him. Emma falls hard for Gilles and has no desire to be anywhere near William. She has her babe to tend to and now Gilles to love. She doesn't think him to old at all and tries to make him beleive that every time they touch.  They admit they care for each other but before they can find true happiness tragedy occures. Gilles must again save Emma's life and his very own. The secondary characters in this book bring it all together. There is plenty of humor and lost of passion to this tale. I laughed and cried over this book and when that happens it makes a story I'll read and reread over and over again. I would recommend this book to everyone who loves a great romance.
