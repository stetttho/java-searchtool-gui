 Well I can't say I agree with two of the reviewers. I did like this book. Now I will admit I like her Bridgerton series a bit more, I still found this book to able to amuse me and make me forget about my day to day life, Now in this book the heroine, Emma, is an American heiress who has come to London to enjoy a Season but she's not looking for a husband. She's just here to have some fun with her cousins. In one of capers she and her cousin Arabella dress up in maids clothes and help the cook with the meal for the party that is to happen that night. When the cook needs more eggs, Emma volunteers to get some. When Emma is on her way back she tries to save a young boy and the little dog he has run after, from the wheels of a carriage. Emma is knocked out and when she comes to she's in the carriage with the notorious rake Alexander Ridgely his sister Sophie. Alex is imediately attracted to the "maid" and has no way of knowing who she really is. When he sees her at the party that night, he decides to make her pay for her deception. They agree to be"friends" but soon find that they both desire each other to much to be mearly "friends".  Both struggle with thier new found feelings.  There are some wonderful secondary characters who show up in other books. I look forward to reading Arabella's story. All in all I found this to be a good book. It is on my "keeper shelf".I will continue to be a fan of Julia Quinn's.
