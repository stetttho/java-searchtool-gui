 Well I was very excited about this book when I first ordered it and I was really looking forward to reading it. Well It was a good book but I didn't think it lived up to the recommendations it has had. It was a bit slow throughout the book. I liked the fact that the Heor Malcolm MacFane aka the Black Wolf is not super strong but has had major injuries to overcome. I actually liked him and his friend Gavin much better than the heroine in the book, Ariella. At first I thought she would be a wonderful heroine, strong and willful but loyal and caring to her clam and to the injured Black Wolf whom she was to have been married to. Even though she helps ease his physical pain she doesn't seem to interested in helping him heal his emotional pain. She seems very cold to me. The other characters in the book make it very funny at times. The training scenes and the two old men are very humorous. All in all I would say its a good read but it could have been so much better.
