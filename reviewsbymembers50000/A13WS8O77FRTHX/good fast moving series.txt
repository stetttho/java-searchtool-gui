 This is the first book I've read by May McGoldrick and I'm happy I bought the rest of the series to find how this all turns out. Actually this book ties in with a book called "Flame" so I'm going to go back and read theat one first. The hero in this story appears in it and so it may give me more insight to his character. This is the story of the oldest of three sisters, Catherine Percy. She is fleeing for her life to Scotland the homeland of her mother after her father is killed as a traitor to England. She and her sisters separate to protect themselves and a treasure which they and their mother know its where abouts. She is going to open a school with several brothers. She is also going to be protected by John Stewart, Lord Athol.  John has just found out some very disturbing news about his fathers past and has just reluctantly agreed to finally marry. His intended bride meets up with Catherine on the way. When they reach the keep the bride to be cons Catherine into switching rooms with her. Catherine does and soon is awakened by John making love to her. She is shocked and so is he but he decides to marry Catherine instead. She resists but eventually gives in. Soon passion consumes them both and they realize that they love each other very much. In order for them to find bliss however they both must overcome enemies and stay ever villigant. This is a fast paced book that can be easily read in one afternoon. I enjoyed the secondary characters and look forward to reading about the other sisters.
