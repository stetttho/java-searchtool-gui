 This is the first book I've read by this author and it won't be the last. Marian Edwards brings to life two wonderful characters. She doesn't pull any punches about how life could be harsh in 1067 in Wales but still she shows that love can conquer all. This story actually begins in modern day with Regan, a handicapped  woman and Drew her polital opponent die tragically in a plane crash. They die before thier time so they are put into the first two bodies that become available. that of Bronwyn, a beautiful Welsh rebel who has just murdered her new Norman husband Christophe. Christophe makes Bronwyn drink the same poisen and they both die only to be made whole again by the souls of Drew and Regan. Both remeber their former lives but don't realize who the other really is. They now must adjust to this harsh life and find what happiness they can. Everytime they seem to be getting closer to love something always drives them apart. I was on the edge of my seat with this book wondering what was going to happen next. There is some humor and a lot of tenderness in this book. I enjoyed the secondary characters for they made the story whole. I can't wait to read the sequel. Heaven's Return.
