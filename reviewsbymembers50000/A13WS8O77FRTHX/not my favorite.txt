 Well I bought this book because I love pirate stories or stories about the sea. This book was a disappointment. It dragged. I didn't like the love scenes. I really disliked the hero and the heroine didn't make me proud either. I wish I could have liked this book but I really didn't. The story starts out with the heroine being held captive by a ship of bloodthirsty pirates who will kill her after they have had thier fill. She decides that in order for her to survive she must attract the captian and become his whore. The hero is now the captain after having killed the former captain. He decides to take the captive woman up on the invitation her eyes are sending him. He never realizes that she is a virgin and believes her to be a well practiced whore. After several days they near shore and she manages to escape. He searches for her and when he finally finds her he stalks her. This book protrays pirates as they probably really were but I don't think it made for a nice enjoyable romance.
