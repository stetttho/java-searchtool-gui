 Well I was a bit disappointed by this story. I have liked Lisa Kelypas' books in the past but this one while it had a sweet heroine and and strong devoted hero bored me. It seemed like the mystery never really developed and the excitement was over very quickly. There wasn't much passion which is ok because I liked the tender love scenes. It just seemed a bit lacking so it took me several days to read. I wish it had been better.
