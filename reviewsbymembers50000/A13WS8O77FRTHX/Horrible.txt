 I really had a hard time with this book. it was boring, jumbled, dull and I had to struggle to finish it. I have never wanted to throw a book away more. I thought it would be a wonderful futuristic romance but it never lived up to the cover. I found the characters very underdeveloped and the story didn't have a strong plot line. I felt like I had come into the story when it was almost over. I'm sorry but I cound't recommend this book at all.
