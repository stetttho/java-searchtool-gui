 I found this book to be an easy read. I am a sucker for books where either one of the main characters is blind or deaf or injured. It evens out all the books that have perfect heros and heroines. True beauty is in the heart and soul of a person and its refreshing when an author has the insight to write about it. The hero, Captain Rutger Grayson, is no longer a "looker". Terrrilby scarred he is shunned by polite society. but not all of his scars are visible. He is haunted by his past and has accepted that he unlovable but when a beautiful and seemingly perfect young woman approaches him to help her find his brother, he finds himself hoping that she can see what lies beneath the scars. The irony is that she can't see at all, blinded by illness, Lady Calire Aylesbury lives in a world of darkness, and yet she only sees light when she's with Rutger.  Together they work to find her brother. While doing so they manage to brighten each other's lives in ways neither thought possible. I really enjoyed this book. I would love to read more from this author.
