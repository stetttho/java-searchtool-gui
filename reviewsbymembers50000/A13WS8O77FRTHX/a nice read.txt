 I liked this book. It did remind me of Kathleen E. Woodiwiss's The Wolf and the Dove but it didn't have the strong character developement that that book had. The hero, Merrick is a Norman Lord who has taken be force the Heroine's home. Alana, is a Saxon who was the former lord's bastard child. She is feared by the villagers because of her dreams that tend to come true. He makes her his mistress despite the fact that she fights him at every turn. She must over come her own feelings of hate to love this conqueror and he must overcome his distrust of her. The story is a good one but I wished the characters had a bit more substance.
