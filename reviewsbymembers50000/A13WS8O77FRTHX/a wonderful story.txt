 Ok get your tissue out for this one. I love time travel stories and Julie Moffett has created a wonderful one here. This is the first of two books the second being"Across a Moonswept Moon" which I read by accident first. I loved it also. This book is the story of Faith, a modern woman who works for British Intelligence and is sent on a mission to Ireland. She is positioned in a famous Druid circle of stones. There she meets up with the terrorist she was seeking and a struggle ensues. Somehow they are both sent through time to Ireland in the year 1648. The terrorist runs off and she is found by the handsome Miles O'Bruaidar, who is also known as the Irish Lion, a man who has been causing havok to the British who are invading. She at first doesn't realize she is in the past and when it finally hits her she fears revealing it to Miles, although she trusts him with her life. Together they must over come her fears, The hated British, the traitors to the Irish and many more to stay together. This story made me cry and laugh and I would highly recommend it.
