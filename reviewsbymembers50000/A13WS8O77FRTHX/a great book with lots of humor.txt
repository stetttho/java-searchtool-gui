 I liked this book but not as much as I have the other books by Dara Joy. This one is a historical that is packed with very interesting secondary characters that drive the hero, Lord John Sexton crazy. His heroine, Chloe, has decided to set her trap for the Lord of Sex, as he has come to be known. They have known each other since childhood and are very close friends. She tells him that she wants to be a "Rake" like him and needs him to teach her how to go about it. And since it is unheard of for a unmarried woman to have sex she asks him to marry her so that it will not be considered such a scandal. He agrees but isn't quite sure what he has agreed to. He cares for her but is afraid to really love her and she must convince him that he really does love her. Its a wild tail that leaves you cheering in the end. I laughed at the humor and blushed at the sensual love scenes. They are hot!. I will still recommend this book to anyone.
