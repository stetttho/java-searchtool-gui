 Oh my what a book! I first picked up the book because i love it when the heroines are not just innocent but also innocent of how the act of love is performed. Rosamunde has been raised in a convent all her life and when her father the King brings her intended husband to wed her she asked her fellow nuns what will be expected of her. Well the way they explain lovemaking to her made me laugh so hard I cried. And then when she's finally alone with her husband who under the time conditions placed upon him by his King cannot take the time to really teach her the art of love making, she endears herself to all the readers. Soon though she does learn from her husband and he is delighted to find her a willing and apt pupil. He is very jealous of any males coming near her and has to learn the hard way that she really has no intention or desire to be anything but his. She tries his patience and it makes for an exciting book. I can't wait to read Lynsay Sands other books.
