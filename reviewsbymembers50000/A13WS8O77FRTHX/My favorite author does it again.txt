 Well I must say that I have loved every book this woman has written. It all started twenty years ago when I read "The Flame and The Flower" I was hooked. This is Jeff's story and there are only two things that bothered me about this book. One was that "The Elusive Flame" which is Brandon's son's story came out before this and in it we found out that Jeff had married Raelynn and that they were deeply in love so we knew that everything had worked out well before this book made it's apprearance. The second was that this book seemed to start in the middle. The are already married and its a bit confusing finding out the whys and the hows. I did like the secondary characters in this book very much. I will still recommend this book to anyone but I think I'll tell them to read it before reading Beau's story.
