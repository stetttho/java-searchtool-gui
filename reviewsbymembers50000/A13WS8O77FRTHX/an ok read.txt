 Well I liked this book well enough. It is a time-travel fantasy book. The hero is Dar a Norse God who is tricked by Loki and travels forward in time and to another planet, earth, where he meets the heroine, Jennifer. She is having a really rotten year. Her mother has past away, the bills are piling up and to top it off she was just layed off. Then out of nowhere Dar appears and she almost hits him with her jeep. He thinks her jeep is a beast and is ready to defend himself from it. He ends up staying with her as her boarder and in the process proceeds to tear up several of the homes furnishings. Also he has this pet dragon who is very picky about what he eats chewing up her shoes and other belongings. Not to mention a few squirrels. There is quite a bit of humor in this book as they adjust to each other. they also must fight evil from both worlds. This is a nice book for an afternoon read.
