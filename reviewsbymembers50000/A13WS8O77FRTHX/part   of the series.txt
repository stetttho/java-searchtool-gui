 I really enjoy Sandra Hill's books and this one was no exception. This is the story of Tykir, who is Thork's son from The Reluctant Viking" and younger brother to Eirik and Rain. This book is filled with wonderful characters that show up in previous and later books. The humor was wonderful and the passion was hot! I like the way that Sandra Hill makes the hero and heroine more true to life. The hero has a bad leg and the heroine, Ailnor, has freckles and she is not terribly busty and not super young either.  Alinor is sort of taken captive by Tykir because she is supposedly a witch who has put a curse on King Anlaf's privates. He is commanded to take her to the King to remove the curse/spell. She is very reluctant to go and fights but then soon realizes that time spent with Tykir is better than time spent with her brothers who are always marrying her off . She is a widow three times over and really would like for all men to leave her alone. Tykir at first doesn't think she is attractive at all and can't hardly stand to be near her but he soon finds that he likes freckles and her hair drives him wild. Their passion soon flares and turns both of their worlds upside down. The reader is not sure what is going to happen next and it was really hard to put this book down to go back to work after my breaks. I am now going back to read the Outlaw Viking which is Selik's story.
