 Sandra Hill has done it again. She has created some of the most memorible characters. Her books are never boring. They always have action, passion, heated arguments, and humor. I would recommend any and all of her books to everyone. This one starts off when we meet, Prince"Charming" Perico Tomas de la Ferrama, aka P.T. as he is getting into character for his Princely role of owner of Ferrama Shoes. He has, with the help of his two best friends, created a highly sucessful company that is about to go public. He has taken his step-fathers old shoe company and turned into a multi-million dollar business. He spots a possible problem though in the body of a long legged beauty holding picket signs using crutches. He is breahless at the sight of her but when they actually meet he finds him self breathless from the punch she throws him. Cynthia Sullivan is known on Wallstreet as the Shark and when she is injured wearing Ferrama shoes she threatens a lawsuit unless they settle on her terms. Cynthia will not admit to anyone that P.T. has knoced her for a loop. She stands her ground which is the cause for her downfall. P.T. has two step-sisters that need the money that going public will give them and they are not about to let her interfear with those plans. They kidnapp her along with a Elvis wanna be named Elmer Presly. P.T. goes after her and finds hims self kidnapped as well. Soon Elmer, who claims to be thier fairy god-father, works his magic on the two of them and they can't keep thier hands of each other. The passion is so hot that they almost burn up. But below the surface of the passion lies love that both are fighting. Its a struggle to see who will win love or thier stubborn natures. The secondary stories and secondary characters of this tale are fab and make this all the more enjoyable to read. You've don it again Sandra! Way to Go!
