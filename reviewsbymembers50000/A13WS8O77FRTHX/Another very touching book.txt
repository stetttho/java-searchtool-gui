 I have always enjoyed Samantha James's books and this time was no exception. This book was a warm tale of two childhood friends who as adults must marry and face the trials of life in the harsh land of Scotland together. The characters are very human. They had humor and sorrow in thier lives.  This is the story of Ian MacGregor, the head of his highland clan and Sabrina the second sister and the unloved one by her father. Ian fostered at Sabrina's home when he was a lad and his father had wanted a wedding to seal the alliance between the clans. Ian comes back many years later to marry Margaret, Sabrina's older and beautiful daughter. He meets up again with Sabrina, who in thier youth was a good friend. She is very untrustful of him and he is saddened to see how her own family treats her. She is strong and has a mind and a voice of her own but also deep seeded fears.  Margaret dissppears the day before the wedding and is presummed dead. Ian decides to marry Sabrina to fullfill his father's wish. She is both overjoyed and mad about the whole idea but goes along with it as not to shame her father. Soon they are back at Ian's castle and the trouble begins. Both thier lives are in danger and together they must face thier mistrust of each other and find the love that they both share. This book has great mystery and was an easy read and hard to put down until the end.
