 Well first off I must say a big thanks to Pat Ballard for giving us a heroine who is plus sized and loves herself. Its not often we see one so it was very refreshing to find one in this book. This is the first book I've read by this author and it won't be the last. Its a quick book. You can finish it in an afternoon. The story is easy to follow and filled with excitement and love. Nella, the heroine, has just agreed to marry the pig headed, arrogant, anti-fat, Samuel. Now its a marriage of convience. His small son needs a mother or he may loose him to his grandparents in a nasty custody battle, and she wants to keep her home. Not great grounds for a marriage but Nella has a strike against her. She has already fallen in love with Sam's son. She willing puts up with Sam's attitude for the sake of the child but soon decides that Sam had better start treating her like a human being. She demands he respect her and soon finds that Sam isn't all that bad. He just needed a strong woman to make him wake up to reality. They soon find themselves very attracted to each other and passions flare. But before they can live happily ever after they must fight his ex-in-laws for the boy.  I really enjoyed this story. The author makes it quite clear that being a plus sized person doesn't mean that you are unhealthy, stupid or unlovable, it just makes you human.
