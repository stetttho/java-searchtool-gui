 This is the second book in this series. You need to read "High Energy" to find out how these characters meet. This is to story of Zanita, a reporter and her hunk of a physicist Tyber. They are on a ghost hunt. They have a challenge going on between them that leads to some very hot and steamy love scenes. The humor in this book had me laughing so hard I cried. I love secondary characters in this book and am still hoping with fingers crossed that two of them will get their own story. Get these two books and enjoy them.
