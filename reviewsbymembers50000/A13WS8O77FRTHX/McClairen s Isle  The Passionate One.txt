 Well I liked this book enough to buy both the sequels because I always love finding out what happened to the other Characters in the book. This story was nice. I thought the story dragged a bit and that the hero was a bit too moody. I wish there had been more humor in the book. I really think that the last book in the series "The Ravishing One"will be the most enjoyable because the hero and heroine seem to be at odds with each other from day one, which makes for a stronger story.
