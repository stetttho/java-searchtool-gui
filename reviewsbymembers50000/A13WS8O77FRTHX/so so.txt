 I didn't really care for this book. I thought the story line sounded very good and the basic plot was. I found the writing to be jumbled in areas. It seemed to jump around and it was a bit hard to follow. I got bored very easily. I found it to be very funny in spots and I would have loved to have read more scenes with the two raccoons. I just didn't feel the characters were developed enough to hold my interest. I hate to say this but it was a real struggle to get through this book.
