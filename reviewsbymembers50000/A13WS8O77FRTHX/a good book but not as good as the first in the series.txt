 This is the second book in the series. The 1st book"The Darkest Knight" was much more tender and loving. I enjoyed the fact that in this book the bad brother from the first book has a chance to become the hero and mends the rift in his family. This is James's story. We first meet him as he is being attacted by the heroine in the story, Isabel, or Angel as he calls her. She is trying to finish the revenge her family has started against his family. She steals from him and leaves him bloody and bested by a woman only to show up again at his castle in his bedroom. She flees after a struggle with a very naked James. She is soon caught though and he has her thrown in his dungeon. He soon finds himself commanded by his King to marry her. He is stunned but more so she. She dresses like a man, has no idea how to act like a lady or even a civilized human being. He tries to get her to change but she is as stubborn as he. They fight the attraction they have for each other and only after a long struggle do they finally admit they care for one another. I will enjoy reading a book about James's sister hopefully in the near future.
