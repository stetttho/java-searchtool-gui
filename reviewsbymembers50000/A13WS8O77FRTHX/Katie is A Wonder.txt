 Well first off I have to say that if you want to read a book that is full of humor, hot, sticky, passionate love scenes, great heros and fantastic heroines, story lines that keep you reading long after you should be asleep, then read a book by Katie MacAlister. I have read everything she's published so far and I eagerly await more. One thing I really like about the way Katie writes is that she writes as if this were her story. You don't find many authors writting in the 1st person so its refreshing to read Katie's books. A Girl's Guide To Vampires is a thrill ride. You have a lot of suspense and danger that keeps you guessing until the end. You have two wonderfully funny friends, Joy, the Heroine and Roxy the adorable best friend. The hero Raphael is.... Well let's just say I want one exactly like him! Raphael's rival Christian ain't too shabby himself.  I even loved the cover of this book. Its way to cute! All in all I have to say that this is a WINNER!!!! Run, don't walk to buy this book.
