 The first book "The Pirate Lord" first introduced Jordan, the Earl of Blackmore and his character was so interesting that he had to have his own book. Well this is his story. It starts off as the other ended at a ball where Jordan leaves with a woman he thinks is a widow only to find out that she is the innocent rectors daughter, Emily Fairchild. Emily thinks that he is her cousin since they are dressed the smae and it is a masquerade. when they realize their mistake they try to fix it before her reputation is ruined but first he must kiss her. The kiss will stay with both of them for months until the meet again. This time when they meet though she is Lady Emma Campbell and he is determined to solve the mystery of her masquerade. She can't tell him the real reason and when he finds out who she really is she begs him not to tell. She falls for him but he thinks himself incapable of feeling love and is determined not to feel anything for her but lust. This is a fast paced story with several twists. I enjoyed the banter between the characters and am looking forward to the next book in the series "The Dangerous Lord".
