 This is the second book in this series. This book is actually two love stories put into one. The hero's are the twins, Peter and Raven. They are the brothers to Lucien, from the first book "A Knight's Vow".  The story starts out with the King ordering Peter and Raven to marry two Welsh heiresses. Peter is to marry Roxanne and Raven is to marry Pamela. Pamela is heiress to a vast estate while Roxanne is the last daughter and even though she has no land to give the King is giving as her dowry a cache of valuables. Roxanne is a fiesty woman who desires nothing more that to return to her home and have nothing to do with the English. She and Peter take a walk and Peter slips and breaks his leg. Roxanne takes this as her chance to escape and flees bck to her home. Since Peter can't go after her he sends his twin Raven after her. Now Raven dislikes Roxanne and is only doing this because he is forced to. Pamela stays behind with Peter to help with his healing. Soon after Raven leaves Peter and Pamela discover that they have feelings for each other but know that each is promised to another so they fight their passions and love. Raven meanwhile has caught up to Roxanne and soon discovers that he finds her desirable and she him.  This is an enjoyable romp with danger, passion, friendship, honor, and love all rapped up in one book. I did like the first book just a bit better than this one but was glad i bought both.
