 When I first read the back of this book I thought "wow this sounds like a great book." I even thought that in the beginning because it starts off with a lot of humor and I thought the heroine and hero were going to be great adversaries for a while and then finally admit thier love for each other. That didn't happen. I liked the Hero, Jamie, but I found Jix, who is the supposedly impish heroine, a bore most of the time. I actually found the secondary characters of Griffin and Sam were more interesting. It was a good book but it didn't live up to its potential.
