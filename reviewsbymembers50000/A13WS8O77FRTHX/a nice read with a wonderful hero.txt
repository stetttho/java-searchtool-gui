 This is the first book I've read by Gayle Callen and it won't be the last. I really enjoyed this book. The story starts off with the heroine being kidnapped and taken to a monastery. She has knowledge of a plot against King Richard. She is freed by a monk, the hero. He is actually a novice. He sees her being taken into the monastery and his knights training kicks in and he has to help her. Katherine is very leary of monks. She won't tell him her name and the real reason for her need to get to King Richard, but he helps her anyway. Along the way they discover they are attracted to each other and they end up making love. They know it is a sin but they can't help themselves. There are several twists and turns to this story. We soon find out that Katherine's monk is Reynold her betrothed's brother. I enjoyed this book and would like to see books about Reynold's brother and sister.
