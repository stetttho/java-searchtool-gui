 I loved this book. It takes place in Hawaii. The heroine Calie has come for the vacation of a lifetime. She decides to really live and hires an escort. The man who answers her is Tresand, a mysterious man who will only meet her at night because he is a vampire. Of course she doesn't know this but she falls in love with him just the same. He is a tortured soul who tries to distance himself from her but his heart has already decided his fate. This story has some interesting secondary characters that I would enjoy reading about. Also it has a twist to it that I really enjoyed. Get this book if you can.
