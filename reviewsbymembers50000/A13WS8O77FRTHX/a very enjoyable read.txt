 I really enjoy this authors books. They are always full of humor and tenderness. I lookforward to each one. This one is the story of Lord Bannor who has a dozen children who are driving him nuts. He decides that they need a new mother and sends his steward to get him a wife. He comes back with a new wife alright but one that Bannor can barely resist. She is the beautiful Lady Willow. Lady Willow has been treated by her stepmother and step siblings like a servant. She is thrilled to get married and away but soon finds that all she is to be to her husband is a caretaker for his children. She sets out to change this and inlists the help of the children. Bannor cannot resist her and even though he fears making her pregnant wants her very badly. The love scenes are tender and make one want to sigh. I enjoyed this book very much and would recommend it to anyone who wants a light read for a rainy or sunny afternoon.
