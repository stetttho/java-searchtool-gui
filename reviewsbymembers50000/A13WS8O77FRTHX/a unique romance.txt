 This was a most unique story. I have always enjoyed time travel romances but this one has a twist. The hero has traveled 500 years into the future but not as a man but as a statue. He is the exact replica of the "David" by Michelangelo, but smaller. He is discovered by the heroine Honoria Psyche Fitzhugh, aka Honor. Honor has just announced her discovery to the world only to have it declared a fake and her career is in ruins. She is saying good-bye to the statue when her tears bring him to life. Dominico Castiglione, Dom, was trapped in stone until the tears of a virgin awaken him right before the year 2000 so that he can find his long lost realtive and help him. Honor agrees to help him and together they flee to New York where they try and find Rafe, Dom's relative. The also are helped along the way by Honor's friend Ernie and his brother Nick. Dom must find his family or be lost forever but he must also fight the struggle to remain honorable and not take Honor. He wants her and she him. They love each other but Dom cannot bring himself to soil her. Honor is confused and hurt but know no matter what happens she will not regret anything that she and Dom do.  This is a exciting story that keeps the reader guessing how it will turn out. I liked the ending and I look forward to the sequel "Heaven's Hero". I also hope their are others in the series.
