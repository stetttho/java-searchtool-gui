 Well I have to agree with most of the other reviewers, this book wasn't as good as the previouse books I've read by this author. I also found that the heroine was a bit too much. I didn't really warm to her at all. I liked the hero although he was just a bit too much of a hero. I couldn't see real people in them at all. It took me a while, several days to get through this book. I kept putting it down and read several books in between. This book does have a sequel which is Pip's story I am hopeing that her story will be an easier read.
