 These books just keep getting better and better! I have enjoyed all of them and I get excited when a new one comes along. If you haven't read them start! This book is the 7th full lenght novel in the series. Ther is also a novella in the book "After Twilight" that has a tie in with the series. This is Gabriel's story. He is the twin to Lucian. They are very ancient Carpathians that have lived for over 2000 years. Gabriel has been in the ground for years in Paris and whe he rises its to find that Paris has changed and that his twin, Lucian who has turned vampire has also risen. Gabriel soonn is found by Francesca who is also Carpathian and his lifemate. She has been unknown for centuries and is living as a human healer.  She freely gives her help to Gabriel and he soon discovers that she is hhis true lifemate. She has made a decision to end her life so Gabriel must convince her that she must go on now that they are together. Along the way they have to fight against the vampires that are now flocking to Paris, including Lucian, who even though he has turned has kept intouch with Gabriel. They also must protect a very special girl that is wounded and needs the love and support that they can give her to heal. This book has a twist to it that is very suprising. I enjoyed it and can't wait for others. There are several secondary characters that need to have their stories written as well. I am looking forward to reading the next book in the series soon.
