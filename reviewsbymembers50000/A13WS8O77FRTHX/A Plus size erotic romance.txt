 Wow! Well I first must say that this book is not for the shy. It is very erotic. The Love scenes, and there are several, are very,very descriptive. This book is an E-book and the only complaint I have was that I had to set at my computer and read it rather than in my nice comfy Laz-y-Boy recliner. Oh well you can't have everything. This book is about a plus size woman. I loved that. She goes on a singles cruise with a friend. She soon realizes that she's not what everyone seems to be looking for. She wants to go hide in her room but its occupied by her friend so she ends up on deck. Little does she know that Troy is watching her. Troy is also on this cruise with a friend who is now occupied. Troy spots Angie and is imediately drawn to her. Now he has never been attracted to large women so this is a first, but there is just something about her that makes him flush with desire. They meet and sparks fly. They find that passion doesn't see dress sizes and when the cruise is over they are both left wanting more. Troy trys to get over her but soon finds himself trying to find a woman like her again but only to realize that its more than her body that he wants. Angie and he meet by accident and the desire that they felt is still there but where Angie wants the whole fairy tale, Troy is determined not to marry. But when Angie turns up on another man's arm he can't see straight because of the hurt and jealous feelings coursing through his body. This is a beautiful story of how love and passion are for all and how sometimes they right person for you is nothing like you've every wanted before. I liked this book and plan on getting more from this author.
