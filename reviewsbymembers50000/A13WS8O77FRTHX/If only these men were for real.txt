 Oh my was my first thought when I started to read this book. After just two chapters I was totally hooked. I have now read the first three in the Dark series, the first Dark Prince, then Dark Desire, and then Dark Gold. I have several of the others and am waiting for one that I just recently ordered. Well at first I couldn't quite tell what the hero of this book was. He had the ability to transform himself to a wolf, owl and even into just a mist. He drank blood to survive but wasn't a vampire. He was a Carpathain. He was old, the oldest of his kind and their Prince. Mikhail was very lonely and had long ago lost all his emotions. He was close to turning into a vampire(one who kills when he feeds and enjoys it). He was considering going into the light and ending his torment when he started communicating with a human woman by the name of Raven.She is a telepath who has been hunting down serial killers and has come to the Carpathian Mountains to try and relax and come to find some peace. She can't touch people because she picks up their thoughts and it can hurt her. She feels Mikhail's pain from a great distance and longs to comfort him. She is unaware that he is being hunted by her fellow travelers and when she finds this out she becomes hunted also because of her association with Mikhail. He has found in her his true lifemate. The one who can bring emotions back to him. His kind are slowly dying out because there are only a few women and most only give birth to male children. They have tried to convert human women before with tragic results but with Raven's telepathic abilities the conversion goes fairly smoothly. Mikhail wants to protect her but soon finds that she can handle herself and learns that they both must give a bit if this love is to survive. The love scenes are hot and wild and then tender and touching. I look forward to all of the books in this series. I would recommend them to anyone.
