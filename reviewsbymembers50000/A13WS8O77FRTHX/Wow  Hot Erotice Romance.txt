 Well Again I must caution anyone who reads this book that it is highly erotic and very sexual.  This is a sci-fi romance. It takes place in the future. Earth has established relations with another planet Shimerian, who has a lot of men on it who need wives/mates. Our heorine Sharon took an "oath" at age 18 to possibly become one of these mates/wives. She never expected it to actually happen but suddenly Her mate came calling. Liken has know about her for years(he's Telepathic) but decided to wait to let her have a life without him first.  Now Sharon doesn't really want to be there but she must go through a trial period. If she she resists him the oath will be broken and she can go home. Now there she has three options or oaths that she may choose. The oath of Seduction, the oath of Challange and the oath of Capture. She chose Seduction. You can guess what that means. Sharon discovers that there is much more to Liken than just just terrific bod. He is a caring person who can make her life a happy one if she chooses to stay. Liken must overcome her fears and help her realize that they are life mates. This book has two sequels, Oath of Challange which is Sharon's friend Kate's Story and another one Oath of Capture.  I really enjoyed this book although I couldn't set in my comfy recliner and read it. I am looking forward to the others in the series.
