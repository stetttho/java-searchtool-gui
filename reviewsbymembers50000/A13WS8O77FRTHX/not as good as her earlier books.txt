 I love this author but i didn't like this book very much. I was so looking forward to it that I bought it 4 months before it came out. I have always enjoyed the humor and wonderful writting style of Lynsay Sands but this book lacked that humor and style. I did find it somewhat funny in a few random scenes. And i will admit that the love scenes are hot but the plot didn't thrill me. The characters were boring to me and the situations that the heroine gets herself into may me think she was an incredibly stupid woman not one who was supposed to be making it on her own. I'm sorry that this wasn't a better book but I'll still read Lynsay Sands books in the future.
