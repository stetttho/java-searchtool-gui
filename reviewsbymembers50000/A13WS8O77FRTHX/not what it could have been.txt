 I was very excited about this book when I read the back cover. Unfortunately the book doesn't live up to its potential. I liked the main plot but the author didn't spend much time describing the characters, the scenery. She left you hanging. The romantic scenes left me cold. I wish she had taken the time to really develope this story. I would pass on this one.
