 I really enjoyed this book from page one. It is very funny and had me laughing so hard I cried! The opening scene is priceless. Lisa Cach's books are always a joy to read.  This is a time-travel romance where the Hero is a modern day pro wrestler who is sent back in time to defeat a dragon. He thinks that this is just a dream but soon realizes that its all too real. He really discovers this when the dragon tries to make him lunch! Along with trying to kill the dragon he must fight the fears of the heroine, the virgin, Alizon. Alizon was sent to the dragon 12 years before. She somehow survives and now provides a haven for the virgins that have followed her to their "deaths". She has hidden the girls away and even though she hates and fears the dragon she has come to depend on him to keep her and the girls safe. When George shows up to kill the dragon she doesn't know what to do. She is strongly attracted to him but fears the unknown. She must battle her emotions and fears before she can become a full woman in his arms. I would like to read future books with some of the other girls as leading characters, hint, hint! I would recommend this to anyone who wants a lite fun read that will really let you escape for a few hours.
