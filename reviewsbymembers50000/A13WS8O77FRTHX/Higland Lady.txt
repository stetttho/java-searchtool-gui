 This book has one of the strongest heroines I've come across in a long while. Elen, is as much a warrior as her hero Munro, who is also her prisoner. Her sister is kidnapped by Munro's brother and to get her back safely she takes Munro prisoner. She treats him fairly and during her visits to him to get info on why her sister has been kidnapped and if she's ok, Elen falls for Munro and he for her. He is clueless as to why his brother has done what he did but starts to actually enjoy being Elen's prisoner. After the kidnapping is resolved and he is released he tries to woo her with gifts but she is not impressed or at least she appears that way. He finally enlists the help of the scottish king, his friend, to make him marry her. The whole thing almost blows up in his face but in the end she she is as happy as he is. I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it highly.
