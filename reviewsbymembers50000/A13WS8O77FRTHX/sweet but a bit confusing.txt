 Love, Remember Me is a time travel story that has a very sweet premiss. The hero and the heroine are in love and they die together after a fierce battle to save thier way of life. The only had one night together and now as they lay dying they vow to find each other again.  Well the heroine dies and the hero, Cairn is helped by angels and is given a special task. He is not really dead but also not really alive. He comes back to earth several times over the centuries searching for his lost love. He finds her only to loose her again before she remembers him. She must remember him in order for him to stay. The heroine is now a modern woman writting a news article on angles. She meets a woman who tells her that someone is waiting for her. She of course this that this is baloney but soon finds herself being drawn to Scotland to find her destiny. She and Cairn finally meet and she remembers him but before they can have a life something will happen that could tear the two apart forever. This story jumps around a lot so it is a bit confusing. I liked its idea but found that all that jumping around made it hard to enjoy.
