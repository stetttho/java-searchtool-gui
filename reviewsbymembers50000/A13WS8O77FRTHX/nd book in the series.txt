 I am really enjoying this series. The series started with "The Dreamer" which was the story of the oldest of three sisters. Now in this second book we have Laura's story. Laura is the practical one of the three. She is always planning. She is exactly opposite the hero of the tale, William, the reluctant Laird of Blackfearn. William has been asked to escort Laura to safety. He thinks that she will be a quiet lass and is both horrified and thrilled to find her a strong, willful, exciting woman. He is strongly attracted to her but has no desire to be tied down. He is having enough trouble coming to terms with the fact that he is now Laird of his clan. Laura is in danger and she must rely on William to protect her even though she wants nothing to do with him. She is drawn to him and soon finds herself lost without him. She must help him overcome his fears that he is not good enough to be Laird. She must also keep her secret safe at all costs. This is an exciting story. One that will make you laugh and cry. I found the characters were so well written they came alive. I actually enjoyed this book just a tad bit more than the first and I can't wait to read the last in the series, "The Firebrand". This husband and wife team are wonderful writters and I look forward to more from them.
