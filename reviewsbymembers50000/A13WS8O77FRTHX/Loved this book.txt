 When I first got this book I didn't realize it was a part of a series, when I did I put it up until I could read the other books. I'm glad i did. It made much more sense to me when I knew who Adam was and What a Berserker was. Even though the first two books take place after this one I could tie them in very well. This is a time travel book. I love time travel books. I wish that there had been more discription of Lisa's(the heroine) transition into 14th century life. Plus when Circenn(the hero) goes forward in time his transition. The love scenes in this are great even before they actually happen. The two have fantasies about each other which are quite steamy. I like the fact that the hero hasn't been with a lot of women. It makes him seem more real. I liked the secondary characters of Galen and Duncan who I have a suspision are related to Hawk in Karen's first book. I would dearly love to read books about them finding love. Especially Duncan who has "had" almost every willing maid he can find until he seems to meet his match in a mysterious woman named Elizabeth MacBreide. She seems like a match for him. This is a good book and I would recommend it to anyone who likes tender but fierce warrior hero's and mischevious fairies.
