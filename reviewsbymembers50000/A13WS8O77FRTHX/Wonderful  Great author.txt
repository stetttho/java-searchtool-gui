 I was so thrilled to be able to get ahold of this book. I have enjoyed every book that Sherrily has written. I have been lucky enough to have met her in cyber-space and found that she is a wonderfully nice person with a great sense of humor. I hope to meet her in person some day. Until then I will have to read all of her books again and again. Now this book is tied in with her book Paradise City. Both are sci-fi romances that pack a lot of action and heat. The hero of this book, Nemesis, is a dark, fearsome warrior who has a fierce reputation as a mercenary. He also has a secret. He has admired and dreamed about the heroine for years. Princess Kiara is a wonderful dancer who soon finds herself in very close quarters with Nemesis. He is protecting her from her father's enemies but at a high cost, his heart. The two are trying to fight their growing attraction for each other but failing. The passions soon ignite and the fireworks are fantastic.  I loved the supporting characters. They added humor and really tied the whole book together. I hope that there maybe more in this series. Hint, Hint! If you can get this book and Paradise City as well.
