 First off a Warning. This book is highly erotic. The sex is very graphic and there is a lot of it. I enjoyed this book because it was different. It is a sci-fi-romance-erotic-adventure. The main characters are humans who have been kidnapped and taken aboard this ship for study by the Revan. Its a study of sex. The Revan no longer have sex but have found that the lack of it is killing them. They have gathered subjects from several worlds to watch them have sex. They create several  different sexual situations for the subjects. The subjects are not allowed to resist because they are mind controlled. Once the Revan have all the info they need they will disspose of the subjects. The two humans, Bruce and Jenna, are rival althletes. They have a strong attraction to each other but have never really acted upon it until now. Now that they are thrown into this bizare situation they must drawn on thier feelings of both attraction and respect for each other to fight for thier lives. Along the way they fall in love. Now the love story is sort of a minor detail in this tale. Its more about the sex. I liked the concept of this story and my only complaint was that I wanted the love story to be more of the story and that would have made the sex more interesting.
