 Well I started this series out reading the third book first and now I've just finished the second book. I am finally going to start the first book in the series. This book is about the oldest Bridgerton brother, Anthony. He is the head of his family and has finally decided to settle down and marry. He is determined not to love is wife so when he picks a potential bride is caught completely off guard when he meets her older sister, Kate. Kate is determined that her baby sister not marry the dashing rake. She stands up to him and even manages to ruffle his feathers a bit when she takes her dog on a walk that ends up in disaster. This book has lots of humor in it and I enjoyed reading about all the Bridgerton family. I can't wait to read the other stories. Plus I have an idea who the mysterious Lady Whistledown is. I can't wait to find out if I'm right!
