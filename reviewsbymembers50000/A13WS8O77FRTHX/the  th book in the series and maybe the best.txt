 Ok I have loved every book in the Dark series but I really think that this one may have been the best. I couldn't put it down. I usually like to spread these books out so that I don't have to wait and wait for the next but after I read Dark Legend which is Gabriel's story and found out that this was Lucian's story I had to read it as soon as I got it. Lucian is the twin to Gabriel and is one of the very ancient ones. He has lived for over 2000 years as the greatest hunter of the Carpathians. He has a voice that can make even the most evil of vampires do whatever he wants. He soon finds though that his voice, although compelling, cannot easily command his lifemate. After centuries he finds her. She is human but has special abilities that allow her to be his true lifemate. Jaxx has had a horrid childhood and is a loner because of it. She is haunted by a evil past that has stalked her and everyone deer to her for years. Lucian has vowed to protect her but she is a cop and can protect herself. She fears that she will put Lucian in danger so she fights what her heart and soul are telling her. She decides that she will protect Lucian and fight alongside him in his battles. This is the first time the heroine has taken such a strong role in protecting her lifemate. I really enjoyed how she could be both strong yet vulnerable at the same time. The love scenes are hot and so wonderfully written. The whole book is just so good that I was both happy and sad at the end because I knew I'd have to wait awhile for a new book. I would recommend these books to anyone, not just because they are romances but because the stories are so well written that you feel like the characters are actually real.
