 This is the story of a vicar's daughter, Olivia, who is forced by fate to work for the new Earl of Ravenwood, the half Gypsy, Dominic. Olivia and dominic first meet by accident, literally, on a moonlite night, hence the title. They are attracted to each other right off the bat, but Olivia has strong feelings of scorn for what she believes Gypsies to be. He father was killed by a Gypsy so this fuels the fire of distrust. Dominic has always been an outsider. Not fitting in with the Gypsies and not with the English. He struggles with discrimination at every turn. Olivia comes to realize that her distrust is misplaced and soon seeks to comfort Dominic. All the while this is going on Olivia's blind sister Emily is being courted by Andre. He is a Gypsy but is afraid to reveal it to Emily because he doesn't want to hurt her. They fall in love but have some big obstacles to overcome. Both of these love stories were touching and I really enjoyed this book. I read it in one day and I hated when I had to put it down. I really enjoy Samantha James's books and will be sure to get more of her books.
