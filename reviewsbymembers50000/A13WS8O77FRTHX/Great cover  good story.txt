 Well i have enjoyed the Viking series of books by Sandra Hill so i was excited to find a book of hers that I hadn't read. This one is about an American hero after the Civil War. It was very funny in spots but I didn't really like the heroine in the story. She was too much. The Hero was wonderful and I loved the secondary characters and since I found out this is actually a sequel to "Frankly My Dear" I'll going to go back and read it. This is a time travel book. The heroine, Harriet ids a modern psychologist who really seems to hate men, in my personal opinion. She has written a book on woman's fantasies and and has determined that it is wrong to have a fantasie about "forceful seduction". This is not rape but where the man seduces the woman into sex. She has preached against this but can't admit, even to herself, that she has these fantasies. She uses a famous book by Rosemary Rogers called " Sweet Savage Love" as a bad example. Well when her train is derailed in modern times she awakens back in time in the year 1870. Where she meets the subject of her dreams Etienne. Etienne is undercover working for President Grant and at first thinks she is a spy so he must keep her close, very close. The story has a lot of interesting turns and plots but when it all came to head it was a bit boring. I enjoyed the banter between the two main characters and I loved Etienne's two best friends, Cain and Abel. The book was enjoyable and I'm looking forward to reading the book leading up to it.
