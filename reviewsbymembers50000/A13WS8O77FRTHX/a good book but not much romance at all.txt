 Well if you are looking for romance it is not this book. This is a tale more of redemption. The other two books in the series Miracle and Devotion are the romances. This book is the continuation of Devotion and the Story of Maria and Trey. I enjoyed the book and was on the edge of my seat wondering how it would all turn out. I was a bit shocked by the violence in the book and the sad states of the characters both main and secondary. The author paints a bleak picture of how life can go terribly wrong but also gives us insite on how we all can change our own destinys. I would recommend this book only as a follow up to the other two, its not a stand alone book.
