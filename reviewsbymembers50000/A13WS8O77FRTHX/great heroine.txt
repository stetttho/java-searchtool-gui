 Well I haven't read this book in many years and I was very glad I reread it today. This is one of my favorite books by Connie Mason because I love the heroine in this book. She goes through hell, and I do mean, hell to have happiness. The hero in this story I don't really like. He puts her through most of the hell but in the end love conquers all. This story starts out in London in 1759. the heroine, Amanda, has been sent off to get lace to finish a dress her mother is making for a very rich woman. On the way back she is mistaken as a prostitute and ends up being bedded by our hero, Tony. Tony is leaving for the colonies the next moring so she is his goodbye gift from his friends. He never realizes that she is a virgin. After he leaves the next day things go from bad to worse for Amanda. She now must steal so that her and her dying mother can eat. She is caught and soon finds herself on her way to the colonies as an indentured servant. Tony sees her and buys her and on the way home he can't help himself and takes her. She can't really help herself either because Tony does make her burn with passion. She becomes his housekeeper and he treats her very roughly. Finally they realize they love each other but there are a multitude of horrible things that will try and stop them from marrying. All throughout the book Amanda remains strong and I did like Tony some of the time. He got better. This book has very hot love scenes that could burn paper. You won't want to put this down until you've finished it.
