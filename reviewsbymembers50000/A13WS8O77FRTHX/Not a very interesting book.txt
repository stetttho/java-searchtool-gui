 I have enjoyed Joahnna Lindsey's books for years. I used to look forward to each and everyone. Well this book was a big disappointment. The plot is interesting although I though it was going to be about a Viking showing up on a modern womans doorstep. Its a sci-fi romance. The Viking is a Very Very tall man named Dalden who has come to our humble little planet to stop a evil man from taking over our planet. Dalden gets our heroine, Brittany to help him. Brittany is a very tall woman who is looking for mister right and can't seem to find one. She agrees to help him, rather quickly. Dalden decides that she will be his lifemate and she doesn't even bat an eye at that. There is a super computer that helps them both named Martha who adds humor to the story which it badly needed.  The story doens't have a lot of interaction between the main characters at all. Its mostly between Brittany and Martha discussing that this is real and not a fantasy and how Barbsric Dalden is. I struggled through this book. It took days to read. I wish it had been better.
