 I loved this book. I read it in one setting. I couldn't put it down. I had read this authors books under another name but was thrilled when I found this book. This is the story of the most feared knight in the land, Draven and a very willful woman named Emily. We first meet Draven when he and Emily's father are before the king arguing about the on going feud between them. Both blame each other for the attacks on their land. The king decides that in order to make these two come to a peace that Emily shall spend one year in Draven's care and that Draven must never touch her or else he will die. They both agree and Draven gives his vow of honor not to touch her in anger or in lust. Little did he know how hard that vow would be to keep. Emily is a beautiful woman who longs for a husband and family of her own. Her father is overprotective of her and her sisters. She is thrilled to get the chance to be free for a while and decides to set her sights on Draven. When they first meet he takes her breath away. She decides right then and there that he will be hers and she always wins. Draven is not unaffected by her and its a constant struggle for him to keep his distance. He longs to love her but is afraid the demon inside him will hurt her and drive her away forever. They must find the laughter and the love they both deserve and bring peace between two families. Kinely MacGregor makes you really feel the sorrow and the pain the characters feel. She has wonderful side characters that make the book a whole. There is humor, passion, love and tenderness all wrapped up inside.
