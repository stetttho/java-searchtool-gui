 the first book in the series"The Warlord" briefly introduced the character of Guy, the half brother to Kenric. He is now the Baron of Montague and a very strong, wealthy, smart, man. He goes to Lonsdale castle to get back Halford hall which is rightfully his back. He spots a beautiful woman and looses his heart right away. The woman is Lady Claudia Chivari, a half English, Half Italian niece of Lord Lonsdale. She has not had an easy life and is not well liked by her uncle. She speaks with a heavy accent and it is hard for people to understand her, all except Guy that is. Thiers is an instant attraction but Guy insists that it is not love and only lust. Claudia fights her feelings for him as well and this makes for some very interesting conversations.  They must learn to trust each other and when both her uncle and her brother Dante mess with thier lives this makes it almost impossible to do. There are wonderful secondary characters in this book and we even get to meet Kenric and Fitz Alan again. I really enjoy these books and look forward to more by this author.
