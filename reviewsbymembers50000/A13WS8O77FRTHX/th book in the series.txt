 I love this series. The Dark series has been a joy to read. I'm trying to read them slowly so that I will have time to cheris them but I want to fly right through all of them. This is the 5th book in the series and Julian's story. He is Aidan's twin and the man Gregori had guarding his lifemate Savannah until they mated. His assignment is to warn a beautiful singer named Desari that her life is in danger from the vampire hunters. He suddenly discovers that Desari is his lifemate and also Carpathian. She and her brother Darius escaped with four other children many centuries ago the hunters and have been living with out the knowledge that other Carpathians other than those who have turned vampire still live. Desari and Darius are Gregori's long lost siblings. Desari is not to keen on the idea of Julian being her lifemate. She likes her freedom and is quite powerful on her own. She struggles with his need to control her and protect her. She wants an equal. He is also struggling with this and is learing how to give a little. He must also battle a dark secret he has carried with him for centuries. This secret could destroy them all and he must seek it out and kill it before it hurts them. Darius, Desari's older brother is quite a force to deal with also. He has had to learn everything on his own and protect his family unit. He is very leary of Julian but comes to respect him and his abilities to protect his family. His story is next. I can't wait. There are also some very interesting supporting characters that I would be interested in reading thier stories. I am so glad I found this series and will enjoy it for years to come. Keep writing Christine!
