 Well I liked this book to a point. The characters of Eden, the young, innocent, prim and proper lady, and  Ram, the Highland Laird, who is fighting demons from his past are wonderful. Betina Krahn describes them beautifully. He must marry her to gain his inheritance and even though he is strongly attracted to her, as she is to him, he finds that his demons are coming between them. Her family is very enjoyable and add to the humor that is in this book. The only real complaint I have about this book was that it was a bit too wordy. It took me days and days to read. I would have liked it more if there had been a bit more action between the h/h. I just got bored with this book.
