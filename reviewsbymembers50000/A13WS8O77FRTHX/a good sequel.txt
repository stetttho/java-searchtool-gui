 Well I first have to say i got some very strange looks from my co-workers when I was reading this book. They looked at the title and I could just tell what their thoughts were. "Hummmmmm, she has to read a book about how to marry? poor girl." Well anyway their thoughts kind of go along with how the heroine felt in this book about the book she found"How to Marry a Marquis". The heroine, Elizabeth, is working as a companion for Lady Danbury. She has to work to make because she is the sole support for herself and her three younger siblings. She has come to the conclusion that she must marry for money to support them but doesn't really have a clue as to how to become married. That's where the book comes in. Now the hero in this story is The Marquis Riverdale, James. You will remember him from the first book in this series" to Catch an Heiress". He has come at the request of his aunt Lady Danbury to solve her problem of blackmail. He has taken on the identity of James Siddons, the new estate manager. He is quite taken by the clumsy Elizabeth and when he discovers her plan to marry he agrees to help her find a suitable husband. But all the while he is becoming more and more attracted to her and she is having the same feelings for him. Finally they act on their attraction for each other but before it can end happily ever after all hell breaks loose. This is a funny story and I was please to see characters from the previous book make appearances. I would enjoy reading books about Elizabeth's siblings so I'll keep my fingers crossed. I have enjoyed all of Julia Quinn's books and would urge anyone to buy them all.
