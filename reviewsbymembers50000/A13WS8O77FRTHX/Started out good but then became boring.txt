 I liked the start of this book. The idea of the "Forever Bride" story is very beautiful and heart warming. I thought the plot of this story that the modern woman, Meagan, goes to Scotland to get married in an old church where the "Forever Bride" tale is said to have taken place, was unique. There she is suddenly flung back in time and ends up marrying, not her modern day fiance, but Robert Cameron, the Laird of Thistledown Castle. Robert has never met his bride to be so is shocked to see that she is not as young as he thought her to be, nor as innocent. He can't deny that he is attracted to her and tries to convince her that she is just as attracted to him. He soon realizes that she is not his real bride and together they set out to find the missing bride. The story is very good for a while and really held my interest but then it started to drag. I put this book down several times and it took days to finish it. I think the ideas of the book were good but not really brought to life. The characters were a bit lacking also. I wish this had been a better book.
