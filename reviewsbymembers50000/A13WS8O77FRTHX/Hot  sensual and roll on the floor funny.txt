 I loved this book. I laughed and cried so hard over this book. I will definately buy other books by Rebecca. This book is a fantasy historical. The heroine is a fairy. Her name is Splendor. She is a fairy princess who has been chosen to conceive a child with the human Jourdian, the 12th Duke of Heathcourte. She has only has three months in which to do this. If she doesn't do this the fairy world will end. They need the half-human baby to strengthen them and the kingsom will again be able to have children. So she goes to the human world naked and lands atop a shocked Jourdian. She proceeds to send his orderly world totally upside down. When her best freind, a shape shifting animal shows up in the house, you never know what it will be. One day a pig the next a donkey and so on. She is seen by the vicar naked and now a scandal is afoot. Jourdain marries her to save her reputation but she can't abide by the scratchy clothing so she marries him in one of his silk shirts and nothing else. The love scenes are hot and sensual and make a person sigh. Splendor's sister Harmony who is very mischevious shows up and causes havoc, even going so far as to turn Jourdian into a snail! She then falls for Jourdian's best friend Emil. This story is so endearing to me I can't wait to read it again and again. If you get a chance to get a copy of this book buy it and never lend it out, you might not get it back!
