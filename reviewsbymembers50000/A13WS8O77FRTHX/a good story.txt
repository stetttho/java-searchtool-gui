 This tale is loosely linked with Ann's Lord of the Keep. The hero from that story is friends with the hero from this tale. Lord of the Mist starts out with the hero, Durand, burying his unfaithful wife and trying to come to grips with the baby girl she left behind. He knows the child is not his but is willing to raise her as his own. In the chapel he finds a woman who he needs for his soul as much as the child needs her for nurishment. The woman, Cristina, is the child's wet nurse. Cristina is the wife of Simon le Gros, a horrid man who uses Cristina to furthur his own causes. Cristina is a healer who not only tries to help those who are sick and needy but she also tries to bring light and love back into Durand's life. Durand has a very hard time learing to trust again but soon realizes that Cristina is the only one who can make him live again. This is a very sweet story. I have enjoyed many other books by this author since this book. I am looking forward to more from her.
