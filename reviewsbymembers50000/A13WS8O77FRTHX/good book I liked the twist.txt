 This is a book about werewolves. I enjoyed the fact that these characters were struggling with the same things every human deals with. Love, pain, loneliness, feelings of duty and honor. The main characters, Branden, the head of the family, has devoted his entire life to the Cause, which is restoring the purity of the bloodline. He has put his whole life force into this and so he is shaken when the heroine, Cassidy, a half human, enters his life. She is searching for her people and is over joyed to be a part of his family. There are many things which she must learn and he finds himself teaching her and falling for her even though he is struggling to keep her at a distance. She on the other hand has completely embraced her feelings for him. I enjoyed this book and will be reading the sequels. I can't wait to read Quentin's book.
