 Wow was my first reaction to reading this story. I have enjoyed all of Robin's books but I think this one was the best so far. This is the sequel to THE LOVER which was Gabriel's friend Michael's story. Now while that one was exciting and thrilling this one surpasses it by a mile. I stayed up all night reading this because I couldn't put it down. Gabriel is a tormented man. He is a former high priced [prostitute] but not for women but for men. He hated it. He only did it to get wealthy enough to find the men who had raped him so long ago. He has found one but the other is still at large. He now owns a famous house of sex. Where the rich come to act out thier every fantasy. On the reopening night a innocent 34 year old terroized woman, Victoria, shows up to sell the only she has left of value, her virginity, to the highest bidder. Victoria was a governess who was dismissed by a jealous woman and now after six months without work is desperate. She captures Gabriel's attention and knows that she is the key to his revenge. She is also the key to his salvation.  Soon they find that they cannot ignore thier passions. The love scenes in this are so well written  that the reader will blush with both embarassment and longing for more. The story takes exciting turns that keep the reader on thier toes. ... is just around the corner and when its revealed its a suprise. I really think that Robin has outdone herself on this book. She tackles taboo subjects with ease and makes the characters truely human faults and all. I would recommend reading THE LOVER first to get the full story.
