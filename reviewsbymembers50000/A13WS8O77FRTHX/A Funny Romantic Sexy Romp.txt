 Well first off I have to say that I have yet to find a book by this author that I didn't like. Her books are always filled with tons of humor that leave me laughing so hard my belly hurts and I have tears running down my face. Her characters are so real that you could swear you know them personally.  Hard Day's Knight takes place at a Renaissance Faire. The Heroine, Pepper, has never been to one of these so she's experiencing a bit of culture shock. Especially when she has to put on the Official Wenches Guild costume. Her breasts will never be the same.   The hero,Walker, is a sexy Englishman who's voice melts Peppers heart. He also looks really tasty in tights! He is also a man who has scars from his past that haunt him and prevent him from winning not only the Jousting tournament but Pepper.  Pepper has to overcome her fear of horses, and learn to joust to help Walker see the man he truley is and the man she loves.  The supporting characters in this story bind it together making it a well written and complete story.   I can't wait to read more from this author. She is definately one of my favorites.
