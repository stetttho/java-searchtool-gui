 I have always been drawn to the tale of Cinderella. I love the whole idea of the handsome,rich,kind prince finding true love in a beautiful,poor,kind girl and making her his own. Well this story is the same except the roles are reversed. The hero, Ash is a handsome, poor, kind farmer who prides himself on doing things his way and not taking handouts. The heroine, Charmaine, is the beautiful, rich, kind, liberated woman who has always secretly loved Ash. She comes back home to Kansas for a visit and finds her whole world turned upside down.  She has very specific ideas about marriage and love and thinks she will never marry, her father has other ideas. This is a light story that makes for an enjoyable afternoon read.
