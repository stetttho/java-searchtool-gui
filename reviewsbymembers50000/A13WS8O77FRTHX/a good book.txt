 Well I was a bit leary about reading this book. I didn't care for the first book I read by this author but was pleasantly suprised by this one. I liked the plot line and the charactrs were well written. The discriptions of everyday life made it feel as though you were watching it happen. This is a time-travel-historical. The heroine, Ana conjures a warrior to help save her mother. She is hoping for the legendary Irish warrior, Cuchuliann, but what she gets is a modern day man who plays footbal for a team called the Warriors. Kenneth MacKinnon, aka Mac, is suddenly taken from the middle of a game and thrown back in time to 1328. He is totally confused but quickly adapts to his new life. He soon finds himself training to do battle to be the hero that Ana needs. He also finds that he wants to be more than just a hero for Ana. he has fallen in love with her but with his future uncertain he is reluctant to make her his. She feels just as strongly for him but knowing that he must go back to his time she is afraid to let her heart feel for him. There is action, humor, passion and love in this story. It is filled with many secondary characters that help tie it all together. I really enjoyed it and I hope her other books are as good.
