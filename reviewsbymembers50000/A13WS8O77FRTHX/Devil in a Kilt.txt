 This is the first book I've read by Sue-Ellen Welfonder and it problably won't be the last. I didn't really like the cover at first but then after I got into the story I really could see the model on the front being Duncan. He is a troubled man who has been bitterly betrayed by his first wife and is said to have killed her for the betrayal. He is unsure whether his son is actually his son so he weds Linnet, a woman who is reported to have the gift of sight to tell him what he needs to know. Linnet is torn from all that she has known to a far away castle by a man who weds her but only wants her for her gift. She is determined to make him love his son no matter his parentage. she also wishes for his love for herself and hopes to bring laughter and happiness back into his life. I liked this book and I would like to see a sequel about Duncan's best friend Maraduke, a man who's scars go deeper than the flesh.
