 I like time travel romances but this one kinda left me cold. I felt like the characters could have been developed more. I would have liked a bit more substance to both the hero and the heroine. I liked them but I didn't really get to know them. This story starts off with the heroine, Taylor Rose, a school nurse, traveling on a train to get back home to San Diego in modern times. She falls asleep and when she awakens and gets off the train she is back in the year 1888. She adapts really fast to her new surroundings, a little to quickly for me. She meets the hero, Jackson, the bartender by accident. He thinks that Taylor is a man because of her pants and short hair. She over hears him making plans to kill Wyatt Earp, his boss. She is shocked and confused about what to do. Her dead father speaks to her and guides her through this situation. She ends up taking care of a madams garden and everyone is now calling her Rose. Jackson falls for Rose and she for him but this murderous plot is in the way of their happiness. I think that this could have been really great and I would have enjoyed it more if it just gave the characters more life.
