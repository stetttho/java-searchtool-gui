 Making Mr. Right! I'll sign up for this. Well that's what the heroine Josephine was going to do. She is a top scientist who has invented a plastic skin that is great for making life like toys, so why not make a man. She has dated all the pushy jerks that she can stand and now she wants the perfect man and she know just who can help her make him, Matthew Taylor. Matt is a genius robotic scientist. He can build anything and the chance to regain his crediblity was to hard for him to pass up. He soon realizes that Josie needs more than a plastic man, she needs him.He can't be perfect but he can show her how to love his imperfections. Together they build the perfect man but they also build a lasting friendship and deep love for each other that will stand the test of time. There are some wonderful secondary characters in this book that made me laugh so hard I cried. I would really recommend this book for an afternoon of lite reading, or if you are in a gloomy mood, it will bring a smile to your face.
