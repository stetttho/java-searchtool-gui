 I have always enjoyed this authors book but this one was a bit of a struggle to get through. It was a good story and had a good plot but I had to push myself to get back into the story. It was well written but I found it didn't have as much of the humor that I love in her books.  The story starts off in 1865 in New Zealand where the hero Justin Connor finds his best friend dying and pledges to take care of his little girl. He believes her to be a very little girl but in reality she is young lady who is now faced with the death of her father and the abandoment of her ward Justin Connor. Emily soon grows up and finds herself on a boat in New Zealand searching for her ward. She hates him because of his selfishness and has vowed revenge. She is thrown overboard and washes up on the shore only to be found by Justin. Justin has no idea that she is his ward and finds himself strongly drawn to her. He is a man haunted by the past and she is a bright star showing him that he has a future. Soon the local changes to England where Justin finally finds out that Emily is his ward. Now he has to contend with more guilt over how he treated his ward and his feelings of love and passion for his Emily. Emily doesn't make it easy for him and we get to witness some funny moments while she torments him. This story has some exciting twists to it and I enjoyed the banter between the characters. I look forwad to reading others by this author.
