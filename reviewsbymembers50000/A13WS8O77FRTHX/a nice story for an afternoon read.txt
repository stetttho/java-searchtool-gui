 I really enjoy this author's books. she also writes under the name Sherrilyn Kenyon and I have loved her books as well. The are always filled with humor and great passion. She makes the charactes really come to life and you feel like they've become friends of yours. In this book its about a Pirate, good thing it was named what it was huh? Anyway, The Pirate is the dreaded Sea Wolf. A man who is terrorizing the British navy and helps to free the American sailors that have been impressed by the British. His realy name is Morgan Drake and even though he is legit now he has a sorrid past as a pirate who took any ship. He is suprised to find himself the topic of a newspaper article by S.S. James in Savannah. He decides to go ther and confront the man and to find out his sources. Only when he gets to the newspaper office his world is set upon its ear. the S.S. James is not a man but a woman. Serenity James has worked for her father's newspaper for years and longs to write articles herself. She longs for adventure and for her "Pirate" to come and make that dream a reality. She never realizes thst the rude man asking about her article on the Sea Wolf, one which her father was so upset about, was her "Pirate". Once she does realize it she decided to go find out more info and ends up being kidnapped and taken aboard Morgan's ship, without his knowledge. The tale gets funnier by the page and the passions between the two get hotter and hotter. I loved the secondary characters in this book and I wonder if several of them might not have had thier own books and I may have missed them, I'll have to check. The only part I didn't like about this book was the ending because it came to fast. I thought this book could have had a few more adventures in it and lasted a bit longer. It's a book I shall read and reread.
