 Ok I admit it I bought this book because of the title and the cover. I mean it is a great title and the cover does make a girl have naughty thoughts! Oh my! Anyway, this book is the first I've read from Sheridan Smythe and it won't be the last. I laughed a lot over this book. It was a very easy read and made my afternoon. Brooke, the heroine, is a normally very stable unimpulsive person, that is until some jerk knocks up her sister and then disappears. Brooke decides to kidnap him and get him to admit to his crime and take responsiblity for his child. Well it sounded like a good plan anyway. The only problem was that Brooke has hijacked the wrong man! Oops! The man turned out to be the new owner of the factory where she is a shift manager. Alex Bradshaw is technically on vacation. His health has suffered as of late so his doctor has ordered a vacation. Well Alex decides to first come down and see his new factory and try and figure out why his condoms are failing. Yes I did say condoms. Its a condom factory. I must admit the setting made for some very funny scenes. Well as soon as Brooke realizes her mistake Alex inlists her help in uncovering the culprits. Together they proceed with a wacky investigation that leads them not only to the bad guys but to love. Along the way they fall for each other. The tension between the two is hot and when it's finally unleased its explosive. I really enjoyed this book and I can't wait to read others from this author. If you can get this book do.
