 I really liked this book. I thought that both the hero and heroine were both strong characters. I loved the way Adrienne just fell back in time. Plus she likes cats so thats a definate plus. The character of Adam, even though he was a troublesome cad, maked the struggle of the hero to admit his love all the sweeter. I liked the hero's friend Grimm and look forward to reading his story. I would definately recommend this book. It kept me up till 3am finishing it!
