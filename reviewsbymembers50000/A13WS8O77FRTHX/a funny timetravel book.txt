 This book is actually the sequel to "Breath of Magic" which I am going to go back and read now. I have loved very book Teresa Medeiros has written. She has humor, tenderness, true to life characters and she doesn't gloss over the harshness of the historical times of which she writes. This book starts off with Tabitha, a modern day witch. Yes those of us old enough to remember "Bewitched" from Tv will know that Tabitha was the daughter with the cute little nose. The book actually  mentions that show several times. Anyway she hates her magic because it never goes right. The 1st boy she ever kissed she turns into a frog by accident and it just kept getting worse to the point that she has almost hidden herself away from the world and her magic. Her parents,from "Breath of Magic" have tried to help her embrace her magic but to no avail. Tabitha learns that her parents are missing and her mother has left her a special message to find an emerald amulet which transports her back in time to be found by her "knight in shining armor" Colin. Colin is on the run from the man who has killed his family and ruined his castle while he was away on a Crusade. He has returned to find eveything in ruin and his once best friend wanting to kill him. He almost trample Tabitha and from that day on they are forever linked. Teresa Medeiros takes the reader on a wild adventure where your not sure you will end up next. The humor is terific, the love scenes hot enough to burn the paper and enough tenderness to make you cry. I really liked this book and can't wait to get the 1st book and read it.
