 Well I don't normally read modern romances but this one was very good. Its very fast paced and has the danger of a mystery. I thought the main characters of Jake and Marnie wonderful. I liked the fact that both were strong seperately but together they made a force to be reckoned with. I look forward to reading other of Cheryy's books that seem to include some of the secondary characters here. A good read.
