 This is the second installment in the Rogues of Regent Street series. They all tie in with each other so I think they should be read in order. The 1st book THE DANGEROUS GENTLEMAN was Adrain's story, this is Julian Dare's. Julian is on of Adrian's best friends. He too is tramatized by the incident involving thier mutual friend Phillip. But he also has a secret fear that involves Phillip and Lady Claudia. Now Lady Claudia has been his sister's firend for years. He has withnessed her groth from a imp of a girl to a beautiful woman. He vows to have her as his own which leads to a scandal. Claudia has loved Julian for as long as she can remember. He has hurt her several times and when he expresses interest in her she is leary but her heart leads the way. She must somehow show him that her love is true and that it's ok for him to love her back. I enjoyed the fact that Claudia is a strong woman who is fighting for women's rights in a time when women were thought to have none. I also liked the fact that Julian was secure enough in his malesness to accept that she was deserving of his respect as a fellow human. I look forward to others in this series.
