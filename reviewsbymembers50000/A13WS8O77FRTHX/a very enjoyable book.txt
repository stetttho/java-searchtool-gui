 As always I love Connie's books. She has a way with words that really brings the characters to life.  This book is set in Scotland, where the hero, Damian, an Englishman, is sent to prevent a wedding that would join two clans and possible upset the fragil peace between England and Scotalnd. The king send Damian, a landless knight to be the new Lord of Misterly & if he can prevent the wedding the land will be his. He arrives just in time to keep the heroine, Elissa Fraser keeping her promise to her dead father. He had wanted her to marry the Gordon Laird and unite the two clans. At first Elissa treats Damian like the hated Englishman he is and thinks he will be cruel and harsh with her clan and family, but she soon finds that he is a honest, caring, tender man who has no wish to hurt anyone anymore. they soon realize the strong attraction they have to each other and the love scenes are passionate and beautiful. But there are evil forces that keep them from being together and they must fight for thier love and their very lives. I enjoyed this book so much that I read it all in one setting. Its a fast and exciting read. I can't wait to read her new book as soon as I get it.
