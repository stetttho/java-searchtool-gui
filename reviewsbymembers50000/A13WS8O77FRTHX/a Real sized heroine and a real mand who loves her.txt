 First off I have to say a big "Thank You" To Teresa Medeiros for writting a book with a real sized woman and for having a man who willingly admits he likes larger women. Yeah! About time!. I also liked the fact that the heroine in this story has the same fears and thoughts about her body as modern day women do. It made her so real.  This is the story of Gwendolyn, a virgin who has been sacrificed by her villiage to the Dragon of Castle Weyrcraig. Only the Dragon isn't really real its Bernard the thought dead son of the dead lord. He was thought to have been killed 15 years before by the British. He somehow survives and is now using the Dragon to terrorize the village for its betrayal of his family. When he finds Gwendolyn tied up to a stake as an offering her is furious but she calms the Dragon and soon works her way into his heart. He is extremely attracked to her but she can't really believe it. It takes quite a bit of convincing to get her to feel good about herself. They have so much to overcome to find happiness but when they do you feel like cheering. I really enjoyed this book and look forward to others by this author.
