 I have been a fan of Connie's for years. I read everything she puts out, usually over and over again. That's what I did with this book. I orginally read it years ago and recently found it again and was just a thrilled this time. Connie has a way of making even the most fierce heros vulunerable and the weakest heroines strong and courageous. Her characters always compliment each other so well that if they were real we know they'd be together always. "The Lion's Bride" starts off right after William the Conquerer has taken England. One of his knights,Lyon, who saved his life, has now been charged with the Protection of Cragmere, the home of Ariana. Ariana is determined not to let William's Lion rule her. But Lyon is under orders to Marry the wench and take control. He does but then sends her to a convent for 5 years until he needs his wife. Ariana goes thru with the marriage and retreats to the convent but conspires with her former betrothed, Edric. Now 5 years later Ariana has grown into a beautiful woman and Lyon has need of his wife. Lyon is to return to Cragmere and help prevent a rebellion. So he sends for his wife, hoping to find her docile. Well that's not to be. Ariana is a strong willful woman who speaks her mind. Lyon is struck with her beauty but cannot trust her not to betray him or his heart. Ariana is also amazed when she returns to find that the man who she has hated for years is stirring feelings in her that confuse her. Together they must follow their passions to wherever they lead or else they will burn out. The book is filled with Connie's famous erotic love scenes that could make the book erupt in flames. You can always count on her books to do that. I found this book to be very enjoyable and as always i look forward to others by Connie.
