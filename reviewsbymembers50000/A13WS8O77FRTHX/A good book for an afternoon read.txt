 I though this book was easy to read and finish in just one afternoon. The story starts when the hero and the heroine are both children (13 or so) and Fox Mercer's father is dishonored and looses his title, his money and his lands because he will not tell who really killed a baron who was a close friend of the kings. The h/h are best friends but are torn from each other only to meet up again 10 years later when she is to be the prize for a tournament and he shows up even though he has now become the outlaw known as the Black Fox. He wins but is thrown in the dungeon but escapes and takes Jordan, the heroine, with him. He tries to keep his anger at her betrayal 10 years before but he finds he still cares for her as she does for him. The characters don't really stand up and impress the reader but the secondary characters are quite amusing.All in all a good book.
