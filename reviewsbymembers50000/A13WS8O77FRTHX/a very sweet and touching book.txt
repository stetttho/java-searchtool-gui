 This is a Cinderella story. Which is the reason I bought this book. I love the story of Cinderella. In this book Cinderella is called Sophie. She is the daughter of a Earl & she is reduced to that of servant when her father passes and her stepmother takes over. She has two stepsisters. One just like the mother, cold and unfeeling and the other Posy who is kind but scared to let her feelings be known. They go to a masquerade ball being held by the Lady Brigerton, who is forever trying to get her children married. She has two eligible sons but neither seem very interested in marriage. Benedict the older of the two and the second son is the hero of this tale. Sophie sneaks into the ball and only has until midnight in which to live out all her fantasies. She is imediately spotted by Benedict and he spirits her away to a private terrace. The attraction is imediate and electric. The share a brief kiss but times runs out and before he knows her name she is gone. Two years later after being thrown out of her step mother's house, she is saved by Benedict from a terrible fate. He doesn't realize that she is the dream girl from the ball and is very confused by his strong feelings towards her. They both try and fight their mutual attraction for each other but passion and love win out. I really enjoyed this book and I'm going to go back and read the first two books in this series.
