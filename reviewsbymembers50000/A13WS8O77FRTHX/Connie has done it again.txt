 I have loved everything Connie Mason has wrote. Her books are filled with humor, danger, excitement, passion and love. Her characters have depth and you actually become involved with the story. This is a wonderful tale of danger and scandal. The hero, Gabriel the Marquis of Bathurst has just been robbed at gunpoint by the most intriguing highwayman. He can't get the robbers emerald eyes out of his mind  but when he finds out his highwayman is the Hellion Olivia Fairfax he is thrown for a loop. Olivia has taken to a life of crime in order to survive. She is daring and strong willed but when Gabriel takes her in his arms she finds herself vulnerable. The two almost burn up in each others arms. But there are obsticals standing in the path to thier happiness. Overcoming them is no easy task but one they will embark on together. There are wonderful supporting characters that add to the fun of this book.Also Connie promises that two of these characters will get their own books. I really enjoyed this book and eagerly await her next book.
