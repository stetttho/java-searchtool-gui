 I liked this book. It was a cute  story, and easy read and made me feel good after I'd read it. Its a time travel romance. The heroine, Victoria, and her super rich employer are transported back in time to 13th century England. Her employer has bought a castle in modern times that is falling apart but no matter what they do it can't be fixed. He decides that if he can find an amulet which is said to have been taken from the castle all will be well. He finds a travel agancy that specializes in time travel and away they go. When they get there they are confronted with several things. Victorias boss is taken hostage and she has to find the amulet to free him. She gets some help from a shaggy unclean knight named Percy. Now Percy is really the rightful heir to the castle and wants the stone to right old wrongs and recalim his inheritance. He doesn't want anyone to know who he is so he pretends to be a unkept knight. He offers his services to Victoria and soon finds he is very strongly attracted to her. She is likewise attracted to him but not just time stands in their way of happiness.  This is a funny book that was very easy to read. I plan to read others from this author.
