 This book is wonderful. I laughed so hard that I kept getting strange looks from people. Julie Kenner brings to life a wonderful fantasy about a man and his cat. Nicholas a big time lawyer has a cat named Maggie who he loves. Maggie loves him too but more than just as her owner. She loves him as a woman. So she asks the wise old one eyed tom to make her a woman so that Nicholas will love her back the same way. He grants the wish but there are conditions. She is only a woman at night and turns back into a cat during daylight. Also Nicholas must say he loves her by the end of Halloween in order for her to stay human, otherwise she will revert back to being a cat and remain a cat forever. She agrees and soon finds herself a beautiful woman, a naked woman on Nicholas's doorstep. When he answers the door she pounces on him, literally. He freaks and leaves for his best friends house. Hoop is a great secondary character and so is Deena, Nick's sister, I wished that their had been more to their story but maybe we can get a sequel. The story is very refreshing and makes one really believe that magic does exist. I loved the part about the kitty treats. Definately buy this book and reread it again and again.
