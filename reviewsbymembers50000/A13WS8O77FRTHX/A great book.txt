 Well this is an older book that i had bought years ago and put on my to read shelf and then it got pushed to the back of the pile until recently, I'm very glad I found it. Its a very enjoyable quick read that has you cheering for the hero and heroine at one moment and the crying the next.  This is a a sci-fi/futuristic romance. The story starts off with the heroine, Captian Shaylah Graymist taking a much needed and deserved leave from her post. She is a decorated hero of the Coalition and her reward is Wolf, the hero of the story. Wolf is a slave who is kept in line with the use of a collar that can control his emotions and punish him if her doesn't please her. Wolf is from the planet Trios, a world that the Coalition savagedly destroyed and only a handful of people survived. He is a perfectly shapped man who has been used to pleasure many. and yet is is never allowed to have any pleasure or freedom himself. Shaylah decides to give him his freedom because even though she is part of the Coalition she hates it policies. She must rescue him and together they must fight for his freedom and their growing feelings for each other. This is a both tragic and wonderously amazing tale of two people from different cultures trying to build a new one. I am so please i found this book and I'm looking forward to finding the sequel.
