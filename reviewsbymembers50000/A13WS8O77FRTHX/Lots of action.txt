 Well this is an older book but if you come across it get it and read it. The story is about a young women who is running from her foster home after she was attacked. She comes across Morgan and his partner riding down the Colorado and stowsaway on board one of thier boats. What follows is a fun, exciting trip down the river where they come across Indians, a Mormon settlement, and finally Trish's long lost father. I enjoyed this book and I hope you will too. Its an easy read and made for an enjoyable afternoon.
