 Well this was the first book I've ever read by Christina Dodd. It won't be the last because I did enjoy it but it didn't thrill me. I found it to be humorous in some spots and down right boring in others. I liked the hero and the author really developed him well. The heroine left a lot to be desired. She was a cold fish and even during the love scenes I didn't think she thawed any. I also found this story a bit hard to follow at times. It seemed like the conversation would start and stop at the weirdest times and lines seemed to be out of place. I did like the secondary characters in this book and would be interested in reading future books with their stories. Like I said I enjoyed it but it could have been a lot better
