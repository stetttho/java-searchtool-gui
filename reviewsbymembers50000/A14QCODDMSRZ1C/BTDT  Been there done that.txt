 I have avoided all the ills prescribed by diesel boat sailors by being qualified on one of them before making the transistion to the nuclear boats.  I was one of the guys with holes in his dungarees from the battery acid; an electrician in other words.  The book took me on a journey of remembrance in the 60's. Stories of Admiral Rickover, the description of the smells, living aboard each type, some danger, the comradiere, and the common goals we all had of defending our country.   The book belongs in every serious submarine library as it's the first of the class of books on the subject and probably will be the only one to seriously attempt to write about the change from diesel to nuclear subs.   I wanted to rate the book a 3 because of it's size.  I didn't want it to end. And also because of it reliance and interviews with too many officer types.  But that was being prejudice.  Dan has done a very good job and I appreciate the read.   Ron Martini-www.rontini.com
