 Seldom do I read books about "targets" that submariners call every ship except submarines.  I found myself cheering for a DD in a battle with four subs from an outlaw government trying to prove who was best to rule the seas. My silent exhaltation was soundly rewarded. Technically very accurate, exciting and a true page flipper which will keep you from reading your usual 30 pages and falling asleep.  I am going to use some descriptions to educate my submariner friends into the world of ASW.  Thanks Jeff!
