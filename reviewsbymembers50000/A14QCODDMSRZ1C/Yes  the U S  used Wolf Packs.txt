 A valuable addition to anyone's naval library. Information gleaned from much research by the author. Details of each pack's patrol never seen before.  Also of interest were the many trials and tribulations that Admiral Lockwood faced in getting the proper equipment for his submarines.  The FM Sonar (Hell's Bells) enabled the subs to get into Japan's backyard (Sea of Japan) for the first time.  The first wolf pack there sank some 28 ships and were only able to get into the Sea by using the untested in combat, FM Sonar.   Other details were uncovered by the author such as the Navy's use of a grid system in numbering the areas of the Pacific and the publication of a doctrine for submarine commanders which was a document similar to the German "The U-Boat Commander's Handbook." The terror felt by crew members when undergoing an attack or transversing a minefield was well described by the author as was the real comradship only felt by elite units of the military in times of danger. Humor was added as well to make the book real as were many direct quotes from commanding officers and Admiral Lockwood.   A sure bet and a must have for all historians.
