 "An Insider's Account of the NR-1, the Cold-War's Undercover Nuclear Sub" By Lee Vyborny and Don Davis Published 2003 by New Amerian Library-243 pages/35 Photos Lee Vyborny was an enlisted IC Nuke trained plank owner on this boat and tells an excellent story of the history of the boat, it's early financial appropriation problems and the construction of this very secret boat that was to become Rickover's "toy." It also tells of the training that he received prior to the very long design and construction of this boat that is a legend in the Submarine Service.  From the very first chapter right out of Blind Man's Bluff,  Lee tells the reader stories of the danger posed by the North Atlantic on this small wave swept boat and the harrowing recovery of a bomb from an F-14 and even mentions the nuclear warhead recovery and the search for Israel's lost  boat Dakar in the Mediterranean.  The terror of being trapped and stuck in the mud at great depths makes me wonder why they had any crew who stayed with the boat for any length of time/    From the first commanding officer, LCDR Dwaine Griffith to LCDR Toby Warson,  who I served with in the 60's on the Patrick Henry, to the CO who bravely broached Rickover's reactor start-up procedures. He did this to save their lives.  Right through to the design considerations for the NR-2, I found the book very well written.  Someone mentioned the book was candy to veteran submariners and I concur.   Maybe it was because the book was written by an enlisted person is the reason I found the book really was aimed at my level and so exciting. I was thoroughly disappointed when I neared the end, in that I wanted more and more of this fabulous story.   I rate it a ***** of 5.  The first "submarine" book I have ever rated this high.  The book is chronologically right, militarily correct and contains stories of Admiral Rickover that are new to me.   BZ Lee and Don.
