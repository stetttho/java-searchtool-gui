 Review:   Voyage of the Gray Wolves  by Steven Wilson Paperback 352 pages by Pinnacle Books  It is 1944 and the Battle of the North Atlantic is still as rampant as the winter swells. Hitler, Himmler,  and others have a grand design that will, in their minds, create a turning point to the war.  Their best remaining U-Boat Commander is chosen to lead a squadron of new Type XXI U-Boats against England.    The struggles of this makeshift squadron depleted by the ravages the allies are pouring on Germany make for a great read.  They base is a perpetual cloud covered fiord in Norway which was an abandoned fishing village.    The training, problems with the untested boats, supplies, a decrepid tender, untrained crews,  and the sudden arrival of the SS add a great suspense to the book. Those events and the weapon that they are to use make up most of the very good read.    The story also has the approval of Michael DiMercurio and Joe Buff who are also premier submarine novelists.    The books is available at Amazon.com and other outlets.  Get it, settle in and read a very good story.
