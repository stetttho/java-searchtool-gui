 This book not only contains important historical information and wonderful photographs but also timeless advice, counsel, and encouragement.  Ich  Kmpfe means "I fight."  It is not enough to state, "I believe."   One must  take the oath, "I fight."  Fighting is action; believing is nothing. Ich  Kmpfe contains history of the party from its founding by Karl Harrer,  but  it was nothing until a true man of action, Adolf Hitler, joined.  It  contains the 25-point party platform; statement of will; what the Fhrer  demands of party members; and responsibilities of party members.    Articles include: "Internal and External German Freedom," by Alfred  Rosenberg, "The National Socialist Revolution," by Goebbels, "The  Responsibility of the Political Leader and Standard-bearer," by Robert Ley,  "The National Socialist Way of Life," by Dr. Gross,  "The Responsibilities  of the SA," by Victor Lutz, "The SS," by Himmler, and more.
