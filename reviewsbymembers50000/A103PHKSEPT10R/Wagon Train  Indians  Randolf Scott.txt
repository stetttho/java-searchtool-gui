 Great wagon train epic.  Randolph Scott gets great support from many fine actors including sidekicks Raymond Hatton and Olin Howland.  Fantastic theme song that will stick in your mind for days.  A woman hating scout (Scott) and his two sidekicks lead a wagon train of easterners into Indian country.  Major action scenes, pictures of the majestic wagons, romance, and Monte Blue as a half-breed villain you'll not soon forget.  This is one you'll watch again and again.
