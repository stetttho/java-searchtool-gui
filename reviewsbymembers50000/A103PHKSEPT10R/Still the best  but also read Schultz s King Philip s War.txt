 This is the best and most unbiased history of King Philip's war.  Leach wrote the book; Morrison only wrote the two-page introduction.  Leach tends to be a little "politically correct" but in generally he gives us an unbiased history.  This is an interesting book and I've just finished rereading after a 10-year gap.  It is still interesting.   This was an amazing war between Puritans, who were would poorly equipped in nearly every way, against Indians who would were born and raised in warfare.   For many months the Whites lost virtually all the battles.  King Philips' war was one of desperate sieges of tiny garrisons and ambushes of those Whites trying to rescue those besieged.   Just when you think the Whites are about to get the upper hand, the Indians attack new targets and the Whites are losing again.  The most amazing thing is that the colonists had not one English soldier or ship to help them.  They raised and equipped their own little militia companies.  Unlike some other Indian wars that only had a few battles, this little war had dozens if not hundreds of little battles.   The Indian was as well armed with flintlocks, as was the White.  In this war, the Indian was far superior in tactics and he was never beaten when he could fight his guerrilla style warfare.  This was the Indians' last chance to push the White man into the sea.  Providence (Rhode Island) was nearly destroyed and the Indian raided the towns adjacent to Boston.   Town after town was destroyed.   I think this book is a little superior to Schultz's "King Philip's War," which is a little bit too PC.  But both are well worth reading.
