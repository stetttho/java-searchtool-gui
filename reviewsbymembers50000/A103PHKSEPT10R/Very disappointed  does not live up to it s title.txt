 This is another "postmodernist" history -- one that assumes that the Indians were a spiritual, peace loving, disease free people who communed with nature.   Then came the big bad honkies with their diseases, guns and "total warfare."   Malone takes bits of information and constructs them in is to history.  He finds an obscure record of a White who got in trouble with White authorities for selling a defective gun to an Indian.  Obviously the Indian knew the gun was defective, claims Malone, he was just buying for parts and we can assume he was a technological genius. Worse is that the book gives of very little information on the skulking tactics and technology of the Indians.   For example, the Indian of was a master of deceit and subterfuge but Malone avoids that topic like a plague.   The Puritans won the war because of more men and virtually unlimited supplies, according only to Malone.  Other authors such as Schultz (King Philip's War) and Leach (Flintlock and Tomahawk) tell us that the colonists were short of nearly everything, couldn't get their crops in, and faced starvation.  Certainly the colonists had a larger population but fielded smaller army.  The books by Leach and Schulz remain the only two good recent histories. Researchers can use Malone's book for its references.  And it's worth reading for those taking more than a casual interest in the 1775-1776 King Phillip's War.
