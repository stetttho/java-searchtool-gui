 I've read Prof Butz's book twice and an still amazed that no big publishing house has printed it.  For history to accept an event as true there must be evidence.   Butz shows that there is only limited evidence  of much of the WW2 Jewish "holocaust" story and that much of it  was fabricated or exagerated.
