 I'm not an expert so I can't vouch for the details but only 27 of Germany's heroes  won the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords, and Diamonds.  Their's was a war of skill, courage, and sheer will  against an endless, unremitting tide of the Allies' personnel and  machinery. All 27 are covered in Knights: Panzer commanders, U-boat  captains, combat generals, Hans Rudel (the Stuka pilot), and fighter  pilots.  Fighter pilots included Adolf Galland, Werner Mlders, Gordon  Gollob, Hermann Graf (200 kills in 13 months), Erich Hartmann (353 kills in  30 months), and Heinz Wolfgang Schnaufer.  Called the "Night Ghost" by the  British bomber crews, Schnaufer shot down 4 bombers a night for 5  consecutive nights and once destroyed 5 bombers in 14  minutes. Hans-Joachim Marseille was known by his friends as the "Southern  Star."  This lone fighter preferred to attack an entire squadron of  Spitfires (at least 5) with his single aircraft.   He never completed a  sortie without a kill and often got all five enemies.  The British had  standing orders not to engage the wild but chivalrous warrior they called  the "Eagle of Africa."  He died in a 1942 aircraft accident with 158 kills.   He was 22. 	 Knights of the Reich is truly an exhilarating and  inspiring book that tells of war time heroics and the sad tale of the  heroes treatment by their cruel victors.
