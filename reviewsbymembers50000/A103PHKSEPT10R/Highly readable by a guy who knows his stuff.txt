 This book is for the man who thinks he might find it necessary some day to jam police or other radio systems.  It is not overly technical or lacking technical details.  In fact, it reads more like a combination of a how to book and a military manual. Some technical information is necessary.  For example, if you don't know what an oscillator is or what it does in a receiver or transmitter, you could not hope to be an effective and hidden jammer. I enjoyed the book very much and consider it readable, interesting, and knowledgeable.  In fact, although I read it strait through in a few nights, I'm keeping it for a reference.
