 Don't let the liberals steer you away from this great and provocative book.  The establishment that believes in open borders, massive non-White immigration, and the inherent equality of all races and ethnic groups hates  this book.  Georgie Ann Geyer defends her America like a White lioness  defending her cubs against an attack of savage hyenas.  It's also very  interesting and well written.  Oh course, we would expect that from this  author.
