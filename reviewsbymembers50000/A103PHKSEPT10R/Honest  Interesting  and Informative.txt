 There have been dozens of poorly researched books written about the White nationalist movement in America, and "White Power, White Pride!" is the only exception.  The other books are not objective and they just  repeat the semi-truths and outright falsehoods that circulate in the  controlled news media rather than doing original research, which is what  Dobratz and Shanks-Meile did. This book is primarily descriptive.  It  tells the history of the "movement" and describes today's major  groups and leaders, who they are, what they believe, and what they do.  The  authors give an unbiased account of the FBI's and AFT's wars against Whites  --  Gordon Kahl, Ruby Ridge, and Bob Matthew's Silent Brotherhood -- as  well as the FBI's illegal and underhanded war against the Klan and other  White groups.   It does have a few dry parts where these two professors  describe how the movement fits into Sociology's theories.  Dobratz and  Shanks-Meile don't seem to understand that the White movement is a  biological struggle for survival and not a sociological movement.    Nevertheless (from my perspective as someone in the  "movement"), I highly recommend this book to anyone who is  interested in the White movement.  There is a wealth of interesting  material in here for journalists, and no newsroom should be without a copy.
