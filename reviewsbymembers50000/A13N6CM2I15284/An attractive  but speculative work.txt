 Colin Tudge surmises that, in many cases, late paleolithic hunter-gatherers (maybe from about 40.000 B.P. on) already practised "proto-agricultural" techniques, that enabled them to manipulate the ecosystem they were living in, so that its productivity was increased. Quite a few recent hunter-gatherer people knew such practices (Australian aborigines, for instance, who never developed agriculture, used practises like burning brush land in order to make place for a vegetation in which more useful plants could grow, protecting trees bearing usefull fruits and enhancing their growth by selectively cutting down competiting trees, putting back into the earth the vegetative upper part of an excavated tuber so that a new tuber can grow at the same spot, etc.), so the author's assumption is anything but unlikely. "Real" agriculture, when it did start from about 10.000 B.P. on, was thus less a "revolutionary invention" than an intensification and extension of already existing practices. The problem is, as the author himself aknowledges, that these "proto-agricultural" techniques almost never leave any traces that the archeologist of today could identify without ambiguity. His assertion is therefore of a rather speculative nature. Nevertheless, the book is an eye-opener. We should not exclude the possibility that our late paeolithic ancestors used more sophisticated food producing techniques than is usually thought, simply because these techniques did not leave any traces in the archeological record. The booklet is well written and very short. You could read it in about two hours.
