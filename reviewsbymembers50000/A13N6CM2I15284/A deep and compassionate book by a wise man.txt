 When learning economics at university I had "Economics" by Samuelson as a handbook. I learned a lot from it and I still consider it as perhaps the best available introduction into classical economics. On its own ground,  this book can hardly be surpassed. But, as many others, I have come to the  conclusion that the classical paradigm of economics, which this book  reflects, has serious shortcomings. Samuelson fleetingly points out some of  them, but he does not pay much attention to this aspect. Of course, there  exists an abundant literature by less orthodox economists in which these  questions are discussed at length. Unfortunately, much of this literature  is rather unbalanced. Recently I discovered "Development as Freedom" by  Amartya Sen. Finally I found a book that offers a balanced philosophical  reflexion on the premises of classical economics and its relevance for the  development problem. Mr. Sen asks questions rarely asked by economist.  What purpose does the acquisition of wealth serve? Mr. Sen argues that dire  poverty makes people unfree. Wealth is a means to freedom. From that  perspective he draws very interesting conclusions concerning development  policy. Classical economics can be a useful tool in understanding  society. Samuelson's book is an excellent introduction into this  discipline. But in order to put the classical paradigm in perspective, you  should also read "Development as Freedom" by Mr. Sen. It  is a deep and  compassionate book by a wise man.
