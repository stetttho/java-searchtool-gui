 In the Soviet period the thriller genre languished in Russia. Since the fall of communism it has blossomed. The "queen of the Russian crime novel" is undoubtedly Polina Dashkova. Her novel "A place under the sun" is quite a good thriller. A 33 year old casino owner is killed just when he returns home at night, falling into the arms of his wife, a  famous ballerina. Who did it? Plenty of people would have a motive. Some dubious "businessmeny" would like to take over his casino. Gleb Kalashinikov was a hard drinker and notorious womanizer. He did not lack ennemies. The plot is quite good, but even better are the pictures of the lifes of people in all stations of life in modern Russia, from the high living and adulterous new rich, to the destitute hoboes. I can recommend reading this novel. Apparently it has not been translated into English yet, which is quite a pity.
