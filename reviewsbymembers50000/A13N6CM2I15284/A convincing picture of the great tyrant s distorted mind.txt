 Robert Waite approaches his subject, the distorted mind of Adolf Hitler with all its historic consequences, from two directions. Firstly, he gives a revealing picture of the murky side of German culture that flourished since German unification in 1870: the baleful complex of hyper-nationalism, pan-germanism and anti-semitism. Secondly, he gives a psychiatric analysis of the mind of Adolf Hitler.  Even if the author does not succeed in substantiating every detail of this analysis, much of it is convincing. Particularly elucidating is the suggestion that the reason why Hitler frenetically tried to surpass everyone else in his anti-semitism was that he felt the need to suppress in his own mind the lingering suspicion (unsupportable for many people in Austrian society at that time) that he himself might be partly Jewish (for a quarter of his genes).  Waite finds convincing evidence that Adolf Hitler's grandmother, Mrs. Anna Schicklgruber, who later was to marry a certain Mr. Hitler, conceived her son, Alois (Adolf Hitler's father), while she was serving as a maid in the household of a Jewish medical doctor, Mr. Frankenberger, who might have been the father of her child. In fact, Mr. Frankenberger in subsequent years was paying money to Mrs. Schicklgruber. The child was eventually to be "posthumously recognized" by Mrs. Schicklgruber's deceased husband (or rather his brother) and thus got the family name "Hitler". His son Adolf seems to have been aware of this part of the family history. This is a very useful book for those wanting to acquire a deeper understanding of the mind that was to a large degree responsible for the monstruous derailment of German history in the period 1933-1945.
