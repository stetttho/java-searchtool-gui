 On the one hand this is a very interesting book. It gives a deft synopsis of what has been going on in the fields of evolutionary and mind sciences in the outgoing two decades. Horgan provides a lot of information about the  persons who play an outstanding role in these fields. As such, the book is  valuable. He also warns for too much gullibilty in accepting the claims  made by scientists who present new insights, which is a usefull  exercise. But on the other hand, even more than in his earlier book  "The end of science", Horgan can be outrageously negative. He  does not like mind science. He does not like evolutionary biology. At  times, his scepticism grows really malignant, when he deliberately  selectively cites authorities in order to discredit their theories.  Personnally, I prefer the enthousiasm of Tooby and Cosmides, Gerald  Edelman, Daniel Dennet and Steven Pinker to this negative nagging about  what really are very interesting theories. Of course there is a certain  danger that such enthousiasts get carried away by their pet theories, but I  prefer these "trumpeteers of the new time" to this  "nattering nabob of negativism". Always yelling that the emperor  has  no clothes, is rather cheap.
