 This book is a collection of letters by Raden KARTINI, the daughter of a rather enlightened Javanese nobleman, who allowed his daughters some school education. At the beginning of the 20th century this was quite exceptional  in a native society where the overwhelming majority of even the male  population was illiterate and where an educated woman was considered to be  something inconceivable. The young Kartini had some acquaintance with a few  enlightened Dutch people, who appreciated her thirst for education and  provided her with some books, thereby enabling her to acquire a good  knowledge of western civilisation. Kartini had a lively correspondence with  these persons, which were rather unrepresentative of the average colonial  white people. Her letters have later been edited as this book, whose  original Dutch title should be translated as "Through Darkness to  Light". The letters were written in Dutch, a language of which Kartini  had a good command and which was at the time the only vehicle for higher  education in Indonesia. In her letters, Kartini stressed that education  is a precious good, also from a moral point of view, to which every person,  women included, is entitled. Her book is a cry for liberation of women from  the cultural bondage to which they were condemned in traditional Javanese  society. Kartini is considered to be a torchbearer for progressive ideas  and education by Indonesian nationalists and feminists. While recognizing  that the Javanese had a lot to learn from the progressive side of western  culture, she was of course critical of the coarse, materialistic side of  it, which predominated in colonial society. Unfortunately, Kartini died at  the age of 25, giving birth to her first child. This is a very  interesting book for those interested in the impact of western thought on  indiginous people or the emnacipation of women. It is obligatory reading  for anyone interested in the history of Indonesia during the colonial  period.
