 The persons critizing Dennet for "denying" the phenomenon he claims to "explain", apparently fail to understand his theory. Dennet does not deny that "consciousness" exists, he only claims  to show that it is nothing more than the accompanying effect of a lot of  complicated neural activity. I think his claim is valid, but I understand a  lot of people will be uneasy with this conclusion.  Sometimes Dennet  provokes his opponents somewhat more than necessary. If he argues that  "qualia" (the subjective impressions of our sensory perceptions)  do not really exist, it is possible he goes a step too far. He might be  more persuasive if he recognized more explicitly the existence of two  aspects of reality: the material world with its neurons, molecules, quarks,  etc. on the one hand, and the "qualosphere", i.e. our subjective  world with all its "qualia", on the other hand.  I grant that  this second world is derived from the physical world. However, in our  "human condition", we human beings live in this  "qualosphere" and not in the world of molecules and quarks. This  explains the emotional resistance many people put up against Dennet's  theory. Dennet's critcism of John Edelman seems a bit too harsh to me.  Edelman's research on neural networks might contribute some day to a more  profound insight in the neural processes that are at the base of our mental  processes. Dennet's modell of consciousness will acquire a more solid  foundation once we know more about this. I think he is a bit too dismissive  of people who concentrate their attention on this aspect. But, of course,  "Consciousness Explained" is one of the  great books of this  century. R. Holsbergen Luxembourg
