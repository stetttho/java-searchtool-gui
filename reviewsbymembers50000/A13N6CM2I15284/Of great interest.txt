 More than a  quarter of a century ago, Edelman was distinguished with a Nobel Price for his research on the immunity system. Later he switched to neurology. He sees a parallel between the way the immunity system is  programmed and the way the brain is programmed. These procedures have much  in common with Darwins process of evolution by way of natural selection.  Edelman speaks of "neural Darwinism".  When you just think  about it, after reading the arguments Edelman brings forward, you will see  that evolution could hardly have produced something as complex as the human  brain (or even more simple animal brains) by any other means. A lot has to  be investigated yet, of course, but I think Edelman has shown the way to a  deeper understanding of our brain. It is a pity Edelman and Daniel Dennet  get along so badly. Edelman never mentions Dennet, and Dennet is extremely  critical in the few remarks he makes about Edelmans work. I think their  approaches are complementary, not contradictory.  Yes, the human brain is  a computer of sorts. Edelman has the clearest ideas about the structure of  this computer, but he denies that the metaphor of the computer is valid. I  think that, even taking Edelmans ideas about the deeper structure in  account, the metaphor remains valid, up to a point at least. Really,  Edelman has much more in common with Dennet (whom he seems to despise) than  with the "mysterian" Searle, whom he praises.
