 I have to admit that when I first saw the previews on ABC, I wasn't quite convinced, despite being a big fan of the spy genre. But the first time I saw it, I was blown away. I couldn't believe that something this good was on network television (let alone on ABC, which at the time was notorious for its bad hits:misses ratio). The plots were absolute genius, and I'd (very loudly) curse at the television every time an episode ended. It didn't just have me at the edge of my seat. It had me on the floor! In the back of my head I always knew that Syd would pull through. But how would she escape this time? Tune in next week!  Except now you don't have to wait seven agonizing days to find out, since it's all at your fingertips on DVD. (Or you can deliberately wait a week between viewings for a truly authentic nail-biting experience. Up to you naturally.) Even if you're one of the Alias faithful whose seen each and every episode on its original airdate, it's worth another run through. You'll probably catch all sorts of stuff you missed the first time around--the plots are as thick as a good milkshake, and it continues to amaze me how much stuff the writers could cram into a single episode. And best of all, you'll get the absolute best picture and sound quality. It's quite a different experience seeing it in widescreen, especially if you've grown accustomed to over-the-air analog. And of course there are the special features, the many different peeks behind the curtain. You'll get lots of answers to your how-did-they-do-that questions in the behind-the-scenes featurettes, cast and crew insights from the audio commentaries, and quite a few good laughs from the gag reel.  If you're an Alias fan and don't have this yet, what are you waiting for? On the other hand, if you haven't seen so much as a minute of this show's crazy costume-changing, ass-kicking, and double-crossing, you owe it to yourself to check it out.
