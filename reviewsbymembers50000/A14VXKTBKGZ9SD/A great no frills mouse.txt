 I personally like the more full-featured Microsoft IntelliMouse Optical, but if you don't really need all the buttons and still want the benefits of optical technology (enhanced precision, no rollers to clean, etc.), it's hard to go wrong with this. Installation couldn't be simpler--just plug it in and go, and not just with Windows.  The equivalent Logitech Wheel Mouse Optical has all the same features, but is more expensive (here on Amazon at the time of this writing) and not as comfortable after hours of use. And you could easily go for a cheap knock-off, but I've gone through way too many cheap mice in my day. Pay a little extra up-front for quality--this mouse won't let you down.
