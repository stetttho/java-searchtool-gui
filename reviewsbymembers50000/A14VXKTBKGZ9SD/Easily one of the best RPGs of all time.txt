 I bought Morrowind GOTY on a whim, and I don't regret it. I was blown away by the size and depth of the game world. You could easily spend half a day just playing side quests, working your way up the ranks of the dozen or so guilds and organizations and not even touching the main quest in the process. Basically you have near-total freedom--go where you want to go, do what you want to do. You can even download new user-created adventures and addons (or make one of your own with the included Elder Scrolls Construction Set) to enhance your experience. A very active custom content community churns out countless new clothing items, quests, and even better bodies. (Check out psychodogstudios.net for more information about that.)  This flexibility extends to character creation as well. There are plenty of races to choose from, each with their advantages and disadvantages. A variety of predefined classes are provided, but they make it easy for you to define a fully custom class if you so desire. Character development doesn't end at creation; as you progress through the game, you get better at the skills you use the most. The more you use your trusty longsword, the more effective your kills. The more you sneak around, the better your chances become of passing through undetected.  And the graphics--wow! You're given the choice of first- or third-person perspective, all the better for immersing you in the many detailed, lush environments. You really have to see it to believe it. Controls are a little complex, but given the scope of the game, I more or less expect that. And once you're used to it, you don't even think about it.  The only thing that would make this absolutely perfect would be a multiplayer component of some sort. But the single-player experience is so comprehensive that I can't really complain. In short, this game is bound to be a classic and should have a place in your collection.
