 Unfortunately, there is no single memory card standard for digital photography. But readers like this make it easy to work with all the major (and not-so-major) card formats in use today. I have yet to come across a card that I can't use with this reader.  It's recognized straight-up in Windows 2000 or XP, no driver install necessary. Anything older (like Windows 98 or Me) will probably require a driver install. It will show up as four different drives in Windows Explorer--one for each slot.  Mac OS X (10.3 and higher) will recognize it straight-up too, and it works great with iPhoto and Aperture.  Like anything else, it takes a little fiddling to get this to work with Linux. But if you've got usb-storage support set up (either in the kernel or as a module), you're already halfway there.  There's no need for a bulky power adapter. All you need to do is plug the reader into an available USB port. A USB 2.0 port is preferable, but if you're stuck with the older and slower USB 1.1, it will still work.  My only complaint is the power indicator light. It's a very bright orange and can be very distracting. Other than that, it's just about perfect.  If you're serious about digital photography, a memory card reader is a must-have. And this is easily one of the best out there.
