 I bought the Gravis GamePad Pro for use with a PlayStation emulator, since the layout is very similar to the older non-analog controllers. If you're thinking about buying this contoller for the same reason, consider the following before purchase:  1. It's lighter than the real thing, feather-light in fact. This doesn't bother me much, but I know that some people like the feel of something solid in their hands.  2. The D-pad is a little mushy, a criticism I see echoed in the other reviews here. If Gravis ever decides to revise this design, this is the first thing they should look into, because it can be a deal-breaker for some people (and the primary reason why I knocked one star from this review).  3. No analog sticks. If you really want analog sticks, you're better off buying a real Dual Shock controller and a USB converter.  All that said, I found it to be a worthy purchase. It's truly plug-and-play. Windows XP detected and configured it immediately. Worked just as well in Linux; it uses the joydev kernel module. You should have no problems hooking up a second one if you're cooking up some head-to-head action. It just works.  A word of warning: if your hands begin to hurt after extended use, that may not be the controller's fault. As with any input device, you're prone to developing a repetitive stress injury if you use this for extended periods of time without resting. Please take my word for it--I have carpal-tunnel and learned this lesson the hard way!
