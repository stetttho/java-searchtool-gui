 It's a pity and a shame that Microsoft discontinued this keyboard. Their newer keyboards look nice, but they're a little too flashy for me, and I'm not a big fan of the new keyboard layout. If you're looking for the functionality of these newer MS keyboards but with less of the nonsense, this is definitely the way to go. It sports a not-likely-to-offend beige finish and the old-school 104 key layout. Even has a built-in two-port USB hub, the perfect place to plug your USB mouse and game pad. (It's not a powered hub, so don't try plugging in things like printers and hard drives.)  The lower-end Internet Keyboard has 10 additional keys; this thing sports 19. Use them as marked for one-touch access to web browser and media player functionality, or reprogram them to your heart's content. The pain-free driver install and configuration makes this a cinch. And key response is just about perfect; if you don't already know how to touch-type, learn it, and you'll appreciate this even more.  If you can find it, get it. It's more than worth the time and effort.
