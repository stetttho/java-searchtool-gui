 This scanner is a pretty solid piece of hardware. It's downright snappy (fast using USB 1.1, blazing using USB 2.0) and yields very high-quality images. It's not a suitable replacement for a dedicated negative/slide scanner if you do that sort of work often, but the included adapters can do the job in a pinch.  I knocked off a star because of the included software. If all you want to do is acquire images for use in Photoshop (or your image editor of choice), the Epson Scan software works well enough. Outside of that, it's a mixed bag. The third-party apps work well enough, but they have this "tossed in" feel about them since they don't look or feel anything like the stuff that Epson provides directly. But that might not be such a bad thing, since Epson's stuff is a little flaky. The copy utility could use a bit of work. For example, instead of giving me an alert politely reminding me to turn on my printer, it locked up my scanner until I restarted my computer. And when I finally remembered to turn on my printer the next time around, the output was garbage, completely useless. Of course I'm on Windows. Maybe the story would be different on the Mac side of the fence, but I wouldn't know (though I'd like to eventually).  While we're on the subject of operating system support, I should mention that if you are a Linux user (or the user of any UNIX-like OS, except Mac OS X), you're likely going to have compatibility problems. It's not natively supported by the SANE backend. There's a driver made by EPSON KOWA (search on Google for more information), but good luck getting it to compile.  In a nutshell...  Pros: fast, good-looking, well-built piece of hardware that can handle almost anything you throw at it.  Cons: the software is not worthy of the scanner that it supports.
