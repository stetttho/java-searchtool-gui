 On the surface it's lots of sexy outfits, gadgets, and guns, the hat-tip to the Bond legacy. But there's quite a bit more to Alias than that.  When season one drew to a close, I thought to myself, "How are they going to top this?" And so they introduced Irina Derevko, Sydney's mother, a pitch-perfect performance by Lena Olin (and sadly, one that only lasted the duration of this season). The added family angle added even more depth and intrigue to a show already neck-deep in it. The demise of SD-6 and The Alliance halfway through the season turns the Alias world upside-down, and we see relationships tested and characters pushed to their limits (Will and Dixon immediately spring to mind). I doubt you'll find such excellent ensemble acting elsewhere on network TV (outside The West Wing or 24, anyway). Even characters outside the core cast stand out. I'm sure you'll grow to love David Anders as the enigmatic Mr. Sark and Terry O'Quinn (currently playing Locke in Lost, another J.J. Abrams masterpiece) as hard-nosed Assistant Director Kendall. Then there are some wonderful guest appearances by Ethan Hawke and Christian Slater, among others.  I'm frantically scrambling for the right words to finish this review, but I am forced to conclude that the experience is indescribable. See it, believe it, come back for season three.
