 If you have a digital camera that uses CompactFlash memory cards, this is a must-have accessory. Instead of plugging in your camera directly and draining precious battery life, simply take the CF card from the camera and put it in one of these. Use that battery life to shoot more pictures! If you're using Windows 2000 or XP (I can't comment on Mac compatibility, not having tried it myself), it will be detected and configured automatically. No need to install any special software either; just use it like any other disk. Oh, and even if your system doesn't have USB 2.0 ports--mine doesn't, unfortunately--it will still work with older USB 1.1 ports. Just be prepared to wait slightly longer for transfers.  Oh, and if you take the reader and a CF card with you (it's small enough to pocket quickly), it makes for quick, easy, high-capacity portable storage.  Update: I've also had a chance to test this in Linux, and it works perfectly there. Just make sure to compile USB Mass Storage Support into your kernel or as a module.
