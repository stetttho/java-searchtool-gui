 Lots of die-hard Alias fans tend not to like season three as much as the previous two. According to an interview, even J.J. Abrams himself felt the show drifting, which motivated him to get it "back on track" for season four. Nevertheless there are quite a few gems, proverbial diamonds in the rough. And you have to hand it to them for taking some pretty substantial risks, including the introduction of Lauren Reed, a character so reviled in some circles that it was practically obscene. (Thankfully, most were willing to separate the character from the actress. Melissa George did quite well as Lauren, but she happened to be written in between Sydney and Vaughn. Not a fun job being put between one of TV's hottest couples.) Then there was the whole two-year amnesia bit--really out there, but you bought it anyway.  But that's the charm of the show, I think. No matter how ridiculous it gets--come on, the whole Rambaldi thing is as out there as any plot device gets, no pun intended--but you can't help but come back for more. And really, season three's greatest failing is that it had to live up to the seasons that came before it. With the departure of Merrin Dungey, Bradley Cooper, and most notably Lena Olin, it was as if an entire part of Sydney's life had dropped out of frame. I have to admit that I didn't warm to Will initially, but it was great to see him when he made his guest appearance. And the rest of the cast continued to give stellar performances, Victor Garber and Michael Vartan especially. And you can't help but love the guest appearances by Quentin Tarantino (reprising his season one guest role as McKenas Cole), Vivica A. Fox, David Carradine, Peggy Lipton, Justin Theroux...the list goes on.  So maybe season three wasn't the strongest, but it's still a hell of a contender. And it sets the stage for a reworked, re-energized season four.
