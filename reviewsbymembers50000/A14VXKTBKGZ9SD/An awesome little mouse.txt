 The trackpad on my parents' laptop began to exhibit sensitivity issues, so they picked up one of these little mice. I've had battery-life issues with other wireless mice, and I didn't think that a mouse so small would be comfortable enough for extended use.  Thankfully, Microsoft addressed my concerns. First, the wireless receiver snaps neatly into the base of the mouse when not in use, shutting off the sensor (and making for a neat portable package). Not quite a proper on/off switch, but an ingenious idea nevertheless. My full-size IntelliMouse Optical is still a better fit, but given the size, I can't complain. It felt fine in my medium-sized hand. I suppose it would be a little awkward if you have larger hands, but not totally unusable. And of course you get all the benefits of optical technology. The sensor is a little off-center, but this doesn't seem to affect accuracy at all.  Anyway, I picked one up for myself. If you're a laptop user in need of a pointing device less awkward or problematic than the built-in track pad or "eraser head" pointer, you should too.
