 I'm not a big Microsoft fan in general, but I can't stop saying good things about their mice and keyboards. This is no exception. It's not shiny or colorful, but none of that matters to me. It's solid and fits my hand like a glove. The scroll wheel is neither too tight nor too loose, making for near-effortless long document scrolling. All five buttons (the wheel itself counts as a button) have a definite audible and tactile click. The optical sensor lives up to the hype. Low- to no-maintenance (sometimes dirt accumulates on the surface, but this in no way affects performance), and you'll appreciate the tactical edge when playing "twitch" games like first-person shooters or touching up pictures in Photoshop.  Installation is a no-brainer. Just plug it in and go. If you want  to program the side buttons, the IntelliMouse software install is relatively painless, and configuration is a snap. If only Windows as a whole was like that!
