 Bioware is perhaps one of the best (if not the best) RPG creators in the world, something you already know if you've ever played any of the Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, or Neverwinter Nights titles. When I heard that they were going to do a Star Wars game, I knew immediately that it would be a winner. And indeed it is--it's a cut above the prequels that make us long-time Star Wars cringe, with their flimsy plots, flimsier dialogue, and CG overkill. (And yet we still queue up for midnight showings, sporting cloaks and lightsabers, stubbornly hoping for better. I'll see y'all in May.)  But I digress. You don't have to be a veteran RPG player or a crazy Star Wars devotee to appreciate this game. The graphics are quite good in my opinion, and gameplay rarely lagged or stuttered on my rapidly aging, circa 2000 machine. The voice acting work is nothing short of incredible--all the dialogue in the game is spoken, much of it by professional actors! You might even grow a little attached to your traveling companions. Best of all, it's two games in one, the outcome depending on whether you adhere to the light or dark side of the Force. And the controls are quite easy to learn. Once you've got the basics down, you'll be wielding that lightsaber like Obi-Wan or Darth Maul. Yes, you can have a double-bladed saber if you'd like. Or one in each hand. Or do your best Han Solo or Boba Fett and have at it with blaster pistols (not a recommended course of action later in the game, since higher-level Jedi/Sith are very good at blast deflection). It's up to you!  It's great as an RPG, a more than worthy addition to the Star Wars franchise, and perhaps one of the best computer games of all time. Just get it!
