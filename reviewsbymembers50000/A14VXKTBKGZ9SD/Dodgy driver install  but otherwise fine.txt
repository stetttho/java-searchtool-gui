 Several people have noted that Windows XP does not detect this card automatically. This is true. The trick is to install the latest drivers (from the web, not the CD), then insert the card. Of course this might be a chicken-and-egg kind of problem, since you need to have access to the web before you can install the card. I downloaded the driver on my Ethernet-connected desktop, burned it to CD, then installed it on my laptop. Then (and this is very important), I told the driver install program to let Windows manage my wireless networking. The built-in Windows XP wireless utilities work much better than the Netgear ones, especially if you have Service Pack 2.  Once everything's set up, the card works great, and drop-outs are usually attributable to the router or access point, not the card itself. Netgear just needs to write better drivers. Three-and-a-half stars overall, but Amazon doesn't let me assign half stars.
