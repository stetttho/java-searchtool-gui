 Sure, there are cheaper keyboards out there. But for a little more cash, you can get a lot more keyboard. Microsoft's software could use some work (to say the least), but its hardware is top-notch. This may be their "value" offering, but they haven't skimped on quality. Keys are well-marked, not likely to smudge, and the excellent key response makes touch-typing a breeze. The layout's more traditional too, not the odd one featured on higher-end models. Having only 10 utility keys may seem constricting until you consider that they can be completely and easily reprogrammed.  About the only thing this is missing is a USB connection, so you can't use this with a Mac or a PC that lacks so-called "legacy" ports. Most consumer-level desktops haven't done away with them yet, so you probably don't need to worry. But that's a very minor quibble. If you're on a relatively tight budget but want a keyboard that'll last, look no further. (On the other hand, if you're looking for something a little beefier, seek out its discontinued sibling, the Internet Keyboard Pro.)
