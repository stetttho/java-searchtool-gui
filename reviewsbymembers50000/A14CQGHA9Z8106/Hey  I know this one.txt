 I acutally first spotted this CD at Wal-Mart and picked it up to see what was on it.  I saw Alpha and Omega, and had to buy it.  That song was a favorite of mine long ago, and listening to it again reminded me why I loved it.  Bill Gaither has long had the talent for arranging voices in such a way that everyone sounds their best.   As I listened to the rest of the songs on this CD, I found myself repeatedly saying, I know this song.  There were many songs on here that I had forgotten about, but remembered distinctly once I heard them again because of hearing them long ago on the radio.  One of these refound favorites is Blessed Messiah, back when Larnelle Harris sang with the Vocal Band.  And yes, it is Larnelle, not a remake.  Unfortunately, that's the downside of this CD.  Since the originals used to make this CD are so old, the sound quality of the CD is not so great.  There are also a few songs that are most definitely cheesy, but hey, so were the 80's.   In my opinion, if you've been a Gaither fan for some time, this is definitely the way to get a bunch of the old favorites together in one CD (since you may very well have them sitting around somewhere on 8-tracks).  It's worth enduring the goofy songs (When the Angels Rejoice... woo) in order to get the old favorites.
