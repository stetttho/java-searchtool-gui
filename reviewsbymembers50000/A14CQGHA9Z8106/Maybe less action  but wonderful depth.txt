 Though The Indwelling may not come across as spell-binding as book #6, Assassins, I personally think LaHaye and Jenkins did an incredible job making this book as the most real and powerful yet in the series. In the  previous books, it is typical to find a lot of action, but things still  seem to follow a typical path in writing popular fiction.  In The  Indwelling, we meet the characters in a whole new way.  Rather than being  perfect little beings who always have the correct answer to every problem,  we see Rayford in a striking moment of humility as he realizes he needs to  come before God in repentance.  We see Tsion dealing with uncertainty  regarding prayer and spiritual manifestations occuring in the last days.   Chloe struggles with desiring to protect her son at all costs. What makes  these scenes so powerful is the stark honesty in which they are written.   It is as though the reader can feel the emotions along with the characters.    Some may feel disappointed that this book seems slightly different from  the other six in the series thus far.  In my opinion, it is this  difference- this deliberate, open window into the hearts and minds of the  characters, which makes it so excellent.
