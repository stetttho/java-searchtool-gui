 I admit it, I can't get enough of Mark Lowry's talent, both in his comedy and in his music.  His sense of humor can be just side-splitting at times, even when listening to a song or routine of his for the second, fifth, or twentieth time.  What amazes me every time though, is Mark's incredible ability to retain the full message of the Gospel in everything he does.  His role as a comedian does not put any kind of compromise on his determination to send a clear message of the Savior who lived and died so that we can be free.  The songs included in this CD demonstrate both of these strengths.  There are some of Mark's goofy songs- First Class, Wrong Flight and Hyperactivity; and there are also serious songs- If Your Heart Belongs to Jesus, What A Savior He Is, Rest in the Arms.  Two of my favorites are Mary Did You Know?- a deeply moving series of questions looking at the intensity of the role the mother of God had to play; and This Too Shall Pass- a song speaking of a quiet peace and trust in God that every difficulty and hardship must come to an end some time.  If you're looking for good Christian music to make you both smile and think, here's the CD for you.
