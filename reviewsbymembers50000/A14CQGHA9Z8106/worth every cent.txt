 This CD is by far one of the most incredible that I have heard so far.  Not only is the music well done, but the lyrics are far superior to even some of the popular Christian music out today.  There is a depth to the  theology that isn't commonly seen.  I highly reccommend this CD to anyone  looking for music that will speak to them, in addition to being  entertaining.
