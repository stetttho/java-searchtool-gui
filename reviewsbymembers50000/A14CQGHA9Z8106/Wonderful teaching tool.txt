 I can remember going to church camp as a teenager and hearing the director read this book aloud to the campers.  Still today, hearing her read about the Wemmicks and the Song of the King are among my favorite memories from camp.  Now that I've returned to camp as a counselor, I'll be bringing this book along with me to read to the kids.  The stories paint word pictures that come to life as they are read.  (And if that isn't enough, the illustrations in the book are outstanding.)  More than that, these stories are specifically intended to open up conversation about the subjects they deal with.  The lessons taught through the stories are ones that will stick with the kids--and the adults too.  I've already bought two copies of this book, one for myself and one for a friend teaching at a Christian elementary school.  If you're looking to instill godly lessons into young children, I doubt if you'll find a more useful, excellent book.
