 Okay, so maybe Michael W. Smith isn't quite on the same level as John Williams, but I enjoyed listening to this music just as much.  A few years ago I went to hear Amy Grant, Michael W. Smith, and CeCe Winnans in a Christmas concert.  I was impressed with the quality of the music there, especially when Michael would play the piano, either solo or along with the orchestra.  This CD reminded me of being there in that arena, just thoroughly enjoying every moment of the music.  Here there can be do doubt of Smitty's incredible talent as a musician, as he carefully crafts each piece to bring out the emotions he must have felt while writing it.  If you enjoy the music of others such as Jerry Goldsmith or John Williams, give this a try- it's worth the money.
