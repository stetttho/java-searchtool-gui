 It was worth reading the first five books of the Left Behind series just to get to this one.  Unlike Nicolae, where I felt the action really started to lag, Assassins kept me turning the pages as fast as I could.  The  cliff-hanger at the end is what really clinches the novel and gets you  running for the next book-- who killed Nicolae?
