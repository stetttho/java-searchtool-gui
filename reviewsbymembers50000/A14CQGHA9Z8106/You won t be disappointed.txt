 If, as I did, you came to this book through the popularity of Jerry Jenkins's co-writing of the Left Behind series, don't worry- you're in for more of the same excellent and captivating writing that has made the LB  books soar.  This book is open and honest, cutting through the glossy  finish many books have simply to make a profit.  It is very real, and  reaches to the heart of the reader.  Life is presented as is, with the same  responses each of us would have in the situations the main character  endures.  By the end of the story, the reader has been drawn into a deeper  understanding of what it means to live totally and completely for Christ.
