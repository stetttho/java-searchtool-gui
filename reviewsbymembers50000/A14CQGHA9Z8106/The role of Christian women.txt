 This book started out a little slow, but once I got into it I couldn't put  it down.  Through the telling of the lives of these four generations of  women, Austin masterfully creates a complex drama that not only entertains  but teaches as well.  As each of these women in the book must learn how to  deal with the struggles they face in life, they also learn what it means to  be a godly wife.  Just as with Adam and Eve, these women learn how- even  though difficult at times- they must trust God and follow their husband's  leadership.   Another book I enjoyed which is similar to this one is  Jerry B. Jenkins (co-author of the Left Behind series) book, "Though  None Go With Me."  His style of writing is somewhat similar to that of  this book.
