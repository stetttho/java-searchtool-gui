 Don't get me wrong.  I agreed with everything Diane Passno had to say in this book.  But as a Christian who already believes that current feminism is in no way compatable with Biblical living and that abortion is one of the greatest evils of the United States, I can't say that this book was very strong on persuasiveness or new material.  More of the writing was based on personal opinion rather than on studies or research to support Passno's viewpoint.   I think that if others like myself read this book, they may very well enjoy it because it rings true with what they already believe.  But as far as persuading someone who disagrees on these issues, or providing arguments for Passno's supporters to use against the divergent viewpoints, I thought this book could have been made stronger.  It was good, but certainly had room to be better.
