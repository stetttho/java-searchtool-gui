 These three pastors have both the vocal talent as well as the audible sincerity of faith that make this worship album simply outstanding.  That alone would make this CD worth owning.   No doubt this CD will be popular because of the familiar songs it offers.  It seems that every Christian artist has recorded the songs Heart of Worship and Open the Eyes of My Heart.  They're great songs.  Those are the ones that people will recognize and lead them to pick this up.  But those aren't even the best ones. The best songs on here are the new ones.  I enjoy the five that are comon in church worship services, but I LOVE the other five that I believe are all newly recorded--Let My Words Be Few, Pour My Love, How Great You Are, Voice of the Lord, and Your Grace Still Amazes Me.  Each of these songs cut to the heart of the relationship we have with our heavenly Father.  They speak of both the adoration and awe of being in the presence of the God of the universe, the wonder of knowing him and serving him. The familiar songs are good.  The new are even better.  And above all, they're all for the purpose of exalting our Lord Jesus Christ.
