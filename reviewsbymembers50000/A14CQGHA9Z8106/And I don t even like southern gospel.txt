 I admit I was a little hesitant about buying this CD.  I don't care for any kind of music that has that twangy sound to it.  But these four guys have such a powerful gift for music that I was simply amazed when I first listened to it.  Each song is perfectly crafted to at times bring out the different talents of each singer in the solo parts, while also demonstrating their incredible abilty to blend together as a group.  For me the whole CD was worth it just for the song "More Than Ever."  The music is strong and moving, the words are deep and provocative, while in every way giving all praise and glory to God.  Mark Lowry himself said that this is probably the best CD the Vocal Band has done, and I have to say that I agree.
