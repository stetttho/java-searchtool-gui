 From Larry Norman to Delirious, this CD has some of the greatest Christian music of all time.  It appeals to people of all ages because of the incredible span of the popular artists through the years.  The greatest  treasure, however, in this CD is to see the passion that has filled  Christian music for decades.  Even though these are the musicians who have  filled arenas with thousands of fans, the message has always been that all  the glory belongs to God.
