 Mark Lowry is a genius at packing in side-splitting humor with genuine passion for Jesus and a clear-cut gospel message.  This video also has the powerful song written by Mark Lowry, "Mary Did You Know?"  Well  known artists such as Clay Crosse, Bill Gaither, Carman, Newsboys, etc.  show up in some strange places!  The entire video is very well done, and  worth watching again and again and again...
