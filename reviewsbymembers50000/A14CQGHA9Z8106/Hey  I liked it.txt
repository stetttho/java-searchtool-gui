 The duet with Sandi Patti, the spoof on Amy Grant's "Every Heartbeat," Mark and Steven Curtis Chapman's "The Date Adventure," Michael W. Smith's "Place in this World" Mark  Lowry-style... I loved everything about this video!  I also appreciate  Mark's serious side as well.  His commentary along with the song,  "This, Too, Shall Pass," has been a reminder to me many times  that God sees all things, and the troubled times always have an end.  This  video is definitly one to own.
