 PLOT TWIST is the first Jane Rubino book I'd read but it was enough to convince me to immediately buy her backlist and put her on my auto-buy list for the future. If you like dialogue-driven stories, as I do, you'll like PLOT TWIST. It moves along at a snappy pace and never drags. The plot and characters remained fresh and kept my interest until the very last word.  The very best part was that the ending totally surprised me. I had no clue as to the resolution of the mystery.  I'm looking forward to catching up on the Cat Austen stories and hope Ms.Rubino has more in store for the readers.
