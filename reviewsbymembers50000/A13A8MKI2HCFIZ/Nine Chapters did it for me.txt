 By the time I'd finished the first nine chapters, I had it with the crude characters. Perhaps some will find the humor laugh-out-loud funny, but I prefer humor that is more intellectually appealing and I want characters  worthy of my sympathy. Unfortunately, this book provided neither. What it  did provide was the premise that "crude is cute."  This was the  first book I'd tried by Linda Howard. Most likely, it will be the last.
