 I didn't quite know what to expect from "Rock Solid" as the series line and the author are ones I'd not read before. I'd heard good buzz, so decided to try it. I'm glad I did. Ms. Greene packs a whole lot of punch into 185 all-too-short pages.  Take one stressed-out panic attack-ridden young lady who felt more comfortable with Dow Jones and NASDAQ than a Hobie Cat, plunk her down in Idaho for a month of R & R with the man women dreamed of [but doubted existed] and you've got the recipe for one powerful sexy story. Cash McKay senses there's more to Lexie Woolf's ever-present anxiety than meets the eye, but doesn't know how right he is until he takes her under his wing for some confidence building exercises. When it becomes clear her childhood had left serious emotional scars, Cash loses his reserve and his heart, for he knows the situation all-too-well. His small nephew, Sammy, now under Cash's care, suffers the same way. Trouble is, Cash feels Lexie isn't cut out for the wide-open-spaces life and the ranch is *his* life & Sammy's future. How Lexie and Sammy face their demons and how Cash and Lex come to an agreeable understanding and resolution is enjoyable to read and left me perfectly satisfied.  I liked the interaction between Lexie, Cash and Sammy as well as the dialogue between Cash and Lexie. Some great one-liners and humorous undertones keep the story from becoming too dark. This truly was a good book and I will definitely be on the lookout for more of Ms. Greene's work.
