 Karen Drogin does is again, serving up a tempting summertime reading dish with "The Right Choice."  Intense at times and at other times  evoking a chuckle or two, this story, about two people who'd been orphaned  as children (literally and figuratively), will tug your emotions and keep  you turning the pages. Carly Wexler finds out in the nick of time that  her fianc, Pete Novack, is not the perfect match she'd convinced herself  he is. Adding to her confusion over his infidelity and her conception of  what she'd always thought she wanted is the fact that Pete's brother, Mike  (arrived for his part as best man) stirs feelings in her that she never  once felt for Pete. Pete & Mike were orphaned as children and a family  scandal early in her life left Carly with feelings of abandonment and  animosity towards her parents. When Mike and Carly are together the sparks  fly, yet neither is at the point in their lives where they can make  commitments to the other. Readers will enjoy watching Mike and Carly come  to terms with their pasts and work out their differences--with Mike it's  going back into dangerous territory to finish an assignment he'd left  half-done after tragedy struck, with Carly it's facing her parents, getting  the true story behind the scandal--so they can move forward together.  My  only regret in reading "The Right Choice" is knowing that  Kensington has decided to terminate the Zebra Bouquet line. Ms. Drogin has  one more title coming out later this year, "The Solitary Man,"  which I am eagerly looking forward to.  I can only hope another publisher  will snap up this author's work and get it out to the readers. We deserve  the best and Ms.Drogin knows how to provide it.
