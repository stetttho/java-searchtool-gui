 But still hasn't reached the level of erotic romance that she achieved in her Braddock-Black series. I was beginning to despair of ever reading another of the author's novels that didn't resort to an overabundance of obscenity and purposeless sex, without a viable and entertaining plot to hold it all together. In Temporary Mistress, we have less obscenity, but the love scenes are like tepid bath water and the plot, while not completely without interest, is kind of blah.  We have Isabella Leslie, newly made heierss, attempting to elude her hideous relatives who have visions of golden eggs with Isabella being the goose. All they have to do is force her into marrying her cousin, something Isabella rebels against. She races headlong into the night, knocking on the first `friendly' door.  Molly Crocker, the good-hearted madam behind the door, takes Isabella in, listens to her tale of woe and offers a suggestion. I found Isabella's ready acceptance a bit hard to believe and the suggestion involves spending a week in the company of Dermott Ramsay, Earl of Bathurst, known womanizer and rake, in order to so sully her reputation that her relatives would no longer want her. What follows was, to me, at times a bit hard to believe and at other times predictable. Isabelle take to Molly's tutoring of the sexual arts like a duck to water and Dermott take full advantage, adding his own unique spin in a series of love scenes so toned down they were almost sweet.  It will be interesting to see how all this translates into the author's next release; if she can once again weave an erotic romance in the vein of Blaze, Silver Flame and Forbidden.
