 Savannah Reid is back. Back home, that is. Back in McGill, Georgia for sister Marietta's 3rd trip down the aisle. Savannah's not too keen on wearing the dress Marietta picked out, but she is anxious to see her Gran again and catch up on all that been going on. Unfortunately, what's been going on is all the trouble brother Macon has been getting into. The latest, being arrested for murder, has put a serious crimp in the matrimonial festivities and all eyes turn to Savannah to make things right.  This is not cut and dried case. Seems the victim had quite an impressive list of those who hadn't minded seeing him gone. Who to finger? Just when it looks like it just might too much for Savannah to handle, her California cohorts--Dirk and Tammy--show up and with this trio on the path to justice, the murderer just doesn't stand a chance. McKevett gives another entertaining mystery with enough red herrings to throw the reader off and a stellar cast of secondary characters. I was especially pleased to read more about Savannah's family members, especially her mother. We get to meet all the brothers and sisters, learn the particular quirks of each and share the special bond Savannah has with her grandmother.  I do hope the author doesn't relegate the Georgia Reids to the back burner when Savannah returns to California. They make a nice addition to an already outstanding mystery series.
