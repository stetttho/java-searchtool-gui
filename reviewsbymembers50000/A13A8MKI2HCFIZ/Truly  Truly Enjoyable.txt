 Suspend disbelief of time-travel long enough to read Sandra Hill's sequel  to The Last Viking and you'll have yourself a truly delightful reading  experience. Chock full of humor and pathos, this latest addition to Hill's  Viking series is bound to touch your heart at some level. At times I found  myself laughing out loud, while other times I found a lump forming in my  throat as I read of Jorund's (Joe's) loss of family, his bewilderment in a  new land and his attempts to help those in the mental-health facility  support group into which he has been thrust. His blossoming relationship  with Maggie is definitely steamy and that with her twin daughters(who so  remind him of his loss) tugged my heartstrings more than once. His  fascination with TV soap operas, Big Macs, the Internet and other aspects  of our lives that we take for granted are shown humorously through the eyes  of one for whom this is a whole new world.  Ms. Hill has just the right  touch when it comes to creating intelligent, good-hearted characters with  whom you can sympathize and filling their mouths with words that will make  you chuckle or get misty-eyed. Her secondary character, former Navy SEAL,  Steve Askey (did anyone else read ASCII in this?), and his story (and how  Jorund helped Steve with PTSD) is poignant and served to increase my liking  of Jorund as a character and Ms. Hill as an author.  I, like the  characters in the story, am skeptical of time-travel, but I do believe in  miracles. If this describes you, also, then you won't be disappointed with  Truly, Madly Viking.
