 Once in a blue moon, there will come a book whose tormented, tortured hero reaches out and wrings my heart; the ability to haunt me long after the covers had been shut and the books on my  keeper shelf and Michael des Anges (The Lover) is no exception. He pretty  much hung my heart out to dry and haunted my thoughts. By the time I'd  gotten half-way through the book, I was ready to go out and slay dragons  for Michael, *that* was how angry I was over what had happened in his past  to bring him to this point in his life.   Yes, The Lover is erotic, very  much so. But it also has a soul, because underneath the eroticism is the  story of a man whose struggle to regain some semblance of normalcy in the  face of all the inhuman crimes that have been perpetrated against him was  enough to rip the emotion from me. At times, I physically hurt for him.   So, thank you Ms. Schone, for doing the erotic and the angst so well,  and I hope that in the future we can look forward to Gabriel's story, also.
