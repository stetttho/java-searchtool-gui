 Barbara Delinski delivers a powerful tale of friendship, love, trust, suspicion and faith in a story that centers around a young pregnant widow on a quiet cul-de-sac.  When no one can discover who the father is, the marriages of the other 3 couples on the street are tested--as well as the friendships that have evolved amongst the neighbors. Each couple makes a decision based on what is really important in their marriage and in life's scheme of things. Several sub-plots add richness and tension.
