 No, it won't inspire great debates nor deep philosophical introspection, but THE LAST TIME I SAW PARIS will provide the reader with a fast, light story good for a day or two of beach reading.  Character-driven, it's premise seems to be that if it can go wrong, it will.  When Lara Lewis finds that her doctor-husband of 25 yrs has decided to blow off the plans they'd made to re-create their French honeymoon to take up with his assistant, Lara decides to go ahead with the trip anyway as a way of finding herself. But she's not going alone. She asks along the young carpenter who's been working to repair her porch. Dan Holland sees in Lara everything her husband has overlooked and finds himself falling for the older woman with the air of sadness about her. The two embark on what Lara thinks of as re-tracing her honeymoon, while Dan, unaware of Lara's motives, thinks this is the first time she's been in France. Every Murphy's Law comes into play and the two learn more about each other than perhaps was good for them to discover after knowing each other such a short time.  Some may find the premise a bit unbelievable and others will view Lara as wimpy. I didn't think she was wimpy as much as she'd been `walked over' by her domineering husband. In the end, she not only finds herself, self-confidence, and real love, but she finds the courage to be her own woman.  My biggest complaint was the use of too many French phrases, both in dialogue and in description of countryside and foods/drinks. I'll admit that toward the end, I was skipping over them. This won't keep me from checking out this author's next book, though.
