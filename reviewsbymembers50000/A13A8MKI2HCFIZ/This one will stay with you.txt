 Long after you finish the last page, this book will stay with you. If you like your books light, with lots of dialogue, this one may not be for you. But if you enjoy a book that really delves into people's minds and into the 'why we do what we do' then you will enjoy this book. I found it  slow-going at times, with lots of introspection. But Ms. Adams' writing  kept me interested and made me *want* to know how things would all turn out  for Elliot and Brody, both sympathetic characters in a very believable  situation. The backdrop of a big city hospital and Ms. Adams' description  of it and the roles both Brody and Elliott played enhanced the story and  made it real.  This is the first time I've read an Alina Adams novel, but  it certainly won't be the last.
