 In *Caught in the Act*, Lori Fosters first single title, we re-visit old friends from previous books and are introduced to a couple more who will get their own stories in the upcoming months. But the main focus is on Mick Dawson, undercover cop, and Delilah (Call me Del) Piper, mystery writer. After Mick has spent a couple of weeks longingly watching Del jog each morning, he finally works up the nerve to introduce himselfonly to get caught in a botched jewelry story holdup. While trying to protect Del, Mick is seriously injured and when he needs some nursing, Del volunteers. Theres something about Mick that attracts Del and rather than question the sanity of taking this stranger home with her, she goes with her instincts. Mick improves and the sexy writer drives him to the brink of insanity with her attention to his most basic needs. They forge a bond that gets stronger as the story goes on, so when Mick discovers that the robbery wasnt the usual sort of heist and that someone is out to kill Del, he turns from lover to fierce protector. His resolve is strengthened when they learn someone is watching every move they make, especially their bedroom moves. Before the story ends, near tragedy forces both to re-examine what their relationship means to each of them and where they go from that point on. *Caught in the Act* reunites Mick with Dane and Angel Carter from *Beguiled*, Alec and Celia Sharpe from *Wanton*, and introduces Zack Grange and Josh Marshall. In addition to being a hot romantic story, this book is a return to the brotherhood of male friends as found in the Buckhorn Brothers series and which this author does so well. The camaraderie touches your heart and the interaction and banter amongst this tight knit circle of males is what makes this book a keeper. I'm looking forward to Zach in *Treat Her Right* and Josh in *Mr. November*, both released later this year.
