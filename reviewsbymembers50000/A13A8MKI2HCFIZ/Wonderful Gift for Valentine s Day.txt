 As a student of Victorian literature, I read and came to love the poetry of Robert Browning, Tennyson and Rossetti, so I was pleased to find poetry in the same vein being written today. Although I enjoyed reading the entire collection, my favorites are "Wishes" and "At First  Sight." In both, the poet is able to paint a deep sense of eternal  commitment from one person to another.  The poems are wonderfully  romantic and evocative, and would make a great gift this upcoming  Valentine's Day--or anytime you wish to communicate your love and devotion.
