 Rarely do I enjoy a reading a book more so than with Say Yes. The opening scene--the opening page!--hooked me in. The two leads, Sara and Gavin, are interesting, believable characters - with a twist: Gavin is the one who  wants to settle down, get married and Sara is the reluctant one. What  follows is an amusing--and sexy--story of one man's attempt to 'get' his  woman.  Ms. Foster has blended the right amount of humor and sensuality  in this story. And the addition of several members of the animal kingdom  give the story an added element that many readers will enjoy. I think the  author has found her true calling in romantic comedy. I can only hope her  publisher feels the same. Say Yes is the perfect book for a lazy summer  weekend, so Say Yes and put this book on your To Be Bought list.
