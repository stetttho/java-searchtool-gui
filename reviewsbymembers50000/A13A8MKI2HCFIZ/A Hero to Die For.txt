 SEDUCING SUMMER gives us Summer Avery and Brett Ford, who, after their first night of loving shockingly find themselves with a baby on the way. In a reversal of roles, it's Summer who wants nothing to do with men & marriage and tells Brett she fully intends to raise the baby alone and requires no assistance from him.  At first floored, Brett recovers to find himself eagerly anticipating the baby's arrival and wants to be much more than a weekend dad. Furthermore, he's adamant about getting Summer to accept his proposal and she's just as adamant about saying no.  But Brett won't take no for an answer and so he sets out to do everything he can to change her answer to yes. This guy is a prince. A knight in shining armor. The kind of guy you dream about and fantasize about. I loved him and I wasn't too happy with Summer's callous and cold treatment of him. Yes, perhaps she had reason, but I thought she went overboard.  Brett's family gets into the act with parents and two of the three sisters fully behind Brett and supportive in all the changes he makes in his life. All except his sister Brenda. I'll let the reader form their own opinion of Brenda, but in the end I don't feel she redeemed herself enough. Nor do I think Summer groveled enough for Brett's forgiveness.  But these are minor things. Overall, I enjoyed the book very much and think Ms. Blake's star is on the rise. She's certainly an author to watch.   Toni-->> More like Brett, please. <grin>
