 In the style of Jane Heller (Sis Boom Bah) and perhaps a bit of Olivia Goldsmith (First Wives Club), Ms. Bond has penned a great first single title story that has humor and angst, love and hate. All told in a way that will draw the reader into the  lives of the 3 women(ages 50+, mid/late 30s, 20+)  who were married simultaneously to the same man, and who find themselves all convicted of the crime of murdering him. Who did it? You'll have to read it to find out.  A interesting cast of secondary characters, intriguing story line, and three memorable ladies combine to make a novel you won't want to miss. From initial distrust and intense animosity, the three women must work together up until the very end to find out who did Raymond in. The author has created heroines for whom I felt compassion and sympathy and a bit of empathy, as I know women who *have* been taken in by con men like Raymond.  As the holiday season approaches, pick up a copy of Our Husband, curl up by the fire with a cup of your favorite beverage and treat yourself to an incredible story with a satisfying resolution.  I envy Ms. Bond's ability to put words on paper. I only wish I were one-tenth as good. Brava! And what are you doing for an encore?
