 Not often does one come upon a book that has an intriguing plot, likable characters and a cast of secondary character who are not only zany but actually interesting.  Kristine Grayson has given the reader a modern new  spin on some old myths and fairy tales with a struggling young lawyer  suddenly finding for herself a client who not only vastly rich, but who  also happens to be a 1000-year old wizard hellbent on 'rescuing' his fated  soulmate from the clutches of the evil wizard-ess.  The writing is  fast-paced with loads of snappy dialogue, my favorite. Ms. Grayson has me  hooked and I definitely look forward to Thoroughly Kissed.
