 This book was fantastic, one I could sink my romance loving teeth into. To put it simply: A good old-fashioned love story. The story had characters I could sympathize with -- and in the heroine, Rachel, I fully identified with her reluctance to confide her problems to anyone, even her mother. Both Rachel and Sean exuded likeability and the author hooked me into their story from the first page. Rachel had good reason to be afraid for her and her children's safety and good reason not get anyone else involved. But through Sean's persuasive kindness and consideration, he earns the trust and love of Rachel and her children. Throw in sweet seduction, sizzling love scenes and moments of panic, mayhem and angst and you'll see why Ms. Kantra has become an auto-buy for future titles, and her back list now is part of my books to be read. Two scenes that stood out for me were Sean and Rachel, confronting each other in the kitchen and  coming to terms with their feelings for the other and later, when Rachel gets her first introduction to the entire MacNeill family.  The Temptation of Sean MacNeill is definitely Two Thumbs Up.
