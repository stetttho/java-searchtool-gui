 I devoured this book in one sitting and as in the past, Ms. Smith has penned an emotional, riveting story with all sorts of good stuff packed into 186 pages.  In her latest, Smith continues her tradition of throwing strong characters (Dina Corcoran and Mac Nightwalker) into a compelling plot and adding keeps-you-reading motivation and conflict.  Dina, a struggling single mom, faces obstacles that tear at the hearts of moms everywhere. And Mac's reticence to become romantically involved is adequately and reasonably explained. Add to this a common denominator between hero and heroine, and the fact that Mac and Dina move in circles far removed from each other and the stage is set for the power of love to conquer all.  I was first introduced to this author with her BE MY BRIDE? and now have bags and bags of her backlist. I'd recommend this author to anyone looking for a fulfilling read with sympathetic characters, believable plot and a warm, satisfying resolution.
