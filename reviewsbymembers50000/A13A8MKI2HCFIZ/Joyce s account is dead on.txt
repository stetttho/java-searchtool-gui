 As another of the Raytheon nomads, I read with interest, Joyce's accounts of her (and her family's) overseas adventures. Although I and my family were in Greece and Jordan, Joyce had me laughing, rolling my eyes and  nodding, "Oh, yeah. I remember doing that." If anyone wants to  know what it's *really* like to take you family of little ones and live  overseas (both my children were born abroad) you can't do better than  Caravan Days for a true sense of adventure. Thanks, Joyce!
