 I have to admit, Emma Holly is my favorite Black Lace author. She always combines high sexuality with a satisfying love story and "In the Flesh" is the latest in a string of winners for her.  I liked the  two lead charcters, David and Chloe,  what they went through to end up in a  committed relationship with one another, the story line and the motivations  for their actions. Their dark moments drew them closer together and made  them realize that they were destined for each other.  The bondage in the  story is quite light and fits perfectly into this story which is never  rough or raw.  Ms. Holly continues to show why she's a top-notch author  of women's erotica.
