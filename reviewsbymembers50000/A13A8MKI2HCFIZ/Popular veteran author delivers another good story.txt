 Prolific Silhouette author, Karen Rose Smith, adds another satisfying love story to her list with Doctor in Demand.  Dr.Dane Cameron, wounded physically and emotionally, travels to the desert of New Mexico to heal and start life over as best he can. He's hired by Dr. Maria Youngbear-single mom of a 2-year-old daughter-to help out in a small clinic, but little do either know that the help they both secretly seek will come in the form of opening their hearts to new love.  In Doctor in Demand, we catch up with the activities of some of the characters in Ms. Smith's previous stories and are once again taken to the magical desert Southwest. Having lived in the area myself, I doubly enjoy the stories Ms. Smith sets there.  This author never fails to deliver satisfying stories about everyday people whose lives are changed by love. Her characters are as-big-as-life and believable without over-the-top macho men and trash-talking women. And I already have her next book, His Little Girl's Laughter, marked to buy.
