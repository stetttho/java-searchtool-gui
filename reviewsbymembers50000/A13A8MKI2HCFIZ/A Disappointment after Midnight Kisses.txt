 After reading and loving Midnight Kisses by Kimberly Raye, I was really looking forward to this month's Blaze, Shameless, for a great read at the beach. Words cannot express my disappointment. Where were the lovable  characters like in Midnight Kisses? The snappy dialogue, the  OK-I'll-suspend-disbelief-because-this-is-so-much-fun-to-read plot?  From  the first chapter I felt no sympathy for either hero or heroine and the  plot was not one I could get into: basically an "I want you in my bed,  so we'll work out the court settlement in trade." Two weeks of sex for  sex's sake and then it's good-bye. By the time the hero and heroine  got  around to admitting there was something more, the book was nearly over. I  also felt the hero acted too much the juvenile at times when attempting to  get his point across, such as walking into Deb's office and throwing her  over his shoulder in front of her co-workers.  The makings were there for  a great summer sizzler of a read and I expected as much given Midnight  Kisses. Unfortunately, Shameless never came close to living up to my  expectations.
