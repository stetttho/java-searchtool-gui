 Danelle Harmon's at the top of her game in her latest addition to the de Montforte saga. When last we saw Andrew, he was in his ill-fated flying machine with his brother Charles, winging from the fire that  ruined his  laboratory and sent noxious fumes into the air, the aftereffects of which  play a major part in  The Defiant One. Oh yes, and we again have Lucien,  Duke of Blackheath--matchmaker extraordinaire--at his meddlesome, obnoxious  best. (Ms. Harmon promises that Lucien will get a proper comeuppance in The  Wicked One, due in January, 2001 & I eagerly await seeing him meet his  match.)  If all this were not enough, The Defiant One offers something  for those who are animal lovers ( Our heroine, Celsie, is a woman far ahead  of her time in her cause against the abuse of animals), a  discovered-by-accident aphrodisiac that has half the country after it, and  enough humor to have kept me chuckling in all the right places.  I've  read every one of Danelle's books, starting with her first, Pirate in My  Arms, and The Defiant One adds another jewel to her literary crown.  Ms.  Harmon just keeps getting better and I can't recommend this book highly  enough.
