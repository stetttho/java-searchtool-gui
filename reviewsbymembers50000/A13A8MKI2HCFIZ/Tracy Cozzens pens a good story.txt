 This was the first time I'd read one of Ms. Cozzens' books and I enjoyed her ability to make the two main characters come alive. The plot of the story-industrial spying/scientist developing radical life-saving  process-was one I'd not run across before. It was evident from the facts  that the author had done a lot of research. What made it enjoyable is that  those facts were given to us in intersting conversation and narrative. The  ending is a true nailbiter that kept me reading long after it was time to  turn in for the night. I couldn't stand not knowing how it all turned out.   I was pleasantly surprised to see that the cover accurately depicted the  main couple and the decorations on the deck of the sailboat. If there was  one "show stopper", it was the fact that Alica, described on the  back as a top scientist (biologist) dedicated to saving lives, falls into  bed with Jason repeatedly without the use of protection. However, this one  niggle won't prevent me from picking up Ms. Cozzen's next release.
