 I thought the premise of the story, Julie and Romeo, held great promise. Since I can't relate to the 20 and 30-somethings anymore, I was looking  forward to a story that featured 50+ main characters and I stayed  interested and delighted until - Romeo and Julie's offspring showed their  true colors.  Yipes!  Maybe I'm living in a fantasy world, but where do  these kids get off talking to their parents like this? Where do they get  off making explicit and implied threats against members of the other  family? And where-oh-where are these parents' brains to let these kids get  away with all this?  And the crackpot grandmother was no better. Nora  needed a swift kick in the rear and Joe was nothing more than a thug (quite  possibly with bigger aspirations in mind). Plummy was the only decent one  in the bunch, with Sandy and Tony(absent for most of the book) coming in a  close second.  I did like Julie and Romeo (at least in the beginning). I  cheered them on finding love after life had dealt them both lousy hands  (although Julie was infinitely better off without Mort).  But as it became  apparent that neither of them was willing to take a stern stand against  their kids and were content to let this second chance slip by, I began to  lose interest in the story and the characters. Yes, they did 'come around'  at the end, but by that time it was too late. And by this time, it really  didn't surprise me that not one of the kids offered any sort of apology to  their parents for the grief they caused.    I do have one comment to make  to the editor/author/proofreader,etc. Those of us who really *do* live in  this area know that the landmark grocery giant is Demoulas - not Demoula.  Therefore, on page 5,  " . . . into his aisle at Demoula's."  should have read: " . . . into his aisle at Demoulas.'"
