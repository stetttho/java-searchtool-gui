 I was stressed and coming down with some evil 'bug' and wanted a book to 'make me feel better.' I could not have chosen a better title. The previous reviewer gave an accurate overview, so I won't repeat. All I can say is  this is the first Kimberly Raye book I've ever read, but it's definitely  not the last. A light enjoyable read that will leave you chuckling and  feeling a whole lot better by the time you get to the last page.
