 We last saw Samantha Deveaux in PURE CHANCE with her sister Serena. Sam is back in New Orleans to start a new life away from her father and Hollywood's glitz. In order to make ends meet, she takes a security job for Supermarket Expo. How bad could it be? But she didn't bargain for Pasta Guy! Dominick LaRocca's life was never the same after his grandmothers put him on the label of the family company's tomato sauce jar in an attempt to get him settled down. Well, life is anything but settled for Nick and is about to get even more so when Sam "Just-Doing-My-Job" ends up rescuing him from hordes of screaming women and ends up with a piece of his heart.  INSATIABLE defines the Temptation Heat tagline: Sassy,Sexy,Seductive. The shower scene alone is worth the price of the book. The characters and the story premise are delightful. Ms. Leto has another winner with more on the horizon.
