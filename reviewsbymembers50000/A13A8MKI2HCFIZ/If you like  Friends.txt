 -- you'll no doubt like this story of two friends about to take the next  step in their relationship. Trevor Templeton  & Lee Phillips have  known each other for years, part of a college group that also includes    Katy & Ben (friends, then married), Susan(divorced) and Peter(looking  for his true partner in life). The six have been there for each other  through thick and thin and although Led and Trevor entertained private  thoughts about what it would be like to become intimate with each other,  they have not yet taken that step. Until Lee not only broaches the subject  but pretty much pesters Trevor into going along with the plan.  Not that  Trevor needs to be pestered much. The rest of the story chronicles the  trials and tribulations inherent to such an undertaking. At times, the  other 4 friends seem to be more of a hindrance than help and they tend to  get in the way, but their hearts are in the right place. And the scene in  the elevator is so truly memorable that it alone is worth the price of the  book.  I've read many of the Temptation Blaze line and "Hot and  Bothered" wasn't has 'hot' as I'd come to expect. But readers looking  for a good way to spend a day's reading won't be disappointed.
