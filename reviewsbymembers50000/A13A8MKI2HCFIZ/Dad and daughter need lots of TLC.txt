 And that's just what they get at the Rocky R ranch. Therapist Shannon Collins and her Equine Assisted Therapy program are what Rafe Pierson feels is the last resort in getting his traumatized daughter to speak again. After exhausting all conventional forms of therapy, he turns to the pretty doctor for help. He doesn't make it easy-he's highly skeptical and harboring a great deal of grief himself. With Shannon's patience and love, and the unconditional love of her gentle menagerie, father and daughter learn to again open their hearts to love and to live (and laugh) again.  I thank the author for giving her readers a story of warm comfort to read at this time. It never fails to amaze me that Ms. Smith turns out great stories time after time. "His Little Girl's Laughter" is no exception. A story that alternately tugs on your heart and steams up the pages, it's just the ticket to curl up with in front of the fireplace on these crisp autumn nights.
