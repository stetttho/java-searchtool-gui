 I admit I bought the book for the title--and the cover didn't hurt, either--but the story between the pages had me laughing and gave me two very enjoyable nights of reading. The story of a Plain Jane's makeover and the recording of such by man-of-the-world photographer could have been  contrived, but wasn't. I could actually believe the situations and the  dialogue.  If you're looking for a couple evenings worth of light  entertainment, you would do well to try this book. I know I will be looking  for more from Julie.
