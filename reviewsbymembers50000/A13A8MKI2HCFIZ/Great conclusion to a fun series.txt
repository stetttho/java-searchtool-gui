 With WILD FANTASY, Janelle Denison brings to a satisfactory close the 4-book series, Fantasies, Inc, which she started off with SEDUCTIVE FANTASY. WILD FANTASY defines the tag line for the 4-island resort ["Anything goes"] with everything a fantasy should be: seductive and maybe a bit outrageous.  Mitch Lassiter has taken care of his family since his dad died, never paying much attention to his needs. That is . . . until his mother steps in and makes an R&R offer he doesn't refuse mainly because part of the R&R involves a certain Nicole Britton, for whom Mitch has lusted after for years.  Nicole has spent her entire life trying to gain her father's approval, trying to be better than her brother is. When her mother and Mitch's propose they compete as a team in Wild Fantasy's charity event to win money for Breast Cancer Awareness, Nicole's fiercely competitive nature and Mitch's desire to spend time with Nicole set the stage for a sexy encounter in which both characters learn much about each other and even more about themselves. The outcome of the weeklong event, in which teams compete against each other in increasingly difficult competitions, is very different than what all had expected. Nicole learns a valuable lesson: One should do what one feels in their own heart is right and not to please someone else.  And although I liked the resolution to Nicole's feelings of inferiority and low self-worth, I wanted her father to be more contrite about how his actions negatively impacted his daughter's life. In a parallel plot that ran throughout the entire series, there was also a sweet resolution to the Merrilee-C.J. story. Personally, I'd have preferred a goodly dash of sizzle added to the sweet, but it worked and was satisfactory.  Look for more from this author when her Blaze! release, Heat Waves, hits the stands in October.
