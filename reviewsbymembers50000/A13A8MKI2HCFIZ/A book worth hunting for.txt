 After I'd read Ms. Leto's newest release, Good Girls Do!, I knew I had to hunt down her backlist, and I'm sure glad I was able to locate Seducing Sullivan.  Seducing Sullivan doesn't have the playfulness of Good Girls  Do!; what it has are a sympathetic hero and heroine who will tear at your  emotions, involved in a believable and wrenching plot about love remembered  and love reclaimed. The only problem I had initially was trying to decipher  Angela's real reasons for  "getting Jack Sullivan out of her  system."  This didn't detract from my enjoyment of the book, however  and, in fact, helped me understand where Angela was coming from. Anyone  would be very lucky to have her as a friend, as Jack ultimately discovers.  In the end, I found my heart hurting for Jack as the story resolves  itself. I highly recommend you try and find this book.
