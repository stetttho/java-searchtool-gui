 Monica Jackson's story will appeal to readers no matter what your race. I like a book populated by characters that come alive and with whom I could see having a friendship. Tiffany Eastman and Jason Cates are two such people. Each started the story with a large amount of emotional baggage. Tiffany is a recovering alcoholic who had been horribly abused by her late husband and Jason is a surgeon and long-time widower. He'd had to raise his children himself and still, after many years, misses his wife terribly. By the time the story ends, they still have baggage, but the amount is less and the reader is left with the feeling that between the two of them, they will eventually get everything straightened out. They never gave up on each other, even when the going got really rough.  In addition to sympathetic leading characters, Ms. Jackson gives us a varied and interesting cast of supporting characters and a setting that shifts from Atlanta to St. Louis.  I'm looking forward to this author's next book.
