 After reading The Christmas Cookie Murder, I decided to read Back to  School Murder because, well . . . it's back to school time.  I was so  disappointed. I couldn't believe these two novels were written by the same  person! In Back to School Murder, Lucy seems more concerned about her  feelings for her night school professor, her older kids are brats and Bill  is a total jerk( which could account for Lucy's feeling toward her night  school professor.) In Christmas Cookie Murder, Lucy came across more  sympathetically, her older kids weren't quite as bratty and Bill's moments  of being a jerk were not as many. The mystery seemed to take back seat to  the trials and tribulations of Lucy Stone. By the time I finished the book,  I didn't care who the murderer was, nor did I care about any of the  characters.  When I posed this opinion to a mystery fan list, it was  suggested I skip the author's earlier works and try the one coming out in  November, Turkey Day Murder. I think I will take this suggestion.
