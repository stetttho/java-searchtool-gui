 A trio of short, Valentine-themed stories, the book is an entertaining quick read. Any of the stories lend themselves to longer books, which is what I hope Ms. Alexander will do in the future, especially the final  story, Heart's Desire. Romance readers may balk at the absence of a true  happily-ever-after ending, even though it's obvious that it will occur. I,  for one, would have loved to been privy to that.  The writing sparkles  with the right blend of drama and humor. Both of Ms. Alexander's previous  Black Velvet(both out of print) books are in my ToBeRead pile and have now  moved closer to the top. I do hope Carrie decides to add a 4th.
