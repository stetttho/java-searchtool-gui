 When I buy a book by Lori Foster, I know I'm going to get a steamy sizzling love story with a healthy dose of humor thrown in. SEX APPEAL gives me all that and more.  Shadow Callahan had Brent Bramwell falling at her feet. Literally. When he loses his footing outside her little shop, little did he know he'd later lose his heart to the unconventional lady wearing a sweatshirt that warned, "You've been a bad boy. Go to my room." Shadow is need of a man. Well, three. That's the number she has left to recruit for her part in the strip mall's Love and Laughter contest and she'd bound and determined to enlist Brent. Brent, on the other hand, is just as adamant about refusing. Not only does he own the strip mall(unbeknownst to Shadow) but entering a Hunk contest is not something a businessman of his stature does. But he doesn't stand a chance against Shadow's determination, especially when he finds himself falling for her romantically. There's trouble brewing, though, when Shadow finds herself being stalked by a man who's insistent that *he* is the one for her. Anonymous phone calls give way to more sinister events, causing Brent to fear for her life. He takes steps to keep her safe, but Shadow bridles at what she sees as his controlling nature.  Throw in Brent's snooty ex-girlfriend and his equally snooty parents, add Ms. Foster's sizzling love scenes and the reader is in for a story with more steam than a sauna. Shadow is a woman who can hold her own, whether in the bedroom or restaurant. I applauded her attitude and outlook on life and felt she and Brent were quite well-matched.  Lori Foster continues to shine for Harlequin Temptation and I'm looking forward to her first single title for Harlequin, CAUGHT IN THE ACT, coming in September.
