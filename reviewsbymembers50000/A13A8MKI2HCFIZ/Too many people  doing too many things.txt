 After"Larger Than Death," I was really looking forward to "Large Target" and involving myself in the exploits of Josephine Fuller. Somewhere along the line, her exploits became lost in a maze of  over-plotting and so many extra characters, I couldn't keep track of them.  It yanked me out of the story everytime I had to stop and think who Ivor  was married to, who Dwight was (and why he had problems), etc. etc.  Mulligan puts in a less-than-interesting appearance. Although the writing  was good, the mystery itself was just so-so I think Jo should get back to  Seattle as soon as possible. She was out of her element in San Diego,  surrounded by people I cared nothing about. I really *did* care about her  Seattle friends.
