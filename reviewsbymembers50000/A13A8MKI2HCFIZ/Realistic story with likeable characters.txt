 This is the first book I've read by Ms. Drogin, but it won't be the last. In fact, her subsequent Zebra Bouquet, The Right Choice, is in my To Be Read stack.  Perfect Partners takes two people, both lawyers, who have  each suffered the loss of a sibling and thrusts them together for the good  of their little niece. Neither hero nor heroine comes into the arrangement  without baggage. In order to help the little girl deal with the loss of her  mother and father, her aunt and uncle agree to set aside their differences  for her welfare. How they work things out and arrive at the final solution  is heart wrenching at times. The author did a wonderful job of creating  two 'real people' leads whom I bonded with immediately. Their interactions  with each other, their individual emotonal scars and the healing process  involved in getting past them were all well-written. Although this book  is out-of-print, it's well worth the reader's time and effort to find it.
