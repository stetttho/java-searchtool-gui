 The eye-catching title is really a reference to stock market jargon, which fits neatly into the story as the past career choice of the main character,Jacobia Tiptree, and which was extremely lucrative as evidenced  by the vast amounts of money she shells out to fix up her antique house in  Eastport,Maine. I live in one just like it, so I know of what she speaks.   The mystery of who killed Threnody McIlwaine was filled with numerous  red herrings, yet I had it narrowed down to 2 suspects about 2/3 of the way  through. I liked the Eastport, Maine setting as the northern coast of Maine  is one New England area I've yet to visit, and Ms. Graves' details made the  area sound very inviting. Referencing cozy mysteries I've read lately, I  felt this book a bit overlong in comparison, that the story could have been  wrapped up sooner if some of the renovation details had been sacrificed and  the story tightened up. Another common theme is the abusive ex/likeable new  significant other and in this instance, as in previous books by other  authors, I found nothing to like about the ex and a lot to like about Wade  Sorenson. However, the similarities won't stop me from reading the other 2  books in this series (Triple Witch and Wicked Fix) and, in fact, they are  in my to-be-read pile.
