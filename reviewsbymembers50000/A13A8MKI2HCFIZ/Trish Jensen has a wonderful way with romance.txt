 This is one lady whose career you'll want to follow. Rarely does an author combine characters, plot and motivation so well. The characters, Michael and Darcy were sympathetic and I was able to empathize with their plights  and their motivations for their actions. Michael is the consummate hero,  putting himself last in all aspects of this life. Darcy is a heroine in  definite need of a caring, loving man. One who sees past her insecurites  and helps her overcome them.  For a warm story that will leave you  celebrating love, you can't do better than "The Harder They  Fall."
