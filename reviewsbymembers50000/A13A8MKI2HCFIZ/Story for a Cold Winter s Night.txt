 If the weather outside is frightful, grab a copy of NO PLACE FOR A LADY and curl up near the fireplace for an evening of reading bound to take your mind off the double-digit negative wind chill factor.  Molly Riordan's employer, Lady Elizabeth Summersby is in a bind. Literally, her clothes are getting tight and reason for this will make itself known in about 7 or so months. Seems Lady Elizabeth had a brief lapse of descretion at a masked ball and now must face the prospect of traveling to America to wed her partner in imprudence. She insists on taking Molly with her, a decision Molly rejoices in when she discovers that Lady Elizabeth is to travel to the region Molly's father fled to years earlier in hopes of making his fortune.  Our travelers encounter problems and setbacks, compounded by the fact that upon reaching their destination, they are set upon by murderous bandits. The stagehand, mortally wounded, intentionally misrepresents Molly as Lady Elizabeth and thus begins an adventure to unravel the mystery surrounding the two women.  There are several simultaneous misunderstandings, but the biggest is in regards to Molly's real identity which, when all is revealed, sounded completely plausible to me. In the cast of secondary characters, Lady Elizabeth and Ray Lovejoy are the most enjoyable and the hero's brother, Lance (afflicted with Down Syndrome), is lovingly portrayed.  I closed the book with a good feeling; it was definitely not a waste of time to have read it. It is the first book by this author that I've read, but it won't be the last.
