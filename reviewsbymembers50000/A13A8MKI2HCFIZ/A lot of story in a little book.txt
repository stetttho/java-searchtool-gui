 I've only just 'discoverd' Ms. Smith's books, with BE MY BRIDE? the first one I've read. I was amazed at the amount of emotion and meaty story the author packed into the slim volume. I especially loved the characterization of Cody and Lauren. Both emerged as people I would really like to know in real life.  By the time I finished the book, Ms. Smith became my newest auto-buy author and I picked up most of her backlist at my local UsedBookStor. At the moment, I'm currently reading her latest release, TALL, DARK AND TRUE. Suffice it to say, it has not disappointed yet.  If you haven't read any of Ms. Smith's books, I'd advise you to start with BE MY BRIDE? I don't think you'll be disappointed.
