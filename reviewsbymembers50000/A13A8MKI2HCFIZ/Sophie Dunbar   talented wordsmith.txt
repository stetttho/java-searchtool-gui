 In this, the 2nd of the Eclaire mysteries, Sophie Dunbar continues to leave me in awe of her way with words. Aside from the enjoyable tale of mystery and steamy romance between Claire and her hunky hubby, Dan, Ms.  Dunbar's wordsmithing ability leaves me applauding her efforts. Rarely do I  read such well-crafted scenes of high indignity and outrage without  resorting to profanity.  The story itself is pure camp, whacky,  irreverant, sexy and spicy (without being overly graphic). While not set in  Claire's hometown of New Orleans, the story nevertheless is entertaining  with just the right mix of secondary characters to add flavor but not  overwhlem the mystery.
