 With that warning ringing in Jackson Witt's head, he takes off for Seductive Fantasy Island in the hope fulfilling his fantasy: Exacting revenge on the woman he believes has stolen crucial technical information from his company. And what better way to do it than fulfill her fantasy, then break her heart and walk away? Alexis Baylor is on the verge of making her inherited computer game company a success and figures she needs to reward herself a little. What better way than to indulge her fantasies at Seductive Fantasy Island than with an arranged affair with a handsome stranger - no strings attached.  Little did each know they would get much, much more than they bargained for. With Jackson's help, Alexis undergoes a startling transformation from no-nonsense business to the soft and feminine woman underneath. In return, Alexis gives Jackson something he'd always found elusive: a woman who loved him for himself only.   But everything isn't rosy in Paradise, as our two lovebirds will soon discover. Alexis captures Jackson's heart and he's forced  to face some serious questions about his motives.  Ms. Denison, in this first in the Fantasies, Inc. mini-series, gives us two likeable characters in a setting where anything goes. I found the whole premise believable and so enticing. The guilt Jackson felt as time went on and the remorse that hit him when it was discovered just exactly what he'd done were right on the mark. It made him totally believable and a very sympathetic character. I quite liked him.  SEDUCTIVE FANTASY is a great book to kick off your summer reading schedule.
