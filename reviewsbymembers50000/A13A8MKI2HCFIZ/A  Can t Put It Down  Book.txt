 This book had me forcing myself to stay awake so I could read 'just one more page,' and then just one more after that. It's been a long time since a book kept me up well after I should have been in bed, making me lament having to go to work the next morning.  The Lady's Tutor is one icy-hot  read. Set in Victorian England, Robin Schone aptly conveys the cold,  starched atmosphere of the era, while tugging at our heart strings when we  read of Elizabeth's loveless marriage and the darker, seamier side of life  in England at this time.  This is not a book for the gentle reader, but  on the other hand, the love scenes, while erotic, are done tastefully and  beautifully. I truly did not want this book to end. Kudos to Ms. Schone. It  will be hard to top The Lady's Tutor, but I've no doubt she's up to the  challenge and I look forward to her next book.
