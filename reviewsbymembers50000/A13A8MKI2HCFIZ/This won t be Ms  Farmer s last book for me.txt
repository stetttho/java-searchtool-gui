 This is the first novel I've read by Jerrilyn Farmer, but her first two are in my ToBeRead pile. Farmer's writing is witty, entertaining and well-wrought in the ways of humorous mysteries. The cast of secondary  characters is manageable so that you don't need a score card to keep track  of them and she gives the heroine Madeline Bean a generous share of male  attentiveness as the plucky caterer cum sleuth picks her way through a  debacle of a wedding to discover who killed the wedding planner and used  her body as a dinosaurian accessory.  If you're a fan of Diane Mott  Davidson, Sophie Dunbar or any of the writers of humorous mystery, you will  enjoy Killer Wedding.  Note to Ms. Farmer: Please....less Arlo and *much*  more Chuck Honnett
