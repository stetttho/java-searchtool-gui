 If you are willing to suspend your disbelief, you'll have a fun and pleasant way to spend a few nights reading. The characters are quirky, to say the least, and the story full of humorous lines. Likewise, the plot is  a bit far-fetched in spots, but overall, I enjoyed it.  If you like heavy  drama, and you just can't tolerate your Viking heros thinking, "What's  wrong with this picture," this book is not for you. But if you can put  aside your notions of what you *think* the Vikings were like, and let Ms.  Hill entertain you, then you'll enjoy it.
