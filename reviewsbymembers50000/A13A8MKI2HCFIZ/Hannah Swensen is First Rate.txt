 When I read the review of this book in Publisher's Weekly, I had a strong suspicion I was going to like it. I was wrong. I loved it! In the tradition of Diane Mott Davidson, Joanne Fluke gives us a down-to-earth, girl-next-door heroine, who bakes wicked good cookies, came home to help  take care of her [matchmaking] mother and is owned by a huge stray cat  named Moishe. Oh yes, and she's tracking down a killer.  In this 'cozy'  mystery, Ms. Fluke kept me guessing until the last chapter or so. Usually I  have it figured out before then. I chuckled over Hannah's reasons for why  Minnesotans did not rush out to buy Currier and Ives winter scenes and her  endeavors to take her sister's mind off their discovery of a victim by  plying her with inexpensive wine. I'm looking forward to the next in this  series, as it looks as if Hannah may have herself a couple of fellows  angling for her favor. If you're looking for a pleasant way to spend an  evening or two, you can't do much better than Chocolate Chip Cookie Murder.  Oh, and the recipes look great, too!
