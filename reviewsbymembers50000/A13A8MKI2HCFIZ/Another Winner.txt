 In FILM STRIP, Nancy Bartholomew continues a winning streak with exotic dancer, Sierra Lavotini's amateur murder investigation. And this latest venture is a real pain. Literally. Poor Sierra. All she wants is for the Tiffany club to rake in the cash in order to stay afloat, thereby ensuring her financial security. Doesn't look like it's going to happen, though, as one by one the invited guest dancers are picked off. Much to Sierra's chagrin, the shooter's aim on one occasion is a bit off and Sierra ends up with a huge pain in the ----- well, you'll have to read the book. Sierra's brother, Francis, arrives to help his sister stay out harm's way and ends up in a position he'd never even dreamed of.  The author brings in all the characters we've come to know and love: Raydean and Pat, Marla and Vincent, and of course, hunky police detective John Nailor.  And we finally get a verbal 'glimpse' of the infamous Big Moose Lavotini. The dialogue is fast and witty, the characters quirky and interesting, and the love scenes are--whoa!--hot!! What more could one ask for? I'm eagerly awaiting the next in the series, STRIP POKER.
