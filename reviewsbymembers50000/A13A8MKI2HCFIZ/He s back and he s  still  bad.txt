 Zack [Smooth Operator] Brody is back and the town's womenfolk are all atwitter because in his 'glory days' Zack had a penchant for romancing and then bailing out. Unfortunately, the last woman to fall victim was his bride, Laurel, who never forgave and never forgot and vows to seek revenge for the humiliation Zack put her through. She enlists the help of the town's women, who unanimously elect town newcomer & shop owner, Cathy Timmerman as the revenge tool of choice. To aid in the seduction, the women give Cathy a complete makeover. Gone are the glasses and shapeless apron dresses she wears for work. In their place are contacts and totally "glam" clothes.  But she has a secret. She may be new in town, but she's no stranger to Zack and something tells her that something's wrong with the picture Laurel is painting of Zack. And despite the new look, she's still the same woman as before, one whose doubts about Laurel's story continue to deepen as the story unfolds. On top of all this, she's had a crush on Zack since he'd rescued her years before while swimming. And so she agrees to the routine the women outlined, neglecting to tell them she has her own agenda: She has no intention of dumping Zack after the seduction. Poor Zack has no premonition of what is about to hit him.  As the story unfolds, we learn more about the disastrous wedding-day-that-wasn't, about Zack's family [especially his brother Adam & the role he played] and about Cathy's sense of justice.  It's been too long a wait for a Carrie Alexander book, but SMOOTH MOVES was well worth it. The conversations flowed fast and furiously and got more than one laugh out of me. The love scenes, in true Alexander fashion, sizzle. The hero and heroine are sympathetic characters, and the 'woman scorned' was, I felt, quite deliciously diabolical. I feel the author should make Laurel the subject of her own book and perhaps learn the true meaning of love. A bit of groveling wouldn't hurt either. <grin>
