 I'll admit I had my doubts about a romance audiobook read by a man. My doubts didn't linger for long. I much prefer Ms. Brown's earlier books and the story of "Adam's Fall" lived up to all my expectations. However, the narration of "Adam's Fall" was one so superior I doubt any other will top it, in my estimation. You can read the synopsis of the book elsewhere on this page, I only want to add that Michael Zaslow did an outstanding job of reading. His voice brought the characters to life, infusing each--men and women alike--with uniqueness and, in the case of Lilah, sufficient quirkiness to make her come alive.  The world lost a great thespian when Mr. Zaslow passed away in 1998. I highly recommend this tape if for nothing else than the sheer joy of listening to him read a highly entertaining love story.
