 I've read several of Heller's books and have enjoyed all of them. FEMALE INTELLIGENCE was no exception. Brandon Brock's initial behavior rang true, as I've known those in management positions who have exhibited the same attitude toward women in the workplace. Only, they weren't as lucky to get a Dr. Lynn Wyman to help them out.  Heller presents a wealth of secondary characters, all unique in their quirks and foibles and I thought she did a good job (read= authentic) with Dr. Wyman's musings and opinions regarding these secondary characters. They all acted within character making them believable.  The book evoked a range of emotions: humor, disgust, sympathy and shock. I would have liked it, though, if Lynn had come down harder on Kip and Penny. For what they did to her, they deserved, at least, a verbal lashing. In the end, Lynn triumphs, professionally and personally, which is the best revenge of all.
