 So states Morgan "Blackheart" Farrell, to some a pirate, to others "Robin Hood of the High Seas."  When his ship is suddenly caught up in an otherworldly 'Bermuda Triangle,' Morgan finds himself cast ashore on the same island as widow Kate Cameron and her daughter, Casey, have found themselves stranded--all by a hurricane no one else seems to have experienced. Trouble is, he thinks it's 1702 and it's really 1998. Worse--not only did he travel nearly 300 years into the future, but so did his ship and his arch enemy, Thomas Low. Having lived through the tragic loss of her husband, Kate is getting on with her life but definitely not ready to lose her heart to, of all people, a man claiming to be a pirate. But as time passes, events occur that lead Kate to change her mind about Morgan---in more ways than one, as he, at the same time, struggles with choices that will keep him with Kate or send him back to the past without her. With BORN TO BE WILD, Patti Berg became an automatic-buy for me and I was able to obtain all of her backlisted books. LOOKING FOR A HERO has a poignant love story, suspense, revenge, fast-paced delightful and believable dialogue, sympathetic characters and a hero to die for--all woven together in an endearing romantic style that is totally Berg.
