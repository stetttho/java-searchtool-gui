 This review is based on the audio tapes:   This was my first book by Ms.Neggers, and although I don't usually read romantic suspense, I did enjoy On Fire. The hero and heroine (Riley St. Joe and John Straker) are  two of the most obstinate, hard-headed people I'd ever met (and not in a  bad way). Both are intent on solving the crimes and protecting loved ones,  and in the process these childhood friends and adversaries find themselves  falling in love with each other.  I enjoyed most the setting of Boston  north to the coast of Maine. Carla Neggers has it down pat. The  oceanographic setting for the story was one I'd not read before and I found  it very interesting.  The tape's reader was excellent in that she was  able to assume so many different voices, which I think is essential in a  multi-character story. If there was one drawback it was that she dropped  her voice too much at the end of many sentences, making it difficult to  understand unless the volume was cranked up high. That aside, I would  definitely try another of Ms. Neggers books on tape.
