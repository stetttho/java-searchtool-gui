 Over a decade has passed since Ann Barclay Cross and Maddox Palmer had shared the same town of Cutler, North Carolina. Now, dark circumstances have brought Maddox back to Cutler and Ann, dealing with her own dark problems is wary of letting Maddox close again, physically and emotionally. In the process of extricating herself from a highly abusive husband, attempting to clear her name from a felony conviction, and being a good mother to her son, Ann has enough on her hands without letting Maddox into her life again.  Maddox, on medical leave from the Atlanta police force (following a devastating and tragic altercation), has no intention of letting Ann crawl into herself and hide. He sees firsthand the physical and emotional ravage inflicted on Ann by her slime-ball ex-husband, Rob, and by the snide and hurtful attitude the citizens of Cutler (including his own father, the police chief) have toward Ann and vows to right it all.  Virginia Kantra has done it again--written a story of two everyday people fighting to overcome the odds Fate has tossed them while hesitating to acknowledge the history they have between them or the future they might have together. The reader will be moved to revulsion by how Rob Cross attacks his ex-wife and their son. In the end, I'm glad Rob was treated to some pain. Although not nearly enough to make up for what he'd done to Annie, the fact that she 'got' him with a toy was somehow quite fitting. Highly recommended.
