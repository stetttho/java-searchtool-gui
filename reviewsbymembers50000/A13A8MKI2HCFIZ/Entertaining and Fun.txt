 Larger Than Death is an entertaining way to spend a couple night's reading. The femme sleuth, Jo Fuller, is a full-figured woman whose best friend, also full-figured,has just been murdered. Jo vows to find the  killer, but along the way several other victims fall prey. They don't fit  the profile of previous victims, which now throws Jo for a loop. A cast  of lively secondary characters adds color to the storyline. The one thing  that keeps me from a 5-star review is the fact that about 1/2 way through  the book, I'd pretty much figured out the culprit. That aside, I've ordered  Ms. Murray's second book and am looking forward to reading it.
