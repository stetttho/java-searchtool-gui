 Heat of the Night (Donna Kauffman's latest Temptation) features a police detective hero and a public relations heroine and what a beautifully matched duo they are, both in terms of sexuality and intelligence. Both as sharp as tacks and both with some hot fantasies that involve the other. When a city official is found murdered in eyebrow-raising circumstances, Brady O'Keefe is hot to find the perp before the mayor's reelection hopes burst like soap bubbles. But he's hindered by Erin Mahoney (former classmate and the mayor's PR consultant) whose fledgling PR firm could really use the publicity that a job well-done would generate. It's obvious that neither will be able to do their job until they indulge their fantasies and put out the fire that smolders between them. The love scenes are intensely hot and both Brady and Erin find much more than they'd bargained for. The banter between Brady and Erin kept the book going at a fast clip and made for a book that was hard to put down. The cast of secondary characters added spice and variety and the murder mystery was plotted well. Ms. Kauffman's talent and her love for the characters made Heat of the Night one of the best of the summer.
