 You know the book is a keeper when, long after you close the cover, it stays with you. In "A Man Like Mac," Fay Robinson not only pens a keeper, but one that easily deserves the title, "Best First Book." Olympic runner, Keely Wilson, finds her dreams crushed after injuries suffered in a car accident leave her body and spirit crippled. Determined to achieve her goal of winning Olympic gold in Sydney, Keely returns to the man who was so instrumental in building her young running career, Mac McCandless, in the hopes that he can, once again, work magic. Unbeknownst to her, however, Mac has been dealt his own rotten hand of Life's cards. Keely must find it within herself to not only accept and deal with Mac's condition, but her growing attraction to him. She must also deal with memories of the past--her parents' divorce, her father's death, and her mother's plans to marry again.  As Mac works with Keely, he's not only afraid she will never run again, but that she will rebuff the personal feelings he has for her.  In the hands of a lesser writer, Keely could have come off as a whiny,spoiled brat with whom the reader would feel no compassion, no sympathy; the portrayal of paraplegics and quadraplegics could have come off as maudlin. But Ms. Robinson outfits her complex characters with acceptable and believable conflict and gives them intelligent, compelling dialogue. Some scenes leave you laughing and some will make you cry. But in the end, the reader is filled with a sense of awe and the knowledge that love *can* conquer all.  This is Ms. Robinson's first book. Thankfully, it's not her last(her next is scheduled for Jan. 2001) This is an author to watch, and if her first book is any indication, her career is destined to be a golden one. I can't recommend this book highly enough. It's one of the best love stories of the year.
