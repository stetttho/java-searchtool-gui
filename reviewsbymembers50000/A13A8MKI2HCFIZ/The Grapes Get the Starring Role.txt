 After reading, and enjoying, several of Ms. Delinsky's novels - and having met her this summer - I was looking forward to reading her latest, The Vineyard.  When I closed the book, I was left with a mixed bag of emotions and thoughts.  While I really enjoyed the budding love story of Olivia and Simon, I found myself wishing there had been more devoted to them , especially how Olivia and her daughter, Tess, helped Simon in his grief recovery over losing his wife and daughter several years before.  The italicized portions of the book, which constituted Olivia's writing of Natalie Seebring's memoirs, broke my concentration and drew me out of the story, although  I don't know how the author could have crafted this differently and still gotten across Olivia's creative writing ability.  Ms. Delinsky expertly weaves several story lines of a dysfunctional family into a verbal tapestry rich in characterization and human foibles. Of all the characters, I loved Simon best, but what I really loved was the in-depth description of life caring for and nurturing a vineyard. I grew up less than a mile from many vineyards, but never did I know what went on inside the little ecosystems. If nothing else, The Vineyard gave me a new appreciation for those whose livelihoods depend on grapes and what they must do to make the harvest a success.
