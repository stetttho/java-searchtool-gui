 Knowing I would not get another installment of Claire and Dan's exploits for a while, I savored Shiveree, drawing it out over several nights. Dunbar's trademark prose is still here, her characters as quirky and  delectable as ever and Dan and Claire are still steaming up the pages in  between hunting for clues in the latest murder investigation. What kept  me from awarding Shiveree 5 stars is the ending. Not that the reader isn't  left guessing until the very end, not that Ms. Dunbar hasn't thrown in a  slew of red herrings. The book just ---- ends!  It's almost as if there is  a chapter missing. I was quite let down, expecting a neat wrap-up, some  cozying around the Christmas tree with Claire and Dan, maybe getting to  find out what was really in the gaily wrapped packages. Maybe learning  something more about Charlotte and Foley. But, nothing!  I'm not happy.   Ms. Dunbar, you really need to do something to correct this. We need  another Eclaire mystery ASAP. Please don't leave us Claiborne groupies  behind.
