 Can Miranda Carpenter resist the charms of Noah Yeager? It's not easy, but Miranda is determined to give it her best shot. Her sexy colleague doesn't help matters when he insists on 'helping' her win The Most Virtuous Woman  on Campus award. Along the way, Miranda sets out to teach  confront-your-conflict Noah a thing or two about commitment. I LOVED this  book! I'd never read one of Ms. Leto's stories, but I intend to correct  that oversight. She has drawn very likeable, sympathetic characters to whom  I was drawn immediately. Her dialogue is true and snappy. And the  'thunderstorm' love scene is guaranteed to leave your pulse pounding. [It  was my favorite in the whole book]. This is a great book to tuck into  your beach tote this summer. If you think it's steamy at the beach, just  wait until you read Good Girls Do!
