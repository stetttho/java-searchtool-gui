 Shelter in a Soldier's Arms by Susan Mallery After reading and enjoying Ms. Mallery's single-title debut, SWEET SUCCESS, I looked forward to trying out her latest category and I wasn't at all disappointed. Ashley Churchill, a widow and single mom, suddenly finds herself very ill and homeless (thanks to a broken water pipe that destroys her apartment). When the owner of the business she cleans offers her and her daughter a place to stay and a job, she accepts with the intention of it being only until she can get back on her feet. But by the time she regains her health, she finds herself falling for her virile, secretive employer Jeff Ritter has seen the worst life has to offer. The take-charge former soldier, now top-notch security expert, possesses a cool, aloof demeanor that is essential to his job. Never did he figure that one little girl and her mother would melt his heart and show him the meaning of love. But the hazards of his job and the nightmares that haunt his nights threaten to keep Ashley from him forever unless he can find a way to reconcile the two very different parts of his life.  The author gives the readers multi-faceted characters in a story that has humor, gut-wrenching emotion, and sizzling passion. This is a great book for a reader looking to really get involved in a reading experience. The main secondary character, Zane Rankin, is pure delight and deserves his own book. I do hope Ms. Mallery can conjure up a heroine worthy of him.
