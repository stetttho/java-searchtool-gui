 Vineyard Blues is the second of the Martha's Vineyard mysteries that I have read [Death on a Vineyard Beach  being the first] and like the first, Blues is long on scenery, fishing and familial insights. Sort of short on mystery, though. I'm not sure I like the idea of J.W. letting his two children tag along on investigations and business calls, especially his son at the sight of an arson fire. Too many chances for a young one to get hurt.  Having visited Martha's Vineyard I enjoyed re-visiting some of the island spots, but I thought the mystery plot itself could have been more meaty, and I was disaapointed that the two Kline brothers [1 a slumlord, 1 into kinky behavior - both into abusing women] were not dealt with a bit more severely for their roles in the lives of some of the island's female population. And I never did figure out just what purpose the sub-plot of the Quick's played in the book, except to fill some pages.  Vineyard Blues is a cozy beach read or for Vineyard dreaming in the middle of winter.
