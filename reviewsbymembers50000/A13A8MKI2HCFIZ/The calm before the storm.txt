 In this, the 5th book of what has come to be known as The Outlander series, Diana Gabaldon gives the reader a sense of impending disaster. Although nothing horrendous befalls our cast of characters, the book is apocalyptic, nevertheless, with a growing sense of foreboding as the start of The War of Indenpendence looms closer. This doesn't mean that your emotions won't be wrenched. They will. From laughter to heartache, the author manages to evoke them all in the extreme. The Fiery Cross is, at its heart, a string of short stories based in Fraser's Ridge, North Carolina and in the surrounding areas. It brings back the main cast of characters, adds new faces and reunites some of long-lost favorites. We watch as new generations of Frasers evolve and grow, and as Jamie and Claire deal with middle-age. Questions are answered, but yet more are raised. Some threads are tidied up, yet some are left dangling.  While some readers have said this is the weakest book, I feel the opposite. I feel the author is setting the reader up for what may be the most explosive volume of this series, when the next installment is released.  One note of caution: If you're reading this book without the benefit of the previous 4, you will have a rough time understanding the complete back history. One might want to pick up a copy of The Outlandish Companion, as a refresher or for a quick summary of what has transpired before.
