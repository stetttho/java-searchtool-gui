 Are romance publishers pushing a new theme these days? The theme of the adult male who blames his inability to commit to a defective gene. Do these editors and publishers have inside information to the map of the human genome? Let's get this straight: infideltiy is caused by defective jeans, NOT defective genes. To insinuate otherwise is to assume the reader does not know the difference.     Cooper Wilde believes he has defective DNA. Maybe he does, but it certainly is not the cause of his commitment worries. Yes, his mother and uncle seem to have a problem with sticking to one significant other and based on this, Cooper decides his is also so-fated. Enter Carly Cassidy.     Tired of being good, within the space of a couple of days, Carly's left her bridegroom at the alter, wandered into a strange bar, drunk herself senseless and `falls in love' with the bar owner, Cooper Wilde, all in the name of making it on her own. I would have to question her common sense, given the danger she puts herself into. I found Cooper, with his "we'll have sex, but I can't commit" attitude and Carly with her frequently uttered, "Sweet Mary" to be irritating people. I thought that her attempt to mentally recite the Beatitudes with Cooper biting her ear was inappropriate, even though she's the daughter of a minister. When they finally do have sex, it's unprotected! At this point, I finished the book, but quit caring what, if anything, happened to them.
