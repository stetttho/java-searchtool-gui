 Gwen Cassidy wanted to change her life and experience the ecstasy of desire and so she books a vacation to Scotland. But things were looking bleak: all her travel mates were senior citizens and just when she thought it couldn't get any worse, she falls through a crevice right onto a body. Not just any body, mind you, but a 6 foot Highlander in all his glorious condition. Trouble is, he's been asleep for 500 years. Drustan MacKeltar, a old-school Druid, had been put under a spell, asleep until awakened by his savior: a unlikely, wee lass whose spunkiness more than made up for her lack of height. The two of them embark on an odyssey through the 20th century as Gwen helps Drustan return to his family home in the hopes of returning to his own time. Along the way, Drustan gets a quick lesson in future history, current fashion trends and the way of modern women. Gwen learns what it was she wanted in a man and eventually the desire and love she so craved.  They stand within the circle of magic stones and Drustan prepares to go back in time only to have something go wrong with his calculations. Within moments, Gwen finds herself in 1518 Scotland with her Highland laird. Except he has no memory of her and they find themselves pitted against a nameless enemy bent on destroying them both.  This is the first book I've read by this author, but it won't be the last. Ms Moning's flair for creating likeable and sympathetic characters, snappy banter between the characters and detailed research (as noted in the list of source books used for research) all come together to form a delightful story that will stay with the reader long after the book is finished.
