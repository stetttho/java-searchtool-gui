 I'd seen this book mentioned on a mail list I belong to and being a fan of Diane Mott Davidson and G.A. McKevett, I thought this book might appeal to me. It did and in a big way. Ms. Dunbar's characters are believable and  totally entertaining. Her dialogue is smart and sassy without being  demeaning or crude. In one part, Claire delivers a scathing retort that had  me mentally applauding her ability to reduce her victim to the size of an  anthill all with the use of brilliant profanityless dialogue. I thought I  had the mystery figured out up until the end when the author threw a curve  and the spicy, steamy on-again/off-again romance between her and her  erstwhile hubby, Dan, is quite humorous.  Although this is the first book  I've read by this author, I enjoyed it so much I am now reading the next in  the series, Redneck Riviera, and plan to work my way through to her latest  release, Shiveree. I heartily recommend this book. I'm definitley  cheering for Dan
