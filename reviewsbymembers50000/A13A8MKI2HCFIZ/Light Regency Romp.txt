 Regency England is not my preferred story setting, but I'll be honest - The cover hooked me.  It has to be one of the most unique and beautiful covers I've ever seen. I read the back blurb, decided I might enjoy the story, too, and bought it. Ms. Claybourne writes a light Regency romp that features Belinda Croft (dabbler in potions and such), Marcus Barrow (an earl without a title), Belinda's loving and agoraphobic father, her prone-to-vapors Aunt Phoebe and her air-headed and flighty cousin, Sissy. When Sissy is horrified to discover a pimple on her face the day of her big debut into society, Belinda quickly 'devises' a beauty cream, which Sissy uses and insists has given her a perfect complexion.  Of course, news of this wonderous invention quickly makes the rounds and reaches the ears of the Prince Regent. He, in turn, uses it as a bargaining chip in Marcus' attempt to regain his title.  Marcus, guru of good-taste, makes the bargain with Prinny that will bring back family title if successful. Belinda holds the key, but can Marcus go through with it?   I was most annoyed with the silliness of Aunt Phoebe and Sissy throughout most of the book, however Sissy develops some spine near the end and raised my opinion of her and, to be fair, they were portrayed no worse than other females of the same period.   A Thing of Beauty was just that: A beautifully covered book with a warm and satisfying love story inside.
