 I really do like the Eclaire mystery series. And I'm looking forward to delving into the last, Shiveree and hoping it grabs me like the first two books.  Bad Hair Day...was just too much. Too long, too much going on,  too many characters to keep track of, much more 'dark' than previously. Ms.  Dunbar's writing is still superb. I just wish Bad Hair Day had been a touch  more on the light side.  Despite the overabundance of action and  characters, the book is still good, and I'm very glad I read it.
