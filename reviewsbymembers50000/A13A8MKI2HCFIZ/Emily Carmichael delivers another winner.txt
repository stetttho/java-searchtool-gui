 Take a man on the run from the law, a wagon filled with `ladies of the night,' several more filled with a small-town congregation set on journeying to Oregon, mix it all with the author's highly entertaining storytelling and one has the makings of a fun and entertaining spell of reading.   Nathan Stone, a man wanted for a crime he didn't commit, cheats fate and the noose and goes on the run, appropriating the identity of a preacher who'd had the misfortune of being attacked by Indians. Nathan becomes Rev. Homer Pernell, takes on the responsibility of guiding the god-fearing folk to Oregon, and figures life is good. Until Lila McAllister and her `girls' join the wagon train as part of a deal cut with the sheriff of Webster, Kansas, whose advances Lila had previously rebuffed. He won't press trumped-up charges against Lila if she and her band of brothel beauties clear out for good. In with the group is Cass, Lila's younger sister and an innocent despite her `home life.' On the trail to Oregon, `Rev.Pernell' begins to have some devilish thoughts about the young Ms. McAllister, which she reciprocates after time. But just when things were looking up for the Rev. and Cass, Fate steps in again. Only this time the results aren't nearly as fortunate. What ensues is a series of events that forces the young couple to do some serious soul-searching as they come to grips with circumstances, learning what's really important in life and, for Cass, learning the art of forgiveness.  I loved this book. I laughed, a lump formed in my throat a couple of times and I seriously contemplated taking a vacation day so I could finish the book. Like Ms. Carmichael's previous releases (FINDING MR. RIGHT and A GHOST FOR MAGGIE), JEZEBEL'S SISTER is an entertaining, satisfying romance that I highly recommend.
