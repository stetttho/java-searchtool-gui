 Do *you* have a secret fantasy? I do. But it's better left secret. <grin>  Instead, I'm content to read and enjoy the stories in Harlequin's Fantasies, Inc. series. Carly Phillips' entry, SECRET FANTASY, is no exception.  Reporter Doug Houston's fantasy is to become part of Juliette Stanton's fantasy. Along the way, he hopes to uncover the real reason she fled her wedding and re-establish his credibility as a reporter after a bad lead wreaks havoc with his professional integrity.  Juliette Stanton, aka Runaway Bride, is desperate to find some peace and quiet. Away from the media hounds that smell the scent of scandal and will stop at nothing to ferret out the truth behind her run from a marriage to an influential politician. Little did she know that that the dark-haired charmer selected to play the key role in her fantasy was only after one thing: Her story. But as Doug gets to know Juliette better, he realizes there is more to life than `a story.' And along the way, both learn to follow their hearts.  I've been a fan of Ms. Phillips for a long time and SECRET FANTASY didn't disappoint me. Her characters (who come alive with real problems and real dialogue) work to overcome the odds, culminating in a fulfilling and satisfying ending. Fans will be happy to learn that this author has an upcoming entry in the Blaze! Sexy City Nights series, titled Body Heat. I was lucky to have received an advance reading copy and can only say that if Body Heat is any indication of the quality of the new Blaze! imprint, then readers have much to look forward to.
