 Books like this are hard to rate. While it wasn't bad, it wasn't as good  as Ms. Hayter's first Robin Hudson mystery,  "What's a Girl Gotta  Do?"  Yes, there were moments of humor, some really good, but all too  often I found myself wondering just what in the world was going on. The  first part of the story moved right along and was on par with Janet  Evanovich's "Stephanie Plum" series.  But then I found myself  distracted by lengthy narrations into the history of the Cootie Girls and I  lost the train of the plot.  Although the story line was one of revenge,  I wasn't quite sure against whom. Was Robin the target, or just a pawn in a  bigger plot? And, why? By the time I reached the end, my head was spinning  and I was worn out from the convolutions the story took to try and figure  it all out. I didn't feel the secondary characters added enough substance  to the story, none of them evoked much sympathy from me, and seemed to be  included just so Robin would have someone to talk to.  While  "Revenge of the Cootie Girls" didn't entertain me as did  "What's a Girl Gotta Do?" it wasn't a bad book and did provide a  couple night's worth of nice reading. I just hope that Ms.Hayter's other  Robin Hudson stories will provide me with greater reading delights.
