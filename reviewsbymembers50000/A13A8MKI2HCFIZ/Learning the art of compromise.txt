 First of all, I do not believe THE PREGNANT MS.POTTER, deserves the one-star rating given below. Within the rules of series romance, the book is right on track. However, if one disregards these differences and reads it after Ms. Criswell's THE TROUBLE WITH MARY, then I can see where they might be disappointed. These are two very different books, written to two very different sets of rules.  THE PREGNANT MS.POTTER pits two very independent, strong-willed characters against each other in a story filled with love, over-protectiveness and coming to grips with our pasts and getting on with our lives. This is particularly true with, Pete Taggart, who lost his wife and unborn child in a car accident. Unknown to him at the time, his wife had talked of leaving him because she could no longer handle his 'male chauvanistic' way of running things. Into his life plops Maddie Potter: unmarried, pregnant and very much the independent successful business woman. Pete decrees that a woman's place is firmly in the home, which rubs Maddie totally the wrong way as she does not intend to give up the career she worked so hard to get. Should have been a match made in you-know-where, and it very well could have ended in disaster, if the two of them hadn't kept the lines of communication open, worked through their differences and learned the art of compromise.   My only complaint is that I wished the book had been longer, because I'd have liked more with Maddie, her estranged father and her sister. I felt the length of the book prevented the author from telling us more.   I hope Ms. Criswell intends to followup with books on Pete's two eligible brothers, John and Mark. It would be sinful to let these two get away.
