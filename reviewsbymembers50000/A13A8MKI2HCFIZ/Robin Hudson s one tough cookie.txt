 -- And so she should be if she's to survive her reversals of fortune at work and in love. Relagated to an undesireable job at the TV station where she works (due to un-couthness during a live White House broadcast) and  demoted to the title of ex-wife, Robin seems to be one of those people to  whom trouble is perpetually attracted. Having to face the ex's chipper  young 'other woman' *and* deal with a murdered blackmailer requires all the  resourcefulness Robin can muster. The 'who' in whodunit came as a  surprise to me.  This is my first book by Sparkle Hayter, but it won't be  the last.
