 In "Simply Sinful," Carly Phillips pens a hot love story pitting  Detective Kane McDermott against etiquette school, Charmed!, owner Kayla  Luck in a battle of wills where everyone wins.  The story has a  believable premise (detective goes undercover to investigate whether  business is a front for prostitution), the characters are people I would  like to have as friends. They're honest with each other, they speak  believable (intelligent) dialogue, there is no BIG MISUNDERSTANDING to keep  them apart and they evoke a sense of sympathy and caring.   Although both  had suffered loss of parents and other close family, my heart went out to  Kane the most. Kayla had her sister (& her aunt, before the aunt's  death), but Kane had no one who really loved him. At times, I had a lump in  my throat as it became clear he blamed himself for the death of his mother  even though he was a child at the time and there was little he could have  done to prevent the suicide. An air of sensuality sizzles and crackles  between them, yet Kane is ever mindful of Kayla's position and the danger  she's in, and treats her with fiercely protective tenderness. (Hot  chocolate and whipped cream will never mean quite the same thing to me  again. ::: big grin::: )  These two are great for each other and I was very  happy with the story's resolution.  I loved this story and can't wait to  dive into Cat's story, "Simply Scandalous." And be on the lookout  for Carly's "Simply Sensual," in January 2001. I know I will.  Carly also writes novels for Zebra Bouquet, as Karen Drogin. Check out  "Perfect Partners" and "The Right Choice."
