 What impressed me the most was the likeability of Ryan and Janna Ryan Chandler's grandmother and meddlesome matchmaker, Allie, decides it's high time her grandson get out and live life a little. After marrying off her two granddaughters, Allie's next victim is Ryan. And what better way to shove him out into the world than at the Bachelor Auction hospital charity event. And in order to ensure success, Allie picks out Janna Monroe (widow and mother) from the bidders and `helps' her along in the form of a check to make the winning bid.  As the story progresses, we watch Janna learn to love again and Ryan change from a boring corporate businessman into a warm and loving man, whose heart opens up not only to Janna, but to her young son, Zachary. Ryan's first attempt at grilling is hilarious, even if the outcome was not.   I found Ryan and Janna very appealing. I did not find Almira Chandler likeable at all. From her scheming to the way she spoke to others, I found myself wanting to reach out and strangle her. I wasn't particularly fond of Mrs. Ballantine (the housekeeper) either.  Ignore the interfering grandmother and crabby household help. Focus on the story of Ryan and Janna and you won't be disappointed.
