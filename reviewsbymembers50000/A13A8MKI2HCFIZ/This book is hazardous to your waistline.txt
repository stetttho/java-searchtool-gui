 WARNING: Do not read this book while attempting to diet. You're apt to start eating the pages.  Following up on her first Hannah Swensen mystery, Ms. Fluke again pits the Cookie Lady against evil forces when Hannah happens upon the body of Lake Eden's sports coach, Boyd Watson. Since Boyd has been known to abuse his wife, she becomes the prime suspect, but good friend that she is...Hannah doesn't believe it. And she sets out to try and find the real killer--of which many seem to fit the bill.  Interspersed among her sleuthing are mouth-watering recipes Hannah is using during the televised coverage of the 1st Hartland Flour Dessert Bake-off. Just reading the recipies made visions of Cocoa Snaps dance before my eyes.  There are a few interchanges between Hannah and Mike Kingston (who we met in Chocolate Chip Cookie Murder), but not enough to satisfy this reader. <hint hint> However, since the dust cover tells me that Ms. Fluke is working on the next Swensen mystery, perhaps we'll get to see more of Hannah's social life.  The author is an automatic-buy for me and I'm looking forward to the next book in this series as I've grown rather fond of the Cookie Lady.
