 "Treat Her Right" continues where Foster's previous release, "Caught in the Act," left off-and this time, it's Zack Grange's turn in the hot seat. A widower with a young daughter, Zack has decided that it's time to Look to the future and remarriage. He knows exactly what type of woman he wants for a wife and mother and it's not his new next door neighbor Wynn Lane.  Outspoken, physical and eye-to-eye tall as Zack, Wynn finds her new neighbor to be a man worth getting to know better and his little girl adorable.  Unfortunately, although little Dani feels the same way about Wynn, Zack does not.  Or so he thinks. The sparks fly as Zack and Wynn first fight their attraction to each other, then succumb to the inevitable.  Lori Foster continues her tradition of giving romance readers everything they could possibly want: sympathetic characters, great dialogue, steamy love scenes and the easy camaraderie of a closely bonded group of men that only she can deliver. The fun continues in her next book, "Mr. November," in which the 3rd member of the group, Josh Marshall takes his turn in the game of love.
