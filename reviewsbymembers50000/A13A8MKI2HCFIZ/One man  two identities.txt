 In an effort to save her family's business, Kyra Cartright has decided to accept a proposal of marriage to a business acquaintance for whom she has feelings but not of the toe-tingling variety. Before she tells him "Yes," she decides to indulge in one final breakaway weekend on Intimate Fantasy Island--never realizing that her wildest fantasies were about to change her life forever.   Tony Moretti made his livelihood saving other peoples' lives. But in the space of one afternoon, he lost not only his life's work, but also his health and self-confidence. Scarred and in pain, he accepts his friend's offer of R&R at Intimate Fantasy island before settling down to life without the thrills he'd become used to. By day, he lounged around the pool, but by night he morphed into the mysterious Michael, an unidentified man who traveled in the shadows and rescued those who had gotten into trouble. And one of those is Kyra.  Kyra finds reality far better than her fantasy in the arms of Michael, a man with masterful bedroom skills. And by day, she finds a wonderful friend in Tony, a man whose scars are overlooked in favor of that special `something' about him that draws her closer and closer.  Afraid the truth will ruin all he's accomplished so far, Tony holds back and doesn't tell Kyra of his alter ego. A boating excursion turns deadly, prompting questions and revelations and, for Tony, the point where he must decide to risk it all and tell Kyra the truth.  Julie Kenner creates a tender and passionate love story with two very real people, each faced with life-altering events, in a story line that is both credible and heart tugging. My heart melted for Tony, whose life of a firefighter has gone from the heroic to the mundane as he contemplates a desk job and can't quite handle it. Kyra is just what he needed to gain back his self-confidence and zest for life. She saw past the scars and the pain to the real man inside. A man who *does* make her toes curl!
