 Ever dread finishing a book because you just know the next one you start won't come anywhere near to being as good? This was how I felt when I read the last page of Disguised Blessing. Before this, I'd read and enjoyed The Beach House, but Ms. Bockoven's latest surpasses that.  I read the book  in one sitting, not wanting to have to put it aside for the night to find  out how it ended. The dialogue is convincing and the characters totally  sympathetic and in one spot I was in tears. Ms. Bockoven does an admriable  job of showing that us while life may be horribly  unfair, with love and  hope the score can be evened. I urge anyone who wants an uplifting book  to read to put this one your To Buy list. As for me, I'm off to hunt up the  author's backlist.
