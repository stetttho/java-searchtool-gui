 In the style of Patricia Gaffney's Saving Graces, Friendship Cake is a real-life novel whose focus is women, the lives they live and the problems they face.   Friendship Cake takes 5 disparate church women and throws  them together in the course of putting together a church cookbook. But,  it's more than recipes that get tested. Friendship, love and trust are put  to the test over and over as the ladies learn to accept the others --- and  themselves --- for who they are.  I didn't know what to expect from this  novel, which is written by a pastor in North Carolina and I have to say  that I do hope Pastor Hinton has more stories like this tucked away, just  waiting to be written. Quite a wonderful book.
