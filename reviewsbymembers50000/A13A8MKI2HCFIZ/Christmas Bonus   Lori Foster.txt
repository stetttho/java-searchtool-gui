 Forget hot chocolate, forget that crackling fire. All you need is Lori Foster's "Christmas Bonus" to warm you up on a cold winter's night. Whew! This is one hot story. Too bad it was so short. Of course, this is a novella, but I'd have loved to have had another 200 pages of Eric Bragg and Maggie Carmichael. Unbeknownst to each other, they've both worshipped the other from afar, their age difference being one of the main factors. Now that Maggie is head of her late father's company, Eric continues to keep his distance, unsure of how Maggie would respond to overtures. Would she think him only interested in her now, since her rise to company chief, as a way of gaining control of the business he once thought would be his to control? As for Maggie, did Eric still see her as the bouncy teen-ager, ten years younger than him?  Their secret infatuations with each other remain secret, until Eric discovers Maggie's `other' career. Then, the sparks fly as Eric decides to take matters into his own hands. If those long, cold winter days (and nights) have you feeling a bit like hibernating, "Christmas Bonus" is guaranteed to jumpstart your pulse and heat your blood to sizzle.
