 Stephanie Bond's latest book is definitely not for the faint of heart. Having said that, I will also say that if you are one who likes their romance steamy you can't do better than this sexy, spicy, and often  humorous tale of the ultimate 'wrong number'. I can certainly relate to the  problem Georgia has with her new phone. I still have to call my son to help  re-program the VCR remote. So, screwing up the speed dial is entirely  possible to me.  I did wonder about the believability of the heroine not  knowing it wasn't her boyfriend on the line, but the author offers a  plausible reason and because the phone calls were only a few, it was  believable for me.    Ms. Bond definitely pushes the envelope with this  book, with her well-crafted 'flying solo' scenes.  Does she push it out of  bounds? Not in my opinion. The language is suggestive, but not explicit.   She also gives us those elements we've come to expect: a hero and heroine  who make mistakes and aren't afraid to apologize. The hero, Ken Medlock,  makes a memorable case for himself in the end as he tries to legitimately  win Georgia's love after having kept the truth from her for so long. Does  this make him less heroic? No. It makes him human.   I've read several of  Ms. Bond's earlier books, and look forward to seeing more of her writing  for this particular category. I did learn one very important fact from  reading this book: There are white chocolate-covered cherries!
