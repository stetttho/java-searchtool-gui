 Heartwrenching. Emotional. Hot. That sums up the last of the �Men to the Rescue� trilogy from author Lori Foster.  And saving the best for last, she delivers a story worthy of the man in the hero�s shoes. Josh Marshall, firefighter and man about town, never missed a chance to razz his best friends when the love bug caught them. But when the tables are turned and the hunky fireman falls head over heels for the woman bent on including him in her charity calendar, it�s a whole different story.  He knows that below Amanda Barker�s frosty exterior is a woman waiting for the right man to awaken her passion and he knows that he�s the one.  Amanda has a secret. One that keeps her from enjoying life to the fullest, that drives her to help others, that keeps her from getting close to any man. She�s absolutely sure that Josh Marshall will prove no different. She�s heard about his past; he�s known as quite the lady�s man. But he�s out to prove her wrong. And with the right woman, we watch Josh grow into a caring, sensitive and very patient lover.  The axiom �The bigger they are, the harder they fall� is certainly true in Josh�s case and when it�s his turn at the altar of love, he doesn�t like it one bit when his friends, Mick and Zack, razz him the same way he�d done to them on many occasions. His testiness makes him believable and endearing.  The dialogue�s snappy and the love scenes are hotter than hot. And Ms. Foster has no equal when it comes to creating friendship, camaraderie and the sometimes wackiness that exists between men who are closer than brothers, bonded together,  in this case, through their professions.  In the Dear Reader section in the front of the book, Ms. Foster tells us about her research for the story and how it led to meeting the man who heads up the South Florida Firefighter�s Calendar Project.  At this time in our history, when the loss of  many of these brave men in New York City is still so vivid in our minds and weighs heavy on our hearts, the chance to help others who have been victims of fires was one I couldn�t pass up.
