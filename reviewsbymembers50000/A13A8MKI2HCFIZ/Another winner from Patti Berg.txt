 At the end of BORN TO BE WILD, we found Max Wilde discovering his sister had been found.  In SOMETHING WILD, Charity Wilde, takes some R&R from Las Vegas' bright lights and heads to Wyoming to see Max, his wife Lauren and Jack and Sam Remington. She never expected to meet up again with Mike Flynn, the pastor who married Max and Lauren and whom Charity snubbed at the wedding reception. But meet again, they do, and when they do the sparks fly.  Mike, a widower for 6 years & now the manager of Sam's ranch (and still a minister), has no intention of ever getting married again. Charity, out to prove to the world that showgirls can indeed be virtuous, has no intention of getting involved with any man. These good intentions are quickly put to the test with the help of Satan. But this Satan is a mustang bent on spiriting away two beautiful & quite expensive horses Jack planned on giving Sam as a gift. Mike is adamant about catching and taming Satan;Charity is just as adamant that some wild things should never be tamed. What ensues is a battle of wills and desire. Mike and Charity develop deep feelings for one another, yet neither is willing to take the final step and make the ultimate show of trust and sacrfice.  SOMETHING WILD is a great follow-up to BORN TO BE WILD. The plot is fresh and very much believable; the characters are endearing and sympathetic. There's humor laced with poignancy as the hero and heroine battle their own personal demons as well as one four-legged one. The book left me eagerly anticipating the next one, Logan Wolfe's story. (Logan is Charity's friend in Vegas).  For Valentine's Day, treat yourself to SOMETHING WILD.
