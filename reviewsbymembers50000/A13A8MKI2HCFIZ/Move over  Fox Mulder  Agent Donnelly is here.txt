 In Trish Jensen's latest, "Against His Will," we have the unlikely Combination of Jake Donnelly, FBI Agent, a bulldog named Muffin, Bob and Scooter (the T-Shirt guinea pigs-trust me, you have to read the  story to get the scoop on these two), and a lovely doggie psychologist,  LeAnne Crosby.   Tough Fibbie that he is, Jake wants nothing to do with  Muffin until he finds out his beloved Aunt Sophie has tied his inheritance  to his care of the dog, and that in the event of his default, all reverts  to the lovely LeAnne.  Quickly, we find out why Jake is so emotional about  one of Aunt Sophie's properties. He's also suspicious  about LeAnne's  occupation and her up-scale resort for humans and their canine owner.  Certain that she's fleecing the unsuspecting, he decides to play along with  the terms of the will if only to debunk the doggie shrink. What evolves is  one of the most entertaining stories I've read in a long time as Jake and  LeAnne at first circle each other warily and then break down and admit  their attraction for each other.  The book had me laughing and, in the  end, crying. It was one of those books I wanted to go on for another 300  pages or so *just* so it wouldn't end. My heart went out to Jake and how  important his Aunt Sophie and Uncle George were to him. And I loved LeAnne  for her ability to get 'close' to him and help him.  I don't know of a  better way to spend a couple of summer days, and if  Amazon would let me,  I'd give "Against His Will" a 6-star rating. I can't recommend  this one highly enough and I'm looking forward to Ms.Jensen's next release.
