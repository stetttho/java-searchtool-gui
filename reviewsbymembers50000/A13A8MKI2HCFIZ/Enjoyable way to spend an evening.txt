 This was the first book I'd read by Lisa Hendrix, and to be truthful, what  caught my eye was the beautiful cover. By the time I finished, I felt I'd  definitely gotten my money's worth. Ms. Hendrix paints a wonderful word  portrait of the Irish village life as I remembered it from my visit to  Ireland. She has also created a hero and heroine with human failings, but  who possess the ability to know when they are wrong and apologize. I  enjoyed the interaction between Brian Hanrahan and Tara O'Connell and while  the storyline involving the women of Kilbooly was entertaining, I would  have liked to have seen more focus on the storyline between Tara and Brian,  involving Brian's business ventures and Tara's perceptions and prejudices  about them and Brian.  If you are looking for a way to spend an evening  or two absorbing the flavor of Ireland and getting a love story in the  process, then this book is for you.
