 In this, the 2nd of the Sierra Lavotini mystery series, we find our intrepid exotic dancer/amateur sleuth with another dead body on her hands and herself just a tad bit closer to snagging Det.John Nailor.  Sierra still can outdance the best of them and still has a penchant for getting herself involved in murder investigations. This time, her protge Ruby Diamond meets a heinous death at the local drag strip. Fingers point to several of the drag strip regulars, Sierra's boss insists she call in her pseudo-uncle Moose, Ma & brother Al show up to lend a hand and Raydean continues in her ongoing paranoia against Flemish aliens. And what, Sierra wants to know, was Det. Nailor doing standing over the body of Ruby? As things start to get heavy, Sierra knows she's in big trouble, but risks her life and her heart to help solve Ruby's murder and get John out of the mess he's gotten himself into.  The one recurring character I despise, is Carla - Nailor's ex. One of these times I'd really like to see this nasty human get what's coming to her and I'd sure like it to be Sierra who dishes it out. The author's next book in this series, Film Strip, is in my short stack on-deck circle of books to read. I only hope Ms.Bartholomew doesn't end the series before Sierra and John reach nirvana.
