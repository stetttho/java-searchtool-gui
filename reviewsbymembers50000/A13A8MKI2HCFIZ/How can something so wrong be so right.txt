 Lucky and Jack love each other. They just can't live with each other. And it doesn't look like the situation is about to get any better. In fact, it's getting worse. Lucky's pregnant. Erin "Lucky" Cahill (photographer for small town paper) and her police captain husband, Jack, have been married less than a year and separated for most of the time. Except in bed, they have to be the most mis-matched pair I've ever seen and no wonder they're constantly on opposite sides of the discussion. They are trying to work things out except lust and Jack's secret past life always seem to get in the way. As soon as Jack finds out Lucky is pregnant he insists on moving back in with her. But is it because he loves her or is it only because of responsibility? The story deals with the two of them coming to grips with Jack's past, Lucky's part in sending a man to prison for a murder he may not have committed, their impending parenthood and their love for each other as they work out their differences. The only thing that kept this from being a 5-star for me was the [in my opinion] unfair treatment Lucky gave Jack when she learned about his past, a minor point that many readers may not share. I am looking forward to reading Jack's sister's story, coming in Spring 2002.
