 For the life of her, Harley couldn't remember if  'professional stripper' was part of her rsum. Not after an accident at the client's house left her without her memory. She figured she had to be, given the state of her  dress and the bachelor party she'd been hired for. But something about her  struck host, Grant Riordan, as being totally out of synch with the picture  she presented. He offers to let her stay at his house, a quiet place where  she can rest and regain her memory. But resting is not quite the way things  work out. In a sizzling story of true first-love, the author makes us  privy to the characters' sensual awakening. Grant, divorced from a cold,  corporate wife, had decided that the loner, stuffed shirt life suited him  just fine, until 'Harley' showed up at his door the night of a bachelor  party for his co-worker. From the moment Harley entered his life, Grant  felt his heart begin to melt. First with concern, then with something much  stronger, for there was no denying the strong sexual tension simmering  between him and his houseguest.  Harley's heart began to pound each time  they came close, until the their attraction could no longer be denied.  Grateful for his generosity and caring while she attempted to patch the  holes in her memory, Harley made sure nothing she did threatened Grant's  position in the community or his job. Little did she know that for Grant,  none of it mattered. She had come to be the overriding reason for his  living. But what would happen when she did recover her lost past? How could  they reconcile the two opposed worlds from which they came?  Private  Lessons is one red-hot love story. Be prepared to turn up the air  conditioning. I may never look at hot tubs or swimming pools quite the same  way ever again. And I won't reveal anything further, except to say: The  ending will leave you breathless.
