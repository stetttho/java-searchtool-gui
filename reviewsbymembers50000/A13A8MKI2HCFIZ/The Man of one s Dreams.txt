 He's the perfect man. He's amiable, always willing to cuddle you in his arms, he won't talk back and he won't leave before breakfast if you don't want him to! Too bad he's a blow-up doll and Lana Martina is stuck with him. An ever-present reminder of her single status, Harry graces Lana's apartment and represents the sum total of her romantic life. Until a mix-up in advertisements sends her Greg Healey-lawyer, entrepreneur and older brother to Will, who decides that singles ad from "Coffee Girl" sounds like the perfect girl for him. Greg, on the other hand, decides that letting Will have free rein could end up disastrous and instead insists he should be the one to check out Coffee Girl. If she checks out, then he'll introduce the two. Little does Greg know that Coffee Girl isn't who he thinks she is and worse! - she's a shop owner set dead center in a part of town that he's bent on razing and paving over. The sparks fly immediately between the two and it looks as if Will might never meet the woman of his dreams.  Although I was aware immediately that Greg looked out for Will's welfare, I never was quite sure what had happened to Will in the past that resulted in his present mental/neurological condition. It was written that he'd taken a nasty fall as a child, but I didn't get the feeling that that had been the cause or vice versa. Also, I didn't feel that Lana's self-centered bimbo brained mother was dealt with severely enough. Personally, I itched to reach out and slap her for her obliviously callous and selfish way of treating her daughter.   After Too Hot To Sleep, readers might be surprised at the toned-down love scenes in Seeking Single Male, and how long it takes to get to one. That's not to say the book isn't good. It is. Two levels of sensuality, same great level of writing.
