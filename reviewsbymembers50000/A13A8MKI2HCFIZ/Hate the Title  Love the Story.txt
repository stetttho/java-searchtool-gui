 This book if definitely an example of how one should not judge the story by its title. Luckily, I'd read a review that piqued my interest enough to overlook the title. I'm glad I did.  Cora Prescott, a professor at a North Carolina college, is researching the diaries of a mid-19th century woman whose house Cora now owns and in which the diaries have been found. Rafael Adriano is an archeologist with a penchant for seeking out old ship wrecks. He's positive the original owner of the diaries was romantically linked to the captain of the ship Rafael is searching for and that the diaries will provide clues to the ship's location. He needs to research the diaries, but one thing stands in his way: Cora Prescott. This could have been a story in which an domineering male simply overpowers the female(physically or emotionally) and takes the diaries for himself. However, Ms. Hart gives the reader a story of two people working out a way to arrive at a solution beneficial to both. The characters are assertive without being overly-aggressive and the cast of secondary characters runs the gamut from sweet to slimy.  Although I have several of Ms. Hart's previous books in my ToBeRead pile, HER PASSIONATE PIRATE,was the first one I'd read, but I'm already looking forward to her next entry in category romance.
