 Jennifer Weiner's first book, GOOD IN BED, made me glad I didn't wait for the paperback edition. When Cannie Shapiro tells her boyfriend she thinks they need time apart for a while, little did she know that her ex's chronicling of their sex life would make her name a household name and change her life forever.  A woman whose father had turned his back on his family, mother has come out of the closet, Cannie nevertheless has found life not-too-hard-to-take and had even come to terms with life in her non-single-digit dress size. But being publicly humiliated in print by her ex-boyfriend was more than she could bear. She sets off on a series of adventures that range from the sublime to the distressful and sorrowful. Cannie has a great group of supporting character, some human-some not, who add spice and richness to the story.  Sometimes funny, sometimes heartbreaking, GOOD IN BED is a story about a women filled with an intense inner strength, who draws upon that strength to get her through some of the darkest moments of her life. I was cheering for Cannie the whole way and she came through like a champ.  I'm already looking forward to the author's next book. I do hope I don't have to wait too long.
