 Yes. I know there are errors and typos. No. I will never be a 'sistah' by any stretch of the imagination no matter how long I live. BUT--- I became so engrossed in the characters and their lives, the color boundaries  disappeared and I found myself reading at night until my eyes couldn't stay  open any longer. I just *had* to know what was going to happen. I did NOT  want this book to end, and it's been a LONG time since I've said that about  any book.  Ms. McDonald has written a book that kept me interested and  engrossed. A book I could not stand to put down at night. She has succeeded  where other highly touted authors did not, at least with me. I believe  there is a sequel planned for Time Will Tell, and I want one fresh off the  press!
