 In a departure from her usual light romantic comedies, author Carrie Alexander stretches her creative wings with The Maverick.  It had been over a decade since Sophie Ryan had last seen Luke Salinger-the day he left her behind: alone and [unknown to him] pregnant.  Over the years, Sophie has managed to keep memories of Luke at bay and get her life back on track.  And she's done all right for herself and her son, Joe.  She's a sheriff's deputy with her ultimate goal to finish getting her degree and say good-bye to Sheriff Ed Warren, a man whose ideas of women leave a lot to be desired.  But her peace is shattered the day a silver-and-black Harley sped past her doing well over the speed limit. And riding it was none other than Luke Salinger. Alexander takes two people, who never fell out of love with each other, and throws them into instant turmoil and intrigue: Heath Salinger, who has more than one secret to hide, the mysterious killings of wild mustangs and the lingering doubt over the parentage of Joe Ryan. There were so many times I put this book down because I couldn't read through my tears that it's a wonder I finished it. Poignant and, at times, heartstring-tugging, The Maverick is one of the best stories I've read. And I hope that Ms. Alexander plans on giving us more along this line.
