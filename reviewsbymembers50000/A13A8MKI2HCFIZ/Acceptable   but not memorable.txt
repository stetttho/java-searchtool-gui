 Readers of Dorothy Cannell's "The Trouble with Harriet" may be disappointed. After such wonderful stories like "The Thin Woman" and "How to Murder the Man of Your Dreams," "The Trouble  With Harriet" drags with little humor and passages more suited to  dramatic soliloquies. More time was spent on Ellie's father's bouts of  depression and ill-humor than I thought was necessary and the premise of  the mystery itself was a bit bland.    I'd really like it if one of these  books were to take Ellie and Ben away from Chittendon Falls on a holiday  and then shove them headlong into a mystery....but please!  Let's get these  two  together without the kiddies and Freddie lurking about.  Frankly, I'd  love to read more of Ben.    Although the book was acceptable, I found  myself skimming and skipping, a sure sign of boredom with a story.
