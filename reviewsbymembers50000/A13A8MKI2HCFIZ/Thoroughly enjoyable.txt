 I've read several of Jane Heller's novels, including Crystal Clear, Sis Boom Bah & Infernal Affairs. Name Dropping tops them all. Bill & Nancy were characters I cared about. Ms. Heller did a wonderful job of  creating two completely different Nancys and putting them into a plot that,  for me anyway, was believable. I'm sure that many of us have, at one time  or another, wondered what it would be like to step into a more glamorous  life and once we'd tasted it, I'm also sure that some of us would be, like  Nancy Z, reluctant to let it go. Bill Harris was a man with a few secrets  himself. How they are revealed and the ramifications to his relationship  with Nancy was one surprise after another, held my interest, and kept me  glued to the story.  Ms.Heller  created an inriguing blend of mystery and  romance and wove them together against the backdrop of two disparate  environments: a pre-school and an upscale jewelry store. The cast of  secondary characters  was not so long as to bog down the story and  contained enough variety to spice it up. I liked this book much more than  Sis Boom Bah, and hope Ms. Heller's next novel is as good as Name Dropping.
