 Talia Trahaern, rescuer of animals and an empath, grew up listening to fairy tales her mother told her. Little did she know that they weren't fairy tales, but the recounting of the mother's real life hundreds of years into the future. The bedtime stories were destined to remain pleasant memories until Devlin Archer and his friend, the wizard-like Baleweg, appear at Talia's door, demanding she follow them back to the future to help save their dying queen. To say Talia is skeptical is a gross understatement, but gradually Baleweg convinces her to embrace her 'gift' and Devlin convinces her to embrace him. She finally agrees to help them and they travel to Devlin's world where we find the most wondrous discovery---tooth decay has been completely eliminated. Seriously though, Talia and Devlin work toward saving the pregnant queen's child while fighting off evil forces who would rather see them all gone. All the while, Talia and Devlin grow closer and closer. But a bold move by the opposition threatens to separate them forever.  Until "The Royal Hunter," I had never read a futuristic-type book, but as long as Ms. Kauffman continues to give readers a can't-put-it-down, good-to-the-last-page story such as this one, I will continue to read them.
