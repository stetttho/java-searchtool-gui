 This romance is a bit of a cross between a modern day It's a Wonderful Life, A Christmas Carol and How The Grinch Stole Christmas. Susan Carpenter, widow and mother, teaches a modern-day Grinch Scrooge, Luke Potter, the true meaning of love and the spirit of Christmas.  Sweet romance, a couple of kisses. Good to put in someone's stocking this year.
