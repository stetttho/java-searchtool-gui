 In this, the sixth of the Savannah Reid mystery series, we find Savannah with double trouble: find the person who is killing off beauty pageant contestants and help her younger sister, Atlanta, understand that no pageant is worth starving oneself for. Of the two, solving the murder mystery may turn out to be the easiest.  Once again, Savannah is joined by Tammy, Ryan Stone, John Gibson and Dirk Coulter (aka Fart Face) as the investigation turns up an abundance of suspects in the first murder and virtually none in the second. Many people wished Barbie Matthews but which one acted on that wish? As nasty as the murders are, Savannah is faced with an even more worrisome problem: it seems sister Atlanta will stop at nothing to attain what she believes is beauty perfection.  With a flair for snappy dialogue and a story that moves along smartly [and intelligently], the author again gives the reader a book to sink one's teeth into and from the blurb on the dustcover, a 7th Savannah Reid mystery is in the works.
