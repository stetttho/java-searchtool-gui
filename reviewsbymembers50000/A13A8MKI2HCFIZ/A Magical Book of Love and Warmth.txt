 Ms. Fuhrmann pens a warm and delightful follow-up to "Mad About Max," which left me looking forward to the last in the Aaronson trilogy, "Miracles for Nick." Joy, the middle child (sandwiched in between her two brothers) has always had a hard time finding her niche in life. Max is a noted psychiatrist and Nick, a lawyer. Both in professions of helping people. Joy was never sure where her talents could best be used. Of course, being a klutz (her words) didn't do much to further her self-esteem. But eventually she discovered that she like raising money for charitable causes and was good at it. She'd founded Ripples, a non-profit foundation that funded small charities. And it's at a fundraiser for Ripples where we are introduced to Trudi St.John and her daughter Sophie. Our 3 fairy godmothers also pop up in the beginning of the book, bent on serious matchmaking while their success with brother Max is still fresh in their minds.  Trudi, planning on re-marrying (and not wanting to take Sophie with her), talks Joy into not only taking Sophie to live with her father, Gabriel, but into delivering the papers giving Gabriel sole custody. Needless to say, my opinion of Trudi took a steep nosedive at this point. Sophie becomes so attached to Joy that Joy agrees to stay on for a while to help Sophie adjust. Of course, the fact that Gabriel St.John is no slouch in the likeability department makes Joy's decision that much easier. The story travels along a path of deepening attachments, blossoming love, meddlesome interruptions from the fairy godmothers and interruptions by Gabriel's assistant (and more?), Helen, toward a satisfying conclusion for all involved, including the reader.  The last book in the Aaronson family trilogy is due out in 2001. In the meantime, you can read more by the author -- writing as Holly Jacobs -- in Harlequin Duets #43, "I Waxed My Legs for This?" coming in January 2001.
