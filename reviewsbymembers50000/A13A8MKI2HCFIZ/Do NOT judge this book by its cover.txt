 The man pictured on the cover is not Sawyer Hudson. Trust me. I don't know  *who* he is, but it's not Sawyer. And raspberries to the people (not the  author)  responsible for this cover. That aside, I want to know where these  guys were when I was younger. I honestly don't know when I've had a more  enjoyable time reading a book. It has caring, compassionate men (who are  also  as gorgeous as all get out), humor, and steamy love scenes. The one  kitchen  scene is worth double the price of the book. And the heroine is no  shrinking violet, given to standing up to these guys and giving back in  full  measure what they dole out to her. All played against a backdrop of  love, respect and protectiveness.  Ms. Foster has again given her readers  a gem to savor along with the  tantalizing prospect of more Hudson  brothers' stories this summer, which  could pose a problem if one needs to  decide which is more important: Weeding the garden or losing themselves in  Buckhorn.
