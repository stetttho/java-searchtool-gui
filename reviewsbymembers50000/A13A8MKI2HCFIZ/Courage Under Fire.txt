 In the last month, I've found myself checking out books and authors I hadn't in the past. Based on comments from other readers, I decided to pick up "The Fire Within" by Kathryn Shay, Harlequin Supperomance #1018 October 2001, a continuation of her original America's Bravest trilogy. The timing of this release could not have been better for me.  Both the hero and the heroine--he a fire department psychologist, she a private psychologist specializing in adolescent behavior--battle private demons from the past (and their attraction to each other) while trying to deal with the present and helping the men and women of the Rockford Fire Department cope with the death of a fellow firefighter in the line of duty.  I found "The Fire Within" to be an excellent book. Very apropos for this time. With the events of past month, I found myself wanting to read stories like this. I believe that in the months to come, we will be seeing more with Firefighter/EMS/police heroes, because in *my* book they are the ultimate heroes.  I'm not ashamed to say I cried when the story got to the point where the hero (suffering with PTSD) finally opens up to the first person ever--the heroine--and tells her what happened on that horrific day that changed his life forever. He'd been a real jerk to her for much of the previous story, but at his point, I understood and forgave him.  His was a terrible burden to bear.  This is the first book I've read from this author, but I immediately found the rest of her books online and ordered them.
