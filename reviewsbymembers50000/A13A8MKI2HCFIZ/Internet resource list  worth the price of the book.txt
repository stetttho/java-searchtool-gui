 Using Linda's book allows me to cut down on the time I use searching the Internet and puts me right where I need to be. The entire 3rd chapter-a resource database(most of which have Internet links)-is alone worth the  price of the book.  ~~Barbara O'Neill, author of Second Chance  (Periwinkle Press)
