 I used to read Amanda Quick's novels as soon as they were released.  For the past couple of years, though, they came to sound like repeats. I found myself disenchanted and hadn't read one until the buzz surrounding The  Wicked Widow intrigued me enough to buy the audio tapes.   Unfortunately,this latest story has nothing to make it outstanding or even  memorable. It's always difficult for me to pinpoint why a book just  doesn't connect with me, especially one that doesn't deserve a failing  grade nor one of excellence. The writing is acceptable, but Artemis and  Madeline and the story line are predictable, and the Vanza aspect is  becoming overdone.  The headstrong & obstinate female and the  grudgingly obliging male have long been a trademark of Quick's stories.  Somewhere along the line, they've all started to sound the same and in the  process I've become apathetic toward them and their plights. I really just  didn't care.  The only bright spot was the reading done by Katherine  Kellgren.  Her melodious voice and ability to create multiple audio  personalities saved the book from my itchy "Eject" finger.   I  was hoping The Wicked Widow would break my long Quick Drought, but alas I  still thirst. I'm hoping her Eclipse Bay, under the name Jayne Ann Krentz  will offer more refreshment.
