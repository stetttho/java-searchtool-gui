 Once in a while, one picks up a book and when all is said and done, they  know they've read one of the year's best. For me, "Daughter of  Ireland", is that book.  I've been an avid fan of cozy mystery writer,  G.A. McKevett, so when I discovered she'd written a contemproary romance  under the name Sonja Massie, I was thrilled to have yet another one of her  stories to enjoy.  Set in New York City and Gormloch, Ireland,  "Daughter of Ireland" is an exquisitely crafted tale of two  strong-willed people, each entrenched in their own beliefs and neither  willing to give an inch. At least, not at first. Moya Mahoney and Rory  O'Brien find themselves at odds over the pub and land left to Rory by his  uncle, which happens to be the only real home Moya had ever known. Rory  sees this as an opportunity to not only expand his corporate empire, but to  bring jobs and security to the townspeople. Moya sees it as a total  destruction of everything she has ever known, loved and holds dear.   Sonja Massie has created a totally believable story with two lead  characters who had me laughing at times, while at other times pulled hard  on my heart, for both Rory and Moya had had less than happy starts in life.  How they manage to compromise over their feelings of distrust and turn them  into feeling of true love and passion that will last a lifetime is a story  that must be experienced.  Ms. Massie's portrayal of rural Ireland and  its people was neither overdone nor glossed over. Her vivid  characterization had me expecting Rory and Moya to step from the pages at  anytime. I only wish Ms. Massie had more romantic stories on backlist. For  now, "Daughter of Ireland" is headed for my keeper shelf and I  can't recommend it highly enough.  For those who would like to read more  by this author, I recommend you look up the Savannah Reid mysteries,  written under the name G.A. McKevett.
