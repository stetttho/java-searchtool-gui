 In "Miracles for Nick," author Holly Fuhrmann continues her fairy godmother series with attorney Nick Aaronson as the last one in his family to get a happily-ever-after.  Trouble is, he doesn't want one and he doesn't want romance. The godmothers, however, have something entirely different in store for him and into his path they deposit one Ms. Glory Chambers.  Glory Chambers, newly divorced from an attorney with an eye for well-endowed women, wants nothing to do with romance, either. She's had her fill. And when an aunt she didn't even know she had leaves her a restaurant in another city, she's more than happy to pack up and leave her past behind. The last thing she wants is a relationship with another man, let alone another attorney. But fate, or fairy magic, has a way of re-arranging life.  With her new employees' (who strangely have no last names or social security cards) help, Glory re-opens the diner only to have her world turned upside down when the fairies are sued by an un-happy customer. Not wanting to lose her new business, Glory sets about to hire the best lawyer the town has: Nick Aaronson.  They get along like oil on water. But as the case continues, and they are forced together, they begin to view each other in a new and more appreciative light. But even fairy godmothers can't order the two to love each other. There is no guaranteed happily-ever-after.  Of the three Aaronson siblings, I like Nick the best, because he was so resistant to love and he really didn't want to believe in the fairy godmothers.  It was fun to watch him and Glory slowly but surely come to grips with their attraction and to finally admit that fairy magic just might exist.
