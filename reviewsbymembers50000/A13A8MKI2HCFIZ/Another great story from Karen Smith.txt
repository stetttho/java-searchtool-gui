 Ms. Smith is an author who amazes me with the amount of ' deep story' she can pack into 200 pages and TALL, DARK&TRUE is no exception. When newly widowed Allison Rhodes discovers a secret about her deceased husband, she turns to her longtime friend, Jase McGraw, for a place to re-group.  While Jase is willing to let Allison stay as long as she needs to, he's more than a bit concerned over the effect she's having on his closely guarded heart and his resolve to not get involved with one woman.  Life has a way of turning things around, however, and through a series of events, both Jase and Allison come to terms with their mutal attraction and their inner demons that prevent them from acting on that attraction.  Definitely recommended.
