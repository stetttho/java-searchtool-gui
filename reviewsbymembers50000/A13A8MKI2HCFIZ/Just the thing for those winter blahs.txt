 If you're looking for something to lift your spirits and chase away those winter doldrums, you only have to pick up a copy of the March Duets from Harlequin, Annie Get Your Guy & Messing Around With Max, both by Harlequin superstar, Lori Foster. Both stories feature characters from Ms. Foster's Silhouette Desire, LITTLE MISS INNOCENT? (2/99) in leading and secondary roles. In ANNIE GET YOUR GUY, Annie Sawyers no longer desires her friend Guy Donovan in a brotherly fashion but rather in a more sensual way. When Guy announces his engagement to another woman, Annie puts a plan into work to seduce Guy and prove that she's the woman for him. If he'd only cooperate! But up against Annie and her sister-in-law, Lace (a noted sex therapist), Guy doesn't stand a chance.  In MESSING AROUND WITH MAX, the last of the Sawyers siblings get bitten by the love bug (older brother Daniel fell hard for Lace in LITTLE MISS INNOCENT?) when Maddie Montgomery runs into Max's bookstore. Literally. How could Maddie have known the glass door was shut! The store's owner, Annie Sawyers, always left it open. How could she have known Annie was away and her brother, Max, was tending the store with his dog, Cleo? Cleo, who likes no woman, takes a tentative shine to Maddie, thereby endearing her to Max. Trouble is, Maddie has no plans for marriage, despite the dog and the dog's cute owner. But when Max and Cleo team up, Maddie might as well kiss her heart goodbye, because this duo isn't about to stop until Maddie says, "Yes!"  Ms. Foster combines her trademark wit and her ability to craft hot and steamy love scenes into two delightful stories guaranteed to get your sap running and put a spring in your step.  If you haven't read LITTLE MISS INNOCENT? I recommend you do so, as it provides a good introduction to the Sawyers family and the rest of the characters.
