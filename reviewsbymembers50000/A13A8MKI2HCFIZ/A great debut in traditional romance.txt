 Her Black Lace books have won legions of fans and now author Emma Holly brings her own special brand of sensual adventures to traditional romance with her first novel, BEYOND INNOCENCE.  The author easily surpasses other authors of erotic romance in this book filled with multi-layered characters, a plot with meat to it and steamy love scenes that are not just page fillers but actually advance the story.  When Florence Fairleigh travels to London in 1873 to meet with her recently deceased father's solicitor, little did she know that the meeting would have far-reaching implications that would affect her life forever. Originally thinking to secure a position as perhaps a governess or teacher, Florence is, instead, thrust into London's social whirl in a plot to encourage a marriage for young Freddie Burbrooke, in the hope of settling him down and sparing him society's censure. In the process, Freddie's brother, Edward, earl of Greystowe realizes he has feelings for his brother's intended-feelings that deepen and finally are reciprocated. But can a true and lasting relationship be built on a foundation of lies?  As much as I like the eroticism of this author's work, in this instance I especially enjoyed the warm relationship between the two brothers, the caring and concern Edward (the older) had for his younger, homosexual brother, Freddie. It softened Edward's dark, stern outward personality and made him more real.  BEYOND INNOCENCE hooked me from the first page and never let me down. I found myself reading long after I would have put another book down for the night just to discover how the situation would resolve itself. Emma Holly's Black Lace books are all on my `keeper' shelf and now that she's taken her skill and talent into the traditional field, it looks as if I may have to add more space on the shelf.
