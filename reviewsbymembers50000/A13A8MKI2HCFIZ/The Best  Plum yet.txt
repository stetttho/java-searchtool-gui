 Hard to believe that Janet Evanovich could top High Five, but with Hot Six, she manages to do just that. Yes. I know who's behind the door. No. I'm not telling. That tidbit is just the beginning of one of the best  novels I've read so far this year. I'd waited a long time for Hot Six to  arrive, anticipation building, and I was not disappointed in any way.    Evanovich's flair for snappy dialogue and creating quirky characters  hasn't diminished a bit. Granny Mazur is just as loopy as we remember and  Rex is still running  his little legs off and Uncle Sandor's Big Blue just  keeps on going.  But now, we have some truly worthy additions to the cast  of whacky secondary characters, not the least of which is Bob, a new 'man'  in Stephanie's life. All add a dash of spice to the latest in the  Plum/Morelli/Ranger saga, which gets more interesting with every page.  The  main characters have become so ingrained in my mind, I almost think of them  as family. Almost.  A truly enjoyable read for your summer enjoyment,  although I would suggest a glass of your favorite drink, heavily iced, to  accompany HOT SIX's high sizzle factor. Then, there's the cake. But that's  Bob's story.  I can't recommend this book highly enough.
