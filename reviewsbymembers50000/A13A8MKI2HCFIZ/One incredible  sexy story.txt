 EXPOSED is one of the first four inaugural books in the new Blaze line from Harlequin. Having been a fan of this author for a long time, I was really looking forward to her contribution and I wasn't disappointed at all. As in her previous books, Ms. Leto gives us a steamy but not over-the-top love story with likeable characters in a well-plotted, believable story, this time with a touch of mystery added.  Ariana Karas is a successful San Francisco restaurateur; Max Forrester makes a name for himself in real estate. Each has been covertly eyeing each other for a year or so each time Max stops by Athens by the Sea, but Max is about to marry a friend (think along the lines of a marriage of convenience). So nothing is more shocking than finding Ariana in his bed the next morning. Not only can he not remember much from the night before [other than it was one heck of a night], but it seems his bride-to-be had bolted for parts unknown prior to the ceremony, leaving behind a cryptic message.  Both Ariana and Max are good people who find themselves the targets of a deliberate set-up, a set-up that could ruin them both. They join forces to uncover the truth and in the process discover some startling and sizzling truths about themselves, not the least of which is the incredible sexual fire that ignites between them.  I knew I was going to like this book when I stayed up way too late at night reading. Ms. Leto evoked sympathy from me for Ariana and Max. They'd both been deceived and poor Max could have died from the drug in his drink, yet instead of flying off on a quest of vengeance, both showed maturity in dealing with the problem.  A good cast of secondary characters and some red herrings in the mystery add depth and tension to the story.  A final note of warning: You may never look at your clothes dryer in quite the same way ever again.
