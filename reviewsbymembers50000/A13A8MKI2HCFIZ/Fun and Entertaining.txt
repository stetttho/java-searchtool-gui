 I originally bought the book because I was attracted to the cover and the back cover blurb sounded interesting. I read it in two evenings and found it a fun book. Easy to read. I liked Laura as a character more than Brent;  I felt the author developed her heroine much more than the hero; put her  through more 'growth' than Brent.  This is a very good debut book, and I  am looking forward to Ms. Ortolon's next release.
