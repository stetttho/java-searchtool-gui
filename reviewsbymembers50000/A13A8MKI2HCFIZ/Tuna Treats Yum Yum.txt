 In order to enjoy this story, you must be willing to overlook a bit of questionable behavior on the hero's part (running out and leaving a naked  stranger in his apartment alone, not ditching the heinous fiance earlier  & being a cat owner who lets his unaltered cat run at large)  and buy  into the fantasy that cats have human thoughts and can, apparently, turn  into humans. Being owned by two cats, I find this a scary thought.  :::grin:::  However, Julie Kenner takes the premise and turns it into a  delightful story that had me laughing in places and in other places had me  muttering, "Just say you love her, Nick!"    At one point,  while engaged in a conversation with Nick's sister (Deenie), Maggie (as a  human) absentmindedly tears open a bag of tuna kitty treats and chows down  half the bag before Deenie's horrified look stops her.  In another scene,  Maggie (as a cat) plots a give the clothes Evil Angela keeps at Nick's  house a look and feel of angora. After I read this, I had a horrible  thought that perhaps my Maine Coon, Esmerelda, plots in a similar fashion  with my hubby's fleece pants and shirts.    All in all, The Cat's Fancy,  was a light and fun story. Ms. Kenner has captured my attention as an  author and I look forward to her next single title, which involves a woman  with X-ray vision!
