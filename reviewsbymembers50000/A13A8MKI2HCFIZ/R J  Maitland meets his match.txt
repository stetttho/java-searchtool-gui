 No doubt about it. R.J. Maitland didn't know what he was in for when he asked his executive assistant to be his wife in a marriage of convenience. His dedicated 'right-hand' had been in love with R.J. for years and would have done most anything, including agreeing to his wild plan to salvage what was left of his reputation. She had only one stipulation: she'd do it, but only if it were a marriage in the full context of the meaning. R.J. has a devil of a time making Dana see things his way. The fact that she doesn't readily agree with on a number of issues boggles his mind. As they work to overcome the damage done to R.J.'s reputation by the local media, and stem the clinic's loss of patients, R.J. comes to realize that Dana means more to him than he ever thought possible. This, however, does nothing to lessen his arrogance. It takes Dana's own show of assertiveness to 'knock him down' a peg or two and force him to realize that she's the best thing that's ever happened to him and if he isn't careful, he could lose everything.   "Married to the Boss" is not a book in Ms. Foster's "Buckhorn Brothers" tradition. Elements in that series, which Ms. Foster developed from start to finish, are missing in "Married To The Boss" (a series whose elements were decided for the writer, to some extent), and there isn't as much humor in this story as in previous books by this author, but that's the nature of the story itself. Was I disappointed? No. My only expectation was Ms. Foster's quality writing. Did I get it? Yes. I think the author did a great job developing Dana and R.J. and putting them through a metamorphosis to a satisfying conclusion.
