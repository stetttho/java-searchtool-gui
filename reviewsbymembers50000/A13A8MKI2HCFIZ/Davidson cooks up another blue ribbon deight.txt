 After waiting a whole year for this new entry on Davidson's menu, I found myself reading straight though and staying up until I finished Tough Cookie. I found myself relating to Goldy's funk over her teen son's 'growing pains' (Been there. Done that. survived!) and I found myself with  heart in throat while reading the descriptions of maneuvering mountain  passes in a blizzard.  Davidson throws enough curve balls throughout the  story to have kept me guessing about the identity of the culprit until the  end.  If there was one thing I would have liked more it's Tom Schultz.  Lovable character, great hubby. And my only big disappointment is having to  wait another year until the next entry is released.
