 The Newsboys offer up their first worship CD as a follow up to their album "Thrive" and it is quite a disappointment.  This CD, while it holds to the pop music style of the Newsboys, it does not hold up to the standard of creativity or musicality set by their previous recordings.  It lacks in creativity and as a worship album it fails to move, at least this listener. "He Reigns" is the first single from the CD and its simple melody and catchy refrain had me anticipating the release of the album.  As it turns out each song has basically the same rhythmic backbeat (snare on 2 and 4), and the songs have very little development, they rarely "climax" into anything very exciting.  There are a couple of familiar songs thrown in the mix, "Lord (I Don't Know)"and "It is You", both nice songs but possibly on the CD as filler because these live versions really don't tap into the energy of the audience like many live worship projects do, and should.  I wouldn't recommend this CD because it is definitely the weakest effort from the beloved Newsboys, especially when compared to their last album which was excellent.  The intent of a worship CD is to offer praises to God and to help a listener be drawn into worship.  While the lyrics do praise God, and some listeners may actually be drawn into worship through the simplicity of the melodies and lyrics, this listener is drawn to hit the "eject" button on the player.  The only reason to buy this CD would be to keep your Newsboys collection complete; otherwise, I recommend some other worship music options. 1 of  5 stars
