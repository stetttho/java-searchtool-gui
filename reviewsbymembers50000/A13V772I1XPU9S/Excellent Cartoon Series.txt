 In this cartoon Jackie Chan must collect Talismans; all have different powers and get Jackie and his cartoon niece Jade and Grandfather into some wild perdicaments. Jackie and the crew need to figure out what powers the Talisman holds and locate it before the villans reach the Talisman's first. I enjoy this cartoon because not only does it contain Jackie Chan but it also has a neat story line to follow and is quite entertaining. It is action packed without being as violent looking as some of Jackie Chan's real live movies. I would recommend this cartoon for Jackie Chan fans. Even the adult ones.  It is worth the time and money.
