 That it was Heath Ledger's twin brother Heath BAR in this movie. I hated the "new found" rock music they played to try to upscale the movie. I probably would have liked this so much better if they'd stuck with more...periodic music. By far the most amusing and most fun was Heath's would-be harald most of the time naked companion. Overall I wish this had been a much better movie.
