 I've read some James Patterson books and have watched Kiss the Girls and I like the detective Alex Cross. I enjoy that they have cast Alex with Morgan Freeman as I could not picture Alex with someone like Laurence Fishburn who rocked with the Matrix. I enjoyed seeing Monica Potter in this movie and though the plot twists and turns I hope to see more from her in the future as she has a lot of potential for these kinds of movies (and not like the one she shares cast with Freddy Prince Jr. in which she kind of played a flake). While I liked the cast, I just thought that there was TOO much jam-packed into the movie. Not enough character development to feel the actors out and not enough to sympathize with the situations. I was dissappointed with this movie but hope to see more from Alex Cross and Morgan Freeman should they decide to keep on the James Patterson kick.
