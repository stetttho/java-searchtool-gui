 That such a wonderful book is out of print! It truly needs to be re-printed. A malfunction with a computer program built to produce life-like holograms plucked six-foot, sexy, scotsman Hazard McAllister from ghostly apparition to a very real life man.  In his time, he had been branded a murderer and sentenced to death, and his ghost had walked the hallways for years looking for a way to avenge his honor and prove his innocense. Now, with the helpful accident thanks to Jamie Kent's brilliant brother, he could discover the truth behind the lies that had been spun and clear his name once and for all. But in doing that he needed Jamie's help.  Jamie Kent grew up terrified of the old house. Every nook and cranny spooked her in some way. Having to come back to the damnable house to aid her ailing but brilliant minded brother made her nervous and jumpy. She'd left behind her work and boyfriend to succeed in helping her brother regain his health. But nothing could have prepared her for the shocking appearence of Hazard McAllister, the ghost she was most deathly afraid of. Please join me in wishing that this book can come back into print so that many more people can read or re-read this novel. It is on my list of favorites and if I had more than one copy I would send it to anyone who wanted it, for it is truly a well written book. Start to finish. You are not forgotten Patricia, I light a torch in your honor.
