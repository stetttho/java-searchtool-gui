 Every book I can get my hands on in this series have never let me down. I am impressed with the way that Nora Roberts/JD ROBB developed and continues to develop Eve's story.  What I'd love to see next is our great Eve going up against the Church for doing something evil/illegal. From all the stories on the news lately I'd love to see our confident Eve bash some heads in and clash wits in that arena. As any fan that has gotten this far will admit, Eve Dallas is the best and the new story and a developed story about what happened to her in Dallas,TX is still captivating. Loved every minute of it and as always am waiting for more. This author is a paragon and I love all of her books.
