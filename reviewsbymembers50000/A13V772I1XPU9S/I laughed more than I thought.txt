 When I picked up this movie I thought sure-fire that it would be a bomb, but prone to watching a variety of movies and some of them less than good, I gave it a try with a dour demenor. It was as coooky as I thought it would be but in the silliest way. Pop corn as tracking devices, a ballon dog, cotton candy body bags, and big silly shoes that leave flouresent foot prints. The acting of "Mike" and "Debbie" was pretty dry and the only one with spice was Mooney, but I gave them a little leeway on that as I was enjoying the comical effect of another "scarey" yet funny Klown.  "It" scared me more but Killer Klowns from Outerspace is a real hoot.
