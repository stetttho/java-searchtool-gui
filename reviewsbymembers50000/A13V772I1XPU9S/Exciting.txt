 When I saw this in theatres when it came out I stood in line waiting for a newly big busted Angelina Jolie flash her stuff all over this movie with a frown and some disgust. I wanted to see a good movie, not a hyped up version of the game with naked shots to amuse and cajole the guys. What I got was a little of both and a pleasing tease of male booty too. Not too bad considering "someone" knew some females would be in the crowd too. Angelina played Croft pretty well and while I've never liked the video games I enjoyed the background history that the movie provided as well as the great kick-... action scenes that had my blood pumping. Obviously the stunts were near as impossible as they could get--I, like most anyone else, would have bruises for the rest of my life in every aspect of action that Laura presented INCLUDING that awesome fight scene on bungee chords. I liked it.
