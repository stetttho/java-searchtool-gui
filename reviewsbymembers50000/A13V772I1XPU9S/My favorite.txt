 Out of all the Janis Reams Hudson books I've read, this one was my favorite. I have read this one over many times. The plot was funny as well as well executed and it drew you in to the story. Most of us do not get a chance to have a close knit family these days and it is wonderful to kick back with the Colton family and share their experiences and wish they were in OUR families. The 'Apache' series lovers will be delighted with this book.
