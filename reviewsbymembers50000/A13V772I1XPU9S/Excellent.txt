 Most of us cannot imagine what our lives would be like without our significant other. I know I can't. When Jason Hill died he left his wife Sabrina behind to mourn him. And though she mourned him everyday and looked for him in every face of the crowd, she decided to move on with her life and try to live again with a man she thought might make her at least half as happy. Steven was a good man. Jason has come back from Heaven to let Sabrina know that the man she is engaged to is not the man for her. That he knows the person who would make her happy and he wants to see them together. Torn by dismay, shock and longing for Jason she is stunned when his choice is pointed out to her. The struggle of trying to be with this new person and still loving and seeing Jason is a wrenching experience for Sabrina. This book was amazing to read. I have never felt such emotion when reading a book and it is amazing to me that this was only published for the month of July in 1994. I am thoroughly glad that I have my copy and can recommend it. I think that any reader looking for a good romance would be happy finding this book in the used bin at a tag sale or bookstore. Keep your eye open. ISBN: 0-373-16542-0
