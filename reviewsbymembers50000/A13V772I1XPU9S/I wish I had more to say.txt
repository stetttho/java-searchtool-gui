 But once again Suzanne Forster has shown that she has so much potential. Her plot was a really good one, but I often felt lost and confused with where she is going with her plots. She leads breadcrumbs to the paths of nearly every character in the book, which isn't a bad thing, it just gets a little old as it seems everyone in the book has a "revelation" at the end. Like life can be solved in one quick week. I mean OK, so you're Mom doesn't like your profession and seems to not give a hoot about you in general; that is allowed to happen in real life. We don't necessarily need to know WHY that is. Most of us never know the deeper reasons why some things are the way they are.  She has a GREAT plot to start with but in this one it seems that she introduces too many characters as being more important than they really are, and for what? It ends up not being most of those people anyway and unless she plans a sequel, we really don't need to know that much about so many characters. I think if she had stuck with the begining and left out some of the personal takes and concentrated on staggering us all with a great begining and ending it would have been all the more satisfying. I will continue to buy Suzanne's books but I will pass over her book to buy a J.D. Robb, Tami Hoag, or a Kay Hooper on my pay-day, to purchase theirs first.
