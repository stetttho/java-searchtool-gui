 As before and all times, Nora Roberts continues to enthrall me and make my imagination run wild with her new series and second book. Three Sisters Island has a Witches Past. One rought of the wrongful prosecution of witches in Salem. The three sisters who forged this island and called it home for a time. Three sister's whose souls are passed on to modern day women with exciting powers. Ripley Todd has been an off-beat loner for a while. While she holds a deputy position on Three Sister's Island she is gruff and abrasive and often rude--trying not to show the emotion that she has inside.  With her brother Zack married to Nell from the first book, Ripley longs to get back to some peace and quiet and leave the love-birds to love and nest and croon when ever and however they wish with her not in the way. When her long time friend and most-times rival Mia Devlin rents the yellow cottage Nell once lived in unknowingly to a stranger Ripley is frustrated that her plans were thwarted and that Nell knows what had lain in her heart--to escape; to be alone. When "tenant" MacAllister Booke, a man with the personal wish and want to investigate paranormal and vastly strange events comes to take residence on the Three Sister's Island in the yellow cottage, after the spectacular and unclear event that took place between Nell (Helen) and her abusive "ex" husband he gets more than he bargained for with Ripley Todd. We get to see Ripley soften with her dislike of magic in this book. And give in to what she was destined for and for a long time rejected. We get to see her happy and angry and we; in our own ways fall in love with her character and with Booke's as well.  Since we already love Mia Devlin, we cannot wait (perhaps I should say "I") until we see how much trouble she gives SAM. (...)  I love this series. Once again, Nora Roberts has made another trilogy of sisters that is loveable and makes us all dream of a close-knit family and or friends that we can only read about.
