 What is it like to be a pre-teen 6th grader. We can remember how awkward we were, clumsy we were, tongue twisted we were, terminally messy we were. Those of you out there who do not know...you were the lucky ones. Jake Stone is such a kid as well. He thinks of himself as a born-again loser with no admirable traits. He wishes that he could be someone else, heck, he wishes that he had a DOUBLE who was perfect and would never do the things that the real Jake does. Margery Wake is Jake's only friend. She has a phobia about getting her head wet and has not washed her hair in a long time. When Jake comes to her with a book called "Change Your Mind and You Can Change Your World" she laughs at the idea that with the power of your mind, you can change something physical; like washing her hair without water. Until something extraordinary happens. Nathan has arrived in town and he looks and sounds but doesn't act like Jake! He has come to stay with the Stone family and help in anyway he can. Nathan does everything the right way the first time and though that is a great thing at first...people start to forget Jake ever existed! In-fact they think Nathan IS Jake. Only Margery can help save Jake against fading away into nothing and to help him recognize his self worth before it is too late. I truly enjoyed this book. My only wish for this book was that Jake had truly realized the worth of himself and had been able to reflect and help the reader see that there are important things that the reader must see in themselves to recognize their worth as well.
