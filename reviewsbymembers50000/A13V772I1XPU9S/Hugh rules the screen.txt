 I picked this movie up after work the day of it's VHS release thinking that I would fall in love with it. I like Ashley Judd and though I cannot stand Greg Kinnear I also "adore" Hugh Jackman since his arrival in X-Men and wanted to give it a try. I guess...I wished there was either more to it or the parts that WERE in it were just played out better. I was disappointed in Ashley's Judd's character and her "Old Cow" routine. It got a little...sickening. Not that I didn't agree on some fronts but the whole movie was about her selfishness and pity party. Hugh Jackman was a good time almost classical "jerk" sometimes which made him adorable but I think he was the one that lit the stage in this performance. Ashley either should have left the role to "Someone Else" or...fought with the director to change her character...
