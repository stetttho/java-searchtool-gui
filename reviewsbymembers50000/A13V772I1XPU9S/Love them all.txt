 X-Files rocked my world when it came to T.V. then I whooped for joy when it came to DVD. A permanent collection of my all time favorite TV show! "Home" still haunts my memory. When I saw that on television I thought that those little green men did NOTHING for me; that the X-Files really knew how to throw a good party! And I enjoy these kind of stories far better. I cannot wait for this to come out in November. I'll have another popcorn session with my couch and enjoy the hours of Season 4 all over again and I love seeing the ones that I've missed!
