 I rented this movie almost cringing, thinking that I would be seeing Saving Private Ryan all over again.  The introduction to the movie echoed Private Ryan but it branched off far into its own category of wonderment as the story progressed. Ed Harris was a refreshing bad man in this movie and while he does some dispicible things, I would have rather seen him in this movie than someone like John Goodman or Jeff Goldblum or someone like them. Harris is a good actor. I enjoyed the tale of Vassily and his "girl" Rachel Weisz (a plesant surprise because I didn't associate the name with the Mummy). It was full of tense apprehension and a well developed story line.
