 To be honest I read this one before all the others because I had no idea that this was the last one in the series (the Volume III) was very small and I guess I just didn't notice. Cassie has made a few mistakes before this book and is brought up before her circle coven on an accusation from another member. She continues to prove herself and her worth with the coven as the book kicks up more dirt. Diana is her best friend...so how could she love Adam? Faye is a member of the coven and yet how could she be so cruel? Nick is so quiet and yet how can she deny the gleam in his eye? Because I do not know the other books of yet I cannot comment on the other ones, but this was a great book and I cannot wait until I purchase and read the first two. It must be a very special feeling to be apart of what these teenagers are in; knowing that they can count on one another and have someone in their corner. That is what I love most about this book. L.J. Smith makes you feel you are apart of the in-crowd and it feels really good!!
