 Danny Johnson has lost Sabrina to a car accident that has saddened his life. He has lost two of the closest people he has ever known and he misses them dearly. Callie Moran is in love with Danny but Danny cannot seem to get over the Larger Than Life Sabrina who died. She has been trying to make him see that they can be together and that he doesn't have to be afraid of being in a relationship and being in-love. But he is hard pressed to believe either. It will take Jason and Sabrina Hill, matchmaking Angels, to get the couple together and on their feet. This was not as good as its prequel. Felt like it was still about Sabrina and Jason and not enough about Callie and Danny this time around. Not enough solid story, like the first one.
