 Once again Eve Dallas takes the stage to stop an Internet dating game that has gone very, very wrong. The deaths of young girls within the ages of 20-26, by a combination of drugs entered into their systems are shocking the city and disturbing Eve's task force. In this novel Eve must go undercover to ferret out a game that is being played by players who think that they are safe from punishment or guilt because they disguise themselves as great poets and capture the hearts of their victims. Little do they know that McNab and Roarke are crack shot computer professionals who are tracking their movements. Once again Eve and Roarke are a hit and I laughed more than once during this book as Eve's modesty and un-girly like procrastination's are downright hysterical. I like how things are going between Delia Peabody and Ian McNab, the tug-of-war they seem to be having is great. It goes to show that J.D. Robb does not just make couples get together and live happily ever after. I finished this book in one night since I bought it from the bookstore and wish I could have drawn it out into a longer affair as leaving Eve and Roarke behind and waiting for the next book is too long a time to wait. I may have to read it more than once. I just can't get enough of Eve and Roarke and I have introduced the books to my friends so that they can enjoy and experience J.D. Robb for themselves.
