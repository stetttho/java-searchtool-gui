 I miss the good old days. Dean Koontz had some real winners a few years back. Strangers, Watchers, The Bad Place, The Servants of Twilight, Darkfall, Cold Fire...These were excellent books. From the Corner of his Eye starts out strange and ends strange in an almost un-Koontz kind of way. Like he is competing with Stephen King's alien/weasel streak (Dreamcatchers). Junior Cain has a killer's instinct and when he gets the urge to off his wife it is a spontaneuos kind of instinct that gets him into more trouble than he realized. Bart Lampion is born with an incredible gift for achievement and life even though the things surrounding him are enough to break a sane man (or woman). Thomas Vanadium is a man that understands Bart's gifts and is hunting Junior for a crime he knows he committed. I felt that this whole story was...on a sliding board and the peices were just too many to be put together. So many different people involved and so many different sub plots in the story and it just seemed to make me more dizzy than interested. Please Mr. Koontz....revert back to your old style stories. The alien thing is past old with King and it is getting cranky with you.
