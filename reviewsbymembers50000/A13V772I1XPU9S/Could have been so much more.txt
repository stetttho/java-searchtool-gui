 I enjoy Suzanne Forster's books but each time I read one, especially like Angel Face, I wish she put a little more into them. Her plot(s) seem to be solid, such as Angel Face's was. Serial killer in doubt; a single gorgeous rich doctor tracks her down in Mexico out of intrigue. OK I could buy the plot, but I just feel as if the writing doesn't get beneath the surface of the plot to make me believe in it. I mean I totally thought Angela Lowe was off her rocker when she had Jordon all tied up and was "torturing" him. I mean you look at that, and some books make you believe that even the impossible can come true, but it seemed too much like a male fantasy and not what a skittish, amnesiac female would do. And what was with the fruit juice??? I just couldn't buy that Jordon could love Angela, maybe lust after her body, but not love her-- she seemed like such a nut case and most people make wide leeway for crazy people, especially hunky single doctors (the saw-bones ones anyway). I thought Blush had excellent potential but even that did not live up to the expectation that I thought it could have...but then Suzanne is a published author and I am not. I like Suzanne Forster, I just wish she had more ink on the paper. I hope to read something excellent from her soon and recount my beliefs on her stories.
