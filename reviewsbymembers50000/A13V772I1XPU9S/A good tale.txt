 When young maiden Saxon, Nicholaa, defended her homeland against Norman invaders (with a slingshot and arrows) she becomes a legend among the Norman people and is sung about by a herald. When Royce, the proud, gentle, and yet stubborn Norman Baron comes to claim Nicholaa for his King, William the Conqueror, (who wished to give Nicholaa to his worthy Barons as a "Prize" along with her homeland) he is astonished and bewilderingly attracted to Nicholaa's and her wild pagan spirit and remarkable appearance. Nicholaa defies Royce at every turn finding her self more indebted to him as her journey progresses. In the London court the tides are turned when Nicholaa's selfless deed is declared a true hero's event and she is granted permission to choose her own husband. This story was well told but I had a hard time swallowing Nicholaa giving in to Royce when he demands her near servitude demenor. I think that in today's society it is so hard to make a connection with that kind of story for even when she rebelled it was frustrating when Royce came back acting like a jerk. I just wanted to poke my head in the book and stick my tongue at him while sweetly giving him the finger.    He did turn around a far cry later than I'd hoped he would have.  I did like the book as the story progressed but I wouldn't rate it as a second read.
