 I've never seen Ally McBeal before this weekend. I rented the DVD version and saw 6 episodes and I liked them. I thought Ally can be a little flaky at times but I really enjoyed the shows. I wish there had been more. I immediatly was hoping for the next set to be available as it doesn't state it is the first season, it just states that it is the first set; but there was nothing else in the aisle for the show. I'm dissapointed there aren't more yet! Please, please put out more soon!
