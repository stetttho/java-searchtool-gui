 I'm not sure what I expected when I watched this movie but I was pleasantly pleased with it.  I laughed at all the right places and found it very entertaining. Lou was indeed very cute and I loved Mr. Tinkles. The Russian cat was pretty funny too. I think that if you pick up this movie with a few laughs in mind that you will enjoy it immensly. If you pick it up looking for a barrel of laughs...well that depends on your sense of humor.
