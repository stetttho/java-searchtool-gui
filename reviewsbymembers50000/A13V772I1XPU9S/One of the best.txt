 In 1571 Marea MacKenzie was the sole survivor of a brutal massacre at Kilclearnon Castle at fifteen. The siege of the castle by the Graham family has left Marea vowing to avenge the deaths of her family and kinsmen and reclaim the castle for the MacKenzie namesake once and for all. Chase Graham had saved Marea of a terrible fate in 1571 that allowed Marea to escape the massacre. Now, 10 years later he wanders into her hiding place where she is known as Agatha the Witch, feverish and bloody from battle. While her pride tells her to kill him quickly, her heart longs to save him. And her destiny calls out for her to love him. This book was very well written and from page one I was hooked. Marea is the kind of woman that most want to be like. A tad headstrong but full of pepper and courage. I adored the swash buckling sword fights and the sway Marea has between loving Chase Graham and loving the Castle that was once her home.
