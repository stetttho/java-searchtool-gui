 Maggie Barnes is an empathic sketch artist who can see the face of a killer through the eyes and tales of the victims involved in the case. But this time it isn't that easy, the victims have died or have remained living without the use of their eyes. John Garrett's sister was the second victim of the Blindfold Rapist and he intends to see that the killer is brought to justice and he intends to have Maggie's help. Hollis Templeton is the only surviving victim of the Blindfold Rapist's brutal assault and when she starts hearing someone's voice in her head talking to her, she starts to wonder if she isn't just plain crazy. But Hollis needs to see again, one way or another, because she needs to help Maggie and the voice who has come to help her. Kay Hooper is stictly amazing. Her stories of the paranormal and gifted are a new twist to the romance category. One wishes when reading Kay Hooper's books that maybe for one day you could experience what it is like to be gifted, and yet be horrified at the same time. I adore Kay's use of characters in this book, bringing to light once again the team of FBI agents that we have seen before in Kay's other books in this series. This book is a treat that people looking for a different stroke of Romance, Intrigue, and Murder will surely enjoy.
