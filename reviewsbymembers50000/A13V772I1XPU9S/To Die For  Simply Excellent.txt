 Willow Evans has always been attached to Beaches, her Grandmother's house on Cape Cod. Even as a little girl the charming cottage was a paradise and "Willie" was left to imagine a pirate playmate roaming the beaches of the Cape Cod house along side her travels. Left as an inheritance Willow intends to keep her grandmother's house intact and live there as she always dreamed. But Doctor Jonathan Raven has other plans. He wants that house. There is something within that house that will allow him to become whole again. He is a nightwalker, a drinker of blood, and he needs his "shade"/soul who was ripped from him centuries ago and who now wanders the house Willow so lovingly protects. He needs to perform the ritual that will return him to the Human race... But his shade is confused. As a "shade" Johnny has roamed Beaches for years, returning there with no inclination of who he was or how he became the way he is. He is terrified of the man who looks like him but is not him but he does not know why. He has been watching over Willow and until now, has not been noticed by her as he can only been seen in mirrors... A shame this was not published through a bigger company. It did not deserve to die a month after its release. A terrific read. No one who likes Vampire tales will want to pass up the opportunity to find this book and read it. It was well written and has a terrific plot. ISBN- 0-373-25642-6
