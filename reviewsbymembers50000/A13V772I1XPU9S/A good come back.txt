 There was only one thing I liked about JP2 (when the trailer is upside down and the woman is laying on cracked glass--that whole scene was terrific) and there were MORE things I liked about JP3. What a come back! But...it was SO SHORT! It had nearly everything I wanted to see in it but just seemed that there was little room for character development to introduce the new people. Tia Leone's character....was a tad depressing. When I knew she was going to be in it I thought that I was going to be impressed...instead I was just, amused and or left disgusted; sitting there just shaking my head at her stupid antics. They could have casted her with a better part to play as "Mom". She was kind of a twit as she was. But I really enjoyed the movie otherwise. While JP2 is going to collect dust on someone elses' video cabinet, I'll let JP3 collect a little dust in mine and be more satisfied.
