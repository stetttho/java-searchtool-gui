 For those of us who are Clive Cussler fans, WE will not be dissapointed with this addition for our bookshelves. I was very pleased with the layout (as with all of Clive's books)of the book as well as the story line.  As usual Clive spins the tale from the ancient times and works it into the present day story for Dirk and Al to discover. From the depths of the Ocean to the land, Clive does not fail in entertaining his fans with well painted scenes. You do not need to be a member of NUMA to understand the terminology used or the plots that are underfoot. Clive also never fails in tying historical events into his story and the addition of Jules Vernes in this story was very exciting~ it's something like "What Could Have Happened" and tho sometimes far fetched, very entertaining. I do need to say BRAVO on the ending. Very well done with the introduction of those two very special people. I just hope it isn't some sort of cloning tease for his next book. Until then I will be awaiting the next book. Looking forward to reading more from Clive Cussler! I am hooked.
