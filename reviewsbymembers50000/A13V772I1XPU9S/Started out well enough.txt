 This book started out well but I wasn't enchanted with the ending. Marissa Quinn is a cattlewoman from Montana who flies to Seattle to visit her sister Leslie when she gets a disturbing letter from her. In Seattle she meets David and Diana Woodward, two peculiar people who seem to be hiding something. Alek is warrior from the time of the Druids and the Romans who has been brought forward in time into Marissa's world where he can amazingly speak and understand the language. He knows that he has a limited amount of time in the new world and he may never get back home if he cannot perform the ritual with the Night Orchid. While I enjoy Patricia Simpson's stories about the paranormal and time travel, I was not overjoyed with this particular book. There was a story line, it was just not my kind of story. It was however, well written.
