 Pay the extra $...bucks and get this version over the American one.  The American version is skimpy, with less than an hour on disc 1, and just barely over an hour on disc 2, while this Australian version has over 77 minutes per disc, and includes more of his best material, including "I Want You", a hit that was left off of the American version.
