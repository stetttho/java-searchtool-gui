 Before I get to the negative, let me start off by saying that disc one is EXCELLENT.  Every song is featured in it's original, unaltered form (including the 7:30 minute version of "You Can't Always Get What You Want, not the single version).  Every track is a gem on this disc.  Now, when we get to disc two, the disappointment sets in.  I counted EIGHT (8) songs that were edited, some severely.  Miss You, Beast of Burden, Fool to Cry, Mixed Emotions, Anybody Seen My Baby?, Undercover of the Night, Emotional Rescue, and It's Only Rock N Roll have been butchered by anywhere from 30 seconds to TWO MINUTES.  WHY OH WHY??  I would have easily sacrificed one or two of these second rate "new" songs for the full length album versions of the classics.  But then I guess they couldn't have called it "40 Licks".  Anyway, I give it 3 stars just for disc one alone.
