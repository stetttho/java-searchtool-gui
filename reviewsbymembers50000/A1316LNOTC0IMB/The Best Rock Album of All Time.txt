 A masterpiece in every sense of the word.  Pink Floyd's epic, sprawling tome on loneliness and isolation should be in every serious rock collectors shelf.  There isn't any album out there that sounds anything like this, and probably never will.  It also contains the greatest Pink Floyd song of all time, "Comfortably Numb".  Forget Eminem, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, or whoever the flavor of the month is, this IS Rock and Roll.
