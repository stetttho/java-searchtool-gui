 All the songs here are good, but like a great many "Best Of"  sets, there is a lot missing that should be included.  Like Van Halen, Ozzy  Osbourne, Bruce Springsteen, Fleetwood Mac, etc, you just can't get the  essential songs on one disc.  It's impossible.  Let's hope that a  "Volume 2" will soon be in the works.  Here are some suggestions  for the next one:  1.)Revolution Calling 2.)Speak 3.)Another Rainy Night  4.)Best I Can 5.)Anybody Listening? 6.)Road to Madness 7.)Gonna Get Close  to You 8.)I Will Remember 9.)Prophecy 10.)Last Time in Paris  11.)Scarborough Fair 12.)Real World 13.)Disconnected 14.)Lady Jane  15.)Cuckoos Nest 16.)Spool
