 I've had this cd for quite a while now but wasn't sure what I really thought about it.  At first listen, it's very unusual.  The shifts in tempo and time signature changes can sometimes be jarring.  The vocals and lyrics  seem to be deliberatley lowered, so as not to place as much importance on  them as the music.  If catchy hooks are your thing, this is probably not  the place to look.  However, I did feel the final track, "Noni"  seemed to have the most "pop" feel to it, which isn't an  altogether bad thing, since I liked the song.      This is a pretty good  debut.  It kind of reminds me of Pink Floyd's "Piper at the Gates of  Dawn."  Experimental, bizzare, and not entirely commerical.  I'd  rather hear more bands like Chigger any day then stuff like Ricky Martin,  Backstreet Boys, and Britney Spears.  I hope to hear more from them in the  future.
