 For many artists, it seems, the US always gets the short end of the stick (literally) when it comes to greatest hits cd's.  On this cd, you get all the same songs that are on "Every Breath You Take - The Classics", minus the song "classic rock" remix of "Message in a Bottle" and the 1986 version of "Don't Stand So Close to Me", which is not an improvement on the original.  Instead, you get "So Lonely", "The Bed's Too Big Without You", "Tea in the Sahara", and my personal favorite "Synchronicity II".  Now if it just had "Driven to Tears", it would be perfect!
