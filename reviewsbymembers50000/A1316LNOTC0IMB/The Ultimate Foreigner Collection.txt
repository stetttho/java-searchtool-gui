 This is the collection that all Foreigner fans have been waiting for.  Not  only do you get all the hits featured on "Records" and "The  Very Best and Beyond", but you also get a lot of great album tracks  and solo stuff.  Three solo Lou Gramm tracks are included, and a couple of  Mick Jones songs also.  It's also cool to see such non hits as  "Starrider," "Headknocker," "Blue Morning Blue  Day," "I Have Waited So Long," "Down of Love," and  "Break it Up" included here.      Naturally some Foreigner fans  might have a gripe about an omission of a favorite song.  Personally, I  would rather of had "Fool For You Anyway" or "The Damage is  Done" over "At War With the World."  And I think  "Tramontane," from the "Double Vision" album, is a  better instrumental choice than "Street Thunder" (an outtake from  the "Agent Provocateur" album).  Still, you can't really argue  with the tracks included here.  It's a great set, and Lou Gramm is one of  the best American vocalists in rock and roll today.
