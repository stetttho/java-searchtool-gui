 It's obvious that the record company made this cd to capitalize on the recent craze of "Greatest Hits" albums started by "The Beatles 1" cd.  They're trying to put all of Rush's best songs on one cd to appeal to the average consumer that isn't a big Rush fan.  If you're a die hard Rush fan, you have no need for this cd.  However, if you don't want to delve too deep into the Rush catalogue and only like "Tom Sawyer", "The Spirit of Radio", "Freewill", "Limelight", and "Subdivisions", then this cd is perfect for you.  Hopefully the newbies that will buy this album will like the music enough to want to go back and buy the original albums, which can only be a good thing, since the kids these days listen to too much [crud] like Avil Lavigne and Britney Spears.  4 Stars for the great music.  One star deducted because of the overkill of greatest hits packages by this band.
