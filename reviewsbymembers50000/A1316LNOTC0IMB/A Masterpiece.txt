 Probably one of the best games I've ever played.  I was completely blown away by all the little details in this game.  The deterioration of the car as you run into things, the accuracy of the crashes.  The thrill of getting into high speed pursuits.  The determination of the police to take you down once you start killing their own.  It's great!  Another thing that makes this game so great is that you don't even have to do the missions to have hours of fun.  Just explore the city, comitting random acts of violence, and try to out-run the cops.  It gets even more exciting once you have built up an arsenal of weapons (including hand grenades) where you can do maximum damage.  Definitely not for kids though.
