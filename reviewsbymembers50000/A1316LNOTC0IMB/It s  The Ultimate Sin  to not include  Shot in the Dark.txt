 Ok, I guess it's now a well known fact that Ozzy hates "The Ultimate Sin" album, but why try to act like it doesn't exist?  Not only is there not any songs from that album on this cd, it's not even mentioned in the essay or the discography!  This cd is called "The ESSENTIAL Ozzy Osbourne".  Wasn't "Shot in the Dark" one of Ozzy's biggest hits?  Regardless of how Ozzy feels about it, isn't that an all time fan favorite, and shouldn't it have been included here?  Absolutely positively YES.  However, I'm still giving the cd 4 stars for what IS on here.  For the most part, the song selection is dead on.  I always thought "Ozzmosis" was a very underrated album, but it's prominently featured here with 4 tracks.   And they managed to pick the best songs from the rather weak "Down to Earth" album.  Also, just to let the die hard fans know, the tracks from "Blizzard of Oz" and "Diary of a Mountain" are the newly remixed versions, not the originals.  Personally, with a few exceptions, I can barely tell the difference, but I'm sure this will upset the purists.  Overall, a great package for someone who doesn't want to shell out for all the original (and often uneven) albums.
