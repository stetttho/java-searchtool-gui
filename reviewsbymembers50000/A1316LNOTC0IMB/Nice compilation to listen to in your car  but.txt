 Pink Floyd is not a greatest hits band.  It would be impossible to summarize their brilliant career in only two cd's.  All the albums from Meddle to The Final Cut need to be listened to in their entirety to truly appreciate the work.  However, each album does have its highlights, and those are nicely presented here.  Since I already own all the original albums, I only picked this one up for the unreleased track "When the Tigers Broke Free", and it also makes a great cd to play in the car, rather then taking 5-6 cd's.  Hopefully beginners will listen to this album and from that, they will buy the original albums.  But to capture the true, "best of" Floyd, they would need to release another 2 CD set.  Here are my choices for a 2nd best of: 1.) Interstellar Overdrive 2.) Lucifer Sam  3.) Let There Be More Light  4.) Apples and Oranges  5.) Julia Dream  6.) The Nile Song  7.) Green is the Colour  8.) Granchester Meadows  9.) Careful With that Axe, Eugene  10.) Point Me at the Sky  11.) Fat Old Sun  12.) Childhood's End  13.) Free Four  14.) The Gold It's In The...  15.) Brain Damage  16.) Eclipse  17.) Welcome to the Machine  18.) Have a Cigar  19.) Dogs  20.) In the Flesh?  21.) Mother  22.) Young Lust  23.) Run Like Hell  24.) The Final Cut  25.) On the Turning Away  26.) Take it Back
