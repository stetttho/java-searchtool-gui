 This box set has two CD's more than necessary.  Several of these songs are repeated two to three times!  After owning this box set for a few weeks, I decided to make my own compilation and burn it onto a CD.  I only needed TWO 80 minute cd's to fit every single unique song (no duplicate songs), without leaving anything out.  It's just startling that there is so much duplication on this box set when there are still tracks missing from "Last Time Around"!
