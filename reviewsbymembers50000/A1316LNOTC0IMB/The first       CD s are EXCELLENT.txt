 This is a VERY good box set of the Best of Black Sabbath.  It covers all  the great Ozzy and Dio tracks from Black Sabbath.  Only during the second  half of the 4th disc does the quality begin to drop, where it seems like  there's a new singer with each song.  Almost every significant track is  here, though it would have been nice to have "Fairies Wear  Boots"and "Solitude" from the Ozzy era and "Lady  Evil" and "Children of the Sea" from the Dio era.  All other  incarnations of Black Sabbath are dispensible.  But it's still a good deal  for the price.
