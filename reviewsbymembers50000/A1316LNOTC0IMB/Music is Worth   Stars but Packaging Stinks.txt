 The music on these 7 cd's is absolutely essential Queensryche (well, except maybe "Hear in the Now Frontier").  However, even that cd has some particularly good bonus tracks from the "MTV Unplugged" sessions.  Where this box set truly is lacking is with the packaging.  Each CD is presented as a "mini LP", which would be okay if they were exact replicas of the old albums, but THEY AREN'T!  The back of the "mini LP" has the new cd artwork featured on all the individual remastered cd's.  What's worse is that there are NO liner notes, NO lyrics, NO pictures, NO artwork of any kind in this set.  Yet if you buy the cd's individually, you get all that stuff.  So if you buy the box set, you might save a few bucks, but you are still getting ripped off.  The "mini LP" design seems very flimsly and likely to tear over the years, while the individual cd's are stored in the hard "jewel case" which should provide years of enjoyment.  Buy these cd's separately and forget this box set.  It does not do justice to the band.
