 I wanted to take this game back after about the first 25 minutes of playing it, but I decided to give it the benefit of the doubt and see if it got better with time.  Sadly, it did not.  The graphics are mediocre, the music is terrible, and the missions are both frustrating and boring.  The only slightly fun thing about the game is the CHAOS mode where you can randomly mow down innocent civilians with a chain-gun, but even this gets boring pretty quick, as the same people just keep reappearing.  It's very sad, considering how great GTA3 was.  I hope Rockstar Games releases GTA4 soon to get the bitter taste of "State of Emergency" out of our mouths.
