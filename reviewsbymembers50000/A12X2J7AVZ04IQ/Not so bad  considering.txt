 I've read almost everything John Saul has written. He definitely has no problem with eliminating major characters to drive the plot. I have read other reviews, and I agree that much of the stuff was repetitive, but I did enjoy and feel for the characters, especially the doctor. Mr. Saul has no problem killing kids, and has always been unnerving to me, especially in his first book, "Suffer the Children". Other books, like "Shadows" and "Cry for the Strangers" killed off kids as if it was a natural thing. Sure, it's not pretty prose, but Mr. Saul spares no one to move the plot along. "The Homing" had good characters, solid drive and an interesting premise, as well as the really bad requisite bad guy. I enjoyed it. Saul spares no one. Everyone is fair game. Unfortunately, just like life..
