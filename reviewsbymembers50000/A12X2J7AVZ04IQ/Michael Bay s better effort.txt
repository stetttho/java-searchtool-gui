 This was not bad, considering Mr. Bay's track record. There were lots of explosions 'n stuff, which are his trademark; and Ewan MacGregor and Scarlett Johanssen had great chemistry; Steve Buscemi was, as usual, excellent in a small role. Without blabbing away the plot, I'm only wondering who would take care of the survivors. Famiy? Friends? Welfare? Enjoyable, though, and a good DVD, but the only extras are about the special effects.
