 I saw this film first in 1963 as the 2nd half of a double-bill; American-International pictures usually put out the Corman/Poe films which were mostly under 90 minutes in length, and they filled up the time by throwing this off as a 2nd bill. It was certainly better than "The Comedy of Terrors" (1st bill). Here we have Curtis Harrington before he "went Hollywood" (Who Slew Auntie Roo?, etc.), an intuitive director who creates an atmosphere that's hard to describe; slow moving, never boring, always compelling. An innovator of the "indie" scene, Harrington couldn't find a distributor in 1961, but A-I picked it up. There's a wonderful bongo/jazz score and a wonderfully understated and heartfelt performance from Dennis Hopper (before he tried to impress everyone with his individuality and maverick style). The photography, often in dark venues, is remarkably clear and atmospheric. There's also the excellent Luana Anders, who, along with Salome Jens, was never given the career she deserved. The style of this film seems to suggest a mood which the great John Frankenheimer later perfected ("Seconds"). Not a horror film, "Night Tide" certainly had a head-start on the psychological suspense stories that became popular. Definitey worth a look!
