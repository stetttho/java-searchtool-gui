 I've read some of the other reviews, and they blab away the plot. I won't do that. What's important is that this is a first screenplay from Alan Ball, and he deserved his Oscar. Sam Mendes put it all in perspective, and brought a brilliant cast to fruition. A lot of this is about middle-age angst, but there are terrific insights about current young person's issues. Wes Bentley is wonderful, as is Thora Birch, and, later, Mena Suvari. The film really centers around Kevin Spacey and he deserved his Oscar. Some may take issue that Annette Benning should've won. (She lost to Hilary Swank, who was in almost every frame of "Boys Don't Cry")Phenomenal extra characters, and Chris Cooper was exceptional as Bentley's gung-ho military father (nominated for a SAG award). Peter Gallagher hasn't had as good a role since Altman's "Short Cuts". His scenes with Benning are amusing.The plot twists are plenty, and the ending already told at the beginning. The problem with the current DVD is that there were alternate endings, not included; and it would really be fun to find out other things might've been going on.  The resolution was so open-ended, I'd love to see what Mendes & Ball had in mind as alternatives. Awards Edition? OK. A real edition? That might be fun.
