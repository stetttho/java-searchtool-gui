 It's hard not to love this film. The energy level is high, the acting is impeccable (Cher really found her niche), the direction tight and the screenplay clever and original. (It's hard to think of Sally Field in Cher's role, as originally planned.) My only complaint is that, at this moment, I'm watching this film on Turner Classic Movies in a 1.85:1 LBX, though the only available DVD version is full screen. Does anyone out there wonder why we can't have a LBX DVD version? No doubt, the film is a riot, and its references to opera are so approprate, so much so that the great Russian basso Fyodor Chaliapin came out of retirement to play the grandfather (walking the dogs). Olympia Dukakis, John Mahoney, Vincent Gardenia, Nicholas Cage and Danny Aiello create the perfect cast, centered around a no-holds-barred performance from Cher that's as perfect as they come. Ah, the power of the moon...and all that glorious music! What a treat!
