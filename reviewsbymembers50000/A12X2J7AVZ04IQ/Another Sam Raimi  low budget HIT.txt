 I really like this film.  I really like ghost stories. My favorite ghost films aren't available on DVD, and the incredible Sam Raimi created the perfect atmosphere to keep me sated until they do. Billy Bob Thornton's script had every element needed to satisfy this crave, and Raimi assembled an incredible ensemble to execute the final result. Cate Blanchett is magnificent (as always), and she takes you down her road of discovery with innocence and conviction. The biggest surprise, of course, is Keanu Reeves. HE CAN ACT! It was a treat to see him let down some barriers and create this horrible monster of a character. The entire ensemble is amazing (Greg Kinnear, Hilary Swank, Katie Holmes, Gary Cole), but aside from Blanchett, acting honors must go to Giovanni Ribisi as the sweet, confused village idiot ready to go over the edge. Michael Jeter also shines as a reprehensible defense attorney.  I hate it when people blab away plot points, so I won't do that. What Raimi has done is to take a wonderful story and give it his own inimitable spooky touch. Everyone is suspect, and I was shocked, scared and surprised at how it all evolved. Until THE HAUNTING ('63), THE INNOCENTS ('61) or THE UNINVITED ('44) are available, this would be your best bet on DVD. This is pretty much of a folk tale, but if you're looking for a recent honest-to-goodness Haunted House story, you might check out THE OTHERS (Nicole Kidman). The DVD transfer is excellent ( a good 1.85:1 LBX, like most indies), there's one of those gratuitous "extras", where the cast and director all talk about how wonderful each other was; a music video by Neko Case & Her Boyfriends (very folksy), and some trailers. One interesting note (to me, anyway): Giovanni Ribisi was nominated for Best Supporting Actor by the Independent Film Awards; other than that, I know of no other awards recognition.
