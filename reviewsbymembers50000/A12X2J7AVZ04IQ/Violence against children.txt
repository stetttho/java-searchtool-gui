 OK. It's silly. I still like this film for it's flaws. Linda Hamilton & Peter Horton are reliable as the adult leads, and I'm usually appalled by bad kid-actors, but there are so many of them that I had a good time. One kid actor, Anne-Marie McEvoy (as Sarah) was believable.  This film starts out well, and really grabs you; after a while, the kids appear and make it a crazy exposition of silliness. The bland setting of Nebraska (actually, filmed in Iowa) adds to the initial interest. Credit must be given to director Fritz Kiersch for his great use of sets and creating a certain tension, and the music of Jonathan Elias (reminiscent of Jerry Goldsmith's THE OMEN) was effective. Still, there's no forgiving the performances of John Franklin (Isaac) and Courtney Gains (Malachi, who looks like a cross between Alfalfa & Eddie Haskell). They were so atrocious, but, mixed with all the other horrible kid-performances, it becomes a laff-fest. One kid, Amos (John Philbin), looks like a young Tom Cruise, and goes to his death with a toothy smile that's borderline corny (forgive the pun). The film is entertaining, as long as you don't take it seriously. It is based on a 15-page Stephen King story, but it kind of takes on a mystique of its own. The DVD version has a slight LBX which adds to some of the beautiful landscapes. Don't write this off; it's fun.
