 A lot's been said about how bad this film is; I like it for its flaws. It reminds me a bit of those old 50's films about good people in bad situations. Paltrow and Schaech are beautiful as the young loving couple, and Lange, one of my favorites, seems to be researching her role in "Titus", as Tamora, Queen of the Goths. There are two things about this film that make it remarkable to me. The music of Christopher Young is consistantly eerie and complimentary to the action. And, mostly, the wonderful performance of Nina Foch (remember her as Moses' mother), as the only one who knows what's going on. She's worth your time, even if the rest of the film is trivial. Not really that bad, if you like a decent suspense story.
