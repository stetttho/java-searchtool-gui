 With all the garbage on DVD, when can we expect this great film? Robert Aldrich put together a fine old ensemble cast, and it was clever and well written. It was nominated for 6 Oscars, including one for the great old Agnes Moorehead. It won nothing. Black & White photography has rarely been so crisp and clear, and watching all the greats chew up the scenery... well, it just doesn't get any better. Bette Davis, Mary Astor, Cecil Kellaway, Agnes Moorehead...also over-the-edge performances from Olivia de Havilland & Joseph Cotten...hammy but fun! Anyone out there that thinks this is worthy of a DVD? 11/19/05 Now I have the DVD and it's great, though the LBX is only 1.85:1.
