 The DVD version of "Paint Your Wagon" is as good as it gets. The 2.35:1 LBX shows outdoor panoramas that are often breath-taking. Lee Marvin had recently won the Oscar, followed it with "The Dirty Dozen", and shows a confidence that carries this film to new heights. He's never been so good, or as good, since. The Lerner & Loewe score is wonderful. Marvin's "Wand'rin' Star" is actually quite touching, and Harve Presnell is here to give justice to the best song in the show, "They Call the Wind Maria". These songs are augmented with excellent support from the chorale of the legendary Roger Wagner. Additional musical ideas came from Andre Previn. What a great effort from the greatest musical icons of the period! Top this off with a screenplay by Paddy Chayevsky (very loosely adapted from the stage show), and it's a bawdy, irreverent and totally fun film. Clint Eastwood was much maligned for his attempt at singing (and NOT so terrible, considering these were macho  guys...) This film has had a bad rap since it was released, and it's not that bad. It's quite silly, but, in this case, silly is good. There are some serious issues being dealt with. This film's greatness depends on your willingness to accept it as entertainment; if you are the least bit "prudish", forget it. To quote the preacher's teenage son: "If you don't drink or smoke, you're missing out on the 2nd and 3rd best thing in life". Don't judge; enjoy!
