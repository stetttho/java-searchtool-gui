 Director Julian Schnabel, an artist himself, has centered his two best-known films on fine, misunderstood artists. "Basquiat" (with Jeffrey Wright) was well-received and lovingly portrayed. The life of Fernando Arenas, in "Before Night Falls", was a little more complicated, but true artistry shows through. This writer, a victim of Castro's Cuba, had a tough time dealng with his own personal situation as well as his powerful desire to write. A fearless, powerful performance by Javier Bardem carries this beyond any simple story. Mr. Schnabel managed to get Johnny Depp to provide a dual role (or was it?); one as a gorgeous transvestite and the other as a nasty Lieutenant of the guard. Olivier Martinez ("Unfaithful") was strong. So many beautiful men in one film, acting against type. Very intriguing. Cameo appearances from Sean Penn, and the great old character actor, Pedro Armendariz (as the grandpa) were well-integrated. The great director Hector Babenco ("Kiss of the Spider Woman") also has a small role.It's Bardem who carries this to greatness, with Schnabel's sure hand; cinematography was remarkably beautiful for an independent film. Here's the influence of Schnabel, always the artist. Extras on the DVD include a real interview with Arenas; a short video recollection by Schnabel's daughter, Lola, taken during the filming in Mexico. Another longer extra includes a tour of Schnabel's art studio, which I thought might be a self-indulgent trip, but is actually quite insightful into the mind of this talented man.But it's the remarkable, beautiful Javier Bardem that is the #1 reason to see this film. He'd won many awards for it, including the Independent Spirit Award, and an Oscar nomination. I'm very impressed.
