 As previous reviewers mentioned, the script has so many holes as to make this film somewhat incoherent. I have been waiting to see the terrific Michael Keaton again, and this just didn't do it for me. Aside from the fact that the plot is way over the top of believability, the wonderful production values and eerie mood can't save it. I'm disappointed that I bought the film sight unseen. I expected better; the trailers/previews are the best thing about it. The DVD extras are plentiful, but it's still a crashing bore.
