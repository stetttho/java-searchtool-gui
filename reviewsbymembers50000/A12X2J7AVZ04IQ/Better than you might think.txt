 I saw this film when it first came out. I loved it then and I love it now. The Widescreen version is great, though the colors have faded badly, and this "remastered" version isn't "re-imagined". The sound is fine, though, and with a little imagination, the film comes off well (I DO miss some of the colorful landscapes...the greens & reds are very washed-out, and this IS a film about plants!). A later-career performance by Howard Keel is solid, as is the performance of Nicole Maurey (her red hair comes thru!). The important scenes involving Kieron Moore and Janette Scott, filmed separately, were integrated well. There were no cast lists, but the performance of the little girl was wonderful, whomever she may be. I hate bad kid-actors. This IS a fine film; I remember the critics praising this film. I know director Sekely has made other films that I admire that I can't recall. This is definitly worth a look.  John Wyndham's book is well translated to the screen. The goofy extras at the beginning are fun, though you can't forward to the film without watching them...
