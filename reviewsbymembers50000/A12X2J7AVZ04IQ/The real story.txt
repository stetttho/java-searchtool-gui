 Tim Burton, Johnny Depp, and lots of fun stuff, approved by Dahl's daughter (a producer), can only make me believe that this is a definitve version. Roald Dahl didn't like the first version (with Gene Wilder), and it was risky to attempt a new version, but Burton is intelligent enough to do it right. One thing I didn't get was, if the old grandfather worked for Willy Wonka, why didn't Willy age accordingly. As Dahl intended, it's a lesson that rotten little spoiled kids will not always get everything they want. Previous reviewers made references to Michael Jackson, and other nonsense. What I experienced was a fine version of Dahl's difficult story, well presented and very entertaining. What I got out of it, as the book intended, is that greedy kids won't always get what they want; that a poor kid with dreams and hope may get more. The combination of Burton and Depp has never failed to entertain me (Edward Scissorhands, Sleepy Hollow, Ed Wood). Both are among the most talented artists in the film medium, and I enjoy that. "Charlie" is another feather in Burton's cap, and Depp, with his intelligent side-glances, removes any doubt that he's the finest actor today, risky and complete.  If you know the book, you'll understand. If you don't, just enjoy the film. Burton did a fine job.
