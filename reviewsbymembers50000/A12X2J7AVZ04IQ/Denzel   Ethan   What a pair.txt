 It's the day before the Oscars, and I very much needed to rent this film, being a Denzel fan from way back, and I saw A BEAUTIFUL MIND and thought Crowe was swell. It's good to see Denzel playing a baddasss, because, with the exception of "Courage Under Fire", he'd always been maybe just a bit too perfect. This shows range & depth; truly a committed performance. The real star, though, is Ethan Hawke, who never really impressed me before. Putting him up against Denzel's brilliant performance is a true test of acting greatness. I'm sure this type of thing goes on in Police Dept's somewhere, and it's unnerving to think it does; I'm sure production would've been prevented if it hit too many true notes. The film is exciting, suspenseful, and the acting throughout is excellent. The DVD has a crisp 2.35:1 Widescreen, and characters portrayed by Dr. Dre & Snoop Dogg are quite fine, proving other areas of talent. I'm impressed with this film, and I think Denzel should win the Oscar, as well as Hawke (though he won't, cuz he's the dark-horse...I hope I'm wrong...) Definitely see this film; it's unsettling and definitely a morality tale (where do you stop bending rules?) I was greatly entertained, and if you're a Denzel or Hawke fan, definitely SEE THIS FILM!! They are riveting!! DVD extras are plentiful.
