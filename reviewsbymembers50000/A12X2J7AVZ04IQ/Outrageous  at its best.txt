 Anyone who's ever been involved with community theatre should not miss "Waiting for Guffman". The unbelievably, frighteningly creative Christopher Guest seems to command a vast understanding of how silly the whole process can be. Willard and O'Hara are the obnoxious know-it-alls we all want to strangle but are too embarrassing to acknowledge; Parker Posey is perfection in her "Mary Hartman/hey...wait a minute..." delivery, and Mr. Guest makes the deluded Corky St. Clair a masterpiece of hopeless drive and control. You will laugh yourself silly. Don't miss this one. The ending is a special treat (most notably, the reference to the "My Dinner with Andre" action figures, etc.) A winner!
