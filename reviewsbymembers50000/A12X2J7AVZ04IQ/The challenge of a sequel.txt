 I enjoyed "Odd Thomas" so much that I was very much looking forward to Mr. Koontz' next Odd endeavor. Certainly, it's not as good as the first. The main disappointment was knowing everything about the bad guys before I was half-way through. It was also considerably darker than the first, with Odd's constant referrals to his dead fiancee, and, though Odd showed his usual joie de vivre, his final decision just didn't make a lot of sense. One element of this sequel that gained points (from me anyway) was that it could stand on its own, without the necessity of knowing the events of the first. Certainly, there were a lot of references, but nothing that relied too much on the first. The setting of the abandoned hotel was great, though he spent a little too much time in the sewers. No, not as good as the first, but I'm a Koontz junkie and I always look forward to his next project. The Koontz book that disappointed me the most was "Cold Fire", and "Dragon Tears" wasn't that great, either, but I'm compelled to take the good with the bad. I know he'll come up with a "Mr. Murder" or "Dark Rivers of the Heart" to enthrall me all over again.
