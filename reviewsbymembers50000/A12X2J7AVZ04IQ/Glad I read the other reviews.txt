 I have other "drive-in" tapes from Madacy and am quite happy with them. TRACK OF THE VAMPIRE sounded intriguing, and the price was right. I was all set to lambast this film, until I read the other reviews and was informed that there was footage missing. I love 50's trash horror, bad acting, etc., but I wasn't prepared to be as bored as I was. I guess I don't equate bad acting with sleepwalking. And what was with that overlong deal with the dancer on the beach? Suddenly, it was over. On came a Betty Boop cartoon. I thought OH JOY! The cartoon wasn't even that good, though Ms. Boop showed maximum cleavage and overt sexiness, apparently before she ran into trouble with the Hayes code (1932). Surprise! The second film, NIGHTMARE CASTLE was blessedly interesting. Directed by Allan Gruenewald (real name: Mario Caiano) and starring the wonderfully confident Barbara Steele, we have here a film of great style, if not substance. Though poorly dubbed, fans of this genre don't really care. I didn't. Lotsa schlock & silly stuff entertained. Upon further investigation, I was interested to find out that TRACK was actually pasted together with footage from a Yugoslavian film and originally released by AIP as BLOOD BATH. Forget this version of TRACK, but CASTLE is definitely worth a look. Quality of print is also questionable. Madacy did a much better job with BLOOD CREATURE/WEREWOLF IN A GIRLS' DORMITORY. Check 'em out!
