 I have to admit, I checked the DVD cover more than once to make sure that this wasn't a film by David Fincher. The nuance and presentation was quite fine, but not as "up" as one would expect from Spielberg (not counting "A.I.", which was an homage to Kubrick). Regardless, the film is wrought with intrigue not yet imagined, and some great sets. The photography was maybe too "artsy" but was certainly appropriate to the goings-on. The performances were great, with Cruise gaining confidence as the film went on. Colin Farrell and Max von Sydow were customarily fine, and there's a particularly touching performance from Samantha Morton that left me a bit haunted. This film gains momentum, due to excellent editing and very taut direction, as well as a literate script, and the result is an imaginative and exciting adventure, great ecapist fare.
