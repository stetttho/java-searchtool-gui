 Why do Amazon reviewers have to blab away the plot of everything? All I can say is that this small, independent film by Peter Hedges is loads of fun, and full of idiotic, totally believable behavior from all involved. Katie Holmes is Miss Know-It-All, who doesn't. She's a riot. Derek Luke is not given enough credit in this film. He is the only one who is genuinely in love. The magnificent Patricia Clarkson is great, as well as Oliver Platt. Sean Hayes appears briefly, but his character doesn't seem appropriate for the seedy surroundings. Lots of fun; Holmes and Clarkson connect like magnets (opposites), and I enjoyed it a lot. Especially, Oliver Platt has never been in such control. This small film wasn't in theatres for long, but anyone who wants to go for an entertaining ride will enjoy it a lot. A nice DVD extra, too.
