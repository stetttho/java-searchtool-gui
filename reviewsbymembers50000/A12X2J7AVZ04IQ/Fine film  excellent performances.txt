 I never had the opportunity to see this in the theatre, so when the DVD came out, I bought it immediately; not only for the great buzz surrounding the film, but that I've always loved Ray Charles' music. One thing I would advise first-time DVD viewers: don't watch the extended version first. Those extra scenes are included in a "deleted scenes" section on the DVD and most were left out for good reason. I didn't do that, and there was a certain amount of coherence missing.  I've watched it a few times since, it's a wonderfully made film, which FINALLY earned Taylor Hackford a nomination as Best Director.I'm not going to go over the plot, or rehash the fact that this is a "warts 'n all" look at Charles' life. The acting is very fine; Foxx does it all, with excellent support from Kerry Washington (wife) and Regina King (mother). Ms. King, in particular, will bring a tear to your eye, a short but powerful display of fine acting. The Oscars are next week, and all indications are that Foxx will win the Oscar. His leading role in "Collateral" also garnered him a nomination, but...supporting? He'll definitely win something. Oscar odds-makers are suggesting that Foxx' performance in "Ray" was an impersonation. I think it went way beyond that, but who knows what goes through the minds of those idiots? The great Ray Charles has been given a loving tribute, complete with fine music, acting and period detail, not to mention very loving direction by Hackford.The DVD has lots of extras, and a lot of insight.This is essential viewing to any fan of the great Ray Charles Robinson.
