 Director Richard Quine, along with writer Larry Gelbart, created this wonderfully sly, campy film, one of the best  and most well-reviewed comedies of 1962. Columbia Pictures' big success that year was "Lawrence of Arabia", so this one was somewhat relegated to the back burner, then forgotten. A shame, because it's really one of Kim Novak's better performances, and features a fun comic performance by the great Jack Lemmon. Fred Astaire is along for the ride, and having fun in a relatively small role. As in all of Quine's films, the most fun comes from supporting characters, namely Lionel Jeffries & Estelle Winwood. I won't blab away the plot, since many of you likely haven't seen this film, but it's a murder-mystery, very clever with loads of laffs. I thought that, by now, someone would've come up with a retropective of Lemmon's career; if anyone gets that idea, "The Notorious Landlady" should be near the top of the list, regarding his comedies (which he did with the same aplomb as his riveting dramas; this was the same year as "Days of Wine & Roses"). I love and admire the career of Mr. Lemmon, a true American original; his role here as an American dealing with culture clash in England adds to my admiration. PLEASE... Where's the DVD?!
