 "On the Waterfront" is, arguably, one of the most riveting and thought-provoking films of the 20th century. It marked the half-way point in two important Hollywood careers...that of Brando and of Kazan. Brando finally won an Oscar, which gave him power, and went off on his own, not always making good decisions. Kazan was nominated once more, the following year, for "East of Eden", and then his testimony before the "Communist Witch-hunt" committee denied him a future as a Hollywood icon. I believe "Splendor in the Grass" would've won more awards if his name wasn't attached to it; his last Oscar nomination, for "America America" was deserved, but the Hollywood heirarchy doesn't forget.So here we have somewhat of a conundrum: can it be denied that his genius is apparent, deserving of his recent lifetime achievement award, or should his bad choices of the past cover up his grand body of work? After winning an Oscar for "Gentlemen's Agreement" (1947), followed by "Viva Zapata!" and "On the Waterfront", three films about life-or-death integrity, it makes one wonder."On the Waterfront" is indeed a film of great power; the new DVD transfer is clear and crisp. The acting, without exception, is superlative. (Hard to think of Sinatra in the role, when Brando first rejected it). The script is taut, together and narratively without a seam, thanks to brilliant editing. Kazan's brilliance and sure hand are evident. I guess the bottom line is the fact that, even if you don't like the guy's views or personal profile, his artistic vision can't be denied. This is a great film, and if you have any respect for the fine art of a well-crafted film, this will be in your collection.
