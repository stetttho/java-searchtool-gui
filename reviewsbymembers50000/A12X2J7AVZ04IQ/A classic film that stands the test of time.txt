 I have not seen the available DVD. This would be essential to my collection, but I won't pay the ridiculous going rate. Luise Rainer gave one of the best performances captured on film, the second of her 2 Oscars. This is one of the great Hollywood films, directed by the underrated Sidney Franklin, and featuring a brilliant cast, stunning Oscar-winning photography, and some terrific special effects, all while telling a relatively simple and sweet story. Most of the great Hollywood films have been available on DVD at a good price. There's simply no excuse for MGM/UA (or whomever owns the rights) to deny a waiting public this outstanding film. Anyone else agree...?  NOTE: The DVD is coming out in January, 2006, and I'm hoping it will have extras & stuff.
