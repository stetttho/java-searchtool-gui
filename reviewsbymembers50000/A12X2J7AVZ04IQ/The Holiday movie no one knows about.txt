 I find no end of humor with Bob Hope wanting to open a home for "old dolls", over the hill chorus girls. The Damon Runyon characters are well presented by director Sidney Lanfield. Like previous reviewers there's not much more to say, except that I agree that this is the film I watch at the holiday season, along with "It's a Wonderful Life".The wonderful song, "Silver Bells", is sung by Hope and Marilyn Maxwell, and the moment is appropriate. All of the supporting characters are wonderful; it's always great to see Jane Darwell chew up the scenery. I love this film a lot, and wish more people kmew about it.   "Silver Bells" was not nominated for Best Song. (Best song that year was "Baby, It's Cold Outside", which is not really a song, but a duet) The film itself received no Oscar nominations. Pity.
