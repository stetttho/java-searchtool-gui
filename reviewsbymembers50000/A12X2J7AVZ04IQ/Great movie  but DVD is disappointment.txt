 This is my favorite musical film. With the exception of Gene Kelly's films, the athletic dance numbers are unique; exhilarating. Good plot, great songs, fun characters... so my disappointment with this new 2-disc DVD makes me curious. If this is a digitally remastered version, why are the glorious colors so washed out? This film often relies on color, some breathtaking shots of the countryside. The photography often looks fuzzy, too. Oscar nominated cinematography by George Folsey should be given a better presentation. I still love this film, and if this is as good as they can come up with, I guess I'll have to be content. The second disc has some wonderful insight (can't believe the studio wrote this off as a B-picture; then got a Best Picture nomination). This is PURE entertainment.
