 I remember my brothers taking me to this movie as a little kid. All that mattered was that people got eaten by red ants. I've never been fond of red ants since. In the 50's, this stuff was fodder for idiot kids like me. ("Them" and "Tarantula" were really cool.)I since discovered that the real title was "The Naked Jungle", after seeing it again on TCM or AMC, whatever."The Naked Jungle" is soap opera from beginning to end, with the "marabunta" as a catalyst. The stars are interesting. I was never a fan of Charlton Heston (as an actor), but Eleanor Parker was quite lovely, being gorgeous & tough at the same time, not unlike her magnificent performance in "Caged". The "marabunta" is, apparently, a force to be reckoned with, and makes the Amazon all that more intriguing. The beliefs of Amazonian natives is somewhat brought out, so much more brought out in Hector Babenco's "At Play in the Fields of the Lord". It's hard to make comparisons, since the sensibilities of the 50's and the 90's have been broadened. "The Naked Jungle" is really one of the first disaster films. All of the most famous disaster films were soap opera (Towering Inferno, Airport, Poseidon Adventure, etc.). In some ways, this is a trend-setter. I enjoyed it.
