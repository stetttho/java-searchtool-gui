 Robert Townsend is delightful and appealing; knowing what he went through to get this film made makes me admire him all the more. I am in awe. Not only is the film funny, smart and entertaining...it is a true original. With the help of the Wayans brothers, and other unknowns of the time (that are better known now than in '87), this is a film about integrity and conscience, as well as confidence and belief in yourself. A great lesson and a fine film. Robert Townsend shows brilliance and promise, as star & director. His later films couldn't quite match this first blast of originality. Though racial stereotypes are pretty much the center of attention, the broader theme of integrity and self-respect shine through like a beacon...a beacon that I wish more directors of racially-themed films would heed. (John Singleton comes to mind; never since matched the gut-power of "Boyz 'n the Hood".) The fact that Mr. Townsend is so self-effacing, while still refusing to give in, made me want to stand up and cheer. It's a fun film, well made, and perfectly entertaining. If it wasn't for some of the (stereotypical) language, I would recommend this as a lesson for kids. A most admirable effort.
