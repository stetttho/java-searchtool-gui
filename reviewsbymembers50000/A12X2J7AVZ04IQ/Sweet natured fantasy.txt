 I enjoyed it; it's got great laffs. Adam Sandler's occasional appearances are fun. Director Tom Brady has made a film that has many levels of thought, a grotesque reimagining of Boys Don't Cry with a happy ending. Rob Schneider's energetic performance is to be commended; Anna Faris (Scream movies) has proven that she can handle fun comedy. This is not a film to be judged, but to be enjoyed. Those who take the time, will be rewarded. Some great messages for everyone.
