 I've read a number of the customer reviews, agreed with them, and only wish I could think of more superlatives for this phenomenal achievement in filmmaking. You cannot come away from this film without being moved by its amazing, thought-provoking power. The world created by Pollack draws you in so completely (along with brilliant sets, cinematography, editing and, especially, the very well-chosen music) that you cannot help thinking "There but for the grace of God, Go I". What many don't realize is that this film is on the record books of the Academy for many reasons; no other film received as many Oscar nominations as this (9) without being nominated for Best Picture. Two artists who have made unforgettable marks upon the history of American film (Pollack and Fonda) received their first of many Oscar nominations. As I mentioned, there's not much more to say about this film experience that hasn't been said, though I will repeat: SEE THIS FILM. If you're any kind of a film fan, this is an essential addition to your library.The Widescreen version and DVD are 2.35:1, the ONLY way to view this film. With few exceptions, this film gives more attention to detail than any I can recall. I also realize that most people that might read this are aware of its brilliance. Sad to think this film is being missed by so many.
