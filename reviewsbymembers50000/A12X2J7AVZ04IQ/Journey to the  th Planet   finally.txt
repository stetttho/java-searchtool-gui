 OK, they're both trashy. Still, the wonderfully self-gratuitous John Agar is here...TWICE!! "Invisible Invaders" is silly, but the transfer to DVD is quite good. John Carradine must've thought this was the end of his career, and it's a shame. He had a few decent performances left in him. But, with the help of Edward L.Cahn (often referred to as Ed Wood's less-talented little brother), he had nothing to do but glower and look tired. It's silly, and like all Cahn films, loads of trashy fun. I saw "Journey to the 7th Planet" as a kid, and not since. It's really not that bad, with a terrific premise. Unfortunately, the monsters and sci/fi stuff look mostly fake. There was a slight moment when the cyclops monster appeared and thought there might be a Ray Harryhausen moment (great stop-motion photography) but it only lasted a few seconds. Filmed in Denmark, with a Danish cast (all dubbed), Agar had an almost interesting role. He played second fiddle, and had a chance to actually give some character to the role. The women were absolutely gorgeous, starting with the lovely Greta Thyssen and not ending there. The plot, though contrived, was actually quite interesting in premise, a trip to Uranus and the concept of what was encountered. Like I said, I saw it as a kid and somehow always remembered this film and its idea. It's silly, fun & entertaining. Once again, I applaud MGM's "Midnite Movies" series for bringing more trashy fun to my house, and at a good price. ("Journey" has a nice 1.85:1 Widescreen).
