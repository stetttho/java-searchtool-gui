 I've admired the MGM "Midnite Movies" series a lot for presenting some forgotten oldies in double-feature format at a good price. The quality and sound of this DVD is fine, but the films really aren't worth it. The better of the two, "Cry of the Banshee" is faux-Poe, and a histrionic Vincent Price is adequately mean. These MGM double-features usually have a common thread, this one being director Gordon Hessler. In "Banshee", the most interesting character is Oona, the witch, played by the once-great and still-commanding Elisabeth Bergner (an Oscar nominee for Best Actress in 1935 for "Escape Me Never"), another example of the grand old dames finding an outlet in "horror" films. There is definitely style, and great use of color, though the photography is a bit foggy on this DVD. "Murders in the Rue Morgue", on the other hand, is a bit of a complexity (for me, anyway). The great Jason Robards had won back-to-back Oscars only 4 years before. Did he really need this film so bad? Herbert Lom has been involved with re-makes or sequels most of his career ("Mysterious Island" as Nemo and 1962's "Phantom of the Opera"), and, though a truly gifted actor ("El Cid", 1961 & others) fell victim to the second-rate horror genre. (I actually liked his Phantom very much.) This film, I'm sorry to say, is just plain boring. Both films are presented in a decent 1.85:1 Widescreen, and I still admire the "Midnite Madness" series for reviving these films, as trivial and silly as they are, because they've done well with previous endeavors. I still want to know what Poe had to do with either one (except for the title). For that matter, what did Poe have to do with any of those movies "based" on his writing ("House of Usher" was close). If you're a collector, like myself, or even curious, these films are worth a look. Don't expect a lot, except the bitter end of the Poe film series.
