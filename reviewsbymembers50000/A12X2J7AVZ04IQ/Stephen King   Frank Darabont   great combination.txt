 There have been a few really great adaptations of King for the screen ("Misery" & "The Shining", to name a couple). Still, the two best, both about prisons and both written & directed by Frank Darabont have to be "The Green Mile" and "The Shawshank Redemption". Both were also nominated for Best Picture and Screenplay, but NOT director (another Oscar travesty). "Shawshank" was a slight novella by King, and Darabont turned it into a 142 minute narrative that never fails to draw the viewer in deeper with every frame. The new 2-disc DVD is fine, though the 2nd disc has some repetitive interviews. How Darabont managed to take the grim story about a seemingly hopeless bunch of individuals and turn it into a film of hope, renewal and conscience...as well as a good smattering of justice...still amazes me. I am not the least bit surprised that this is considered among the best screenplays of all time. Morgan Freeman, Tim Robbins, Bob Gunton, Gil Bellows and all the rest were perfect. The editing in particular was layered in a way where the very talky script never got tired. This is a film all should see, if only to know that if you have patience and keep your wits, anyone can survive the most dire circumstances. This is a wonderful film experience. ALL credit should go to Frank Darabont.
