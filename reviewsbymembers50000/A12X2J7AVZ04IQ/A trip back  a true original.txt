 I was a teenager when I was first exposed to the Munsters. It was silly and fun. I'd been a fan of old horror films (and still am), and I found it fresh, fun and very harmlessly corny ("Eddie, be sure to wash behind your points..."). I'm happy to own this DVD collection. The transfer is exquisite, though the sound could be better. The acting is adequately hammy and appropriate, though I'd like to know what happened to Beverly Owen (who was replaced in Season 2 by Pat Priest). Season 1 features Marilyn as a major character. All the others(Fred Gwynne, Yvonne de Carlo, Al Lewis, Butch Patrick) are endearing, I guess, as I remember from my teenage years. Current TV Comedy cannot compare with some of the original family style humor of the Munsters. Certainly, "South Park" and "Scrubs" are clever, but hardly what I'd want little kids to watch. Innocent, original, endearing, and often sweet-natured, the Munsters should be an addition to a family film library, proving that you don't need sex & violence to be entertained. Of course, there's the fantasy element; even weirdo families can be pleasant. There are always lessons to be learned from the Munsters, especially regarding their lack of greed, and kindness towards others; even the poor Marilyn, lacking the others' good looks. This is my kind of fare.
