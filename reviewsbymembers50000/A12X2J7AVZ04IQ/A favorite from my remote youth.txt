 I understand that Tim Allen has "reimagined" this film, but I don't know how it can compare to the original. Fred MacMurray, always reliable and loads of fun, is not the central character. The Mickey Mouse Club supplied the main characters. Indeed, Tommy Kirk & Kevin Corcoran carry this film, with able support from Tim Considine, Annette Funicello & Roberta Sherwood. There's also delightful support from Jean Hagen & Cecil Kellaway. I have no end of admiration for this original. Certainly, there are plot holes, but who really cares? I have the VHS, and then I saw the DVD and snatched it up. The DVD has 2 versions: a colorized version, but I have no use for that; the B&W is in a slight Widescreen. This is one of Disney's first live action comedies; Tommy Kirk is especially good, and had just completed "Old Yeller"; Kevin Corcoran was later excellent as "Toby Tyler". Disney studio were famous for their animated features, and wonderful documentaries ("White Wilderness", etc.). Mr. MacMurray later proved a hit in "The Absent-Minded Professor" and it's sequel, "Son of Flubber". My big concern is WHY anyone thinks they have to remake these wonderful capsules of Hollywood treasures. Robin Williams in "Flubber", and now Tim Allen in a remake? The originals are GREAT; the lazy studio heads should start looking for wonderful new material. We all know there's plenty of it out there. Those Sundance darlings, if promoted correctly, could kick some serious butt. Still, I encourage anyone with kids to check this out. It's WAY too much fun to be ignored. BTW: Remember the Mickey Mouse Club...the Hardy Boys...Spin & Marty? I do. I was especially intrigued with the Hardy Boys' "Mystery of the Applegate Treasure". Wouldn't that be fun on DVD? Anyone agree?     PS~The DVD has a fond, loving tribute to Fred MacMurray. Worth seeing; as well as remaining cast interviews, commentaries, etc.
