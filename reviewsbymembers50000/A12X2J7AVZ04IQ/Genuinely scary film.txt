 I've read the other reviews, and I have no intention of looking for the philosophical undertones nor an homage to other directors. Fisher is famous for creating scenarios that scare the pants off his audience, and this is no different. Indeed, the haunting mood and unusual plot can really keep one on the edge of one's seat. Cushing, Lee and good looking lovers and creepy monsters all add up to a scary ball of fun that shouldn't be missed. A creepy and entertaining film; see it soon!
