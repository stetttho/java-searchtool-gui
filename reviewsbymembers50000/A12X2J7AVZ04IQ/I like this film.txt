 I have to admit, the scariest parts of this film were at the beginning, knowing Bergin's psychotic/selfish tendencies. Julia is great, as always, and the transition of her character is totally believable. Joseph Ruben has crafted a very fine suspense film, that I find myself watching over and over. I take issue with others who said the Van Morrison "interlude" was wrong. I thought it was a tension-reliever, as well as a chance to see the budding relationship between Julia and Kevin Anderson. Julia is confident and sure, and is everything we expect. The real moving factor here is the (almost) over-acting of Patrick Bergin, a real mean individual. He counters everything that might be nice. I still think the most overlooked facet of this film is the wonderful score by Jerry Goldsmith, a giant among film composers. Whatever you think, it all works for me. I like this film a lot. It's "scary" in all the "wrong" places...life's like that.
