 As profound and verbose as it is, "Waking Life" never fails to intrigue me. Linklater enhances his reputation as a maverick and visionary. A lot of the stuff sounded silly, but it ALL made me think. Isn't this what original film is all about? It's episodic (Thank God!), and as such doesn't let any idea get more profound than it is. I was entertained and moved.
