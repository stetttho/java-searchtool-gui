 Mike Leigh's films are all improvisational; almost all are interesting. They are usually Oscar darlings, and "Vera Drake" is no exception. I won't mention the plot, because, if your reading this, you already know. Imelda Staunton is, indeed, magnificent. I only recently saw the film, and at Oscar time last year I thought she'd win, because of the slug-fest that seems to involve Swank & Bening, the only times they'd been involved. I thought the votes would be split, as often happens. Imelda was gracious, glorious, sweet and down to earth in this performance, a true amalgam of acting prowess. Mike Leigh also used Brenda Blethyn to good advantage in "Secrets & Lies". A terrific story and interesting part of history, this film is wonderful, especially regarding the other characters involved, all of whom are excellent. Mr. Leigh is brilliant, and he uses women characters well; I hope he will soon get away from that improvisational tool that requires women to whimper and cry a bunch. Imelda's whimpering was annoying, but, in "Secrets & Lies", Blethyn's was distracting. Still, a wonderful display of acting, and about a good person with good intentions which were, unfortunately, against the law. I am pro-life, to a point; I almost understood Vera's motivations, especially regarding rape. Back in the early 50's, frivolous behavior wasn't as accepted as now, and Vera was there to be a friend. The film is worth watching. It's historical importance in perspective is priceless. Family was made to be so important. This is good.
