 I won't blab away the plot, cuz you probably already know it. This is my favorite King novel, and he must have approved, since he has an appearance. This is so complicated that I didn't think it could be coherently put to film...but it works. Acting is very good throughout, especially Jamey Sheridan as the bad guy (It's hard to watch "Law & Order" now.) He was THAT good. There are inside jokes, my favorite being the appearance of Joe Bob Briggs, who did a late-nite horror show and always said how much he hates Molly Ringwald. This is King's biggest novel...and I know he knows it's his best. The 8 hour TV version does well on DVD at only 6 hours (minus commercials). To tell the story in less time would be a travesty. The acting is generally fine, with Sheridan as a standout. I liked Ruby Dee a lot, and thought Rob Lowe was fine. A brief tough-as-nails cameo by Kathy Bates was great. Adam Storke, Ray Walston and Gary Sinese are also quite good. It's all so overwhelming, and beautifully conceived and presented.  I liked it a lot.
