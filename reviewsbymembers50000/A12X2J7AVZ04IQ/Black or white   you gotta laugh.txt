 I've had this VHS film in my collection since it came out; now the DVD is here...no extras, but finally in a widescreen that shows off the period detail in its glory. Eddie Murphy wrote and directed, and it's an auspicious debut. (Nominated for an Oscar for Costumes). Say or think what you want, this is a funny film, which is not really Black-centered, but shows foibles and general short-comings from all involved. It just happens to take place in Harlem in the 20's. There are serious and pensive looks on Pryor's face everytime someone makes a racial epithet...watch for that. It's powerful! Eddie's a riot, as is Foxx, and Della Reese is magnificent; her line "Kiss my entire a**" ...must go down as a great line in film history. ...I'm a white man, and I still find no end of humor in this film. Love it or hate it...it's funny!
