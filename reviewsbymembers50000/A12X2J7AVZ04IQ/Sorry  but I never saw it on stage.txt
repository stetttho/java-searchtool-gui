 Certainly, the medium of film can afford more depth and background than a stage production. I think Joel Schumacher's film is fine on many levels, especially his sense of period detail. The sets & costumes were magnificent. Also magnificent is the lovely Emmy Rossum (I remember her lovely performance in a little indie called "Songcatcher"). The rest of the cast was fine. The finest moment has to be Rossum's "Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again", alone in the graveyard, one of the only really peaceful moments. Gerard Butler was fine, and Patrick Wilson sang beautifully. One thing that often bothers me in films like this is why some characters speak with accents (Minnie Driver) and most of the others don't. ("Evita" had the same problem; even on stage, the character of Juan Peron always had an accent.) Doesn't make sense to me. All the other reviewers have gone into plot, and stage comparisons. I won't do that, mostly because, alas, I never saw it on stage. But this is not the stage production...it's a FILM, and, as such, I was very impressed and enjoyed it a lot.
