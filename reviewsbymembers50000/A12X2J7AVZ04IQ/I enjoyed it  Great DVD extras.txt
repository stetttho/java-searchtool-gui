 Wilhelm & Jakob Grimm are famous for writing "fairy tales", which were grotesque and extremely "grim". How they became so popular to kids is only that kids' minds have a more resilient approach to horror. Here we have a big bad wolf and Little Red Riding Hood and Hansel & Gretel and a sort of Rapunzel character, but in the hands of Terry Gilliam, it's all given a new approach. Will & Jake are con men trying to scratch out a living, in a German countryside that's infested with the French army. (Imagine that!)  Without giving anything away, they save a village and children, purge a wicked queen, and make everyone happy. Everything in between is most amusing. Matt Damon & Heath Ledger are the attractive brothers, and Ledger shows a special flair for physical comedy. There's a happy ending, and it suggests that the brothers got the ideas for their stories from experience. Peter Stormare is especially delightful in his parody of the frightened Italian soldier. Special Effects were used (CGI) sparingly, but to good advantage. I enjoyed it a lot.
