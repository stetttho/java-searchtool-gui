 I'm not an afficianado of ethereal plots or esoteric ideals. Doesn't mean I don't enjoy it, as displayed in Mr. Stevens' narrative. I was, indeed, grabbed by the first few pages, and kept reading, thinking this would lead to an interesting conclusion. Since I was a novice to this form, I greatly appreciated Mr. Stevens' ability not to give anything away, treating all readers like first-timers. This, to me, was good.  There was a lot of potential regarding secret societies, and the dream-like quality of the whole thing was intriguing. All-in-all, I was expecting more. After such an impressive build-up, the ending was a disappointment. I'm left wondering what it was all about. This is, apparently, not a genre that I'm prone to. Sorry...
