 As an American, and a lover of suspense films, it's almost disconcerting that films about devious behavior from the FBI or CIA should be so entertaining. IN THE LINE OF FIRE (Wolfgang Peterson's brilliant film, with Eastwood & Malkovich) is absolutely riveting, and this pairing of Mel & Julia, with Donner directing, was almost as good. I DO really like Julia Roberts. She's a fine and insightful actress. Mel transcended his 3 Stooges imitation (from the LETHAL WEAPON films), and was completely convincing as a paranoid good-guy. As much as I like Mel, Julia's strength to carry the film really comes through. There's great editing (for suspense) and fine photography of some great NYC sites. And Ben Kingsley was so bad, I wanted to bite his nose. This will keep you guessing till the end. I won't give anything away, except that Mel & Julia are the good guys and they're great together.
