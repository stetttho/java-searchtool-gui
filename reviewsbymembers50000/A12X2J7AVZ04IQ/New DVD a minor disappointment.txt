 Though this film is brilliant in any form, I ordered the DVD re-release because it was listed as a "widescreen" version. The first DVD release (and a VHS release) had alternating standard/widescreen scenes (with Kubrick's approval). This version is all standard 1.33:1 which was disppointing for me. The extras are a real treat, and, as I said, the film is worth repeated viewings no matter what format you have. Considering its release date (1964), subject matter and its relentlessly scathing screenplay, it MUST stand as one of the most profoundly essential films of all time. A bit of trivia: This was Sellers' first Oscar nomination; Sellers' is the first for any multiple-role performance to be nominated (Lee Marvin won the following year for "Cat Ballou", the first multiple-performance winner). This film, as well as Kubrick's next 3 films were nominated for Director and Screenplay (by Kubrick...2001, Clockwork Orange, Barry Lyndon.)
