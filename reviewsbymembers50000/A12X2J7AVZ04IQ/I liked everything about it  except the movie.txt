 As a previous reviewer said, all the top-notch production values can't save a film with a bad script. I've always liked de Niro, and am endlessly impressed with the remarkable and intuitive Dakota Fanning. Famke Janssen is gorgeous as ever, and it's really good to see Elizabeth Shue & Amy Irving working again. I didn't hate this film as much as others, or the critics, but something just didn't connect. I'm thinking it's director John Polson's handling of Dakota's character. After all, when Charlie starts doing mean things, she should've made a few connections. The DVD is fine, with a terrific 2.40:1 widescreen, showing off some wonderful scenery, well photographed. Unfortunately, most everything takes place indoors. There's also 4 alternate endings, none of which would've made a difference in the long run. Once Charlie is unmasked, the film loses its momentum. Some nice extras, but overall, I'm glad a friend loaned it to me before I bought it.
