 I don't own this film, but came across it by accident while browsing on Amazon. I haven't seen it in over 20 years, but somehow the power of Marilyn Hassett's performance came to mind. I remember it and am looking forward to a DVD version. Anyone else agree? Since it's out of print, there are blood-suckers out there capitalizing on its unavailability. Give us a DVD and let the blood-suckers stew in their greed. I remember great photography and wonderful music, as well as Hassett, whose career didn't take off. Pity.
