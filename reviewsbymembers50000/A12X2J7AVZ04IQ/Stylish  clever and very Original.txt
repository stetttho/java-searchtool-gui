 I've read the other reviews, and I somewhat agree with most. I've always been a fan of Rodriguez, if only because of his sheer originality; though a buddy of Tarantino, he can still maintain his individuality and integrity. One reviewer didn't like the voice over; if he'd watched the best of 40's film noir, he'd he'd realize that they all had voice over, and for a reason: Precision. I was totally blown away with the originality of the whole thing; appropriate black & white photography, with splashes of color that intrigue. I agree with the guy who said this DVD is lacking in extras; no doubt. This project must have been so complex, I'm very interested to hear more about background stuff. The acting is excellent throughout. I particularly was impressed with Mickey Rourke, as well as Brittany Murphy. Benicio del Toro played his somewhat carricature part as if nothing could be more fun. This film is indeed a wild roller coaster of a ride, not unlike "Pulp Fiction", but a little more clever and even poetic. I thought the script was wonderful. This is indeed a sort of "parallel universe" kind of ride, and I was continuously entertained.Rodriguez' originality has strengthened my admiration of his talent. Watching this was so much fun!
