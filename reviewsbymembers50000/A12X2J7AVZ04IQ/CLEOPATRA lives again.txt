 The new DVD release of "Cleopatra" truly preserves the epic proportions I remember from the big screen when I was 14 years old. Even on the small screen, its epic-ness remains intact. This film is not as bad as most people thought. Production values are high (4 tech Oscars), a wonderful score and above average acting make the entire experience worthwhile. ("Ben-Hur" was far, FAR slower and exceedingly boring...) I recommend everyone to see this excellent DVD transfer. The 3rd disc includes a documentary about the making of the film and all the set-backs, which adds a new appreciation (for me) of the final result. Liz is OK, but Harrison, Burton and MacDowall are excellent. If you're a collector, this film belongs in your library for its historical significance. If not, don't buy it but certainly rent it.
