 I love bad sci-fi, and I saw this as a kid originally when it came out. It was really cool. My reminiscences are not entirely incorrect. Gerald Mohr has two looks...bored and bored/horny. How could he be less bored/horny than to deal with Nora Hayden (gorgeous woman!) who stops before she says anything profound...it's a bad-acting tour de force. I love it. Jack Kruschen ws nominated for Best Supporting Actor this year...but NOT for this film (The Apartment). And poor old Les Tremayne tried his best to lend dignity to this absolutely horribly written piece of garbage. Talk about cheap effects; the red screen was certainly a cop=out, but the bad special effects are still noticeable and stupid and fun. Still, the absolutely horrible performances of Mohr and Hayden are reason enough to see this film. Hearty laughs will ensue, and a good time will be had by all. (Bring beer or an appropriate beverage of choice). You will not appreciate this film if you are sober, or over 11 years of age. I love it because, though I'm getting older, I'll never grow up... I love it, because I'm somewhat stuck in the 60's...my favorite time.
