 This is what Koontz is all about, His attempts at clever humor may be annoying, but in this one, he created endearing characters. This is why we all come back to him. After "Odd Thomas", I was waiting for another similar book. "The Face" was good, though "The Taking" was all suspense and no resolution. "Life Expectancy" was enjoyable, and the characters were good. Koontz had the humor to keep the reader, though his humor is regularly quite corny. Not a bad thing. Jimmy Tock was a wonderful character, and Lorrie, too..without giving anything away, this book is worth your time. I love Koontz. "Shadowfires" is still the BEST!
