 "Way Out West" is my favorite Stan & Ollie film. It is consistantly clever; the horse on the balcony, the head under the pail, the bodies in the piano, and of course, the delightful dance sequence. Alas, I sold my really fine VHS version, expecting someone to eventually give justice to this fun romp. When do you think someone, even Criterion, will wake up and realize that quality entertainment cannot be compromised, and a loving public will not settle for mediocrity?
