 Now that independent film has taken over, and studios are more willing to back them, I think Ed Wood was around at the wrong time. Or was he? Who cares? His simplicity is so endearing, as projected by Johnny Depp (one of our more unappreciated actors). I find that I put on "Plan 9" or "Bride of the Monster" for sheer entertainment more than most others. Tim Burton's very loving tribute to the misunderstood Ed becomes a loving dislay of hope, courage and confidence. Anyone who wants a dream may find it; maybe Tim's film is a guideline. This came out the same year as "Forrest Gump", which seemed to take over the Oscars, but this film has the distinction of winning 100% of it's nominations: only 2, the wonderful make-up, and Martin Landau's exceptional performance as Bela Lugosi. Depp is so much fun; Sarah Jessica Parker belies her later success ("Sex & the City") as the prudish wife.Bill Murray and Jeffrey Jones are customarily hammy, which is appropriate for the characters. Especially great is a small cameo from Vincent d'Onofrio as Orson Welles, Ed's all-time idol. This film is nothing but fun, and the black and white photography is totally appropriate. Lovers of Ed will appreciate this for what it is; Ed's been given a bad rap. Tim Burton's wonderful film will dispell that myth.
