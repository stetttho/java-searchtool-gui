 I'm annoyed that there's so little original material that the classics are all being redone. I'm a huge fan of the original film and avoided seeing this remake, but finally I gave in. After all, with a cast like this, what could be so bad? Sure, it's idiotic and over-the-top with the subtle slapstick. The basic idea of the original (and Levin's book) are there, but Frank Oz took it to a different level, with the help of the very clever Paul Rudnick. I'm glad to know that I'm not such a snob as to totally disregard this "re-imagining" and enjoy it for its parody. Yes, I enjoyed it. I laughed often, and all the leads are quite in tune with the huge joke that's going on. Silly is good.
