 John Hughes (here as producer) has always put together some films about teenagers that made them filled with interesting traits, true feelings and genuine situations. Though this film is a bit far-fetched, it has the best characters (tomboy, skinhead, nerd, popular girl in school, rich fool). I've loved Mary Stuart Masterson since this film, and have made an attempt to see everything she's done since. Lea Thompson had the hardest part, trying to be cool and "real" at the same time. Eric Stoltz was never better looking, truly handsome, belying his previous role in "Mask" and future independent film projects, as well as carrying the lead role with genuine confidence. Elias Koteas is a real delight as Duncan, the skinhead; later he was in "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" as a romantic lead, and the great Terrence Malick used him to excellent advantage in "The Thin Red Line". This film really marks the beginning of many fine film careers. The use of current popular music in all of Hughes' films has always added to their appeal, as well as good writing. This was a little more brutal than "16 Candles", but it hit all the right nerves. Also, as a middle-aged baby boomer, the emotions involved, I must say, are as relevent now as then. It was also a pleasure to see John Ashton ("Beverly Hills Cop") as the dad; he plays the bewildered authority figure very well. The DVD release offers an excellent transfer of the film (1.85:1 LBX) as well as great sound. A true feel-good film, this is real entertainment and I wish there were more like it.
