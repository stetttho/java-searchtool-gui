 There were 3 Mars movies that year...Mission to Mars (famous cast); Red Planet (famous cast) and this one. Th others took a long time to tell a simple story. This one had action from beginning to end. It was a bit silly, but I found it more clever and entertaining in the long run. And the performances of Ice Cube and Clea Duvall, as well as Natasha Henstridge, are quite complete. Not bad...
