 I finally saw this film, and am awe-struck! The attention to detail is quite exceptional, thanks to the brilliant vision of director Peter Weir. I was wondering if ths might be a franchise..."Far Side of the World" ...maybe there'll be more. The action scenes and the flawless cinematography, not to mention brilliant editing, draw the viewer in and you're taken away. Crowe is great, as is Paul Bettany, who creates a sense of purpose and legitimacy to the proceedings. And Billy Boyd is certainly a busy guy, appearing in two Oscar nominated blockbusters in one year ("LOTR"). This is a well-made, seriously endearing action drama with loads of heart. Check it out!
