 "The Magic Garden" has been out of print for so long, I was delighted to see it available again (but NOT happy with the high price). Very original pieces like "Orange Air" and "Paper Cup" are great, and I think their cover of "The Worst that could Happen" is better than the original. Truly heartfelt. I have the vinyl LP; maybe someday I'll be able to afford the CD.
