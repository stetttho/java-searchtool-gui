 With few exceptions, Tina Fey is the main reason I may ever watch SNL. When I heard she'd written and appeared in a film, I thought about other SNL people who've failed. Well, Tina is on target. She not only hits all the elements of good narrative (discovery, conflict, redemption, resolution), but carries it to a special place which I admire. This is NOT another dumb teen movie. Ms. Fey's in-your-face subtlety is masterfully created, and there's a team of great young actors to pull this off~~largely due to understated direction by Mark Waters, who has a profound respect for the script. Teen attitudes are as similar today as they were when I was in high school back in the 60's. Tina's focus on a more wholesome nasty bunch of people (she could've gone nuts on the drug scene, etc.) is admirable. The whole cast is fine, and Ms. Fey is particularly good.All of this makes me think that kids should see this, if only to realize how silly they might become.
