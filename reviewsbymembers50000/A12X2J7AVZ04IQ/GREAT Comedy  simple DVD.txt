 Finally, Billy Wilder's breathless masterpiece is available on DVD. Though there are virtually no extras on this DVD, it offers a terrific 2.35:1 Letterbox (and a standard format on the flipside). I've seen this at least 50 times, watching it now, and I'm still overwhelmed at the amazing screenplay and Cagney's performance, a tour de force that left him so exhausted he didn't make another film or 20 years. There are few performances captured on film that are as totally rewarding. I'd reviewed the VHS twice, but it bears repeating that Lilo Pulver and Hanns Lothar were most supportive toward Cagney's brilliance. Arlene Francis' wisecracks are perfect, Daniel L. Fapp's Oscar-nominated cinematography still shines in this Panavision transfer, and you'll be hard-pressed to get Andre Previn's arrangement of the Khachaturian Sabre Dance out of your head when it's all over. This is, quite simply, an overwhelming, enjoyable comedy film!
