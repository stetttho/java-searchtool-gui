 The new DVD release of The Natural is everything I'd hoped for. The film itself is brilliant and the acting is superlative. The script retains all of the spiritualism and self-searching personal turmoil that affect everyone (not just ball players) who has a goal that seems unattainable. An extra on the DVD is a documentary narrated by Cal Ripken, Jr., which gives interesting insight into the creation of the film as adapted from Malamud's book, as well as how the film has the power to affect each of us personally. Buy the DVD, a memorable addition to your library.
