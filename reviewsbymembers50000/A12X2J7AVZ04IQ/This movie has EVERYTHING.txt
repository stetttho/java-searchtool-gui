 In the glorious tradition of schlock 50's sci-fi, this film is a landmark. Forget, for a moment, the suspension of disbelief that is required for such a genre. The plot, circumstances and script are certainly among the most entertaining elements out there. Herb Evers is the hero who truly loves his woman for her mind, and Ms. Leith's performance is better than she's ever been given credit, since she can rely on virtually no body-language. Make lots of popcorn and drench it with everything that's bad for you. Then put in this film and kick back. Guilty pleasures don't get any better than this.
