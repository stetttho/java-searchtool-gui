 I really love this film. I don't think a whole lot of people are crazy about spiders, me included, but director  Frank Marshall has crafted a film that defies any category. A very smart, literate script cleverly layered the tension as we, the audience, learn along with the characters. We are given a head-start, and that makes it fun.The acting is very fine overall, especially Jeff Daniels as our not-so-wimpy hero. Henry Jones (the old doctor) and Harley Jane Kozak (I'd like to see her more often) were excellent, and John Goodman was a treat. More than the absolute fun that this movie offers, I was particularly overwhelmed by the Score of Trevor Jones, and was equally impressed with the crisp cinematography of Mikael Salomon; his magnificent shots of the Amazon as well as the attention to detail regarding the creepy crawlies is admirable. I find this is a film I like to watch over & over again. Humor and suspense have rarely been blended so well.
