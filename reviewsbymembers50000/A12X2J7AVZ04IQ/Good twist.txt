 This film was entertaining; everytime I thought I knew what was going on, something else happened. Very entertaining. I won't blab away the plot, but Kate Hudson is solid in, what I think, is her first lead role. She handles it with fierce conviction. It helps that she had to deal with the champions, Gena Rowlands and John Hurt. Peter Saarsgard is, as usual, confident and in control. Director Iain Softley handled this film well, and the DVD offers generous extras. It was well thought-out, and the casting of the great Gena Rowlands and the great John Hurt are reason enough to see this film. Don't get me wrong, Hudson is terrific, as is Joy Bryant, as Hudson's friend who knows more than she cares to tell. Fun movie. Check it out.
