 "The Truman Show" is a film I often come back to, occasionally, because its premise is so unique and compelling. Certainly, it's a parable and a fantasy; Peter Weir has quite simply added another brilliant film to his awesome filmography. Jim Carrey was expected to be insanely funny because everyone thought he was nuts to begin with. As a previous reviewer said, that's what we expected from Robin Williams, too, and Adam Sandler ("Punch-Drunk Love"). Carrey's performance is so very complete, a wonderful display of sensitivity and focus. I was impressed. Mr. Weir's vision I'm sure had a lot to do with it all, and Laura Linney's performance was much under-rated. Ed Harris was customarily over-reactive. This is a fantasy to be enjoyed and not analyzed at first glance; let it take you in, and question your own mortality. This is a film about self-esteem. For that reason alone, Jim Carrey flies beyond his reputation.
