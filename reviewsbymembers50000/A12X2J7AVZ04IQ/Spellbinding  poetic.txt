 Nature isn't always pretty. Still, the beautifully photographed landscapes of the Antarctic terrain can only add to this amazing film, so stunning in the events that are taking place. Soft, soothing music, and the soft soothing voice of Morgan Freeman create a mesmerizing lesson in survival and procreation. Children should definitely see this, though it isn't action-packed. A wonderful lesson about survival. The original French version had the birds speaking about their situation, which, though cute, couldn't get across the absolute power of the ordeal. I live in Wisconsin, and winter can be brutal. Still, I choose to live here. It really makes you wonder if these animals would be happy (or content) living anywhere else. A lesson in life, "March of the Penguins" should be watched and contemplated. I was very impressed.
