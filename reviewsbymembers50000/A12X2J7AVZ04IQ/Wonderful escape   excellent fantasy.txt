 I saw this in theatres when first released. I was a kid, and awestruck. Then the VHS came along. It was good. And now, the best DVD you could imagine! The film could stand on its own, and at a good price. The extras are generous...2 short documentaries, and a scripted "making of" involving Disney himself. Loads of fun! The wonderful Albert Sharpe came out of retirement to make this, and he is sharp as a tack; a thoroughly complete performance. He should've had Oscar recognition. For that matter, this film was not nominated for any Oscars at all. The sweet ballad "Irish Lass", though a hit at the time, was ignored, as well as the wonderful Special Effects...and, sadly, Sharpe's performance. The most interesting element of the film is seeing Sean Connery with hair (?); he gives a fine performance and isn't that bad a singer; good insight about how he got this role, in the extras, but I won't blab away the stuff. Janet Munro made her Disney debut, here, and he used her in many others (I liked her in "Swiss Family Robinson"). I don't know what happened to her. She later gave a remarkable performance in "The Day the Earth Caught Fire"; I really like her a lot. She is a natural beauty.  This is PURE Disney...sweet, serious, and especially, great for kids. Let the fantasy take them to another place, as it did for me, when I first watched it. It's Albert Sharpe, though, that gives the crowning performance of his wonderful career. Watch it. Love it. Always believe...
