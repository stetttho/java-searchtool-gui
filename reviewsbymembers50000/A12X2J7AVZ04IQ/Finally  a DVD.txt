 ...and a good one, too. The film itself is riveting and beautifully constructed, and this DVD gives a great wide 2.35:1 Panavision transfer, showing the grotesque haunted house with a chilling perifery, and not the jumpy P&S close-ups of the original VHS. Best thing about this DVD is the commentary from the whole cast, plus director Wise and screenwriter Nelson Gidding; great insights (I won't blab anything away), and author Shirley Jackson was in on a lot of the scripting ideas. No doubt, the scariest ghost movie ever, and I'm thrilled to have this DVD after a too-long wait.
