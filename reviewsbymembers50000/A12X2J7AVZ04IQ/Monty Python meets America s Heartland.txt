 Christopher Guest's mockumentaries are no end of enjoyment. This has to be his best, though it's hard to discern the type of humor that Guest had such a handle on; "Best in Show" was great because the whole idea of those stuck-up kennel shows was exposed. "Waiting for Guffman" was special because I was involved in Community theatre in the past, and people REALLY are like that! I grew up with Peter, Paul & Mary, the Christy Minstrels, and everyone else that is parodied. It's a trip to the past, with tons of humor and appreciation. Mr. Guest's usual band of artists (Parker Posey, Eugene Levy, Catherie O'Hara, Fred Willard, Paul Benedict, Bob Balaban, etc.) are all wonderful, given their appropriately assigned characters.   I can't wait until Mr. Guest's next parody. He hits all the right nerves, especially for those of us who have been there and know how silly the whole thing can be.
