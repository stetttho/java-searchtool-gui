 I watch this film repeatedly to feel good. It's simple, strong and to the point. Ralph Nelson, director, was lucky enough to get Poitier to bring vibrant life to the simple novel of William Barrett. Poitier won the Oscar, and most deserved (some may take issue that Albert Finney's Tom Jones should've). One thing that some people miss is the fact that the nuns had been through hell, and so has the Black man. Once they connect, and understand each others' hell (or redemption), life goes on and goodness happens.  I take exception with previous reviewers who said the townsfolk were inadequate; Stanley Adams has always been a reliable actor (Summer & Smoke). The new respect for independent film makes me think that this is a better film than we realize. The best thing of all is that any actor, of any color, could play this role. Hispanics play an important part, though none of it is important. Working together, what a concept; even in 1963. I will always be impressed with this film.
