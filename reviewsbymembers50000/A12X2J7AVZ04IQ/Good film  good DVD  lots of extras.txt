 I can't say much more that hasn't been said. I might suggest you see Richard Brooks' 1967 film of "In Cold Blood". Brooks' film was brilliant, totally in touch, with excellent performances from Robert Blake & Scott Wilson as the killers. It was memorable for Quincy Jones' score (only his second, and 1st Oscar nomination); It's notable as the last b&w film nominated for Cinematography til "Schindler's List" ('93). This film would've been up for Best Picture, except those Academy fogies nominated "Doctor Dolittle". (How embarrassing for them...otherwise, all the Director nominees would've been for their Pictures). Seeing this can get you well in touch with the subject of "Capote", Bennett Miller's wonderful examination of Mr. Capote's "anguish" at writing his landmark novel. Philip Seymour Hoffman never pretends to suggest that Capote is a nice guy; rather, he's manipulative and controlling, until his involvement becomes personal. Clifton Collins, Jr. is wonderful as Perry Smith, as well as the fine support of Catherine Keener, Chris Cooper & the always reliable Bob Balaban. To be fair, I believe Mr. Hoffman deserved his Oscar; he transcended mimicry to show depth of emotion. His Oscar competition was largely people imitating other people, except for Terence Howard, whose performance was the true, bare-basics role of the year. His performance was created from scratch. Bennett Miller is certainly an excellent director, and I can't wait for his next project. There weren't a lot of "feel-good" movies up for Oscars this year. Too bad "Cinderella Man" got such a minimal recognition...
