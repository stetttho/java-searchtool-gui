 I've read the other reviews. I agreed with most. "National Treasure" is, indeed, silly and contrived, and it's loads of fun. I enjoyed it tremendously. I won't repeat what others have said, or blab away the plot; I will reiterate that Nicholas Cage takes command and is a very endearing character. Jon Voight is particularly good in a very subdued performance and it's always good to see Harvey Keitel.My absolute favorite element of this film is the side-kick character of Riley, a terrific performance by Justin Bartha. I want to see more of him. I enjoyed the intriguing sets, and I didn't think the script or direction were sub-par at all. I was entertained, and that, to me, is what movies are all about. Too bad that so many people analyzed everything with such closed minds. missing out on all the fun that was going on. The DVD has lots of fun extras. I'm happy to own it.
