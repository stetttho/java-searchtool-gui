 I saw this film for the first time tonight and decided to read the reviews; then,I felt compelled to give my 2 cents...Like an earlier reviewer, I was wandering thru K-Mart and figured that a ...DVD couldn't be too cool. But, with Leslie Nelsen, Patrick Macnee & Cindy Williams, how bad an investment can it be..? Well, this film is certainly a parody, but I think they were having more fun poking fun at themselves than anything else. From the credits, I was thinking this might've been a college degree project, since most of the thanks were to a university somewhere (I forget...) then I read that Kimmel also made "The First Nudie Musical" (1976). Hmmm.There are certainly more groans than belly-laughs and it's impossible to compare it to "Airplane!" or the Naked Gun films; though clever, it lacks the rapid-fire insanity of those others. Undoubtedly, the hysterical moments are the 2 musical numbers, and Bruce Kimmel is truly a gifted comedic actor.The only ones who can't appreciate this film are those who don't know how to enjoy the absurdity of life in general.The 90 minutes it took to watch it were not wasted; rather, I was entertained by some truly silly, enjoyable escapist fare. What a relief from the daily grind!!
