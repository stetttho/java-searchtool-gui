 This is a warm, sweet film. Like many others, I saw it, quite by accident, on cable. I've since bought the DVD and am not disappointed. This small, independent film by James F.Robinson is brilliant in concept and delivery. Right off the bat, there are repeated references to Verdi's "La Traviata", the ultimate romantic tragic opera. Things only get better, smarter and more clever. Brendon Fraser is always charming, with his child-like wish for perfection; the rest of the cast handles their roles with aplomb; Ann Magnusen is hard as nails, Tobe Huss as Cameron is the perfect innocent friend, and the great Celeste Holm is there as the granny, delivering the best line in the film: "(He's) redefining an imperfect world in a perfect way". She's crazy as a fox, and totally endearing. The mind-blowing element here is the performance of Joanna Going as Roz, the object of the whole thing. She is perfection...centered and precise in every glance, nuance and delivery. I was very impressed. She deserves a better career, since I haven't really heard of her since. A real talent. The choices of music are also excellent, in addition to the original music of Paul Mills. A rendering of "The Wee Small Hours of the Morning" (performed by Madeleine Peyroux) is most effecive, as well as the final title song, sung by Rita Springer. This is a loving display of (almost) craziness, lovingly presented by a fine director and a stellar cast. Cynics among you may not agree, but there are still a few of us out here that think true love is possible. Also, stay tuned...after the credits are over, there's a dilightful little "stinger". What a fine film!
