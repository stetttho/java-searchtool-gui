 I've read the reviews, and no one can argue that Charlize was brilliant. She needed this shot at legitimacy.  Patty Jenkins gave her that chance, after lovely performances in "Cider House" and "Mighty Joe Young". No loveliness here; a fine brutal display of a disillusioned, selfish crazy-person. Christina Ricci deserves more credit for this. She had to match the insanity with unsettling discovery. Everyone knows the story, but I only want to say that the DVD has a lot of great extras. It's worth watching. Theron is quite brilliant, and Jenkins' direction is "right-on". Not quite as riveting as "Boys Don't Cry", but almost as honest in the brutalty towards misunderstood persons.
