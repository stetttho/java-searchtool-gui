 This is my first exposure to author Sharyn McCrumb, and she has a narrative style that is riveting. Great characters, showing strengths & weaknesses, like normal people. Add a touch of supernatural Appalacian folklore, and McCrumb's wonderful characters take off. Characters like Harm Sorley, Hank the Yank, Nora Bonesteel, Jeremy Cobb and, especially, Deputy Martha Ayers, were individually as different as they come, but they all managed to touch each other's lives as the story progressed. This is my idea of a real page-turner; I enjoyed it very much.
