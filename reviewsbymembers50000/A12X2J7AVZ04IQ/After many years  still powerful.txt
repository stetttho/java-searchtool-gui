 This film brings back memories, and I'm glad the DVD finally came out, though there are no extras. Bette, in her film debut, was brilliant and deserved every award she got. Often compared to Janis Joplin, I think the screenplay of Bill Kerby & Bo Goldman gave Midler a bit more personality and personal angst. Midler handled it all like a seasoned pro. A truly excellent performance. Her concert scenes were good, too. Frederic Forrest was nominated for an Oscar, and he was quite fine (he was also in "Norma Rae" with Sally Field, who won the Oscar over Midler in '79). But it was Alan Bates as the oily, manipulative agent (baby-sitter?) who truly deserved recognition. The Oscars also recognized the film for its Sound and brilliant Editing. Sorely missing from the nominations were the Adapted Score and the wonderful title Song, written by Amanda McBroom.  This is a powerful and entertaining film, with fine acting and great direction by Mark Rydell, loaded with humor, pathos and sadness, and all brought to life by the remarkable Bette Midler.It's worth watching again. Also, watch for David Keith (her personal bodyguard/masseur, later on), who later made such a strong impression in "An Officer and a Gentleman".
