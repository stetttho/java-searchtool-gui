 I have a particular interest in the development of Johnny Depp's career; the man has shown genius for so long (Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood, Sleepy Hollow), but he really went over the edge in "Pirates", and suddenly he's a force to be reckoned with. Johnny Depp is the best of our current crop of actors working today. The man has control, insight and tremendous ability to entertain, as the situation sees fit. After the crazy performance in "Pirates", Mr. Depp gives a subdued, thorougly complete rendition of J. M. Barrie's life during the creation of Peter Pan. Very fine performances from Kate Winslet, Julie Christie and a bunch of really good kid actors made this a wonderful film experience; a feel-good film that's intelligent enough for kids of all ages. A young (20's) female friend of mine thought it was dumb. As a 50+ male, I can relate, especially since I'm amused at the idea of "Peter Pan Syndrome". I hope I never grow up.
