 When's the last time anyone dared to tackle such a subject? We already know that some of the details of Brandon Teena's life needed to be changed to make a concise and coherent film. There is no question that Brandon is not a nice person; he's a user, forger, thief, etc. Still, it's an interesting person around which Kimberly Peirce chose to center her first film. Certain elements of Brandon's life have been "abbreviated" but this was for the flow of the film's narrative. There is really no way anyone can fault Hilary Swank's brilliant performance. She was in practically every frame of the film; Chloe Sevigny brought out the sweetness and tenderness from Swank's character. She also personified the boredom of the lower class, mid-Western, stuck-in-a-rut, karaoke singing, girl at dead-end. There are people like this.It's frightening to think that previous reviewers don't believe it. It's a riveting film, and Hilary Swank gives one of the most courageous performances. Even if you don't believe the gender switch, Ms. Peirce's film is an important one.I love this film. There's ugliness, and it's dealt with appropriately. This IS a true story (edited for content), though a good display of red-neck culture. Most instructive. Most upsetting. Most enthrallng. Hilary deserved every award.
