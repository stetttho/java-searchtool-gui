 After hearing sterling reviews, I decided to find out what all the fuss was about. I am SO glad I did. The music lets you know right from the beginning that this is a love story/epic, and uses period-style melodies that draw you into the narrative. The attention to period detail hasn't been so impressive since Polanski's "Tess". And the acting couldn't be more pitch-perfect. Indeed, Keira Knightly was the headstrong yet vulnerable Lizzie, and Matt MacFadyen managed to get better looking as the film went on, to the point that it was almost a distraction. We are seeing Darcy through Lizzie's eyes. Wonderful supporting performances from Brenda Blethyn, Donald Sutherland, and a particularly bitchy Dame Judi Dench, as well as everyone else, certainly add to this most pleasurable film experience. I'm hoping the Academy won't write this off as just another adaptation of a classic. This film can stand on its own as entertainment right alongside any of 'em.
