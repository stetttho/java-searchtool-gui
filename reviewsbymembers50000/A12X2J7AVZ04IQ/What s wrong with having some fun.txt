 Yeah, it's silly. It's derivative. It's not the greatest (or even close). Still, I think a lot of people are missing an essential point in this film...IT'S A PARODY!!! It's a big joke, with running gags, lots of humor, fun characters, especially Broderick. Matthew Broderick is at his best when he looks like the idiot hero; he's self-effacing and lovable and that should be enough. They constantly mispronounce his name, followed by "er...whatever" and he's regularly referred to as "the worm guy". It happens a lot. I'm a fan of running gags. That so many people took this film WAY too seriously may explain its failure. The extras on the DVD are good, especially listening to the uber- master Emmerich trying to sound like the expert (which he's NOT!). A bit disturbing to me, was to see NYC destroyed, yet there were some great aerial shots of the WTC. When one watches a goofy film like this, it's good to keep in mind that it's all fantasy. The aerial shots were glorious, and can live on, at least superficially, as a testament to the NYC skyline, as some of us knew it. The ones who don't like this film are the ones who can't find humor in the silliness of grand fantasy.
