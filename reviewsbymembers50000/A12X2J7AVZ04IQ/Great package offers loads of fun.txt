 I've read the other reviews and am impressed with their background knowledge. I, too, am a fan of 60's trash horror films, and bought this DVD only because of the price. I am most entertained, and happy with this humble investment. "Blood Creature" was eerie & atmospheric, a little claustrophobic, with storms, etc., adding to the mood. It's silly and fun, and the beautiful Greta Thyssen is there to boot! (I remember her from a film called "Journey to the Seventh Planet", a Danish film that was released in America by American-International, the greatest studio ever to put out "the best of the worst", all the drive-in movies, and practically everything Roger Corman ever did. Richard Derr also appears, typically luggish and looking customarily concerned. I loved him in "When Worlds Collide", one of my favorites. "Werewolf..." is fun, too, with creepy atmosphere and a Peter Lorre look-alike who is sufficiently bizarre. The dubbing is really bad (every line sounds like it came out of a studio microphone...which it did), but there's a lot of homage to the films of James Whale & Val Lewton: suspense and dark intrigue. The song "Ghoul in the School" is an added treat. These two films, tacky as they are, would be OK for the price, but there are previews and even a Popeye cartoon (featuring Bluto & Wimpy, alas, no Olive Oyl). Whatever aesthetic elements may be lacking regarding the actual artistic worth of these 2 films, I wouldn't worry about it. My hat goes off in salute to Madacy Enterainment for putting out a very good package at an unbelievably good price. I hope they continue this trend, and maybe we'll see Corman's original "Not of This Earth" or maybe even "Journey to the 7th Planet". One can only hope.
