 I am a movie fan. I didn't read the books. Intellectual snobs can make comparisons. Who cares? Not me. I enjoyed this film a lot. The sets and photography, as well as smart editing and a great score, had me from the beginning. I'm bored by those who say Jim Carrey was "over the top". I can't think of any other way to portray Count Olaf. It was perfect casting. All of the acting was wonderful, especially Liam Aiken (Klaus) and Emily Browning (Violet), and remarkably lovely performances from Kara & Shelby Hoffman as little Sunny. I can't tolerate bad kid-actors; these kids were superb! It gave credence to the idea that kids often see more than the adults around them. Billy Connolly, Timothy Spall and, especially, the great Meryl Streep took the reins and ran with their characters. It's also boring to hear people say that Tim Burton should've directed this film. It certainly was his style, but Brad Silberling was a fine choice. I was taken on a wonderful journey, and, to me, that's what films are all about. Forgive me all to heck for not having read the books.
