 I'm glad I didn't read any of the Amazon reviews prior to renting it. All of my reviewing predessors blabbed away the very element that makes this film so compelling. I won't do that. Sure, I was a bit baffled at the goings-on, but director Inarratu weaves a tapesty that results in a mind-blowing catharsis. This is one of those "full-circle" films with flash-backs, flash-forwards, and relies on the viewers ability of retention. The three leads are brilliant, and I take issue with a previous reviewer about Watts' character; grief affects people in different ways, and I thought her decisions were appropriate to the developments. Her performance was dead-on, as well as those of Penn and del Toro. I was very impressed. The film is grim and unpleasant with its subject matter. However, its ugliness is countered with daring honesty, something that many don't really ever think they'll have to deal with. Life, death, love, hope, desperation and redemption have rarely been examined so thoroughly on film. To say I loved this film would be like saying I loved a root canal; still, I felt that it was important, and extremely well presented. Once the power of the novocaine wears off, you find yourself thinking a lot about your own mortality. Unfortunately, the DVD offers no extras of any kind.
