 I'm a HUGE fan of Julie Andrews. Here's film with Julie in almost every frame; Robert Wise directing; top-notch production values...costumes, sets, photography, choreography by Michael Kidd, Noel Coward songs...So why does the film fall so flat? Could it be that Julie is a soprano and Gertie Lawrence was a mezzo? Is Julie trying too hard to make Gertie likeable? Could it be the abysmal screenplay of William Fairchild? I'd only seen parts of this film in the past, and now I own the DVD. It's a good transfer, with a wonderful 2.35:1 LBX to show off period detail. There's the wonderful Daniel Massey playing Noel Coward, and his performance saves much of the film.  Still, if you want to see the 20's & 30's period detail, I would recommend the original "42nd Street" with Ginger Rogers: More exciting, more interesting and far more entertaining. I do admit, Julie's rendition of "Someone to Watch Over Me" is lovely; she's in soprano mode.
