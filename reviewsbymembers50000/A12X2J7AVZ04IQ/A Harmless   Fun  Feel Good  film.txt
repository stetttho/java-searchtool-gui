 Just got the DVD, and forgot how wonderfully entertaining this film really is. Danny Huston's directorial debut was met with mixed reaction, but this film never fails to entertain. It's simple, sweet and a bit profound (based on Thornton Wilder) and the attention to 1920's period detail is intact. The most fun thing is the exemplary ensemble cast that Mr. Huston assembled (no doubt with help from father, John, who was co-writer). Anjelica Huston, Mary Stuart Masterson, Tammy Grimes, Virginia Madsen, Harry Dean Stanton, the wonderful Lauren Bacall, and, most notably, the GREAT Robert Mitchum. Holding it all together,in a wonderfully confident fashion, is a young Anthony Edwards in the title role. He is an Everyman, knowing he is better than his lot, talented and confident enough to fulfill his dream. A fine cameo from the great playwright, Christopher Durang, is also a pleasure. After a day of beating your brains out and wondering why life isn't better, watch this film and you'll feel good. Apparently, Mr. North was in all the right places at the right time... Hey! It COULD happen...(?)
