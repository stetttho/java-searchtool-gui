 "Cursed" is not a great film, but I like it in spite of its flaws. It's definitely silly, but is layered with lots of humor to let everyone know that it's making fun of itself.I've always liked Christina Ricci, but this isn't her best moment. Jesse Eisenberg is the real star, and he's given all the best moments (and the best lines). For some reason, I enjoyed seeing Scott Baio working again. The DVD has lots of gratuitous stuff, with the cast & filmmakers talkng about how great their vision really was. A lot of bull, but entertaining, nonetheless. The bottom line is that it isn't that great, but I was really entertained with the performance of Jesse Eisenberg, which kept it from being a total dud.
