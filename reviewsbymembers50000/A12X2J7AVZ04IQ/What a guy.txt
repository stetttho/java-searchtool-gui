 I did not have the privilege of seeing this in an IMAX theatre; rather, I borrowed the DVD from the library. In its 41 minutes, I was riveted and in complete awe. The photography of that very mysterious Antarctica was exquisite: the 2000/01 photography as well as the original. I cheered the great Shackleton and his crew, but was concerned about their faithful dogs (I'm not a PETA freak, I just like good dogs). I know there are other, longer and more detailed versions of Shackleton's trip. I'm happy to have seen this version. It was concise, and told me enough to know that Shackleton is a great man, an adventurer to be revered and admired in perpetuity. A bleak adventure, children should see this as a lesson in perseverence and fortitude. I'm humbled.
