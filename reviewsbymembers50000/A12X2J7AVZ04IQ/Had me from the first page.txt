 A friend loaned me this book, and I put off opening it. When I finally decided to check it out, imagine my surprise. This book really has everything for the mystery fan: well-drawn characters, great plot and sub-plots, intriguing setting and an intense feeling of "being there". Cork O'Connor is an excellent hero, with human weaknesses balancing his strengths. I finished the book last night, and I've just ordered Krueger's first Cork O'Connor book, IRON LAKE, and his third book is on my list after that. Keep 'em coming, Mr. Krueger. You are a refreshingly smart writer. Excellent!!
