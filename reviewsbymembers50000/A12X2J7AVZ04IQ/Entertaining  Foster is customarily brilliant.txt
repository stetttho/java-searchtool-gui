 Okay, I avoided watching it for a while after I bought it; everyone blabbed away that it was a conspiracy film, etc. I watched it last nite and was highly entertained, largely due to the luminous Ms. Foster. I recognized the reference to "The Lady Vanishes" right away, but I wasn't sure who the bad guys were. Sean Bean has played a bad guy in almost everything I've seen him in, and Sarsgard's appearance always reminds me of the first film I'd seen him in (Boys Don't Cry). Then I started to believe that Foster's character suffered from grief-induced fantasies. Don't try to analyze it too much before you've seen it. I did, and I enjoyed it despite any initial misgivings. There are requisite good guys and bad guys, a clever twist regarding the bad guy's motivation, a satisfying demise of the bad guy, and generally fine acting from all involved, especially Foster. I was pleased to see Greta Scacchi in a cameo as a therapist.It was a fun and enjoyable film to watch on a snowy Wisconsin Saturday nite.
