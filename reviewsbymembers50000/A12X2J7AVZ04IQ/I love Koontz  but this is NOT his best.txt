 I have a great affinity for Dean Koontz. There are a lot of things I can relate to; love of dogs, good narrative style, short chapters.  "The Taking" takes off with terrific enthusiasm, and gets a bit complicated, and keeps the reader involved. The ending was a little too quick, and I wasn't crazy about his simple resolution. Aside from that, a bunch of scared kids, aged 10 and under, would hardly sit still (as they did) through the chaos. Improbable? After the excellent "Odd Thomas", I was hoping for some riveting characters. There weren't any. Molly, as narrator, was fine, but we never got to know Neil, her husband, who was her base of strength. The resolution was really disappointing and kind of dull. I could understand aliens running away from this planet because of teenagers...but there were no teenagers involved. "Odd Thomas" is Koontz' most recent good book. If you want a really mean nasty character, check out "The Face". I still think his best is "Shadowfires", one of his earlier novels (written under a pseudonym); he really had a good handle on stuff in that one.
