 I bought this DVD sight unseen, because I'd heard how wonderful the film is. It is, indeed, a wonderful & fun film, loaded with fantasy and "kid stuff" that everyone can enjoy. I was not aware when I bought this that there's a lot missing; there are hardly any extras (2 trailers & some previews of other movies). Now that I'm hearing about deleted scemes & alternate endings, I'm extremely disappointed.I still can't believe that his was directed by Robert Rodriguez, not that I deny his talent, rather it's just a little too tame for what I expect from him. Definitely a feather in his cap, a testament to his versatility. Definitely see this film for a great, escapist time, but don't buy it till the "Director's Cut" edition comes out (and I'm sure one will).
