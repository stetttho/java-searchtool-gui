 This film has maintained its momentum over time. I find it as exciting now as I did when I saw it in 1961. It was nominated for 7 Academy Awards, including Best Film, Director & Screenplay (it won for Special Visual Effects). The editing in particular is so precise as to keep a semblance of the tight drama unfolding before you. The acting is somewhat of a ham factory, and Gregory Peck is hammiest of all. I'm sure James Darren was thrown in there to attract lady viewers, and he's actually not as bad as the rest. A terrific 2.35:1 Widescreen is great, and the DVD offers some fun extras. There's little doubt that this was the inspiration for "The Dirty Dozen" (1967) and the other similar films that followed. Though it's all fiction (there is no Navarone), this is a very exciting war film layered with some human drama. "The Guns of Navarone" is a classic, and belongs in the film library of anyone who respects good film-making, as well as those who want to have an exciting time.
