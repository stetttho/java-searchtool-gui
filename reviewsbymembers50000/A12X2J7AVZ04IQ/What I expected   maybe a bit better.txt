 I first heard of this film accidentally thru Amazon; I hit a button and there were all these reviews & commentaries. When I saw it in a store at a good price, I bought it, sight unseen.I LOVE trashy horror flicks, though not really a slasher fan. I was pleasantly surprised, though it was largely what I expected. The DVD has lots of extras, and I'm terribly impressed. The unknown (to America) film THE UGLY looked most interesting, and was impressed to know that the lead actor won awards for the portrayal. Jason & Michael Myers are only slashing madmen; F. Kruger had sophistication; Chucky & Puppetmaster involved possessed inanimate objects...etc. Somewhat out of place was Norman Bates, Tony Perkins' brilliant and complex performance in the only truly Grade A film of the bunch. What's really great is that scenes were shown as an example, without giving away too much, but getting to the nitty-gritty of the genre. (I never saw "The Dentist", nor do I want to...) At 58 minutes, this is a film you will want in your collection, especially when guests are over and beer is flowing. It never gives you a chance to get tired of any ONE element/idea, and you will never get bored. It moves at a good clip. I noticed that this is "Vol. 1"...the horror genre is so massive that countless volumes in this series could be developed successfully, considering Sci-Fi, Dracula, Mummy, Frankenstein, Haunted Houses, etc. Everything about this compilation film hits the right notes. Let's have more, but let's also keep it diverse and interesting. More of the same (slasher) would be perhaps a bit redundant. I'm glad for the inclusion of "Phantasm", one of the true originals!
