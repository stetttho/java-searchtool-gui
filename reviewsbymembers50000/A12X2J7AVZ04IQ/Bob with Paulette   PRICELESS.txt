 Bob Hope's career was marginally initiated in 1938 when he sang "Thanks for the Memory". The next year he teamed with Bing and made "Road to Singapore". This was a good start. His talent was recognized, apparently, because, among other projects, he was teamed with Paulette Goddard in the very delightful "Cat and the Canary". The chemistry was absolute. Studio ideas as they were, put them in "The Ghost Breakers", and it's no end of fun.It's certainly silly, and the racism involved wasn't meant to be offensive, merely a sign of the times. What's wonderful is that great chemistry between Hope & Goddard. Hope, a devout Republican, had a chance to knock the Democrats (the zombies...mindlessly doing what they're told); fun bad guys, charming mysterious persons, like Anthony Quinn & Richard Carlson & Paul Henried. Jokes are fun, no one is spared, and it was Hope & Goddard's second best moment. The best is "The Cat and the Canary", and I'm really waiting for this clever, original film to be released on DVD. Anyone else agree?
