 If you're reading this, you already know what a great and devastating film this is.Gene Tierney received her only Oscar nomination (1945), and her performance was so complete that some of her friends stopped talking to her.Cornel Wilde received an Oscar nomination for his first film, "A Song to Remember" (1945; where he played Frederic Chopin); I'm only assuming this was his second film. He's great! Also great is Jeanne Crain, in one of her first films. This is a real-life horror film, and I'm at a loss to think of such an evil character today in film, not counting slasher films. Psychological terror is well examined, and director John M. Stahl presents it simply and completely. Oscar-winning color photography by Leon Shamroy shows gorgeous vistas of Maine & New Mexico, and the Oscar-nominated sets of Lyle Wheeler & Maurice Ranford were so comfortable and natural that you wanted to be there; cozy and natural. The involved novel of Ben Ames Williams was given an exemplary adatation by Jo Swerling. This is, indeed, one of the major films of the 40's. One that scares me, because I know people like this.I think we all do. Scary, huh?
