 Otto Preminger is often maligned by film historians because he didn't have a stereotype. He made films as diverse as "Laura", "Carmen Jones", "Porgy & Bess" and "The Cardinal". He also made "Exodus". I first saw this film as an 11 year old kid. I grew up in the sheltered German-Polish southside of Milwaukee, and, apparently for obvious reasons, I knew very little of the plight of the Jews. The attention span of an 11 year old is often a subject of scorn, but I've never forgotten how powerful an effect this film had on me.    The screenplay by Dalton Trumbo was concise, since Leon Uris' novel was quite explicit in detail. As I said, as a history lesson, your kids should see this, especially if you're a non-Jew. I was riveted. 42 years later, I'm seeing the same story but being a little more critical. It's still a wonderful piece of film-making, with brilliant photography of actual locations (a bit faded at times, even on MGM's DVD version); previous reviewers have already commented on the plot and other things so I'll not go on about the lack of chemistry between the leads. Sal Mineo is often joked about, but this is his second Oscar-nominated performance (after "Rebel W/O a Cause") and there is a true nuance about his character aside from the tirades in which he indulges. His eyes flash at moments when you don't expect it, leading to a "cute" romance with the beautiful and admirable Jill Haworth. Mineo WAS talented. Still, the film only garnered 3 Oscar nominations: Mineo (supporting), cinematography and a win for Ernest Gold's legendary score. This all said, the essence of the message can be interpreted as a history lesson. I was particularly moved by Newman's final speech: "(Someday) Arab & Jew will share a peaceful life in this land they have always shared in death" Maybe it's a little more relevant now than we thought.
