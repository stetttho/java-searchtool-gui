 This 1986 video features a spectacular helicopter ride, with no obtrusive narration. Instead, some great classical music accompanies this visual treat, which is akin to those relaxation tapes that soothe the senses. The color is slightly faded, but those familiar with the GC know that colors are always changing there, so it's not a real distraction. The Grand Canyon has been around for millions of years; a 20 year old video shouldn't make much difference. They also filmed this before the helicopters were given their restrictions. Any view of the GC is a treat, and this 1 hour video is stunning.
