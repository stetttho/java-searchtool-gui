 All I can say is that Geraldine Page is among the finest actresses of the 20th Century, whether on stage or film. I don't understand why "The Trip to Bountiful" or "Summer and Smoke" or "Sweet Bird of Youth" aren't out there on DVD. She died only months after finally winning the Oscar in 1986; a tribute to this great lady's films is long overdue. Anyone else agree? 4-22-05; the DVD is wonderful! Thank you, powers that be. Now where are "Summer & Smoke" & "Sweet Bird"?
