 I am a huge fan of Koontz, though I was thinking he may have lost some focus. "The Face" was OK, but he had just written some really long novels that could've been shortened by about 300 pages ("From the Corner of His Eye", "One Door Away from Heaven", etc.). Mr. Koontz has a huge fan-base, and I know that we're all happy that he's back to a concise story with an endearing hero. It's a fast read, with lots of great twists. Koontz' original style (gripping you from the first page) is back in full flower. I enjoyed "Odd Thomas" very much.
