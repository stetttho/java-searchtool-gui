 Shirley carries this film, wonderfully! Lancaster, a great actor, was so sorely miscast, it was hard to imagine. Ms. Booth had done the role over 100 times on stage, and it's no surprise she won the Oscar in 1952, probably the worst year in Oscar history. That same year, Shirley was up against Julie Harris, who had also done "The Member of the Wedding" on stage and won awards. Ms. Harris has had as spotty a career on film, as did Ms. Booth. Interesting. The magnificent play of William Inge can only be another feather in his cap. His very personal plays have been presented on screen so well; most especially in "The Dark at the Top of the Stairs". When will that be available on DVD?Yes, 1952 was a huge Oscar mistake; Booth deserved her Oscar, Gary Cooper deserved it (for "High Noon"), but "The Greatest Show on Earth" as Best Picture? Over "The Quiet Man"? WRONG!
