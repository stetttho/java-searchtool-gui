 I expected so much more from a film with Sam Raimi's name attached to it. It just goes on and on...The resolution came fast, and left a lot of questions unanswered. All in all, I was disappointed. The cast was fine. Even with his one expression, Barry Watson is certainly handsome enough to keep you watching. The acting is generally OK for this kind of film, and there's a particularly good perfomance from young Skye McCole Bartusiak.  I love this genre, and almost bought it. Then a friend loaned it to me, and saved me a few bucks. After buying "Darkness" and "White Noise", sight unseen (both of which disappointed me), I'm glad to know I made the right choice.When do you think we'll get a really good ghost movie? "The Others" was the last decent one I can remember.
