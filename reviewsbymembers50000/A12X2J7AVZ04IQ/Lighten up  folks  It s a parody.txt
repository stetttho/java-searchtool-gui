 This totally silly, illogical film is nothing but fun. Oliver Platt delivers some great lines; Betty White is feisty and bitchy; Meredith Salinger (so wonderful in "The Journey of Natty Gann") isn't given much to do, but it's good to know she's still working. Bill Pullman and Bridget Fonda are cute, and the often unheralded Brendan Gleeson is terrific. Director Steve Miner (House, Soul Man) apparently had some problems keeping order, because there's no cohesive narrative. At 82 minutes, we can only imagine what was left on the cutting room floor. It's trashy fun, but, alas, trash. I don't have a problem with that. I enjoy the horror genre and most are enjoyable because of their flaws.  This is no exception.I DO take issue with a reviewer that compared it to "Jaws". In the realm of really good film-making, that's a sacriligious comment.
