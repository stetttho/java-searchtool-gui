 In our PC society, I can still look back and grin affecionately, considering that this film was made at a time when "battle-of-the-sexes" humor was at a peak (Doris Day, anyone?) Lemmon's a natural, and Terry-Thomas actually steals the film for that reason. Fairly formulaic, the men are made to look more idiotic than the women, though if anyone wants to take issue, check out Claire Trevor's manipulative harpee witch. Virna Lisi is, indeed, stunningly gorgeous, and very endearing. This is a "nice" movie; not a great one, nor one that lives on in history. It has Lemmon, Terry-Thomas, Lisi, Trevor, Eddie Mayehoff (a riot), and should be taken for exactly what it is: a fun, mindless romp that entertains. Lighten up. I still think this should've been nominated for Sound Effects...I never forgot the "Gloppita-gloppita" machine. Don't judge; enjoy!
