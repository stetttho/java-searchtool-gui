 As this film began, I was certain it was a film by David Fincher. The titles, music and approach are quite similar. Well, Director Gregory Hoblit created an atmosphere that was not only weird, but incredibly compelling. Don't blink for a minute. (Hoblit later made the wonderful "Primal Fear") Denzel is his usual confident self, learning, along with the viewer, the strange develoments. Embeth Davitz is quite fine, and there's also the talents of James Gandolfini and John Goodman. Once again, Donald Sutherland gives a brilliant performance. (Why do the Oscars ignore him...?). Elias Koteas, sadly ignored by critics and award committees, is again flawless. (Remember "Some Kind of Wonderful", "Apt Pupil", "The Thin Red Line", "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles", etc. ?) "Fallen" is a very scary film, which gains momentum with every frame. Creepy movies don't get much better.
