 No doubt, this was the inspiration for the disaster films to follow, though there was little or no violence and no deaths. I'd seen the film years ago on TV and remember enjoying it a lot. I jumped at the chance to get the 2-disc DVD, and I'm not disappointed. The Ultra-Wide Cinemascope transfer is definitely a credit to those people who labor insanely to preserve America's film heritage, especially after the collapse of the studio system. "The High and the Mighty" is soap opera with suspense, just like every other disaster film, though it was the first. My interest was held, solidly, and the course of events entertained me. The ensemble cast was uniformly fine, with Oscar nods going to Claire Trevor & Jan Sterling, though I thought Paul Fix was deserving as well. Ralph Dawson's brilliant editing was also nominated. Keeping all this stuff coherent is the sure and confident hand of veteran William A. Wellman, juggling scenes and events that might otherwise come off as silly and incongruous. Maybe it's not the greatest film, but considering the talents involved, and the period in which it was made, I am still impressed. And, yes, John Wayne was a good actor who's not been given proper credit.
