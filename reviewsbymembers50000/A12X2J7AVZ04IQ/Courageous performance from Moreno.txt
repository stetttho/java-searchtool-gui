 It took me a few days for this film to sink in (I rented it). The hopelessness and frustration of being stuck in a poverty-stricken area of Colombia was so well portrayed by director, Joshua Marston. Poor Maria is stuck in a rut, with her whole life ahead of her, and knows she can do better. Enter the chance to travel & make money; Maria thinks twice and agrees anyway. After all, it can't be all that bad...right? Well, I'm not going to blab away any plot points, but Catalina Sandino Mareno embodies the drab, as well as the strong; ultimately the outraged and determined heroine of this disturbing film. To me, the ugliness of the drug situation wasn't made ugly enough. Mr. Marston chose brevity over outrage, and hit all the right marks. He relied on Ms. Moreno to convey, and his choice was dead-on. This brillant young actress (23 at the time, playing a 17 year old) has a formidable career ahead of her. Will she win the Oscar? Probably not. I think it'll be another slug-fest between Swank & Bening, and no one's seen Staunton (who should win); and don't discard Winslet, who's outrageously energetic performance can't be discarded (she's also been nominated, and lost, more than the others).Despite idiot choices by the Academy in the past, it's comforting to know that true excellence is being recognized. I'll be waiting to hear of Ms. Moreno's next project.
