 I've had this book up for sale on Amazon for a long time. I finally decided to read it. It's a fast read, with some interesting twists. Some elements of the plot are left unexplained, but it doesn't really matter. Still, it's a good mystery story. Arnold never got involved until it affected him personally. If you were in college during the turmoil years (as I was), many elements will hit home. Not great, but lotsa fun.
