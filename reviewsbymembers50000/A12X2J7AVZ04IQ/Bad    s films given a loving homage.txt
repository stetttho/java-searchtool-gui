 I love the trashy sci-fi films of the 50's. Visionary Larry Blamire has created a parody, on a low budget, that hits all the right marks. This film is hysterically funny, in all the right places.The cast is talented enough to actually "create" bad performances. You'll have to see this to believe it. There was obviously great love in the making of this film. Kick back and let it take you for a goofy ride. The DVD is loaded with extras, which are very entertaining and informative. Production values are surprisingly high considering it was made for $100K, and in 10 days. I'm glad to have this in my collection, right next to "Plan 9..."
