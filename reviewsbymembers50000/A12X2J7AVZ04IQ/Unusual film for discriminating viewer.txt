 I eagerly awaited the arrival of this DVD version, fascinated with the idea of Shatner before Trek, and the whole Esperanto idea. I am NOT disappointed! Before writing this, I read the first 7 reviews so I'll try not to repeat stuff (I agreed with most of what was said). I first heard of Esperanto back in college at U of Wisc--Madison, where it was offered in night classes. Apparently, it's been around since the 1880's, developed as a "universal language". There have been resurgences of interest periodically since, most notably during the 60's. The director chose Esperanto because he wanted an "other-worldly" language for the demons that couldn't be compared to any other. It works, phenomenally well!! Shatner is quite good, as is Allyson Ames (Kia) and Ann Atmar (as Shatner's sister). Unfortunately, the acting of Eloise Hardt (as Kia's sister) and Milos Milos (title character) is reminisent of Ed Wood's films, WAY over the top of respectable limits. The music score by Dominic Frontiere is eerie, moody and thoroughly appropriate and the photography of the great Conrad Hall is among the best black and white you'll ever see...his use of shadows and fog and back-lighting gives the film ALL of its considerable atmosphere. The location of the Big Sur area in California is perfect.I would recommend this film for anyone with an appreciation of the unusual. Sure, there are a lot of slow moments that were annoying (but just look at the scenery); the overall craft of film-making here has indeed reached a new (if different) level. By all means, check this one out!
