 I saw this film again after almost 20 years, and was again riveted by its artistry and integrity. Robert Redford's directoial debut was most acute, with generous close-ups, and a profound respect for the script. Timothy Hutton is the center of this film, and the completeness of his incredible performance can make no one doubt why he won the Oscar (Supporting?). I won't rehash the plot because everyone else has done that. But there's the performance of Mary Tyler Moore, shedding her good girl image and playing a selfish control-freak mother with virtually no emotion. She's incapable of saying "I Love You" to anyone in her life, including herself. It's a classic performance, adding to her already respectable body of work. Judd Hirsch was pivotal to the goings-on as the shrink (also Oscar nominated), and Elizabeth McGovern was excellent in one of her first roles as Hutton's puppy-love (she was nominated the following year for "Ragtime"). In a small but pivotal role, Dinah Manoff shines as the only person Hutton felt he could talk to, but ultimately, couldn't. Though this won most of the major Oscars (Picture, Director, Screenplay, Supp. Actor), the Academy should hang their heads in shame for ignoring the outstanding performance of Donald Sutherland. It was a subdued, centered performance that eventually made everything make sense. His final scene (with Moore) was so very sincere, and the closing scene (with Hutton), where they both said "I Love You" to each other, made everything seem all right. Even if he was nominated, it's hard to say if he could've beaten DeNiro in "Raging Bull". (I'm disappointed that Hutton's and McGovern's careers weren't greater.) Have tissues handy, and experience this wonderful display by Redford that made this dysfunctional family so compelling.
