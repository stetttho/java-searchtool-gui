 I am thrilled that this film will finally be released on DVD in May, 2006. I'm among the greatest of Geraldine Page's fans, and the only better news I could get would be that "Summer & Smoke" will be out soon. Indeed, Williams' play was toned down for the studio sensibilities of the 60's. Newman was very fine, as was Shirley Knight, Madeline Sherwood, Ed Begley & Rip Torn. But it's Page who carries this amazing film about depravity, disappointment and hopelessness. Page did the role many times on stage, and Paul Newman was an excellent choice for Chance Wayne. Page, Knight & Begley were all nominated for Oscars (Begley a winner); Knight was nominated 2 years earlier for "The Dark at the Top of the Stairs", another brilliant film adaptation of a play by the great American playwright, William Inge. I hope Warner Bros. has the sense to release that soon. A wonderful film. So much drivel is being released on DVD. It's unfortunate that the quality stuff has been put on the back shelf. Will they ever realize that there is a public out here, waiting for real quality?
