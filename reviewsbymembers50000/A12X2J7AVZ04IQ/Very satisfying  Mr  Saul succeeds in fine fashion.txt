 I won't analyze this book to pieces, as some others did. I read for entertainment, and this one had me from the first page. I'm a huge fan of Horror Fiction, especially Saul & Koontz, and I was constantly surprised at developments. Mr. Saul is often quite brutal in his depictions of children being mistreated or victimized, but he sorta modified his expected style to create some interesting surprises. Indeed, I was surprised at many developments, and was never quite sure who the bad guy was until the final revelation. Red herrings a-plenty, I had fun, and it was a satisfying reading experience for me. I enjoyed it a lot.
