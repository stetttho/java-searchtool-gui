 First and last, this has got to be the ultimate love story, complete with conflict and great supporting characters, etc. Though the characters of Mary Shelley are suggested, this is in no way a horror film. The lush, gorgeous music of Maurice Jarre lets you know this right from the start. I'll not blab away the plot, except to say that the separate adventures of the bride and the "monster" are paralleled cleverly by director Franc Roddam. Sting was good, as was Jennifer Beals. Clancy Brown as Viktor (the monster) had wonderfully realized sense of moral character, suspicious of kindness; grateful for friendship. His friendship is found in the person of Rinaldo, wonderfully played by David Rappaport. There's adventure, loss, renewal and a darn good story to go along with it.  As in Mary Slelley's tale, there is goodness and evil. Here, it's approached in a refreshing new way. This has a more satisfying ending. I only bought this film because I love Geraldine Page. Her natural brilliance isn't given much of a challenge. "The Bride" came out in 1985, the same year Ms. Page gave her Oscar winning performance in "The Trip to Bountiful".Any moment of Page is worth it. A pity she left this world in 1986.   Aside from that, "The Bride" is worth consideration. This really is a great date movie...
