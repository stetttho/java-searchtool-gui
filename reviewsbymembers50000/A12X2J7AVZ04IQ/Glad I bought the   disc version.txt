 This is a powerful film. There are so many stories about misunderstood persons with a mission. Previous reviewers have already analyzed the plot, etc., but I was impressed with Bill Condon's direction and especially his Screenplay (he was nominated by the Writers' Guild; also won the Oscar for writing the wonderful "Gods & Monsters"). This is an "indie" but I never would've realized that. The photography by Frederick Elmes was exquisite; period detail was completely caught by costumer Bruce Finlayson and set designer Richard Sherman. Especially impressive was the editing by Virginia Katz, keeping the narrative frantic, or calm & sweet, as necessary. Liam Neeson was perfect, as was Laura Linney as his wife. Excellent chemistry. Also were excellent performances from Peter Sarsgaard, Chris O'Donnell, Timothy Hutton, John Lithgow, Oliver Platt & Tim Curry (as a prude?). Two performances really blew me away: William Sadler as the ultimate sex-offender was so subtle and natural in his delivery that it was unsettling. Also, at the very end, a stunning and beautifully created cameo from Lynn Redgrave, giving Mr. Kinsey a sense of renewal. It's very hard for me to believe that there are people out there who don't realize that Mr. Kinsey meant well. I love films for entertainment, and if there's some enlightenment, my experience is enhanced. This is a simple, basic story, written and presented very well by the talented Bill Condon.
