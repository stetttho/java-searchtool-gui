 To read some of the previous reviews, I guess one must know the body of work by Fulci to "get" anything out of this film. Well, I never heard of Fulci. I do, however, like trashy horror flicks and this one did not entirely disappoint.The acting was bad enough to amuse me, special effects were non-existant (tho sound effects were VERY good), the plot was idiotic (as it should be) and the DVD version I got was dirt cheap. I enjoyed it. I was, however, very impressed with the crisp, moody photography (in a WIDE letterbox) and, all in all, I think I made a good investment. One thing that often bothered me about dubbed, Italian films of this period is that they are often boring, relying only on gore. There certainly was plenty of that, but my attention was held quite well considering the idiot plot. I guess the best thing about this film is that it makes me want to see more by this Fulci guy.
