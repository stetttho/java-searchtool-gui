 "Creepshow" is especially fun for me, because I work in a job where I feel underappreciated. Every bad person in this film gets his/her due; though there are some bad people left over, they'll be fine. A bunch of great stories, penned by King and directed by Romero, you can't help but have fun. Aside from the knowledge that this is comic book stuff, an element of humor pervades all of the action. I won't blab away any of the plots, but... The E.G. Marshall scene was best, but the (very serious) Leslie Neilsen scene was fun, too. Actually, Adrienne Barbeau & Hal Holbrook seemed to have the most fun. Also, Viveca Lindfors let herself look ugly, and, though she's advancing in years, she's has lovely class (she was the English teacher in "The Sure Thing", two years later). There's so much to say about this film, and, apparently, the critics wrote it off. Who cares?! This is loads of fun.
