 Kurt Neumann has put together a wonderful display of SciFi stuff and all of the silliness that goes along with the 1950's genre... Jeff Morrow is typically over-reactive and Barbara Lawrence is beautiful. The plot is really good and interesting, and the widescreen version shows all the great animation/special effects as were intended. A different, and very interesting, monster appears and never fails to entertain. The whole cast is quite good, and very concerned. The musical score by Paul Sawtell & Bert Shefter has been used repeatedly in other cheaper films...I'm not really sure if it was original for this one. Still, it's fun and tacky. Notice this: at the very beginning, the guy is driving down the highway in hs truck, and the music on the radio is "Something's Gotta Give". I thought that was clever.
