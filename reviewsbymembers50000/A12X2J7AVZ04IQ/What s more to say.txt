 The amazing performance of Emily Watson is enough. The film, itself, is mesmerizing, a dreamlike quality, suggesting that Bess (Watson) is not to stable to begin with...the "baby" of the village that has finally resigned herself to marry. Though Watson is brilliant (and garnered all the reviews) Stellan Skaarsgard in his somewhat supporting role matches her every step of the way. Her waif-like innocence belies the eagerness to which she gives herself so entirely without resrevation on her wedding night. She's so naive as to believe her husband's drug-induced suggestions to find omeone else for sex (after his paralyzing accident). Anyway, I've read most ofthe reviews, here, and so have you. What intrigues me is the completeness of Watson's performance. With the exception of Geraldine Page in "Summer and Smoke" (1961), I cannot think of a finer female performance captured on film, for future generations to look at and say "Hey! This is what it's all about".
