 This film is unique in that it relies almost entirely on the audience's imagination. Robert Wise's THE HAUNTING (1963) was quite similar, and far superior, as were the two "English" haunted house movies that come to mind ("The Innocents", "The Uninvited"). From a 2001 perspective, I'm so completely impressed that elements of my 3 favorite haunted-house films have resurfaced so intelligently today without resorting to smarmy fake CGI effects. Most of the credit must go to Alejandro Amenabar, director and visionary (he also "wrote" the score...with the help of a computer...to eerie and substantial effect). Amenabar controlled the slow descent into abject terror so perfectly that I was totally taken in. Other reviewers suggested that the ending was obvious..sorry, I kept my mind a little more open to the flow of events. Nicole Kidman was justly given kudos for this performance, and I was very impressed with Fionnula Flannigan as the housekeeper. But the real treats here are the performances of two absolutely superb kid actors, Alakina Mann & James Bentley. Nothing annoys me more than bad kid actors; these two were brilliant: natural and genuinely convincing...a rarity! The 2-disc DVD has a great transfer of the film; the 2nd disc has some extra "stuff", though not enough to warrant an extra disc. One interesting "extra" is an explanation of XP (Xeroderma Pigmentosum), which I found interesting because I'm a fan of Dean Koontz, and one of his best heroes suffered from this ("Fear Nothing" and its sequel "Seize the Night"). There's also a fine background regarding Amenabar and his methods in directing the film. I'm not going to explain those previous comments, because I don't want to blab-away any plot-points. I really enjoy a good ghost story, and this IS a very good one. Check it out!
