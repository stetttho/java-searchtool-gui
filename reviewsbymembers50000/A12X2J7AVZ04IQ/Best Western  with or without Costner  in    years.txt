 This is such a great film, and I waited way too long to watch it again. Once again, director Lawrence Kasdan assembled a large, talented cast (many from "The Big Chill") and he creates a world that totally absorbs the viewer. "Silverado" is an affectionate homage to the good-guys / bad-guys movies of yesteryear, except one's not really sure who's good & bad at the outset. This makes for fine film-making. A very literate script, beautiful cinematography & editing, and fine acting, along with Kasdan's loving direction make this a treat for all, regardless if you're a fan of westerns.  Bruce Broughton's score is memorable, and Kevin Kline & Scott Glenn are the best buddy-team since Butch & Sundance (wonderfully supported by co-buddies, Danny Glover & Costner). I could go on about background info, etc., but if you love an exciting film, good for the whole family (despite some violence), where good wins over evil (despite impossible odds), you should see this film.
