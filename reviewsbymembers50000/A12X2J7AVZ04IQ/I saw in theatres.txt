 The premise of this film is intriguing, and the script isn't that bad. It's a great action film. There's excitement. It's always great to see Edward G. Robinson. Unfortunately, I thought Chuck Heston was a little too old to be doing all that stuff (stunt doubles galore). My problem was with Richard Fleischer's direction. The goofy crowd scenes didn't make sense, especially when the tow-trucks came along. However, it was a fairly good adventure film, good vs evil and some redemption and renewal.
