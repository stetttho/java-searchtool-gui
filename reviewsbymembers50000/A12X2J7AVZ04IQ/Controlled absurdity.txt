 It's so silly, and brilliantly presented, you can't help but love it. The beautiful cast sells it well, especially Peter Palmer. Whatever happened to him? Much of the Broadway cast was here to bring life to this endearing Al Capp opus. Leslie Parrish is gorgeous; one of Stella Stevens' first roles; the singing is great and the very athletic dancing, on a smaller scale, is reminiscent of "7 Brides" (also choreographed by Michael Kidd). Stubby Kaye, as usual, is wonderful. The adapted Score was Oscar nominated. I was 10 years old when I first saw this in a theatre in 1959."The country's in the very best of hands". Government deception could never happen, huh? This play and film was made in the 50's, the "comfortable" Eisenhower years, and after Joe McCarthy's disgrace. Think about the thoughts at that time. How're we doin' now? This was one of the first films/plays to suggest government "ambivilence"...in a humorous way.
