 I really love this film. We have a most auspicious debut from Martha Plimpton (not used to good advantage since, except by Woody Allen in "Another Woman"). She is insightful; and overly smart, belying the idiot behavior of her father (Jones) years before that sent him to jail. It's refreshing to see a kid go after the affection of a parent, as opposed to the other idea that has inundated our airwaves. Martha Plimpton's natural curiousity is so genuine, not contrived, and purely of love. What a treat! The ensuing story is thrilling, with a particularly nasty performance by Brian Dennehy. The magnificent photography of the Mississippi River leaves strong marks in my memory; this film, written and directed by Tom Rickman, is to be applauded for its depth, integrity and solemn simplicity. Paramount doesn't seem to care about their films...if they did, this would be out on DVD with, I'm sure; insightful comments from Ms. Plimpton (whom I've grown to admire) and Mr. Jones, of whom commentary could be nothing less than entertaining. With all the other garbage out on DVD, this one should be there, not only for its worth, but for a widescreen view of the mighty Mississippi, I relate to this flm, on many levels.
