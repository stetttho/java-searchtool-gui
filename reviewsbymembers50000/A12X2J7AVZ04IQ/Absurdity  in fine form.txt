 First of all, this film is not for serious film purists, unless you enjoy the total absurdity of life at large. Yeah, it's a parody, but it's so much better than the many films it parodies (Scream, I Know What You Did...etc.). The Wayans always only want to have fun, and I respect comparisons to ZAZ and the Farrely's.  Aside from inspired casting (Ric Ducommun as the dad and Lochlyn Munro as the helpless cameraman), the others take this script (no doubt with loads of improv) to great levels. Anna Faris should win an award somewhere, if only because she played this whole idiot role with a straight face and ultimate conviction; she's a riot, a rare comedian who doesn't pretend to to be funny. A real natural! Regina Hall is particularly delightful when she's being intimate with Roy, but all he wants is to see her in his football outfit. The rapid-fire script adds to this when she's in the theatre and annoys everyone...my favorite was when the Pope jumps up and says "You ruined "Big Momma's House" (how many people caught that?). I don't know; it's so funny ALL the time, and repeated viewings make me find new stuff to laugh at. The good looking Dave Sheridan made himself look so goofy as Doofy, and I appreciated Andrea Nemeth's performance as Heather as a direct take-off of Reese Witherspoon in "ELECTION", a really fine film.  Cheri Oteri, the Wayans guys, Shannon Elizabeth...all a treat. Everything about this film is a treat, if you know how to kick back and mellow. If you don't know the films it's parodying, it will still make you laugh...unless you're so jaded that you've forgotten how...
