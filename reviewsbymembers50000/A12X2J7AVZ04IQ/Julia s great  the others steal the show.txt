 I've read some of the other reviews. All I can say is that this film was recommeded to me by a macho male friend. Though I am male, I relate to the perils that women faced thoughout most of history; the 50's were particulaly brutal for women, since anyone in position was scrutinized by McCarthyism. Wellesly College was no different. It's politics did not promote women, rather taught them how to be subservient. Some of my reviewing predecessors failed to realize how different things were then. There is absolutely NO comparison to "Dead Poets' Society", which was about ideas. "Mona Lisa Smile" is about integrity. Unfortunately, in both films, the protaganist left with his/her tail between the legs; Williams from defeat, Roberts from frustration. I'm a Julia Roberts fan, and think she's smart and interesting in almost any film she's made. She is bested here by Marcia Gay Harden, as well as the four young ladies who create her new world of involvement. The most famous 3 (Gyllenhaal, Stiles, Dunst) are fine, but Ginnifer Goodwin is a talent to be reckoned with. Harden, in particular, is so out of touch, and so sweet. Best performance in the film. I also liked Juliet Stevenson as the Lesbian (horrors!). A credit to her performance; she played the mother in "Bend It Like Beckham", who was appalled at the thought of gayness.The DVD is fine, with lots of extras. It must've been really awful to be a rich college girl in the 50's. A smart Lesbian couldn't work, and smart women were happy, relegated to idiot roles. This is a better film than most people think.
