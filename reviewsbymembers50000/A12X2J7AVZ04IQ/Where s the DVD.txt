 I'm sorry to say I did not read the book. I am familiar with the work of Carson McCullers, and her narratives are thoroughly character-driven. However, she does center her material on one character (as in "The Member of the Wedding"). In this case, it's an incredible man named John Singer, masterfully portrayed by the great Alan Arkin. Certainly, most books need to be "abbreviated" in their transfer to the screen. ("Tom Jones" comes to mind, a huge sprawling Henry Fielding novel, concisely brought to the screen). I have read ALL the previous reviews, and pitiably lament that I hadn't read Ms. McCuller's novel. Still, I feel that John Singer's integrity, loneliness and pain, not to mention his frustration, was so brilliantly conveyed by Arkin. Sondra Locke was nominated for an Oscar for this, critics comparing her to Julie Harris in "Member of the Wedding". It's an auspicious debut, but it is Cecily Tyson who deserved that nomination. Outstanding performances from Chuck McCann, Percy Rodriguez and Stacy Keach were wonderful and complete; having not read the book, I knew everything I needed to know about these characters, as a viewer. This simple film from 1968 could certainly benefit from a "re-telling" as a mini-series or HBO film. Perhaps, the lovers of the book would be sated (and maybe not). Until then, I'm happy to know that this story is captured on film, as well as Arkin's great performance. (Arkin lost the Oscar to Cliff Robertson in "Charly", another disabled character).I'm thinking Warner Brothers would do themselves proud to issue a DVD, since Arkin's still around, as well as Locke, Tyson and a few others. I'm also sorry to say that I'm not familiar with the work of director Robert Ellis Miller, but he's made a film that touched me profoundly, with every imaginable portrayal of prejudice and mistrust, all portrayed by "good, righteous" people. I admire this film very much. Please, Warner Brothers...where's the DVD?
