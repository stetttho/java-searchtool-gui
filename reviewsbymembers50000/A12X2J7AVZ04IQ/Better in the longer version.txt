 I have to admit that, when I first saw this film, I was bored. I was even more disappointed when it won every Oscar. Unfortunately, this film was not presented as Bertolucci intended. The DVD fills in the holes, and is actually a valid history lesson. It's worth your attention.  I still don't understand it's Oscar for Editing; the "fight" scene in "Fatal Attraction" is still used in film schools as a masterpiece of editing, and it should've won, at least in that category. I have a new respect for the film, and, as epics go, it's among the best. Bertolucci is best known for close-ups and intimacy; he was certainly in touch with his material. The extended version is the one to see, but be sure you have a lot of time, with no distractions. You'll find it quite compelling. I do have some problems with other Oscars it won: Best Sound (do you remember the thunderstorm in "The Witches of Eastwick"?); Best Cinematography (remember the vast panoramas in "Empire of the Sun"?); Best Music (Morricone's intense score in "The Untouchables"). The Academy seems to give all awards to one film that impresses them; the old farts don't seem to consider their options. It deserved the Best Picture Oscar for it's artistic integrity, though "Moonstruck" was far more entertaining. Decide for yourself.
