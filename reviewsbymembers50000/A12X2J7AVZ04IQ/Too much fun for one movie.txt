 Tarantino, admittedly, loves movies. It shows. As much as his films may be an "homage" to other films, he can take this and run with it, creating the most wonderful and original scenarios. I don't believe he's ever made a bad film, though everyone isn't ready for his quirky approach. "Kill Bill, Vol. I" is loaded with inspired tributes to loads of "genre-cinema". Tributes to Sergio Leone, Brian de Palma, Anime and Kung-Fu films are obvious. Casting David Carradine was truly inspired. Also his use of color and editing are brilliant. The '70's references are fun and his culture-clash references are great. Uma Thurman is truly amazing, in a controlled, multi-layered performance that leaves the viewer breathless. Her energy is to be applauded. Can't wait to see "Vol. II".
