 There are lots of reasons to love this film. The stellar cast, including Wm. Demarest, Jane Darwell, Phil Silvers, a young Jackie Gleason, Frank McHugh, Conrad Veidt, Peter Lorre, Judith Anderson...well, it doesn't get much better. Consider the 1942 release...the war was at it's peak. Then there's Bogie, playing a likeable gangster who makes good with rival gangsters to beat up a Nazi infiltration in NYC. Add tons of humor and the beautiful Kaaren Verne, and you have a delightful mix of suspense, angst, intrigue and American triumph (as well as a cute love story). It may not be a great film, but I think it's my favorite Bogie film, if only because it's so much fun to watch. Where's the DVD?
