 I read Dean Koontz' novelization of the film. I'm a huge fan of Koontz. He prefaces the book with the info that this film was totally changed and (almost) unrecognizable. But I noticed a few moments from the book...and Koontz was given absolutely no credit. The film is not great; rather, a formulaic  horror film, suggesting scary stuff even though it's predictable. There are some good things about the film, as presented in this DVD 2.35:1 letterbox. The photography is very fine, and the use of color is vivid and crisp. Hooper's copying of certain shock-elements from "Texas Chainsaw" are evident, but he apparently learned something quickly, because the following year he made the brilliant "Poltergeist", legitimizing him. Koontz had said that the studio made this film totally contrary to his intention; preventing Hooper from presenting his idea, since it's been proven that he's quite a smart guy. I bought it because of the price, and my curiosity about the Koontz idea. It's a formula teen slasher film, with some genuine scares. The great Sylvia Miles appears, too briefly, with a bad middle European accent (she's always been a "gypsy" in choosing her characters, and the Academy nominated her twice for her bold choices). Rick Baker, the great make-up artist, offered a silly display of the deformed nemesis. Not up to his standards. This film can be written off, but there are talents involved, including Koontz, and it shouldn't be discarded too quickly.
