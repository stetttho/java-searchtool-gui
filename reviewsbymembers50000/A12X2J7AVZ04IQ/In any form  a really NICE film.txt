 I have read the other reviews, and, YES it is disappointing that this "Import" DVD is from Hong Kong (with Chinese subtitles) and YES it is disturbing that there are absolutely NO extras, even "chapter selection". The very British, very urban language is often hard to understand. That said, this is one of the nicest, sweet-natured films I've seen in years. Though the coming-out gay theme is the centerpiece of this film, there are so many other life-styles being portrayed that are all somehow a part of that central theme. It's very clear that the basic idea is "Live and let live"...a mother's love is unconditional; misunderstood people (Leah) are often loud and brash and cruel, looking for attention; love can be anywhere, waiting to happen, even in the working-class urban jungle. I would've liked English subtitles to understand some of the wonderful but stylized dialogue. I liked the 1.85:1 LBX, and, I must admit, subtitles have never bothered me...though a previous reviewer mentioned that they are larger than life, which is correct. Mama Cass' music is SO appropriate, especially the scene of Jamie and Ste running thru the park to Cass' "Make Your Own Kind of Music". There is a beautiful story, sexual tension (somewhat non-explicit), humor and a bit of social justice in the end. It also, without trying, gives homophobia a black eye. A truly fine film.
