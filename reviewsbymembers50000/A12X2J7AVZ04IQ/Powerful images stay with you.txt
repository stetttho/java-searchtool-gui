 I'm not going to rehash the plot. It took me a few days to contemplate the remarkable film, and I can only say the it's the biggest feather in Ang Lee's hat. Mr. Lee's sensitivity never ceases to amaze me, from the hysterically funny "The Wedding Banquet" (another gay-themed film), or "Sense & Sensibility" (Jane Austen as imagined by an Asian? Who would've thought...?), "The Ice Storm" (dysfunctional families abound, with great sensitivity), and, of course, "Couching Tiger..." Ang Lee's mastering of such diverse subjects, with amazing skill, must certainy rank him at the very top of our living directors. "Brokeback Mountain" is rife with style & focus. The beauty of the scenery is in direct contrast with the initial conflict. The gentlemen go off to their mundane destinies, which can, in no way, match the beauty of the environment of the mountain. I can't get certain images out of my head. Heath Ledger is absolutely amazing; I challenge anyone, male or female, straight or gay, not to shed a tear when, at the end, he finds the shirt in Jack's closet and holds it close. I'm glad that Mr. Ledger had this opportunity to legitimize the acting prowess that was so well presented in "The Patriot". All of the acting is, without exception, letter perfect. I still think that Jake Gyllenhaal had the toughest role, and his affection for Ennis was never in doubt. I especially liked the scene where he stood up to his big-shot father-in-law. His range of emotion was far more vast than what was expected from Ennis' character. The beautifully written script hit all the right nerves. This is NOT a gay movie; it's a film that presents an element of life, anyone's life, that under the right circumstances, could affect each and every one of us. A very sad, frustrating, brilliant film; I hope it wins many Oscars, especially Picture, Lee & Gyllenhaal. Love this film!
