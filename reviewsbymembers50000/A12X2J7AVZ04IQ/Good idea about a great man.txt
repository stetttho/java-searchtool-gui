 I just watched the DVD film, and it was interesting. It took a while to understand Jonathan Pryce's importance in the film, and I won't blab away any plotpoints. This is a film told in retrospect, and is actually quite touching. Kevin Kline hits all the right points, but it's Ashley Judd who really hits all the right nerves. A great performance. Because of the back-and-forth time transition, it's hard to criticize that "True Love" was nominated for an Oscar in 1957 as Best Original Song. A lot of stuff wasn't really coherent, time-wise. Still, it's always nice to hear Cole Porter music, and the film was fairly honest to Cole's life. Except for the music, and Ashley Judd's performance, the film is actually quite average. From a musical standpoint, "Begin the Beguine", perhaps Porter's greatest song, was done here in a minor key, and "Be a Clown" was never heard until 1952 when Donald O'Connor did it so well in "Singin' in the Rain". Kevin Kline is very much in touch with his character, but watch Ms. Judd and applaud.
