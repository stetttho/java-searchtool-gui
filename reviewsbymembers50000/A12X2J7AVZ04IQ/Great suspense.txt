 I'm happy to have this DVD in my collection. Director Robert Siodmak was a pioneer in "noir", but this was a straight-forward suspense story, one of my favorites. It was the film debut of Rhonda Fleming, and she was quite good. Elsa Lanchester was again cute, and Ethel Barrymore received an Oscar nomination for her performance. A year later, Dorothy McGuire would receive her only Oscar nomination for "Gentleman's Agreement".  McGuire, indeed, covers this complex role completely, without speaking a word. I was most impressed. The film is one of my favorite suspense fims of the 40's. I'm not sure why anyone can't enjoy the chills.
