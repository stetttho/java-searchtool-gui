 I can say nothing about the merits of this film, as well as its landmark place in SciFi film history, that hasn't been said before. To buy this film at its going rate would involve hocking my first-born and mortgaging my life. With all the pure garbage that's available on DVD, I really want to know what's holding up the general release of this great classic. I don't get it. It's such a worthy film.
