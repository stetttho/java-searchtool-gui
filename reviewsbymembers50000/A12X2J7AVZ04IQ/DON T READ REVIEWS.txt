 I never saw this in a theatre, but I bought the DVD right away because I enjoy this type of film. Well, I was more than entertained! The Special Effects are outstanding, sets and atmosphere are solid. Perhaps this is better seen at home...I don't know. I DO know that I was very entertained. Those who analyze stuff will not like it. To me, this was a composite of all the dumb stuff I enjoy watching to escape the drudgeries, etc. I'm glad to have this in my collection. It's so silly, and so much fun!
