 I avoided this film for so long until a friend loaned it to me. I watched it last nite and I was quite impressed. To compare this to "Se7en" is absurd; there's little or no comparison. Director James Wan's youthful zeal and excitement is beautifully executed, but nothing can compare to David Fincher's meticulous style.I was expecting another stupid slasher flick, and was pleasantly surprised to be presented with quite an original narrative that had me fascinated. I did NOT guess the ending, though I tried, because it was so well written and edited. The acting wasn't very good, though not totally unbelievable. After all, hysterical is an emotion that's hard to sustain for 98 minutes if you're an actor. James Wan's focus may not have been as precise as he'd wished, but I look forward to his next project. The extras on the DVD are minimal, but Mr. Wan's enthusiasm on a short extra impressed me. I enjoyed it and was entertained a lot.
