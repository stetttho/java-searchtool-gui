 I like this film, and I like Jim Carrey. I like energetic performances, especially when coupled with a clever idea. A lot of people don't like Jim Carrey. Maybe they just don't understand. He was manic, crazy and totally in touch with the parody/satire in "Ace Ventura". In "The Mask", he creates a character that is totally his own. Certainly, there are silly moments, but there are also soft and sweet moments, as well as clever crazy moments. The effects are great, and Carrey must've had a great time incorporating them into his performance, a driven performance with center and conviction. There's a great performace by the dog who played Milo. This is a good dog. Often animals are used in film to be cute; Milo transcended this stereotype. One of the finest features of "The Mask", is the debut of Cameron Diaz, here playing a gorgeous vamp (to perfection). Ms. Diaz has subsequently been given a bad rap; I'm particularly referring to her performance in "Being John Malkovich", in which she was definitely not gorgeous, but consumed the role she played. Another example of the Hollywood heirarchy not taking gorgeous women for their innate talent. I admire Cameron Diaz as an actress, and watching this again confirms this. Unfortunately, I got this DVD when I bought my player, and it has subtitles that I can't get rid of. I have no problem with subtitles for foreign films. Don't be misled. Enjoy, kick back and let the fantasy take you away! It's SO much fun! I also think Carrey was brilliant in "The Truman Show", but, I guess, if you like films like "The Mask", your opinion doesn't count. I loved it!
