 I saw this when it first came out. I was 18. It was so corny and unbelievable; a terrific Black man with the daughter of an affluent couple...reality check! Then I was appalled when Hepburn won over Dunaway, Bancroft, etc. Then Rose's screenplay won over "Bonnie & Clyde". That idiot Academy!! Well, things have changed, and this film has definitely survived the test of time. There's really no question that Hepburn won because of her devotion to Tracy (in his last role). She certainly didn't reach the depth of Dunaway or Bancroft, or the Great Dame Edith Evans (who should've won for "The Whisperers"). I thought the screenplay of William Rose was a bit gratuitous, but, as I said, that was then. Inter-racial marriage is prevalent in all levels of society today.         I've always admired Stanley Kramer, and "It's a Mad (4) World" was his only discernable light-hearted film. He missed on a few marks here, though; he allowed some unforgiveable mugging from Tracy, as well as some banal banter between Tracy & Cecil Kellaway. Isabel Sanford stole the show with over-the-top wisecracks, but it was Beah Richards who was nominated as Poitier's mother. That year, she also played the disreputable Mama Kaleba in "In the Heat of the Night, and the opposing characters that she delivered were both impressive. Poitier was confident and sure, typically fine; Katharine Houghton (Hepburn's niece) was overly affected to the point of distraction. I think Rose's screenplay isn't the problem, but Kramer's direction, to allow the editing of Robert C. Jones to include cuteness between the baffled leads. (Jones was nominated, so was Kramer: whose fault?) After a few years I'm looking at this film again; there are three GREAT scenes...First, when Hepburn tells her store manager (Virginia Christine) to get lost; next when Beah Richards talks to Hepburn and then to Tracy, telling him he's a dried up shell of a man, like her husband; then Tracy's final, wonderful speech before they have dinner. These moments are worth your time and effort, especially Richards' two scenes. The bottom line is that it's a beautifully constructed film, with a somewhat unbelievable premise. All together it's enjoyable, and knowing the elements behind this production make it better. There's no question that Hepburn is great, but this is an Oscar that was given for reasons other than greatness of acting. Bancroft should've won this year; Hepburn should've won in 1962 when Bancroft won (for "Long Day's Journey Into Night". Hepburn as a drug-addict? Wow!) I still watch this film and watch it repeatedly; it's hard to describe this film because it's so admittedly corny, but the GREAT moments really slap you in the face. Judge for yourself, and don't hold my opinions against me.
