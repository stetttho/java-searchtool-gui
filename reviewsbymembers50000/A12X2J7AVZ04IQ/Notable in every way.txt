 I don't know what to say about "The Journey of Natty Gann" that hasn't already been said. This is a riveting film that never ceases to entertain. The outstanding and auspicious debut of Meredith Salenger belies her later career, most recently seen in the campy horror flick "Lake Placid" in a small role. This is also one of John Cusack's first roles, and he's perfect, as is Ray Wise as Natty's father. The Oscar nominated costumes are period-perfect, as are the sets, convincingly portraying Depression era America. A Widescreen version is sorely missing from the recently released DVD; a lot of period detail was lost. Let's hope someone comes along to correct this gross over-sight. The magnificent vistas of the Pacific northwest, captured by photographer Dick Bush, would also be enhanced by a Widescreen format. The music of James Horner is symphonic at times (reminiscent of the best of Aaron Copland), as it also incoporates folk music and grand,sweeping passages to compliment the adventure that is taking place. The director, Jeremy Kagan, brilliantly kept a flow and consistant feeling of excitement (he won the Golden Prize at the Moscow Film Festival). Episodic as some might think, each episode is woven into the next with care and a fine feel for the narrative at large...a fine example of great editing. This is, quite simply, and all-around excellent film. Tears are bound to flow, but they won't be manipulated; there's genuine pathos in the final development of events, and not sappy, either. As I said, except for the Pan & Scan treatment, the DVD is well presented, though there are no extras. It's OK, though, because the price is more than reasonable. SEE THIS FILM! And show it to the whole family.
