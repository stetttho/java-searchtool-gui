 The recent atrocity by spineless cowards in NY found me in dire need of a comedy. I've always been a movie freak, and knew that "Chocolat" was up for Oscars...yet, reviews kept me from seeing it or renting it (I'm so ahshamed to admit it!) Well, the reviews were wrong."Traffic" was moving & profound, and OH! so heavy. "Gladiator" was very good, but over-rated...my favorite of the Best Picture nominees this year was "Erin Brockovich" because it had humor as well as a riveting performance by Julia about an important issue. The luminescent Juliette Binoche has never given a bad performance (absolutely deserved her Oscar for "English Patient"). "Chocolat" is timely, now more than ever.Like a faiy tale, it's a tale about good & "evil", but only certain people's idea of evil. Fundamentalist behavior? So appropriate. Johnny Depp is always great, and Dame Dench & Lena Olin and Alfred Molina were so in touch.This is not a trivial film, as some Academy critics have said. I enjoyed it immensely and recommend this to people who love to laugh at intolerance. This is not a film about decadent indulgence (well, not entirely). It's a thoughtful display of a fairy tale world where good triumphs over evil. RENT or BUY THIS FILM!
