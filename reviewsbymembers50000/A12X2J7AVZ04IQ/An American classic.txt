 I don't know what to say that hasn't been said before, but this is one of the most well-made films of 1969. Period detail is well-presented, acting is excellent, wonderful Panavision widescreen makes this DVD a treasure. William Faulkner wasn't known for his lightness of heart, but this precious memoir shows love, spirit and excitement that sets this film aside. I won't blab away the plot, but Steve McQueen, at the height of his career, is having a ball in a fine performance. Sharon Farrell is so lovely; where did her career go? Mitch Vogel, as young Lucius, gives one of the best kid performances ever; I hate bad kid-actors. Where did his career go? And the most auspicious debut performance came from Oscar-nominated Rupert Crosse, knowing everything, wanting to be included, causing the most trouble, and, ultimately, saving the day. Best in the film! And where did his career go? There's also the great Juano Hernandez, and a really great performance by a horse. And it's always good to see Ruth White, the most reliable character actress since Jane Darwell. Non-obtrusive narration by Burgess Meredith is a plus. The odds seem insurmountable, but they all emerge victorious and young Lucius has life-affirming experiences; shocking, painful and ultimately exciting. And memorable. This film is nothing but fun, and I enjoy it a lot. 1969 brought about some magnificent films: Midnight Cowboy, Anne of the Thousand Days, They Shoot Horses Don't They, Butch Cassidy...and The Reivers is right up there with the best of 'em.
