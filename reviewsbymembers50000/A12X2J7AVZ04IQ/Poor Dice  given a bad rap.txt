 I remember the early days of Don Rickles, the master of insult humor. His career was saved when his Las Vegas crowd rallied to let the public know that he was really a nice guy. Unfortunately, the Dice-Man didn't have that support, and his 80's update of Rickles-type humor was blown out of proportion by a misguided, politically-correct public that wouldn't know a funny joke if it was strapped to their privates. Dice IS funny, and he IS a nice guy. His humor is probably a "GUY" thing, but he talks no differently than anyone I've known who lived in a college dorm. Okay. Enough about the misunderstood Dice. "The Adventures of Ford Fairlane", an early effort from Renny Harlin, is always funny and always entertaining. The screenplay is clever, a direct parody of dumb detective films, with many original ideas, tailor-made to the many talents of Andrew Dice Clay. Dice is quite charming, always self-effacing and having a great time. The assembled cast is great, with Gilbert Gottfried in a natural role, a fine nasty performance from Wayne Newton, as well as Robert Englund (in a non-Freddy role, but still nasty). Lauren Holly is a stabilizing factor, and Priscilla Presley (remember the "Naked Gun" films?) is as straight as ever. Really enjoyable is Maddie Corman (the little sister from "Some Kind of Wonderful") as Zuzu Petals (I've not been able to watch "It's a Wonderful Life" without thinking of Maddie...) Ed O'Neill's rendition of "Booty Time" may stick with you.Andrew Dice Clay's humor may not appeal to all, but this is a fun film and the Dice-Man is quite endearing. Don't judge...ENJOY!
