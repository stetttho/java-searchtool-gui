 Despite the merit of those films that won all the 2000 Oscars, this film deserved more. Soderbergh's film was my favorite that year. It was totally entertaining, gripping, and handled the serious subject with humor and a straight-forward drive. There is never a dull moment. (I don't understand why "Traffic" won the Oscar for its choppy, coarse editing, while this wasn't even nominated). I've also never understood the standards involved in the Best Sound category, but every subtle whisper & utterance of Susannah Grant's brilliant screenplay was clear, crisp and understood; also not nominated for Best Sound.  What the Oscars got totally right was Julia's performance. This was an example of total control and commitment. I haven't been so impressed in many years. I was also very impressed with the kid performances of Scotty Leavenworth & Gemmenne de la Pena as Erin's kids. They were real and natural. I can't tolerate bad kid actors. I was impressed with the performances of Marg Helgenberger and Cherry Jones, and Jamie Harrold (as Scott) was perfectly dorky, a real treat. Then there was the great Albert Finney who seemed to be the centering force in the whole spiel. He was customarily excellent. This is, quite simply, an excellent film, and deserved a lot more credit than Julia's flawless performance. I find, lately, that this is the film I play when looking for a real "feel good" movie.
