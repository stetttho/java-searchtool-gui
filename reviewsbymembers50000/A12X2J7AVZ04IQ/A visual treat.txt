 This is a film of exquisite beauty, for eye, ear, mind and heart. The plot is simple, but some of the insights are mind-blowing! Quite profound! The use of color has rarely been so magnificent, and it all is SO important to understanding where sweet Amelie is coming from. Lovely fantasy stuff, mixed with the real world. I avoided seeing this film, but I borrowed the 2-disc version from the library, and was thoroughly entertained. Audrey Tautou reminds me of a young Audrey Hepburn, as well as Julia Roberts...without trying to imitate them. She's endearing. All of the supporting roles were done with conviction and strength, especially Mathieu Kassowitz, as the object of her obsession. Jean-Pierre Jeunet, like some of our other GREAT directors (Scott, Cameron, Fincher) got his big break directing an "Alien" film. The second disc tells that he was so upset with the Hollywood process and lack of artistic control, that he's gone somewhat independent since then. He's given us wonderful stuff like "Delcatessen". It's a sweet story, but if you're into visual art, be sure to see this film. Also, the music of Vann Tiersen will draw you more and more into this fantasy. It's wonderful!The 2.35:1 Letterbox shows off gorgeous sets and cinematography. "Amelie" is definitely worth a look.
