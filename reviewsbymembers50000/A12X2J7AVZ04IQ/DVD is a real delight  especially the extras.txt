 I really enjoyed this film. Critics all went nuts over it, and I finally watched it. It took a moment to warm up to it, because it started out a bit like "PeeWee's Big Adventure". Well, we have a relatively harmless guy whose advice from friends gets blown out of proportion because they're trying to "help". It ends up happy & sweet, but not before all kinds of crazy stuff happens. The film is hysterical, and quite original in its delivery. I won't say anything else about the film that isn't assumed from it's title, but the DVD has extras that will keep any staid person in hysterics, especially the "How do I know you're gay" segment. How Seth Rogan & Paul Rudd kept a straight face during that is amazing. It's such a parody on macho-male one-upmanship, and totally silly.  Excellent direction from Judd Apatow keeps everything in order, as the improvisational skills of Steve Carrell & cronies create a most pleasant and entertaining film. Catherine Keener is excellent, as is everyone, and I was especially entertained with Jane Lynch's second-nature  consideration regarding sex and job performance. Very fun and highly recommended.
