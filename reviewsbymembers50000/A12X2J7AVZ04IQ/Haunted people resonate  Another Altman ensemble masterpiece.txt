 This is what the great Altman does best...throw dozens of people with unrelated issues, and discover how each individual touches the others' lives.The screenplay is amazing when you consider that there are so many circumstances and not one is more important than another because the film gels brilliantly as a whole. Altman's solid understanding is prevalent throughout. The acting, without exception, is first rate. It would be impossible to single out any one performance; however, Annie Ross' bluesy song stylizing was memorable, as well as Peter Gallagher's gleeful revenge against ex-wife McDormand. Jack Lemmon's "cameo" role was the apex of despair. These people are all haunted, in one way or another, as the stories develop: infidelity, neglect, death, misunderstandings, a sick child, negligent parents... and on and on. Altman handles each individual's reaction with generous layers of humor, pathos, discovery and total sincerity."Short Cuts" was at the top of every critic's Top 10, but it somewhat lost out at awards time. The Golden Globes honored it with a special "Best Ensemble" award, as well as a nomination for screenplay. The Oscars nominated Altman as Best Director, but it was the film's only nomination. I was surprised that one of Annie Ross' original songs wasn't nominated, or the absolutely brilliant editing of Geraldine Peroni, which kept this film riveting at all times. Not a slow moment, even at 3 hours. I recommend this film to anyone who appreciates film-craft and the wonders it can create. I'm amazed at this great new Criterion collection DVD presentation. I'm happy to own it.
