 "The World According to Garp" is a milestone film in many ways. It is Robin Williams first starring role, as well as making stars out of Glenn Close and John Lithgow. As whimsical as most of Williams' characters to this point, he nonetheless plays it reasonably straight suggesting future brilliant performances ("Dead Poets Society", "The Fisher King", etc.). The acting, in general, is superb with great bits from the likes of Amanda Plummer and Swoozie Kurtz. The bittersweet tale (from John Irving's novel) involves life seen through the eyes of a collection of free-spirited individuals, most notably Jenny Fields (Close) and her son Garp (Williams). It's a fascinating narrative, and would make no sense to try to explain the plot. In any form--VHS, DVD, edited for content--it's worth seeing. The opening titles are, indeed, a joy to behold. My problem with the just-released DVD is that, though the film is rated R, it has been slightly edited to about a PG. Some of the most brilliant lines have been cut, or clouded over. Disappointing as this may be, it's still a brilliant film, an achievement worthy of the term "classic" (definitely "cult-classic"). Also, though filmed in Panavision, the "widescreen" transfer is only 1.85:1. Director Geore Roy Hill had lots of business going on that was virtually lost, or rendered unimportant. Regardless, don't miss this film. It's a real treat.
