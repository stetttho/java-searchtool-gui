 I LOVE this film. My favorite comedy of all time. Deserved every award, and a lot more. I'm pleased to own this DVD because it's the best version available. Unfortunately, it's only a 1.66:1 Letterbox though it was filmed in Panavision. The late Billy Wilder never missed a trick, and I'll bet there was lots of stuff going on in the perifery...I saw this as a kid, and I know you couldn't blink for a minute...this film wasn't nominated for Best Picture ("Ben-Hur" won, overblown epic with one great scene). Jack Lemmon lost the Oscar to Charlton Heston. How humiliating could that be! D'ya think a real 2.35:1 Panavision version will ever happen? There's no question that this is the best. It was fun and refreshing to see Lemmon & Curtis reunited in '65 in "The Great Race", finally out on DVD. Lemmon makes this work, with subtle assistance from the great Joe E. Brown.)
