 I didn't listen to anyone, except I heard it had crappy reviews. Sorry, but I was totally taken in by M. Night's most recent addition to his respectable filmography. Let's just say that I can say no more than has already be said by "Spotlight Reviewers" Lawrence M. Barnabo and Brittany Hinson. Ron Howard's daughter, Bryce Dallas Howard, is definitely a force to be reckoned with; she is so natural and lovely, there is no question that her career in on the move. Also, William Hurt showed more passion than I've seen from him since "Children of a Lesser God". Hey! He can still act. This was a good performance. Adrian Brody was fine; he probably finished this just before he won his Oscar. And...I've loved Sigourney Weaver in almost everything she's done, and she didn't let me down. Mr. Shyamalan still has it. Don't write him off too soon.
