 I don't know where to begin. This film has everything that I like about BAD films...bad dialogue, really bad acting. It's obviously a cheaply made film. I own the VHS (which is out of print) and now I have the DVD which is of somewhat lesser quality, but the film's substance is so tacky that, no matter what version you get, it'll entertain. My DVD version is from Beverly Wilshire Filmworks/Telefilms Int'l, via Saturn Productions (Dolby Digital!). (...) It's a worthy film for many reasons. Though there's no cast listing, I'm assuming it's Katherine Victor, as the evil scientist who lures the kids to their potential doom, who has to be one of my favorite characters ever. She resembles Anjelica Huston as Morticia Addams, except Anjelica was only 8 yrs old, and the TV series wouldn't be around for 7 more years. Though it's a b&w film, this woman wears fancy evening gowns at all times of the day and speaks in a manner that suggests "acting", a real riot and one of my favorite characters of all time. This woman will be responsible for taking over the world for some idiot organization that will cover the world with some powder that will make everyone mindless idiots (like the writers...) The teenagers are all typical 50's fun-seekers, and save the day. The police station looks like a drive-thru window, and my favorite moment is at the very end, when the kids drive off, victorious, throwing their arms in the air for no apparent reason than to suggest good clean fun. Like I said, I don't know why I like this film so much. It's so bad, and I'm so very much amused. Perhaps it's bacause no matter how bad things may seem in the world or in your life, this film was made to make you realize that things CAN be worse.
