 The brilliant John Osbourne took Henry Fielding's massive novel, and, with director Tony Richardson, developed  a totally coherent, riotous film, rife with period detail and sparkled with double-entendre. I can't say much about the film, except to say it's among my favorite films of all time. The acting from all involved is impeccable. Indeed, Albert Finney became a world-class contender after this film. Religious groups were outraged (most probably didn't even see it), though there was lots of suggested sex scenes, amounting to some non-graphic tumbling under the sheets, and a dinner scene that has been parodied subsequently many times. The fast pace and thoroughly enjoyable episodic narrative never fail to entertain, and one is left breathless by the time it's over. Oscar winner for Picture, Director, Screenplay and John Addison's perfect baroque score, nominated for 5 acting awards, as well as Art Direction. Of the film versions of the great classics, this definitely must stand proudly at the top of the hill!
