 Two of the cheesier films from AIP vaults are presented well on a really good DVD transfer. Herbert L. Strock directed both, and "Blood of Dracula" is really the better one. A girl vampire? What fun! Jerry Blaine singing "Puppy Love", and some crazy Lesbian overtones make this loads of fun. If it was released today, politically-correct idiots would be protesting. "How to Make a Monster" is also tacky, a sort of toned-up version of Ed Wood, but not as entertaining as Wood's films. If Ed Wood had studio backing, he might've had a chance. Mr. Strock had that support. Ed Wood was around at the wrong time; the drive-in crowd came only a bit later, and Nicholson & Arkoff cashed in. I absolutely love this stuff for its tackiness, bad acting, bad attempts at musical interludes... I was around for that drive-in crowd back when, and words can't express how fun it was. Even if the films were garbage, we were entertained, and, despite what critics say, I believe entertainment is what it's all about. I was entertained, and never forgot how much I enjoyed these tacky films.
