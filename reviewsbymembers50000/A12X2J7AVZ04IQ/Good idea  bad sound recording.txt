 I'm sure this film was scary. It was well acted and well presented. My problem was that I couldn't understand a lot of the dialogue that moved the plot along. The sound recording was weak, and doesn't come across on this dvd. It's always good to see the great Giancarlo Giannini, but his major scene was a little too contrived. Anna Paquin is fine, as is Lena Olin and Iain Glen. I don't know the name of the young son, but he was great. I hate bad kid actors; he was very fine. Also, Paquin's boyfriend gave the best performance of all. (The credits were so small on my screen I don't know the names.)The plot was simple, and I really wasn't that moved. I LOVE a good ghost story. This one was only so-so.
