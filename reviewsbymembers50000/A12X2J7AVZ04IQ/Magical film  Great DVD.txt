 Only Robert Redford's 2nd directorial effort, this film is purely from the heart. This is a true ensemble piece, worthy of Altman, and Redford's love of the land is quite appropriate. I was most impressed with the fact that this film is about  Mexican/Native American types, and found no need for sex, drugs, blood or real violence (that stuff seems to prevail when regarding cultural differences). How refreshing. Foremost is the fact that this has a whimsical element of fantasy, and a quasi David/Goliath subtext. I was especially amused when the old man was playing chess with the Angel (a bit of Bergman, perhaps?). Aside from the gorgeous vistas of New Mexico, beautifully photographed, it is Dave Grusin's Oscar-winning score that is most intriguing (it's ONLY Oscar nomination). The lovely guitar of Angel Romero is prevalent throughout, adding to Grusin's 5/8 time with endless modulations, suggesting that this is a land that will go on forever. The acting is wonderful, without exception. The previous reviewers have all failed to mention how strong Chick Vennera was in the lead role. So very handsome, and so un-self-conscious. A wonderful performance. If there would be a second lead, it would have to be Carlos Riquelme as the old geezer that everyone thinks is nuts, but actually talks to Angels. Sonia Braga, John Heard, Daniel Stern, Nancy Mandragon, and especially, James Gammon, were all solid. I love this film a lot, because it really makes me feel good. And that music...it stays with you. Quite haunting. I recommend this film for families; no matter how poor you might be, financially, standing up for yourself and your integrity can make you rich beyond your wildest dreams.
