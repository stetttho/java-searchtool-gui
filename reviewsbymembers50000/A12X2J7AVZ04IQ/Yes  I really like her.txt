 Sally only got 2 Oscar noms, and won both. This seems to be the stock of lots of jokes. Fact is, with great writing, Ms. Field will knock your socks off, as she does here. I won't bother to rehash the plot, cuz you already know it, and it's phenomenal. Aside from the absolute attention to period detail, the acting is, without exception, superb. A previous reviewer noted that the cinematography of Nestor Almendros was sorely missing an Oscar nomination, and this is most correct. There were three films in 1984 about "saving the farm" ("Country", "The River" and this); though "Country" was released earlier and got better reviews, this one came along and blew 'em all out of the water. This was Benton's autobiographical account of life during hard times, and it couldn't be more lovingly presented. Then, again, there's the acting: Lindsay Crouse, Danny Glover, John Malkovich, Terry O'Quinn, Amy Irving, Ed Harris, and two absolutely wonderful kid-actors, Yankton Hatton & Gennie James. Howard Shore composed a score, not that original, with great help from the music icons of the period. It was very effective. The bottom line is that this is a very fine film, and mostly carried by the unwavering and confident performance of Sally Field. I like her. I really do.
