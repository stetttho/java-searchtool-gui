 Isn't it interesting that this amazing ensemble film is up for all those Oscars? Director Paul Haggis did a beautiful job of putting together all these lines of plot into a cohesive whole. I especially liked Thandie Newton, but Matt Dillon & Terence Howard were also strong. I find it interesting, because Robert Altman is receiving a special Oscar this year. Isn't this what Altman created; the ensemble film, multiple plots all coming together? If you loved "Crash" (as I did), check out Altman's "Short Cuts". There's nothing like it.
