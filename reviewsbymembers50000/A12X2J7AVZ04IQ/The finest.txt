 There's very little to be said about this incredible film that hasn't been said before. When I was 14 I went, alone, to see this film. Afterward, I was speechless. I immediately decided it was my favorite film of all time, and, 40 years later, it still is. Horton Foote's brilliant screenplay accomplished a feat that is almost unparallelled: it reduced a complex, character-driven series of events into a 2 hour coherent classic narrative. Its profound effect on me has been a bit of a character builder for me; I'm a better person, I think, for having seen this film at a young age. I encourage all people with children in their life to show this to them. Kids often pay more attention to a film that's seen thru the eyes of kids. There simply can't be any way that your kid won't be moved profoundly. I've seen it happen to my own, and I, myself, am living proof.
