 There's nothing more to say about the crazy plot that hasn't been blabbed away before. Important here is that the great Charles Crichton was nominated for Best Director, after 50 years of respectability. Amusing is that, though Kevin Kline won the Oscar, he wasn't nominated by BAFTA (British Academy); they gave it to Palin. Both are great! Jamie Lee Curtis is perfect, and John Cleese used all of his "Monty Python" humor to create an Oscar nominated script (with Crichton).15 years later, this is fresh and fun and worthy of repeated viewings, and watching the British writers let the Americans make fun of them (they all end up looking stupid), you can't help but laugh. Unnoticed my many is the great performance of Maria Aitken (Wendy, Cleese's wife). She a totally committed insensitive beast. She was great. Also ignored, was the lovely score of John du Prez, most original. Give yourself a laugh, and forget the real world. This is fun! Oh, DO shut up, Portia.
