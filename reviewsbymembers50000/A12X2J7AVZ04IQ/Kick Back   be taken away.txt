 If you're reading this, you're probably an old softie like me. I enjoy this type of entertainment, and rarely have I been as moved as by the lovely music of Tim Janis and his absolutely brilliant ensemble. Much of the music sounds alike, which is not bad considering ALL of it is wonderful and original. I've visited all the National Parks included (except Yosemite) and it's rare to find words to describe them; they are perfectly described in music (and a brief, non-obtrusive narration by George Clooney). Every individual in Tim's ensemble is brilliant, dedicated and heartfelt delivery by all. You can tell they truly love this man and his vision (and profound talent). The photography, by endless numbers of brilliant individuals, captures the beauty in just fashion. I saw this first on PBS. The DVD has a lovely rendition of an original song called "On Wings of an Angel", a song that Mr. Janis is rightly proud of. The singer (don't know her name) is like Celine Dion without the smarm. A wonderful performance, it's made me a huge Tim Janis fan, and I look forward to all of his future endeavors. He is a talent that I hope everyone can experience, at one time or another.  BRAVI TUTTI!
