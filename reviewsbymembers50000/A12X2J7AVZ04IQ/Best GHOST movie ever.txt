 This is without exception the best ghost story put on film. Shirley Jackson is proud (the sorry 1999 trash couldn't come close...). This will be coming out soon on DVD, and I can't wait. The Widescreen version has been shown often on TCM. In my opinion, there are only 3 GREAT Ghost movies: this one, "The Innocents" (1961 with Deborah Kerr), and "The Uninvited" (1944, Ray Milland). I can't think of another film that used the viewer's imagination to create terror, without using smarmy special effects. Finally, a DVD!! So...when do we get "The Innocents" & "The Uninvited"? Do the studios know that this is what we want? They're putting so much garbage out there...where's the class?
