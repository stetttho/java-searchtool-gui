 I always thought Mike Nesmith was the best of the Monkees. He had a self-effacing humor that was endearing, and never seemed to mind being in the background (behind Davy Jones and Circus Boy). I always wondered what happened to Peter Tork? Anyway, I watched them on TV religiously as a young college student at UW-Madison, and have a certain admiration. Nesmith's film is a riot. It's a "pioneer" film in many respects, winning a Grammy for best music video, after which the category was permanent. Nesmith has no end of imagination and ingenuity, and I'm impressed. Since I borrowed it from the library yesterday, and saw it for the first time, I can't make comparisons. It was fun, especially the Marine Recruitment segment. I have absolutely no doubt that this inspired John Landis to make "Amazon Women on the Moon" (1986). Similarities are overwhelming. I loved them both.
