 The great Ray Harryhausen considered this his "swan song". He did not disappoint his vast community of fans. Director Desmond Davis has assembled a great cast with a fine narrative script which puts lots of complicated stuff in a coherent fashion. Harry Hamlin is perfectly buff and handsome and Judi Bowker is as gorgeous as they come. Perfect! The great Gods are no less than Laurence Olivier, Claire Bloom and Maggie Smith. Ursula Andress is also there; doesn't do much, but she plays Aphrodite, and this IS a family film! She's stunning after all these years. Maggie Smith, in particular, is effective when she plays nasty characters, and she doesn't disappoint. The photography of Ted Moore is somewhat faded on this DVD version, not as clear and crisp as I recall when I saw it in the theatre. There are 3 witches, one of whom is the great Flora Robson, but the make-up was so fine and the direction so taut, you didn't know who was whom. It didn't matter. A great scene of rapid-fire dialogue. Charles H. Schneer produced all those Sinbad movies in a wide 2.35:1 widescreen; this was in 1.85:1 LBX. I like widescreen. The real star is Ray Harryhausen. His interpretation of Medusa is the best imaginable. Also Cerberus (the 2-headed dog) actually was supposed to have 3 heads...but who's counting..? The Harryhausen effects are the star...don't forget the scorpions that grow from Medusa's bloody head. Cool. If acting honors go out, they should go to Maggie Smith, in the minor role of Thetis. The only thing missing from this film was that Zeus did nothing to her at the end. (He should've done something...she was a real meanie). Check this out. True escapist fare. One of my faves. One interesting movie fact: the following year, 1982, Harry Hamlin played a gay character in "Making Love", directed by Arthur Hiller. A fine film. It hurt his career. Ten years later, it made Tom Hanks a legitimate star. Go figure!
