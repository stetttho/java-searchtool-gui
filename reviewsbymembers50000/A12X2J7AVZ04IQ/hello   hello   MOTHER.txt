 I've always been a Woody Allen fan, and his early genius is solidly established in this imaginative and clever endeavor. If you're reading this, you already know of the circumstances surrounding Woody's re-imagining of this dumb film. Fact is, it's beautifully photographed; stereotypes are so plentiful that they become non-existant after a short while. Sound effects are exquisite. And the laffs are happening all the time.  It's too silly to explain, and silly is good.  We need a whole lot of silly these days. And, yes, a great egg salad would be terrific! Thank you, Woody!
