 In what is obviously a total labor of love, Roman Polanski has taken Hardy's complex novel and has made a compelling narrative in just 3 hours running time. Complex as it is, it is leisurely paced, though never boring. Nastassia Kinski made her lead-role debut here, and laces her multi-layered character with simultaneous moments of strength and vulnerability. Polanski's attention to detail was rewarded with Oscars for sets, costumes and cinematography. This film is a feast for film fans who appreciate quality, substance and visual excellence.
