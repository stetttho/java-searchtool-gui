 This is a powerful exposition of peer-pressure and teen angst. Director Catherine Hardwicke has presented a devastating and totally honest display of contemporary ideas, with the help of fellow screen-writer and star, Nikki Reed (13 at the time).Nikki plays the bad-influence, while Evan Rachel Wood gives the performance of a lifetime, as the victimized "outcast". Holly Hunter is there, as the mother who wants to let her kid grow by herself, until it's so out of control that she needs to intervene. It's a pure, 100% performance, with total conviction. It's uncomfortable to watch, but it pulls no punches. Good DVD with extras.
