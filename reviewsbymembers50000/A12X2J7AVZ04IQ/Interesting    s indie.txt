 This independent film, written by Louis Garfinkle, is better than you might think. It's an interesting plot, though the final outcome is somewhat predictable. BUT...getting to that final outcome, there's some eerie and wonderful psychological-thriller-type stuff going on. Richard Boone made this just before he started playing Paladin on TV ("Have Gun, Will Travel") and he shows more committment than I've seen from him. The wonderful Theodore Bikel, Scot brogue & all, is quite fine. All of the acting is good. I won't blab away the plot, but the technical aspects of this film are extraordinary, and are displayed very well on this inexpensive DVD. The photography by Frederick Gately is exquisite, showing every crag in Boone's craggy face, and every bead of sweat on his bulbous nose. The opening credits, shown agaist a craggy brick wall show such detail, though you don't know it's a brick wall till later. Lighting is crucial, and mood is well-sustained. The artwork of E. Vorkapich (the map) is as creepy as it gets; great terror potential. Most of all must be the music of Gerald Fried; his deft use of harpsichord adds to the creepiness. The film also relies heavily on sound effects, and the spoken dialogue (all by Ryder Sound Services) is crystal clear. I see moments of Hitchcock...and even Bergman...in the images. "I Bury the Living" isn't a fright-fest; rather a slow, interesting walk down the path of psychological terror. Another feather in Albert Band's indie hat. A very worthy film experience.
