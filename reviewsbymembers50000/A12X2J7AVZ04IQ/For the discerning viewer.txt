 No doubt this filming of Eugene O'Neill's epic play will not appeal to everyone (though there are suggestions of drugs, sex & violence...) This is, in effect, an exact filming of O'Neill's play, masterfully directed by a younger Sidney Lumet (Network, Murder on the Orient Express, etc.), and his trademark of generous close-ups is haunting. This is apt, since the entire cast won top acting honors at Cannes. Indeed, aside from the autobiographical train of events, the acting is, without exception, brilliant. This is one of Robards' first film roles, as well as Stockwell, and their performances are multi-layered and mesmerizing. Also, Ralph Richardson's role fits him like a glove. The most remarkable performance is from Katherine Hepburn...as a morphine addict? Wow! I remember reading interviews years ago where Hepburn admitted that she was scared to death of the utter complexity of the role. She was at a point in her career where she was worried that no one would take her seriously, or that she'd fall short in creating any of the many facets of the character. Well, it's complete! Affection, cynicism, duality, suspicion, and her deep trips into her past, not to mention that she's aware that her life's gone to hell...it's overwhelming. The play/film is episodic, but this is OK because it gives wonderful interaction among all characters (even Jeanne Barr, as the goofy housekeeper). It's all very atmospheric and quite profound, thanks to Lumet's understanding of his material. Andre Previn's unobtrusive score properly conveys "dysfunction" when necessary. At three hours, the time flies by, thanks to impeccable production values, and acting, captured on film, that any true aficianado will cherish. Sure, it's artsy, but it would be hard to present O'Neill any other way. I usually prefer widescreen, but the close-ups may actually benefit from this full-screen version. I'm proud to have this film, finally, in my collection.
