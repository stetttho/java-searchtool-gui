 I saw this film as a child, and not since. Still, the mark it left on me is profound. I believe all children should be treated to J. C. Harris' little lessons in life. I'dheard that someone thought this to be racially un-PC, though I have no idea what they could be referring to...those same people said the same about "Show Boat". All I know for sure is that the film is charming, entertaining and inspirational. James Baskett (Uncle Remus) won a special Oscar for his performance, and Oscar-winning song "Zip a Dee Doo Dah" has become a true American classic. What can be so bad about a film that has touched so many in so positive a way?
