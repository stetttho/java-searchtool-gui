 I'm not going to try to analyze the merits of these films, like some reviewing predecessors. Quite simply, Madacy Enterainment has once again come up with a great double-bill of "the best of the worst", complete with cartoon and trailers. It's amusing that Allied Artists (Wasp Woman) and American-International (Leeches) are represented here, since they were rivals for years to get the drive-in crowd. The acting in both is abysmal, which is only right and proper. "Wasp Woman" was early Corman, and shows a bit of style, but try to overlook that and enjoy the trashiness of it all. I love it when the male lead in these films shows off manly chest-hair (Ken Clark in "Leeches"). He IS the hero, can anyone doubt it? What a guy! I've always liked Yvette Vickers (Leeches); too bad she did too many of these films to legitimize her career. Once again, Madacy included a Popeye cartoon without Olive Oyl. Pity. Lighten up! Give yourself a break from the intellectual. Life's too short not to indulge yourself in some trashy fun.
