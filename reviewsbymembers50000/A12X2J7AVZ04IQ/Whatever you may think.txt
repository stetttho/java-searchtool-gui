 Doesn't matter what you think of Michael Moore. He is annoyed by politicians, and really cares about America.I'm not going to rehash the developments, which are smartly and coherently presented. This film has heart, humor, and sincerity. Do NOT judge this film until you've seen it. Whether you agree with it or not, it's certainly eye-opening. Keep your mind open. I'm very impressed. Every American should see this film.
