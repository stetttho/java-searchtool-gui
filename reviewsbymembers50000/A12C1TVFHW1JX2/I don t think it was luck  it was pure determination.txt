 We just met the affable Mr. Lu Chi Fa at his "The Coffeepot Restaurant" in Morro Bay, CA.  Here I saw a true entrepreneur at work.  We exchanged books.  As the author of "Engineering Your Start-up: A Guide for the High-Tech Entrepreneur" I am always interested in getting to know business start-up role models and tangible success stories.  Here is a story of success obtained through hard work, inspiration, and probably most important, a positive attitude and friendly manner.  Reading Double Luck will be a particular rewarding experience for youngsters wondering about making their way in this uncertain world.  Lu Chi's bookmark says it all... "In America, no matter how humble your beginnings, if you work hard, respect yourself and others, you can succeed."  Lu Chi's sister says "You are lucky, Chi Fa... good fortune has found you" but I don't think it was luck, it was pure determination.
