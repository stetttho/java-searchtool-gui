 This is more of a fulfillment comment than a product comment, but I ordered Antec 7 but received Antec 5.  I had researched thee products and knew the " Antec 5" was not as well-rated as the "Antec 7."  It wasn't worth the hassle to return it... and so I bought an equivalent product, Artic Silver 5, elsewhere.
