 I live in Morro Bay, CA, in San Luis Obispo County, and have undertaken to walk every trail in the immediate area.  Robert B. Stone's "Day Hikes in San Luis Obispo County" is absolutely the best book I've run across for this purpose.  The local Sierra Club's trail guide book, while perhaps more detailed, does not have the clear maps, and concise hike summaries... the how-to-get-theres, and hiking directions.  Each hike is laid out on two facing pages, so you could photocopy (fair use I'd think) it on one 8 1/2 x11 " page to take with you on each hike.
