 I was very disappointed in this unit.   I was going to take it on two-week trip, where the eight of us could save all of our pictures, and review them in the hotel during the trip, and burn a DVD for all at the end, but after discovering the following deficiencies, I threw it in a drawer instead: (1) power brick and cables were almost as large and as heavy as the unit itself, (2) the unit took 5-7 seconds just to display the next picture - making quick review very frustrating, and (3) the video cable for displaying on a TV did not work, or just barely worked if one jiggled it and held it out 1/16th of an inch and applied pressure - either a defective or poorly designed cable/plug.  I'd expect this from a $5 pair of cheap headphones, but this unit cost me almost 600 dollars.
