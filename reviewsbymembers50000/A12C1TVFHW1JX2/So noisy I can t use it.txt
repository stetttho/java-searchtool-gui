 I paid big bucks to get a quality phone, but this one disappointed me... it is very noisy, and when I push the "amp" button (which is hard to do when talking), you get amplified noise.  I chose this 900MHz freq. model to avoid the 2.4GHz models that might interfere with my 802.11 wireless Internet LAN... guess I'll try a 2.4GHz models now...sigh.
