 I found Pastore's "Stock Options" book to be an essential  resource for any employee or entrepreneur needing to understand this very  complex subject.  It is one of the few comprehensive accurate resources  available on the topic.  While my book "Engineering Your  Start-up" contains some overlapping material and more specific  guidance to the entrepreneur in granting stock options, Pastore's book is  an essential supplement. It is more complete in some areas, and is  up-to-date on the related tax laws.  The financial risk of not optimizing  one's tax exposure in deciding when to exercise or sell stock options, for  example, far exceeds the cost of this book.  I recommended to all my  friends who have any stock options at all, to buy, read, and keep this book  for future reference.
