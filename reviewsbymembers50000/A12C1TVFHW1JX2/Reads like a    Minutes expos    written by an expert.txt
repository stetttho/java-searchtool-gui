 Author Jack Morrow, retired in beautiful Cambria, CA,  continues playing a major role in defending the environment as a Central Coast Docent for CA State Parks.  Prior, he was an environmentalist and forest conservationist, and always a perpetual student of ethics, globalization, and national and international politics.   Jack has written a first, gripping novel, that reads like a 60 Minutes expos that draws the viewer into a world not previously perceived - developing a sense of outrage at the brutal and unfair schemes invoked by the bad guys, at the expense of society.  This brief 200 page novel has no shortage of actions (floods, sex, love, deception, earthquakes, tsunamis, murders, suicide, conspiracy, bribery...) wrapped around international intrigue in the globalization of the US lumber business, and in the destruction of the environment and decimation of our precious old growth forests.  In this post 9/11 period, when most US citizens are just beginning to appreciate the role foreign businesses and governments are playing in controlling US businesses, and in influencing domestic policies and national politics, Morrow weaves all of these intriguing elements into "The Consortium"  -- a work of fiction that just as easily could have been a non-fiction account of actual occurrences.  This book must be based more the author's related experiences than just a vivid imagination.  In this case, the first-time efforts of a new author exceed expectations - this book obviously has years of thought and development behind it, and to the extent that every author has one really good book in him, Jack delivered on his first one.  If you care about the environment, and are put off with the lying and deception of big business and corrupt politicians, this book will be a good read for you.
