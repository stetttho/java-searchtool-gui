 don't let the heart on the cover fool you, this isn't a post-hardcore/emo/screamo record in the slightest. this is just a geniune, original hardcore record and one of the best of the year. for as much of an odl school feel there is to this record, theirs a lot of new fresh ideas being thrown here which is great to see a band like killing the dream pushing the threshhold of hardcore. they dabble in little melodic riffs, harmonics, and even some sparse layered vocal work all the way going at a breakneck speed. highlight tracks include "39 and glisan," "writer's block," and "where the heart is." recommended for fans of other deathwish bands such as embrace today, blacklisted, and modern life is war.
