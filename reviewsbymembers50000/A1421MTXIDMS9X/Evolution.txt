 A Life Once Lost are the true definition of a band that has evolved over each album they have released. Open Your Mouth For The Speechless found them tirelessly searching for a musical identity, The Fourth Plague was much more of a tolerable listen, and A Great Artist brought forth their full experimentation in tech-metal ala the mighty Meshuggah but without the full creative scope to step out of the shadows. Enter Hunter.  The easiest way to describe A Life Once Lost at this point in their careers would be a quality mix of Meshuggah and Lamb Of God, certainly not bad comparisons to have. If you're tired of all the gothernburg riffing and crave something with intensity, this is for you. Hunter is chocked full of stop/start riffing, southern-tinged leads, and plunty of pummeling drum work. Rob Meadows vocals attack you like a rabid dog (think Randy Blythe but not quite as low pitched). What is perhaps nicest about this album is A Life Once Lost have taken the concept behind tech-metal and have become one of the very few bands that can actually write cohesive songs out of its format. Admittedly, towards the end of the album the songs start to feeling a little to similar and start to run into each other, but other than that theirs not much to complain about here. Highlight tracks include "Pain & Panic," "Vulture" and "Rehashed." For fans of Meshuggah,   Lamb Of God, Into The Moat, and The Red Chord.
