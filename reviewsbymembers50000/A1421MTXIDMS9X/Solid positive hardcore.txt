 This is just a solid positive hardcore record from a really good band. This Is Our Revenge doesn't retain a lot of the aggressive aspects of Heart Means Everything but theirs very little to complain about here. It's catchy, heartfelt, and actually has something positive to say. Given the current state of hardcore, this is such a breath of fresh air. There is defintely a bit of a Comeback Kid feel to this album, but some of the other comparisons from Victory are pretty off base (go figure). The only reason it says this album is for fans of Thrice on the sticker is becuase this album dropped on the same day as Vheissu and theres really nothing similar to Rise Against. If you enjoy the likes of Comeback Kid and Bane, then this record is for you. Highlight tracks include "Elevens," "Closets," "You Always Said," and "In A Bottle" which has an undeniable Boysetsfire feel to it.
