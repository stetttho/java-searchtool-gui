 I really love this album, even though I probably shouldn't. There's nothing terribly original or unique about this album at all, but for some reason or another, Nodes Of Ranvier captured the metalcore sound when it was downright fun to listen to. It reminds me of early metalcore from a 5-6 years back as oppose to a lot of the garbage we hear today. The production isn't overpolished (in fact, the vocals are very rough sounding akin to that of Seventh Star or Atreyu from their early days) and the songs don't overstay their welcome. There's a lot more singing this time around that meets somewhere in between the clean vocals of Atreyu and the Danzig-styled croons of Sinai Beach, but way better. Which is a welcome in the sense that the clean vocals do not sound whiny in the slightest. There's some use of spoken word that feels very akin to that of Lamb Of God. Musically, there's less of a hardcore influence and much more of a metal influence. Lots of gothenburg style riffing, chugging, and pinch harmonics. The drumming is neither here nor there, but what the overall album lacks in technicality, it makes up for in some great songwriting. The choruses are a 100 times better than your standard fare of metalcore and the heavier parts of the album have enough of a raw feel to appeal to the musical elitist who turn the other way to this style of music. But perhaps whats most surprising, is even though this very much feels like a metalcore record, there's really no emphasis on the "breakdown." The songs chug along at a breakneck speed with lot of energy (sans the track Grave) to really stop for a generic mosh part. On top of that, the slipcase packaging and artwork is really slick looking and all together this is probably my favorite Facedown release of the year. Highlight tracks include the title track, In Too Deep, and Second Hand Syndrome. For fans of early Atreyu, Symphony In Peril, and Sinai Beach.
