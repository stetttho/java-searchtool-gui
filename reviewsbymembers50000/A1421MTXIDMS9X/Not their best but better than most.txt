 Bane is just one of those bands in hardcore that you know for always releasing a quality hardcore record and "The Note" is nothing short of that, although its probably not their best effort. Traditional hardcore, for me, has very few bands in which really stick out to to me and Bane is one of them. Mostly because Aaron Bedards unique and melodic vocal approach and their ability to write dynamic guitar riffs ala Comeback Kid (well, I suppose that comparison should be the other way around unless your new to hardcore) but like Comeback Kid's "Wake The Dead," "The Note" is a breath of fresh air into a pretty stale hardcore genre that seems more concerned with breakdowns and "being tough." Tracks like "End With An Ellipsis" and "Swan Song"(my favorite track on the entire album) find Bane experimenting areas of melody they haven't gone before. "Swan Song" has a real epic feel to it with guest vocals from the lead singer of labelmates Silent Drive (whose name escapes me at the moment). Other highlight tracks include "Pot Committed" and "Wasted On The Young."   Production wise, the album feels a little weak which is probably why people don't feel this record comes across as heavy as their previous releases. The comic book-styled artwork is great and the booklet and has some really cool illustrations. All in all, a worthy purchase for someone looking to start at the top of the hardcore ladder.
