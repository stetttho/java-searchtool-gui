 This is good, it's not great and it definetly is no where nearly as good as "Pass The Flask" but all things considered, it's an above average release in a growingly stale hardcore scene.   The Bled tred some new water (no pun intended) on "Found In The Flood" with a tracks such as "My Assassin" and "Antarctica" which are mostly sung in clean vocals, something you had to figure was bound to happen when The Bled made their jump from Fiddler to Vagrant. "Hotel Coral Essex" could be the coolest song they've ever written and while a demo of this was floating around over a year ago it still tops out any of the other tracks found on the album. "Daylight Bombings" works to recreate the magic of "Porcelain Hearts And Hammer For Teeth" from "Pass The Flask" and while its a valiant effort, falls pretty short of it's mark. "The Last American Cowboy" seems to be a mixture of The Bled's older, heavier stylings mixed with their newer sound while tracks such as "Guttershark," "She Calls Home," and "Millionaires" would have fit well on "Pass The Flask" and feels much more familiar than the vast majority of the album.   By no means a bad album, and certainly much better than the new From Autumn To Ashes album coming out next week through Vagrant, it doesn't quite match up with "Pass The Flask" but thats ok because overall it's an enjoyable listen--just not what Bled fans were entirely hoping for.
