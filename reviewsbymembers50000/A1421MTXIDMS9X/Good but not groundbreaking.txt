 Through The Eyes Of The Dead are probably their own worst enemy. Their inability to evolve their sound or musicianship is seriously going to hinder them in the long run. Is this album bad? Not at all. It's just same old hat for TTEOTD. If you've heared their EP and split, you've pretty much heard this record already. Especially considering there is an intro, an outro, two interludes, and a re-recorded track from each of their previous EP's, what you're essentially left with is 5 new tracks (or just another EP with other loose ends attached depending on how you want to look at it). If I could give this 3.5 stars, I probably would instead.  Musically, the tracks are extremely aggressive and if you must call this "metalcore," this is some of the heaviest metalcore you're going to find. But with the exception of a few breakdowns, this really isn't much of a metalcore record as the album dabbles in a lot more death metal/grind influences. Plunty of blast beats, At The Gates-influenced riffing, gutteral vocals, etc. Basically, fans of bands such as Black Dahlia Murder will enjoy this record much more than you're average Atreyu fan.   Despite the fact that this feels like a bit of a cheapened effort on both TTEOTD's and Prosthetic's part (and an extremely rushed release), it's still a fun listen and better than you're standard fare of music out there right now.
