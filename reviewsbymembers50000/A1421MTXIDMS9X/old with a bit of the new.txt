 As much as I thought "Love" was a great album, I really missed old Juliana Theory but after their stab at mainstream success failed, it seems as if TJT has reverted back to their days of Emotion Is Dead and and Understand This Is A Dream with just a dash of what we heard on Love (on tracks like Shotgun Serenade). While the majority of bands are caught up with the idea of writing songs with the singing/screaming post-hardcore sound thats saturating the radiowaves (ala Silverstein/Hawthorne Heights...yuck!), TJT are writing good 'ol indie rock songs that remind of the early days of Tooth And Nail. Brett Deter's voice never gets old, coupled in with the catchy guitar work of old and you have a winning formula in every sense of the word. This album doesn't feel quite as emo as their older stuff (and when I say emo I'm not referring to Dashboard Confessional, newbies), but rather their sound coming to fruition. Is it my favorite album they've ever written? No, that'll forever be Emotion Is Dead. But is it the strongest, most mature material they've ever written? Absolutely, and I think even the band would tell you that. There's a hidden track at the end of French Kiss Off which is just brilliant and pretty much destroys just about anything you hear on the radio and tv right now. Other highlight tracks include "I Love You To Death(Drive Safely)," "This Valentine Ain't No Saint," and "We Make The Road By Walking." I think it's important to mention that if you're new to TJT and are skeptical about the  band, this is probably an album you should check out and a good starting point, especially considering your favorite bands should probably pay TJT royalties for ripping off the things that they were doing years ago. Kudos to Abacus for keeping this band on the map.
