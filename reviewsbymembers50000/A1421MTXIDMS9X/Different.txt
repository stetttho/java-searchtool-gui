 This is totally off-the-wall release for Victory, atleast in comparison to a lot of the crap they've been peddling to the mainstream which I suppose is the irony about Victory--they can release such brilliant records at times and release absolute garbage other times. In anycase, The Tossers basically don't fit into anything Victory currently puts out (or even in the past, that I can think of?) and while I'm not to awfully caught up on this style of music I suppose it's best described as an Irish influenced fusion of folk and punk--something like the Dropkick Murphys but with more of a focus on the irish and folk influences and just a dash of punk (basically you're not going to hear any fast 3 chord progressions here but it does have the attitude of a punk record). From a technical perspective, the music is written very well and it's catchy as hell. Their some tracks that are only 1:30 long and then others that clock in well over the 6:00 mark. The band is very talented at what they do, but even I'll admit this record isn't for everyone. The average listener of Victory's current roster will probably absolutely hate this. Listen before you buy. Highlight tracks include "Good Morning Da," "No Loot, No Booze, No Fun," and the title track.
