 I don't like a lot of traditional hardcore. The general rule of thumb is that a good hardcore band is really good and a bad hardcore band is well, really bad. There's not much in between and their's very small subtleties that separate the two. Fortunetly for bands like Comeback Kid, Bane, Modern Life Is War, The Warriors, etc., they know how to separate themselves from the pack. Madball is no different.  I really enjoyed this record. You can generally judge a good hardcore band by if when a record is put on and you hear it and you know exactly who it is rather than going through guessing five different bands who all sound the same. There's nothing technically impressive here, it's just good ol' traditional hardcore. Being that Madball has been around forever, most people will probably know what their getting when picking up "Legacy." If you're not familiar with Madball, however, you can expect positive lyrics and song structuring that isn't concerned with basing itself around breakdowns and tough guy meandering. If you're worried that Ferret may have changed Madball's sound, I can say with confidence that they have not, not even in the slightest. This is by far one of the better traditional hardcore records to come out this year and is a worthy purchase for both the hardcore veterans and those looking to get a good taste of what good hardcore is. Some may argue that it's not Madball's best, and that's probably true, but it's good nonetheless.
