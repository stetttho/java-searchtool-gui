 Cannae has impressed me. Where "Horror" was a pretty standard metalcore record, "Gold Becomes Sacrifice" is simply-put a metal record. No silly cores, no stupid genre tagging. Anyone saying anything otherwise is completely off-base. "Gold Becomes Sacrifice" is much more akin to the likes of At The Gates, old The Haunted, and Through The Eyes Of The Dead (for you newer metal listeners out there).   There's a little bit of gothenberg riffing here, a little bit of thrash, and a little bit of a death metal influence all thrown into a giant melting pot. The soloing is not only technically impressive but has an old school metal feel to it. In fact, the technical aspects of the entire album are impressive. It's made pretty clear early on that each bandmember is more than adequate at playing their own instrument. Cannae hasn't totally abandoned everything you knew about them, in fact, the first time you spin this record, you'll know it's them. They still love to pummel you with a well-placed breakdown and amazingly, they utilize them much better than you're fair share of bands these days. After awhile though, the material does begin to start to run into each other (towards the end) and the instrumental "Collapse" serves really no purpose other then just being another track on the tracklisting.   It's definetly not the best album of the year but its far from the worst. The fact that Cannae seems content on creating a sound for themselves (as oppose to standing still) is not only something that should be respected but makes this album worth checking out. Highlight tracks include "Rats, Snakes, and Thieves," "Faceless Portrait," and "Mechanics Of Moving Backwards."
