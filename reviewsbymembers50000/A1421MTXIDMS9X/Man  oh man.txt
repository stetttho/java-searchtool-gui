 Wow, this is not good. I'm not sure what Trustkill was thinking with this one but if you want an album that plays off like it's some sort of almagamation of hardcore and southern rock n' roll and dumbs down everything thats awesome about independent music into just being about "sex, drugs, and rock n' roll" I guess this album will be for you. I'll admit, there's a few catchy parts (mostly on "Complete Heat") but other than that, theres much left to be desired here. The intelligence and artistry displayed on this album is about the equivalent of a rap or hip hop album...and that's not good. Take out the heavier and unique aspects of Every Time I Die, insert lame lyrics, and you have Fight Paris. That's not to say I can't be objective when I say that scenesters will eat this album up and with the proper promotion from Trustkill, it'll probably be spun by the same kids who think The Used are the savior of rock n' roll. Yikes.
