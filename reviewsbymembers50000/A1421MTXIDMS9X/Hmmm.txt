 Hmmm...sometimes I wonder if Haste The Day are their own worst enemies. When Everything Falls has everything you'd want in a standard metalcore record...blistering riffs, throaty vocals, melodic singing, etc. but unfortunetly it falls short of being as enjoyable as their Solid State debut "Burning Bridges." The biggest problem here is the songwriting is just to predictable. Haste The Day have the ability to write a helluva catchy chorus, but when you throw them into every single track like they've done here, not only does it sound forced but it sort of loses it's ability to contrast with the heavier aspects of the songs because of the constant repitition, and even worse it makes it difficult to differentiate between the tracks. Ironically enough, perhaps the most enthralling listen on the entire album is the closing track "Long Way Down" which is entirely sung in clean vocals with scattered background screams, mostly because its just about the only track that really sounds different from everything else thats written and sounds very un-metalcore.  There's definetly talent here and I enjoy the album enough to say that When Everything Falls would fit nicely into anyones record collection who enjoys the majority of Solid State's catalog of releases, but don't expect to be blown away by this album as it doesn't tread any new ground. Highlight tracks include the "For A Lifetime," "Walk On," and "Long Way Down."
