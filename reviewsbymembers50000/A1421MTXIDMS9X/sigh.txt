 Bands like SOTY are pretty much everything thats wrong with music right now. Not that theres ever anything right with 99% of mainstream music to begin with, I just can't help but wonder when people are going to start making decisions for themselves and stop automatically accepting whats on the radio and TV as a basis for what's "good music." It disgusts me on just about every level. Start listening to independent music and looking towards your local music scene and listen to something with originality. This is garbage.
