 the previous reviewer pretty much hit it on the head but i think its more closer to a 4 star album considering their is a lot worse out there. embrace today aren't anything entirely special, nor do they even lay the claim to being groundbreaking, they just do what they do which is play tough straightedge hardcore and they're very good at it. production wise the album is a little weak but thats not so much of an issue in the whole scheme of things. theirs a few moments of experimentation with some female vocals and acoustic work that weaves in and out of the few of the tracks which is nice. the artwork done by jacob bannon is awesome and one of the coolest layouts i've seen in a long time. as long as you're not looking for something entirely groundbreaking, hardcore and metal kids alike can be satisfied with the punch that this album throws.
