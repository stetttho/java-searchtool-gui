 A Perfect Murder is no longer the band you once thought you knew. Their not a hardcore band or even a metalcore band with the tendency to throw in some solos here in there anymore. Their simply a metal band and you'd have to expect major changes when 3/5 of the lineup changes including your vocalist. Is this a bad album? No not really. There's just nothing special going on here. They sounded more unique on "Unbroken" even though this album will probably generate more fans. I'm not sure if Phil Anselmo would be proud at a what a great impression (including the spoken words and croons!) the new vocalist does of him or if he would turn his head and laugh, but the guitar work doesn't even touch the late and great Dimebag Darrell. Basically, what you have here is a very generic Pantera rip off. If you want a new release from Victory pick up the new Darkest Hour "Undoing Ruin" or wait until the new Between The Buried And Me drops at the end of the year. If you want to hear how much this sounds like Pantera listen to "Suffocation Of Thought."
