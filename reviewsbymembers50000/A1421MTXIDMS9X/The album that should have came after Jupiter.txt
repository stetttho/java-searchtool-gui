 I'll just say it right now, when Cave In is on top of their game, there's very, very few bands that can even come remotely close to the genius that is this band. Anchor, while mildly entertaining, was a bust by just about everyones standards and RCA nearly destroyed a great band and just shows you how awful major labels generally are. Thankfully, Hydrahead has brought us the album that should have came after Jupiter complete with the return of ::Gasp:: heavy vocals! Even though these are basically polished off demos packaged as a full length, these songs are so well written it's not even funny. If you ever wanted to know what Cave In would sound like if they took Jupiter and Until Your Heart Stops, threw it in a blender, and mixed up every style and sound they've ever done then Perfect Pitch Black is for you. There's a few tracks that don't do much for me but tracks like "World In Your Way," "Off To Ruin," and "Trepanning" this is a more than a worthy purchase. Cave In has rediscovered themselves and is slowly proving to me that their simply one of those bands that can do no wrong when their given the creative freedom to fully express themselves. I can't wait to see what they'll do next.
