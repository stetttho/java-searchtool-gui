 I don't typically go for the indie/emo rock thing but wow, this is an impressive album. The songwriting is far superior to that of your typical indie release and while "In Motion" has a few moments that feel particularLY overly-sappy, if you will, I still enjoy this album thoroughly.   I think part of the problem with a lot of this style of music is the the tendency to sound so whiny. Copeland pretty much dispels all that. They sound mature and fully confident in their songwriting (both musically and lyrically) abilities. So much so in fact that they would fit just as well next to a band like the UK's Keane (who has a much more contemporary piano-driven sound) as they would to say, Death Cab For Cutie. The songs themselves have a ton of variance in them from the more guitar driven tracks like "No One Really Wins This Time," and "Love Is A Fast Song," to the more more piano and acoustic driven tracks like "Kite" and "Hold Nothing Back." The strength of the album, of course sits on the fact that every song is a little bit different yet as an album they cohesively work so well. Aaron Marsh has an unbelievable voice, just listen to the high notes in chorus of "Love Is A Fast Song" to the lower notes on a track like "Kite." Then you have songs like "Pin Your Wings," "Don't Slow Down," and "You Have My Attention" which seem to meet in the middle of all. The pacing of the album is balanced very well.   If you want something thats driven on melody and is steps beyond your average indie outfit, this is the album for you. One of the better releases in 05.
