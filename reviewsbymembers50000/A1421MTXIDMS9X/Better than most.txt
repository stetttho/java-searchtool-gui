 Byzantine is a band with a lot of talent and has generally flown under the radar of the metal scene, in my opinion. That's not to say that this band is perfect or that their aren't better bands, but it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out this band can actually play their instruments and write fairly decent, all be it not tremendously groundbreaking, songs.   Byzantine seem to have shed their more "tech" aspect that they had on "The Fundamental Component" for a much more standard southern-tinged metal record (this isn't a death metal record like I've seen mentioned here). But what Byzantine lacks in the "tech" department this time around, they make up for with outstandingly improved guitar work (see Justicia) and much more experimentation with things such as piano work (see Five Faces Of Madness), some slight acoustic work (see Redneck War)  and southern influenced vocal work (see Temporary Temples and Redneck War) although admittedly at times the southern crooning sounds a little...well, cheesy, for the lack of a better word. Most of the album however is spent with a vocal attack that is akin to the band Hell Within with a few lower growls scattered here and there. The band chugs a long at a pace that is not necessarily thrashy but not necessarily breakdown heavy either, but really the highlight of the album altogether is the guitar leads and solos the color the entire album.   Collectively, this is a much more ambitious effort on Byzantine's part. Highlight tracks include "Five Faces Of Madness," "Justicia," and "Take Up Serpants." For fans of Lamb Of God, Hell Within, and A Life Once Lost.
