 Ya know, at first, I really just didn't like this album. I knew it was Black Dahlia Murder, but it just felt like they lost their edge. I spun the disk many a times, and its grown on me. This album is a lot more complex than Unhallowed. If Unhallowed was metalcore album, then this a melodic death metal album and as such, it's not going to click on the first listen. It takes a few spins to reveal its complexity and genius. Is this a classic or a masterpiece? Most likely not, but it's certainly one of the more unique metal releases your going to hear this year.  The song writing and riffing is much more dense this time around. The drumming is just amazing. The new drummer they I have, I forget his name, but he drums like a monster. The only song that I really found at all similar to the material on Unhallowed was the lead single "A Vulgar Picture." Everything else sounds a little bit different from what you've heard from this band before, yet you know its BDM. The soloing on this album is unique. It actually follows the melody of the song as oppose to going off into a flurry of notes. I kind of wish Trevor Strnad would hit that growl a little bit more often because he has one of the best growls out there if you ask me. Other than that, the only other real complaint that I can pull from this album is the length (about 33 minutes) so its a quick listen and because of the intro track, your really only getting 9 songs. The material thats there though is solidly written. The artwork for the album is definetly unique, very "un-metal" if you will. If you enjoy some of the classic metal bands like At The Gates or Carcass, you'll enjoy this or if your more akin to some of the newer sounds, fans of The Agony Scene and Through The Eyes Of The Dead will enjoy this as well. Highlight tracks include "I'm Charming," "A Vulgar Picture," and "Dave Goes To Hollywood."
