 Wow, Boys Night Out came out of their shell and shedded a lot of the things that plagued them on their previous effort "Make Yourself Sick." By far the poppiest record Ferret has released, that doesn't necessarily means it bad. Far from it in fact. This is a catchy record that is well written and is not quite pop punk, post hardcore, or screamo, but much more of a rock record that stands above most their predecessors.   Artistically, you have to hand it to the band. The entire is album is a concept album, that unlike most concept albums, is easy to follow and has some chilling artwork to go along with it. Typically,  concept albums are pretty hit and miss but BNO pull it off and they pull it off well. Musically, Boys Night Out have shed most of their tendency to belt out some screams except on "Purging" and "Healing." But don't worry, this is actually much better because they now no longer sound like the twenty million other bands on the Warped Tour. They've added in some synthesizer work and even some female vocals on a track or two (see "Relapsing"). They still refer back to some acoustic passages here and there which is nice (see "Composing.") These tracks will transale excellent live with the sporatic handclaps and not so sporatic sing-alongs. Essentially, what you have here is a band maturing into a sound that is much more longer lasting than their previous efforts. Highlight tracks include "Sentencing," "Healing," Dreaming," and "Relapsing." A worthy 05 purchase.
