 Ya know, I know its almost blasphemy to some people to even say anything bad about Meshuggah, but let's be honest here...this is NOT Meshuggah's best work. Catch 33 is basically a big experiment (which is what the band would tell you) gone wrong (which is what I'm telling you). I've listened to the album over and over and I still don't see what the appeal is. I really enjoyed the "I" EP because it had some variance in the songwriting and the ambience that they dabbled in wasn't cheesy or totally pointless. I'll never discount Meshuggah's talent or their ability to write music, but there's a lot of problems here. First of all, the first three tracks are essentially the same riff cut up into three short parts...why for the life of me, I can't figure out. I realize Catch 33 is suppost to be one giant track, but the tracks should be differentiated by the change in the music. The ambience experimented on this album is just plain bad. I couldn't believe what I was listening to on "Mind's Mirror." In addition, call me a nitpicker but all the drums on the album were programmed which just seems to cheapen the effort for me. I think, in fact, the reason I'm so disappointed with this release the fact that I do hold Meshuggah to a high standard, as do a lot of people but I guess I'm not enough of a fanboy not to call Meshuggah on something that isn't nearly up to their previous efforts. If you're able to listen to this entire album and not be bored, I almost envy you because I wanted to like this album a lot, but I just can't. If your new to Meshuggah, get one of their older full length releases. This is not the place to start.  I'll stick with Chaosphere for the time being and if you want to listen to a good album that is designed to being one giant track, go out and pick up Edge Of Sanity's(Dan Swano) "Crimson II."
