 Alright so I guess it goes without saying that metalcore has pretty much become the new "nu-metal," not only does the term pretty much get slapped onto everything thats remotely considered to be aggressive music but its just about as absurd of a term as your going to find to describe any sort of music because its essentially lost all meaning...just like nu-metal did.   To get to the album though, Shadows Are Security is basically an album that just feels like a natural progression for As I Lay Dying. They trimmed a lot of the "fat" off their songs and stripped their sound down. There's an advantage to this and a disadvantage. The advantage of course is that everything feels much tighter on the album from the guitar work to the drumming. The disadvantage of course is that the density of the songs on Frail Words Collapse is no longer there. Tim Lambesis' vocal approach has been scaled down to a basic growl whereas he sounded like a machine on Frail Words Collapse. Theirs more use of clean vocals as well. I will say however that the guitar work collectively is much stronger and reinforces their melodic stylings found on previous tracks like "The Beginning" more than anything. The few guitar solos found on the album are actually real guitar solos, not just quick little leads, which is nice as well. In all truth, however, any complaint about this album is very much a minor complaint in the full scope of the album because regardless, you still know this is As I Lay Dying and it's written really well, even if their are a ton of bands playing the same style. Highlight tracks include "Meaning In Tragedy," "Confined," and "Through Struggle." No sense in going for the imitators, go to the top which is where this album sits in the "metalcore" world in my opinion.
