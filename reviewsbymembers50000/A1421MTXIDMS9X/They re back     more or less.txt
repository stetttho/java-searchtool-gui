 There really isn't much to say that hasn't already been said. Come Clarity is the best album In Flames has released since Clayman and thats a big thing considering the decline theyve been on. Soundtrack To Your Escape was decent but it had no staying power, Reroute To Remain was a band experimenting but not really solidfying their sound. The first half of this album is more like their recent material, but written so much better. The latter half of the album falls into what you would have heard on Whoracle, Colony, and Clayman which is my favorite era of the band. Being an old school fan of In Flames it makes me very happy that this record is as good as it is. It's not their best but its about as good as we can expect out of them. There still is some clean vocals but theyre done well. The melodic riffing is back and the soloing is back. There's really only two bad songs on the entire album and those would be "Scream" and Vaccuum" both of which I found to be really dull (they sound like Soundtrack To Your Escape b-sides). Past that, everything else is In Flames in top form. My favorite tracks would be Vanishing Light, Pacing Death's Trail, Crawl Through Knives, and the title track. Welcome back to the top.
