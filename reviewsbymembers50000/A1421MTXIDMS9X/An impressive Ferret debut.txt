 I've got to hand it to Ferret this year. Not only have they had a helluva catalog of releases this year (LoveHateHero doesn't count but The Banner, Madball, A Life Once Lost, Boys Night Out, and the mighty Every Time I Die record this next week which is amazing), they were also the main proprietors of The Sounds Of The Underground tour and while their pals in Trustkill seem to be taking a swerve off the deep end, Ferret chugs along putting out excellent, aggressive releases that bare the independent aesthetic and attitude and enjoy mainstream success at the same time. Needless to say, Carl Severson generally knows how to pick 'em.   The Banner isn't groundbreaking or technically impressive but for  what they lack in those areas they make up for in sheer aggressiveness and downright fun songs to listen to. The Banner is to hardcore as Summers End is to metal and The Misfits are to punk and what The Banner do best is take a traditional hardcore sound and mesh it together with some darker imagery and dabble in some quirky lead guitar work with a few scattered breakdowns and hardcore singalongs. Their entirely comfortable in their songwriting as they are just as content with writing a minute and a half track as they are a six minute track. Unlike a lot of metal and hardcore thats coming out, the record sounds genuinely pissed off and while there's a few parts that could of been chopped off from the record (such as the instrumentals), there's not much to complain about here. Give this band a few tours and people will be all over this band.
