 theres not much to say here. the only reason this ever saw the light of day was because tommy is in between the buried and me. i guarantee you not a single label, independent or major, would have touched this project without a name behind it to sell it--its that bad. the lyrics are horrrible, the music is simplistic, and victory is probably laughing all the way to bank. i love between the buried and me but seriously avoid this record. by the way, if you haven't figured it out by now you probably never will, but don't EVER take comparisons of musicians based on the word of the record label. this is called marketing, its how they dupe easily impressionable people into buying records based on your taste. on top of that, victory records is the most aggressive label ever when it comes to laying claims such as those. not to mention, they claimed to have released the hardcore record of the year (comeback kid), the album to put metallica and pantera to rest (a perfect murder), the most anticipated sophomore album ever (silverstein), and the album of the decade (darkest hour). those records may actually be good (sans silverstein), but how silly are those claims? wisen up a little bit otherwise you'll be like the rest of the people who bought a giles album.
