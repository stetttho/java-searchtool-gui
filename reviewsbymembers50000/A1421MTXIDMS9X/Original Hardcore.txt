 I won't bother with coming up with some sort of witty writeup here. I'll just say it, this band is so good. Deathwish Inc. is slowly becoming one of my favorite labels ever and their doing nothing to deter me with releases like this. This is freshest, most unique sounding hardcore record I've heard in years. The only detractor is it is short, but what hardcore record usually isn't short?  I'm not even sure how to describe their sound other then that their is not a single hardcore band out there that comes close to sounding like Modern Life Is War--lyrically, musically, conceptually, everything. If Comeback Kid, Rise Against (minus the clean vocals), and Bane were thrown into a blender you might begin to get a good idea of what MLIW is like. This is definetly a worthy purchase and the best hardcore record to come out this year.
