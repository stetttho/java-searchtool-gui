 Intitially, I didn't like this album. I've been a fan of this band for a long time dating back to Reject The Sickness and Determination and I initially felt it was an even bigger departure than Gone Forever was. But the reason I was having a hard time getting into this was because its just flat out a much more challenging listen than Gone Forever was, for example. Where Gone Forever was very much a metalcore album, IV: COT is traditional metal album with intricate song structures witha strong emphasis on thrash metal, and like a lot of older metal albums, its a concept album so the songs all correlate with each other into unifying theme. I still have a few gripes with the album despite the fact that I enjoy it much more more than I initially did. I don't particularly care for the route taken with the clean vocals. A lot of times they just feel out of place except for on "To The Fallen Hero." Riff wise, theres a few tracks that just don't do anything for me and are fairly standard  sounding (see "Divinity" and the title track). The acoustic/instrumental track "Welcome To The Apocalypse" that leads into the title track essentially serves absolutely no purpose. However, past that theirs a lot of good to talk about. The concept of the album is original, a lot of the other tracks are just great and show how far above and beyond GF is when it comes to songwriting than their peers (in fact, the majority of the songs are 4 plus minutes with a few that surpass 6 minutes) whereas Gone Forever felt extremely short. The lead guitar work feels much more natural this time around and much more well placed. This is an album that can appeal to the old school metal fan as easily as it can to kids newer to metal and is a worthy 05 purchase.
