 Embrace The End blew me away. Featuring members of Killing The Dream and First Blood (Deathwish Inc. bands), Embrace The End sounds nothing like you'd expect them to given the traditional hardcore sound of the aformentioned bands, but this album falls somewhere in between Despised Icon, Animosity, The Taste Of Blood, and Through The Eyes Of The Dead. It doesn't really feel like a metalcore record at all, with the exception of the breakdowns. Everything else feels very tech/grind with a hint of melody thrown in for good measure. The drumming is absolutely phenomenonal, so much so in fact that this was really the first time I've been impressed with drum work since hearing Brann Dailor of Mastodon. The guitar work flys at a 100 MPH with lots of intricate riffs...sometimes technical, sometimes melodic, but never boring. There are a few generic breakdowns thrown in and it's really the closest this record ever comes to sounding like metalcore, in my opinion. Vocally, the album is pretty impressive. No clean vocals here kiddies, sorry. Lots of screeches, growls, and gutterals. Overall, a very good record and definetly a worthy purchase. And if you haven't heard Killing The Dream, be sure to check them out as well.
