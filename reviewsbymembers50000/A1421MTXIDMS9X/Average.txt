 Theirs not much to say than hasn't already been said other than that this album is not bad, however, its entirely forgettable by the mainstream industry standard and unfortunetly this will most likely be the album that buries A Static Lullaby from ever hoping for any other mainstream success and I'm sure that they've learned what a difficult transition it is to make coming from an indie. Unfortunetly, they like many other other bands who jump from an indie to a major made the all to common mistake of messing with their sound far to much than needed be, whether this was at the hands of the label, producer, or simply the band themselves is anyone's guess. Essentially, the aggression once displayed by A Static Lullably is entirely gone for a more substandard rock n' roll with an emo edge sound.   Probably the most exciting moment of the entire album is the new version of an old track(Radio Flyers Last Journey) which in a lot of way speaks volume about the new material that never really hits quite home EXCEPT on "Calmer Than You Are" which is probably one of the coolest tracks released this year. Everything else just feels fairly disjointed and rushed. It's not bad per say, but this will be that record that hits the bargain bin long before their previous album ever will. Theirs just nothing here that will keep the mainstream crowd (which this album trys so hard to appeal to) keep coming back and they've likely abandonded a lot of their original fans by making such a drastic change to their sound. Will they recover from it? That remains to be seen.
