 A couple things are worth mentioning here. Number 1, Trustkill generally had an awful year. 6 records and 3 of them were complete and total busts (those busts being Fight Paris, Bedlight For Blueeyes, and Bullet For My Valentine). Thankfully, Open Hand, Throwdown, and Most Precious Blood all delivered.  Number 2, A few years ago, this may not have felt as original as it does now due to the fact that independent music is basically oversatured with metalcore bands doing the swedish metal thing, so Merciless actually feels very refreshing with its more traditional hardcore sound.   Number 3, Rob Fusco finally has impressed me as a vocalist. He has this ability to stretch and echo his voice unlike I've heard any other singer do and as a whole, Merciless is in fact the best album MPB has ever released. There's a few scattered breakdowns, but generally this album flys at a breakneck speed. Shark Ethic is probably the best, most epic sounding song they've ever written. They do experiment a little bit with some different styled riffing and some short leads, but nothing to drastic. It's only there to pepper the songs with some variance. There's a lot of use of samples as well. Sales figures on this album were not looking to good last I saw, but this should be checked out if you want to have your faith restored at all in Trustkill and to show Josh TK and the rest of his staff that we don't want this other garbage they seem hellbent on releasing. Call me an elitist but I miss the old days of hardcore and MPB brings me back to those days.
