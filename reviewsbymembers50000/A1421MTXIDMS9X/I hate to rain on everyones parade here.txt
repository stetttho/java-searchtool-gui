 I hate to rain on everyones parade here but this band and album is not good. Before you automatically disregard this review maybe you should read what a person with a different opinion has to say. Yeah, they have the technical ability and yeah, its well produced (actually, its probably overproduced) but everything else about this band is such a sham from their cocky, holier-than-thou attitudes (these ex-nu metal kids actually claimed their the next Metallica which is just hilarious and sad all at the same time) to their cliched songwriting and silly image. Its very sad that most people are unable to realize what bands will be hitting the bargain bin sooner than later but B4MV is one of those bands, maybe not immediately, but it will happen.  The songwriting is beyond predictable and cookie cutter, the lyrics are cheesy, and basically you have a record that is for people who don't wish to be challenged or moved by the music they listen to. Everything is so formulaic here that it lacks any passion, heart, or real emotion. I think I heard Killswitch Engage, Atreyu and Trivium write this record over the course of the last few years.  These guys are coming in on the trail end of whats left of the world of metalcore and I've heard about 50 records that came before this written by other bands over the last 5 years and they all did it a 100x better. This is just milking the cash cow and it was absolutely a genius move on Sony's part to stick these guys on Trustkill in the US so they can have some "scene credit." Stop listening to this stuff and go pick up an At The Gates album  and see where the majority of this beaten-to-death sound came from(sans the unbelievably annoying and whiny singing). You'll thank me for it later.
