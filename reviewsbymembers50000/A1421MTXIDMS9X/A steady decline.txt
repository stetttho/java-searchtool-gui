 Scars Of Tomorrow seem to be on a pretty steady decline. Their early albums were decent, but by no means groundbreaking. Their two Victory releases are anything but memorable. There's nothing here at all to really get excited about and I quite frankly question how much longer this band is going to be around. The production is pretty substandard (geez Victory open up your wallets a little more for your bands that don't sound like Hawthorne Heights or Taking Back Sunday) but thats not even really the major issue. The songs just aren't that good. Substandard metalcore, nothing more nothing less--not even on a technical level are these songs impressive. Completely forgettable which is unfortunate because they're a nice group of guys. Oh well.
