 I'll give it two stars for technicality, which is about all this band has going for them. Their songs missed the boat (literally, since their from the UK) by about 5 yrs. when this actually sounded original. Unfortunetly for them, everything passed their own technical abilities is entirely cliched and beyond trendy. Their name, Bullet For My Valentine? Song titles...Hand Of Blood? What does that mean? Cries In Vain? If you dig the likes of Atreyu, old Avenged Sevenfold, and old Funeral For A Friend minus the creativity and substance you'll love this because its chocked full of breakdowns, pinch harmonics, screaming, clean singing, solos, etc.  I'd venture to guess however the two reasons were seeing this band imported into the USA is due to Ferret's bringing over of Funeral For A Friend (now signed to major label Atlantic) which proved to be tremendously successful and the biggest reason of course (if my memory serves me correct) Sony was/is Bullet For My Valentine's UK label/distributor who owns Red Distribution which just so happens to be Trustkill's distributor and it never hurts to break a band through in the US then by putting them on a label that'll give them some "scene credit," does it? You'll sell more records that way. Who pulled those strings? This one's for the scenesters. Eat it up.
