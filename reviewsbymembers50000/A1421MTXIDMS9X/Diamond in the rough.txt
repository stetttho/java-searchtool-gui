 I don't think anyone needs to tell you by now that the screamo/post-hardcore genre has pretty much ran its course. Major record labels have pretty much flooded the industry with so many of these bands it's almost difficult to figure out who the hell is who. When I first heard As Cities Burn, I pretty much wrote them off as being dime a dozen band but upon further inspection this band is much more of a diamond in the rough.   As Cities Burn plays post-hardcore the way it should be: with aggression and passion. But what really sets As Cities Burn apart from the others is their ability to fuse subtle uses of ambience and more spacey rock (think Cave In or Codeseven). There's a few whinier parts that sound alot like Underoath (see Bloodsucker Pt. II) but those moments are few and far between. In general this album is pretty unique. The production is dense and the guitar work is very jarring (lots of stopping and starting riffs) so its almost a claustrophobic listen but this style of guitar work really adds intensity to the songs (see Admission: Regret and One: Twenty Seven).   The album tends to drag a little bit here and there and sometimes feels a little to self indulgent, but the point is that for a debut album, this is damn good. I look forward to hearing what they'll be doing in the future because the sky is the limit for them.
