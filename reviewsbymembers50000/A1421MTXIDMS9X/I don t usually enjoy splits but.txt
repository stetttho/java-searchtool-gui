 I don't usually enjoy splits but I'll make an exception here as its as this is better than most.   The Knife Trade probably should get the nod for the coolest intro track ever for the opener on their half of the album. In all honestly though, The Knife Trade really aren't anything you haven't heard before but for what they do, they do very well. The guitar work is impressive and I love the arpeggio sweeps and the dabbling in what sounds like some keyboard/synth work but I think the The Knife Trade would be much better off avoiding the clean vocals that they used in a few of the tracks. They just don't fit. Highlight track for The Knife Trade's half of the split would be "Off With Their Heads."   Through The Eyes Of The Dead, who recently inked a deal with Prosthetic Records, have become a pretty mighty force in the independent music scene and they don't even have a proper full length out yet, a testament probably to where this band is going in the near future. Nevertheless, it appears that TTEOTD are experimenting more with their death metal influence more than anything here. The material is far more technical than that of their "Scars Of Ages" EP and the drumming is just flat out awesome. They still like to use their samples as we've got a clip from "From Hell" and I believe "American Psycho" as the other. I still can't help but think that TTEOTD are probably holding back some better material for their full length rather than unleashing it on the split though. Sounds like a warm up to me. "Abyssal Creation" serves as the highlight track on TTEOTD's half of the release.
