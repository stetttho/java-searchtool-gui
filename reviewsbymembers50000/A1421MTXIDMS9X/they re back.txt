 This band has been around forever and this is only their third full length. Despite the fact that this band will probably get shafted on the promotional aspect of this album and the production is anything but stellar, this still stands taller than a fairshare of hardcore records out there. It's far from the most unique thing you're going to hear, but if you're just looking for an album thats a real hardcore record this is for you. The guitar solos are fantastic, the riffing is fast, and the vocals (as always) sound legitimately pissed off.
