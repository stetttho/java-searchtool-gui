 This is a very well-written intro to UML.  The book is concise, without any fluff, and immediately useful.  If you want to learn UML and don't want to yawn through the 400+ page spec or lug around some oveweight, over-appendixed book, I strongly suggest checking this one out.  The diagrams are simple and clear.  The examples make sense.  While I didn't really take any of the short quizzes after each section, in retrospect I think they can be helpful for some.  As far as "bad", there really isn't any. For experienced developers new to UML, this book also goes nicely with "Agile Modeling".
