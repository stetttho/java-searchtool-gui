 This is an amazingly thorough account of the RJR/Nabisco LBO story of the late 80s.  It does a good job of noting the influence of junk bonds, the pervasive greed in the culture of wall street, and the complex wranglings associated with a buyout.  The book is exceptionally readable. My main criticisms are (1) it is too thorough: it is easy to tire of the endless discussions-of-only-minor-substance between some of the parties; many of these conversations sound the same and it quickly becomes something one would rather skim over and (2) the book, while providing some basic education on LBOs, doesn't address some of the details as well as it could.  For example, there is no detailed explanation of how junk bonds work or what rules goven the ownership of public or private companies.  I had to turn elsewhere for such info and I think that the authors could easily complement what they already have with such material. Nonetheless, if there is one book about Wall St in the mid/late 80s you should read, it should be this one.
