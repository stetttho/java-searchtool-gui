 This grater is definitely the best I've owned.   Like everyone else, I spent years using both the clunky tripod style grater and older single plane graters.  As other reviewers have noted, the tripod model frequently leads to injury and is difficult to clean.  The older single plane graters are okay, but you end up having to move what you're grating and not the grater.  As a result, I would sometimes "break" hard cheeses in half by applying too much strength. In contrast, the Microplane grater is easy to use, extremely easy to clean, and produces great results.  With very little strength, you can grate by moving the grater - and not what you're grating.  This produces less mess and eliminates the chance that things like cheese will break in half. Finally, the results are very nice.  Grating parmesean produces very light, elegant shavings of cheese, making your dishes look great.
