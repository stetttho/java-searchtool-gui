 I am very choosy when it comes to selecting a computer book. My experience in browsing through several in bookstores is that they are often overly long (sometimes over 1000 pages) and contain appendices or API references that could easily be found online.  What a waste. Here is a clear cut example of just how good a succint book on programming can be.  Instead of reviewing C++ and sticking in a huge API reference, the author assumes knowledge of C++ and stays on track with one concise example after the next of how to improve your code. Nearly all of the examples are critically important -- even the borderline ones are still good and insightful. Someone else said that development managers should make sure that their coders read this book.  I definitely agree.  Once everyone is on the same page with techniques like this -- at the  beginning of a project -- you have a great head start.
