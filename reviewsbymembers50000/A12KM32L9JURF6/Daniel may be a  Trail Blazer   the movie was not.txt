 The technical part of this review refers to the Brentwood Home Video or BCI Eclipse version. Republic Pictures was nearing the end of its career releasing B pictures mostly westerns, crime stories and those Bowery Boys pics when this one came around. Released in a process called TruColor, the films colors haven't aged well (at least in this transfer). But it doesn't detract that much from this fast moving story starring Bruce Bennett (Herman Brix, I gotta research and find out why he changed his name) as the namesake of the picture and Lon Chaney, Jr. as the Indian chief whom Daniel must eventually make peace with.  It's a story filled with fights, morality, romance and even song from country crooner Faron Young. Released in 1956, I'm sure to capitalize on the Davy Crockett craze at the time, this low budget story of building the new frontier is fine for the family with some mild violence and at 76 minutes is perfect viewing for a rainy day.  Brentwood/BCI put in their usual extras, six chapter stops, a DVD dictionary, trivia game and a short subject (Hal Roach's "Little Rascals"). This movie is also in a 10 pack of westerns at about triple the price for this one film from Brentwood Home Video called "The Wild West" and is available from Amazon.com.
