 Were it not for fate having me win this CD, I probably wouldn't have given much thought to this unique concept album. This was the first time I had listened to The Flaming Lips. What was remarkable after I listened to it was that the band came from that endless supply of artists from Oklahoma?  While the concept album doesn't emerge as much as it did in the 70's, it takes some guts to try to record a complete CD and keep someone's attention for an hour. They partially succeed at the endeavor. There are a couple of spots where it bottoms out, but most of the CD treads water successfully.  "Yoshimi Battles The Pink Robots, Part 1", "Are You A Hypnotist" and "Do You Realize??" are superb in their execution, but some of the others just don't feel complete to me. Considering it took two years! To record, the CD should have flowed better. A couple of places it just feels choppy. The only other drawback for me was the use of electronic instruments, sometimes it just overwhelmed me. Overall, a decent release in the new century, it still won't replace Pink Floyd's "Dark Side of The Moon", but it could give Styx' "Kilroy Was Here" (another robot theme concept album) a run for the money. I'll keep listening!
