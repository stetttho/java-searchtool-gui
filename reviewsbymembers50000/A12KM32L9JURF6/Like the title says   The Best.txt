 I don't go handing out 5 stars easily, especially to an album that is lacking any sort of liner notes or chart information. The packaging is skimpy, the tracks aren't in chronological order, the sound quality isn't the best and the versions aren't the full-length album versions. So why 5 stars????  If you're a fan of pop/rock music from this era, you get twenty of twenty-one top 40 hits from the band from Los Angeles. Included are three number 1's and eight top 10's. All this from five years of musical output. Not known for their writing skills, this group helped make household names out of composers named Laura Nyro, Nilsson, Randy Newman and Leo Sayer. The compilation starts out with the phenomenon called "Joy To The World" which stayed at number 1 for six weeks and ends appropriately with "Celebrate". That's what Three Dog Night's music says to me. We're all here on this planet; let's have a little fun while we're here.  For the casual listener or the big fan, this 20-track compilation has all the hits with no filler and despite the negatives I stated at the beginning of the review, deserves a place in your CD collection.
