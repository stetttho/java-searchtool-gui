 Long before the Judith Rossner novel and the movie starring Diane Keaton "Looking for Mr. Goodbar", came this candy bar from Hershey. If the main character in the book and movie was looking for satisfaction, she could have saved herself a lot of grief and strife by going to the local corner store instead of the dark and seamy world of bars and discos. As dark as this 70's piece of literature was, the candy bar is as bright and beautiful. Looking for this Mr. Goodbar is very easy. Besides being found here at Amazon.com, its bright yellow wrapper with red lettering stands out easily on the candy rack. But it's what's under the colorful wrapper and bright aluminum inner wrapper that make a Mr. Goodbar a Mr. Goodbar. It's simplicity! There are no many combinations of flavors. No nougat. No swirling of ingredients. Just creamy Hershey milk chocolate and peanuts. Simple!  Easy to enjoy anywhere. Even at the movies. I just wouldn't eat one while watching "Looking For Mr. Goodbar".
