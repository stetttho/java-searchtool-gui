 The technical part of this review refers to the Brentwood Home Video or BCI Eclipse release of this film. "The Gunfighters" is a passable western set in Wyoming, but Alberta, Canada fills in quite nicely for the scenery. A Canadian film, which ends making the viewer believe it was a pilot for a series that never materialized. It's fine for the family with mild violence and no profanities.  George Kennedy plays the heavy in this story of three brothers who battle land baron Kennedy. The brothers have enough of waiting for the law (who is under Kennedy's control) to help them and take matters into their own hands. Filled with typical clichs, I'm sure you'll figure out the ending before the movie gets you there; still it's a pleasant diversion especially for the low price. As with many of Brentwood Home Videos, this one has a cartoon (from Max Fleischer) and there are 8 chapter stops for easy selection. The transfer is excellent (for a budget release), looking like it almost came from a master source - almost. This movie is also in a 10 pack of westerns at about triple the price for this one film from Brentwood Home Video called "The Wild West" and is available from Amazon.com.
