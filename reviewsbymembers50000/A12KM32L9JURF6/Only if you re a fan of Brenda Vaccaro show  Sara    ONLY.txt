 The technical part of this review refers to the Brentwood Home Video or BCI Eclipse version. A two hour TV movie that was the pilot of the CBS show "Sara" from 1976. (Does anyone remember the Geena Davis sitcom from the 80's on NBC with the same name?) Brenda Vaccarro stars as Sara a teacher from Philadelphia who comes out west to Independence, Colorado apparently to tame it. While Ms. Vaccarro is capable in the role, little else is memorable. Maybe this one line from the show where a man just gets into town and says "I can't remember ever being more bored or more uncomfortable." OK, it's not that bad, but there was a reason the show lasted 13 episodes (a short run for a network show in the 70's). Think "Harper Valley P.T.A"/"Little House On The Prairie"/"Maude" and you have Sara. The transfer is one of the worse I've seen from Brentwood/BCI. Taken from a tape and not film, the picture is grainy and of poor quality. The sound is worse! This movie was recorded over something else. How do I know? At times, there's another soundtrack trying to get through. I wonder what it was, because this show wasn't worth recording. Don't get me wrong, I think every show should be saved, I just wish I was watching something else.  This movie is also in a 10 pack of westerns at about triple the price for this one film from Brentwood Home Video called "The Wild West" and is available from Amazon.com.
