 The technical part of this review refers to the Brentwood Home Video or BCI Eclipse version. "The New Daughters of Joshua Cabe" is from the Aaron Spelling factory of made for TV movies from the early 1970's. This film is a sequel to "The Daughters of Joshua Cabe" another made for TV movie. In the first film Buddy Ebsen did an admirable job of turning the script into an amusing outing. The same cannot be said of this film which has John McIntire taking over the role as head of the family Joshua Cabe. The three "daughters" (ladies Joshua has rescued from the seamier side of life) are played by unknowns from the Spelling stable. The only saving grace is casting Jack Elam in the role of Bitterroot, their neighbor.  When an evil land baron makes the Cabes life miserable and Joshua is wrongfully imprisoned, it's up to the daughters and Bitterroot to rescue him. Ho-hum.  While the film is a harmless piece of fluff suitable for the whole family, it's best to avoid it, as it offers nothing new, cheaply filmed and at times, just plain boring. The transfer was made from a print which had seen better days. The right side of the screen at times was much darker than the left and the middle. Brentwood/BCI does feature their usual extras. Six chapter stops, a DVD dictionary, trivia game and a Hal Roach "Little Rascals" short. This movie is also in a 10 pack of westerns at about triple the price for this one film from Brentwood Home Video called "The Wild West" and is available from Amazon.com.
