 OK, so many opinions on this CD. And ALL of them are right, sort of. Making sense? No. How bizarre. Lemme see if I can sort this out. OMC has only released the one CD. And it's available used for the closest price to free. Yet it's almost indispensable!? How bizarre. I bought it new at a closeout price from one of the biggie mail order companies. Did I feel rooked? No. If I had paid full price, would I have felt cheated? Probably. Like many others, I had only heard the song "How Bizarre". A true 90's one hit wonder. I still enjoy it when I hear it, but, this CD has many other joys waiting to be discovered. "Right On" and "Pour Out Your Eyes" among them.  One look at the credits and you realize that OMC would not exist without one Pauly Fuemana. Take Ray Romano, ship him off to New Zealand and have him write music instead of comedy and you might have Pauly. The lyrics are witty, yet if you turned your back on them, they just might bite you on the behind. The instrumentation is tight, yet, just a bit off.  As far as Pauly's vocals, um, I guess I'm just not used to New Zealanders rapping. But it's much more refreshing than anything Vanilla Ice ever did.  In other reviews, the other two songs that are talked about the most are "She Loves Italian" which many disliked, well, I liked the song. And as far as Randy Newman's "I Love LA", while most liked it, I didn't think it had anything new to offer.  Summary, a real mixed bag. I'd recommend buying it, used or at a discounted price. You're either going to love it or hate it. Perhaps, this will be the most wishy-washy review I've ever done. Guess that's how this CD makes me feel.
