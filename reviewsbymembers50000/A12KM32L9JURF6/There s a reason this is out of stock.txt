 It's the mid 90's. Ric Ocasek and "The Cars" have long since disbanded. There's nothing new for Ric to say. Full of production thing-a-ma-jigs and whirly-gadgets and vocal alterations.  Just a jumbled mess. OK, there's a couple cuts that make the grade. And, this might have broke the top 40....in 1982. In fact, when I listen to the cut "Hopped Up", I can almost see the group Flock of Seagulls performing it. For Cars/Ric Ocasek completists only.
