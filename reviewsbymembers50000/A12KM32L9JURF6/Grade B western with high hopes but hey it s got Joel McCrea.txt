 The technical part of this review refers to the Brentwood Home Video or BCI release of this film.  "Cry Blood, Apache" was made in 1970 when restrictions on what could be shown on the screen were loosened somewhat. And the results are a mish mash. Joel McCrea who did many fine films is used to open and close the story as the older version of the movies star Jody McCrea (Joel's son). The younger McCrea also produced the film which may be why the elder agreed to appear in it. The story is of the more seedier side of the white man taking over the old west stopping at nothing to achieve their goals. This includes drunkenness, raping, pillaging and killing as we see in the opening act of the film. One young woman survives this initial incident and agrees to show the band of men where some gold is located. Off they go, followed by the girl's brother who wants to exact revenge on the group and rescue his sister.  But "Cry Blood, Apache" is not just a story about greed and life in the old west. It's also a budding love story between our young Apache woman and the younger McCrea. It's the old captor/captive love story that plays out between the films climax between McCrea and the woman's brother. Filmed in Arizona and at Sequoia National Forest, the scenery is delightful. Quite light on dialogue, the film does hold the interest of the viewer as it moves at a fairly rapid pace. But have no doubt, it's a violent (for the times) movie, that would have looked at home at a drive-in for a B feature. The print used for the transfer is fairly decent, not too many pops and scratches, although the color is a bit washed. Not a bad film for the money. But! If you are in to cheap entertainment and want some bang for your buck, this film is available from the same company in a 10 pack of westerns called "The Wild West" , which will give you hours of entertainment for a low price ...
