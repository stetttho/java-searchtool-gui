 The technical aspects of this review refers to the PMB version.  Hope, Crosby and Lamour. Do I need to say more? Probably not. It's another of their "Road" pictures and the ONLY one to be filmed in color. It's lots of fun. It's got some good cameos by other stars of the day. It's got the corny jokes and sight gags. It's got songs by all three leads. It's got dances including a water dance by Dorothy Lamour that is um, well provocative for the day. It's not the best "Road" picture (Morrocco is still tops), but definitely a pleasant way to spend 90 minutes. If you're a fan of the stars or of this era of pictures, you can't go wrong. Especially with this edition of the film.   You can buy products of PMB at a national retail chain where everything is only a dollar, or you can purchase it here at good ol' Ammy. Why so inexpensive? This Paramount film has fallen into the public domain where anyone (even YOU!) can legally make copies and distribute this film. Print of this Technicolor film is actually quite good. Of course this is nothing from the vault, but it's glitch free. Splices and visual impurities are practically non-existent which is very good. An excellent buy for the money.
