 The technical part of this review refers to the Brentwood Home Video or BCI Eclipse version. A western set in Africa with Vincent Price! What more could you ask for? In reality, you could ask for a bit more. Mr. Price plays a prospector who lives with his granddaughter and happens to have a ton o' gold hidden away. Along come the bad men who want to take the gold and the girl away. Mr. Price is the cunning wily old codger you'd expect him to be. After seeing him in almost exclusively horror fare, it was a pleasure to see him tackle this role. And I bet HE had a good time with it. It shows! A routine western made better with the African location. The print used was not too bad. Scratches, splices, etc. were minimal. The color by DeLuxe has faded and can be quite noticeable in indoor settings, but not enough to detract from the story. 20th Century Fox originally released this picture, which was 105 minutes in length by all sources I could find. Some company called Rawhide Home Video must have bought the rights, took off the 20th Century Fox logo and put some cheap title card on the beginning. In the process, they must have chopped 12 minutes out of it somewhere. To be honest, I don't know where the editing took place. With such an unknown feature, this will probably be the only chance to see this movie. I wouldn't look for Fox to release a remastered, uncut version any time soon. Brentwood/BCI does their usual job with features of 6 chapter stops, a Max Fleischer cartoon and trivia game. A decent transfer for the price. This movie is also in a 10 pack of westerns at about triple the price for this one film from Brentwood Home Video called "The Wild West" and is available from Amazon.com.
