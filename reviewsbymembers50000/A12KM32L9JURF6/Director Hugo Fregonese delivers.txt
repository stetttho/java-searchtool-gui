 The technical part of this review refers to the Brentwood Home Video or BCI Eclipse version. Mutiny on the Argentine plains. Fort commander Robert Taylor tries to stop the hemorrhaging of his squad to a deserter gone bad and mad! How to keep the boys at home in the fort? Bring in the women. I'm sure some women's groups would have a field day with this picture. It's a unique story where love and lust turn into survival in a harsh environment. Director Hugo Fregonese has delivered a Spanish film that is interesting and moves at quite a good pace. The print used is fairly decent for this budget release. A film that was definitely widescreen shot in 70mm, it suffers in places in this pan-and-scan version. Still worth a look. Brentwood/BCI put in 6 chapter stops, a trivia game and a Casper the Friendly Ghost cartoon. So you can't go wrong. This movie is also in a 10 pack of westerns at about triple the price for this one film from Brentwood Home Video called "The Wild West" and is available from Amazon.com.
