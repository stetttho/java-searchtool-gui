 I kept looking at this CD as I went by the discount rack. I've had a KC and The Sunshine Band CD for ages and I've always wanted the two major hits by Silver Convention ("Fly Robin Fly" and "Get Up And Boogie") and they were on this CD. Well, time kept passing and the CD kept sitting on the shelf. So I grabbed it and went out to the truck and put it in the player. Looking at the CD cover information, I noticed the tracks were licensed from another company. Hmmm, then the first notes of "Get Down Tonight" started......re-record. Dang! Skimmed through the rest of the KC tracks, yep, re-records. OK, jump to track six and Silver Convention. I didn't feel totally ripped off. These were the original recordings and presented with good fidelity.  If you are buying this CD for both groups and you know the difference between the originals and re-records, you will be sorely disappointed. If, like me, you want those two Silver Convention songs, then go for it, although the price point may be a little steep for these two great songs, which are full length by the way and not edited down to single length. "Fly" clocks in at 7:44 and "Boogie" at 7:51.
