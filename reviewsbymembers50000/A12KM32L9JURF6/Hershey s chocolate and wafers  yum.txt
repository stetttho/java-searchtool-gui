 For a mass produced candy bar, Kit Kat is one of my favorites. Hershey's milk chocolate envelopes crisp wafers for a pleasing taste and texture. The standard bar is divided into 4 pieces that break apart with relative ease, consistently even. Breaking it apart makes it easy to share with someone special, or enjoy all four pieces for yourself. Another winner from Hershey, Pennsylvania.
