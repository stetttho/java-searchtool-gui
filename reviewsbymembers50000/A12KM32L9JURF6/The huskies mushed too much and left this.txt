 Yi-yi-yi-yi-yi. I'm a good fan of classic TV and I can put up with a lot from public domain material with the scratches and pops and splices, etc. But this DVD which features 3 episodes from 1956 which are in color by the way, "One Bean Too Many", "Phantom of Phoenixville" and "Trapped" just tested my patience.   In the first episode the colors are melded together and the upper left half of the screen is just dark with a red color. The second episode was the best looking and the third episode looked like a lens wasn't cleaned with all sorts of spots everywhere. I'm lucky I didn't pay much for it as I bought it at a retail outlet where everything is a buck. This series starring Richard Simmons, (no, not that Richard Simmons) along with his horse Rex and dog Yukon King had the job of patroling the northwest Yukon of Canada.   Hopefully, someone will someday do a decent job of restoration and releasing this series. Until then, skip the nostalgia on this one. It just isn't worth it. :(
