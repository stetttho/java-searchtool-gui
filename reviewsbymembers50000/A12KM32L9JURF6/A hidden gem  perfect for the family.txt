 This movie made in 1949 (not 1933) but does take place in 1933 is a big adventure filmed in Technicolor. The story is on a par with a Disney wilderness adventure and shows Forrest Tucker in a good starring role as the head of the family of one of the feuding families.   A love story, suspense, action and beautiful scenery is diluted by the transfer from this budget release from Digiview. It actually looks like it was recorded from a VHS copy .... at slow speed! Maybe this hidden gem by director Phil Karlson will get a more respectable treatment. But for now, this is the only available release.
