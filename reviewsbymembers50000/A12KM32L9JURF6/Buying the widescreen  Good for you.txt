 Do I have to tell you about the movie? One of AFI's best comedies of all time. It's crude, rude, and outrageously funny. It launched the careers of many of today's good actors. It was the first of many vehicles from National Lampoon. It brought many catch phrases to the lexicon of America.  What I will tell you about is the extras. First is a new music video of "Shout" by the group MxPx. It adds nothing new to the "Animal House" world. If you want to hear a good version, skip to the chapter in the movie where Otis Day and The Knights do "Shout". Second, the "Did You Know That?" feature, which is a "Pop-Up" feature, you can switch off and on during the movie with facts about the original production of the film. Such as Meatloaf was considered to play the part of Bluto Blutarsky if John Belushi turned it down. While the facts are items for the most part I didn't know, they don't come fast enough during the movie. I'm one of those who want those facts to appear every five seconds, not every one to three minutes. "Where Are They Now?" a documentary which lasts for approximately 18 minutes puts members of the cast into what they are doing now via the final moments of the film, which stated what the characters were doing. It's fun, not groundbreaking, but interesting to see the cast today. "The Yearbook: An Animal House Reunion" brings together those behind the scenes, Matty Simmons, Harold Ramis and others; and the cast with info on how the movie was made. Approximately 45 minutes, it's informative, if you're a fan of the movie; but may be a bit too long, if you're a casual observer. The picture quality and the sound are outstanding, considering it's a 25 year old movie, but this package would have been a five star package if the movie had a commentary track by director John Landis or others. It has none. Five stars for the movie and transfer and the widescreen edition. Four stars for the extras. Since Amazon won't allow  stars, I'll give it 5.
