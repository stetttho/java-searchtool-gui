  From 1988 and broadcast just once, comes this gem from the mind of Paul Reubens. Released in 2004 along with the rest of the "Pee Wee's Playhouse" output, this stand alone special has been a yearly tradition in our household. Now we can retire our videotape for the DVD format.   The special features are limited, only two, and they are both commentaries. The first one features Paul Reubens, co-writer John Paragon (who also plays Jambi) and Lynne Marie Stewart who plays Miss Yvonne, the most beautiful lady in all of Playland. The second commentary features four of the puppeteers who certainly had a lot to do in the special. The insights and tidbits on both of these commentaries are a great bonus.  The show itself is fast paced and gives you a chance to visit with some old friends. Pee Wee's humor may not be for all, but if you enjoyed the series, you will certainly enjoy this special where holiday traditions are examined and lessons of the spirit of giving are learned.   The supporting cast includes members who have gone on to bigger things including Laurence Fishburne as Cowboy Curtis and S. Epatha Merkerson as Reba The Mail Lady (who is now a regular on NBC's "Law and Order" minus the dreadlocks). The guests include Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello, Charo, The Del Rubio Triplets, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Whoopi Goldberg, Magic Johnson, Grace Jones, k.d. lang, Little Richard, Joan Rivers, Dinah Shore and Oprah Winfrey. Stars, music, fun, a great package.  The transfer is fresh from the masters with Dolby Digital sound and is close-captioned. Highly recommended if you want to catch the Christmas spirit.
