 The technical part of this review refers to the Brentwood Home Video or BCI release of this film.  Pulled from the 17 episode ABC series from 1967, "Crazy Horse and Custer: The Untold Story" is a pleasing way to spend 90 minutes if you're a fan of the western genre. We've all heard the story about the battle of the Little Big Horn, but this movie introduces us to the main characters of that battle long before that ill fated meeting. It shows how Lt. Col. George Custer took a rag tag bunch of soldiers and made them into the fine Seventh Cavalry unit they were. It also takes the viewer to the first meeting between Custer and Crazy Horse and how they had to be allies if they were to live to meet later. Starring Wayne Mauder (who?) with Slim Pickens (under utilized) and Michael Dante as Crazy Horse, the cast features Mary Ann Mobley and the venerable Robert F. Simon.  The print featured in this release was bought by a company called Liberty Entertainment who put a title on in the beginning and end and chopped out any reference to 20th Century Fox who originally produced it. The print itself looked like it had been bicycled around and the opening credits just might make you seasick from the motion. The color is fair and once you get into the film the print is not too scratched. Not bad for the price you pay.  This movie besides being available individually is also in a 10 pack called "The Wild West". For about triple the price of this, you can get 10 pretty decent westerns.
