 First I bought the movie, then I bought this album which features 9 classic rock tracks, 3 new rock recordings and one song by Carter Burwell who composed the soundtrack to the film. Three songs featured on the soundtrack including two of the new ones weren't even in the film, but included here.  This soundtrack does what any good soundtrack should do; remind you of scenes of the movie AND stand on its own. The first component it does in spades as the songs put into motion key moments of this fun, romantic, action movie. The album as stand alone does quite well with the themed classic rock, with many tracks not seen on any compilation albums before. The Carter Burwell track doesn't fit with the rest, (but the soundtrack album to the picture, also available on Amazon.com, with the rest of Mr. Burwell's compositions is worth checking out if you're a fan of the soundtrack scoring genre) and Robbie Williams rendition of Queen's "We Are The Champions" is not up to the original. The new pieces by Dan Powell and Third Eye Blind might have made more sense if they had been included in the film. Here, they're just filler. Overall the first nine tracks would be excellent fare for a high voltage party (or a jousting tournament) you may hold.
