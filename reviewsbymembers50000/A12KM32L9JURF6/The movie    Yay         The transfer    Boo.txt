 The technical part of this review refers to the Brentwood Home Video or BCI Eclipse release of this film. As of this writing, the only available release. 4 stars for the movie, 1 star for the transfer to DVD. Forgive me ClintThe good - The story of Fistful of Lead is actually quite good, with a few twists and turns I didnt expect. Hey, even my wife liked this story of Sartana and his bounty hunter who play cat and mouse all through the movie. The stunts are well done, the gunplay is fast and the story moves right along. The bad - Some of the acting is questionable, especially between the American and Italian actors, if a bit more time had been taken, maybe. The ugly - The transfer to DVD is not the worst, but put it this way. Just pretend youre watching the movie on a UHF station overnight. To agree with others, it looks like it was taken from a tape and put on DVD. And if there were ever an argument to release wide screen movies in its original aspect ratio, this movie would make an excellent case. About three minutes into the movie, there is a scene where the camera wants you to believe youre taking the point of view of looking through binoculars. You can see how much of the binoculars are missing. The pan and scan method on this movie is dreadful. Still, for the money, its decent. But if you are a fan of westerns, this movie besides being available individually is also in a 10 pack called The Wild West. For a little more than triple the price of this, you can get 10 pretty decent westerns. You can view this item on Amazon.com ....
