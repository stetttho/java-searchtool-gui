 When I first got this album, it was in a used shop. I knew the hits ("Wonderwall", "Don't Look Back In Anger", and "Champagne Supernova"). I knew the stories about Liam and Noel. What I didn't know was the album.  First listen? Not bad, but of course I was listening for the hits and let the rest pass by.  Second listen? The album as a whole seemed to fit together quite well, thank you. Third listen? This album rocks! When the world looks back in 50 years, "Champagne Supernova" might possibly be the song that would define the 90's.  Ever since, this album while not in the CD player constantly; is enthusiastically received by myself every time I play it. Great for cruising the roads or doing a workout, The Gallagher boys made one heck of a good album. What about the rest of their output? Couldn't tell you. Haven't heard another Oasis album. I'm almost afraid I'd be let down after hearing "(What's The Story) Morning Glory?)
