 After their big stint with stardom in the 60's, this album hit at the beginning of the disco era in 1975, the first time they had a hit on the charts in 7 years. Spurred on by "dance remixes" of "Who Loves You" and "December 1963", the Four Seasons had found a new audience, some who were just toddlers or a gleam in their parent's eye when they started their string of hits in `62.  "Who Loves You" is 8 songs that are hit or miss. Different from earlier Four Seasons albums because of changes in personnel, changing technology, and no song less than 3 minutes long. The voice of Frankie Valli or the carefully crafted harmonies are not as prominent as in earlier recordings, and therefore the songwriting needs to carry this album....but it doesn't. You get the hits "Who Loves You" and "December 1963 (Oh What A Night)" (which was a hit again in 1994, remember?). Other highlights include "Silver Star" (not too many rock and roll songs about the old West, but this one's a keeper), "Mystic Mr. Sam" (could have been written in the late 60's with its subject matter about "Cosmic Christian bands"), and "Harmony Perfect Harmony" (a nice tribute song about the group's golden days). "Emily Salladedanse" is a nice tune, while "Storybook Lovers" is a notch above the album clinker "Slip Away". Essential Four Seasons? Only if you had this one on vinyl or like me on 8-track, and only if you have fond memories of it. Pleasant pop, nothing more, nothing less. "Silver Star" should have been a contender.
