 "The Best of The O'Jays" is an almost best. It's got all of their biggest hits with the exception of their third biggest chart maker..."Use Ta Be My Girl" creates a big hole in this otherwise excellent package from the Epic Legacy series. If you know the music, you won't be disappointed with the rhythms of the O'Jays and the Gamble/Huff production. The songs are full length and not truncated for radio play. The transfers are very good. The accompanying booklet has an essay written by Robert Palmer and the track listing gives chart dates as well as how many weeks charted and peak chart numbers in both the pop and R&B charts.  A good price point CD, but still wish "Use Ta Be My Girl" was on it. Shame on you Epic! Four stars for the music, 2 stars for Epic short-changing us.
