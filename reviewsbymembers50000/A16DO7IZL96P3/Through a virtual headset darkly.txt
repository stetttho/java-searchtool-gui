 I was one of the principals involved in the founding and initial operation of the HIT Lab.  As the HIT Lab's first Associate Director, I organized the Virtual Worlds Consortium, the industry group that underwrote the Lab, and  created the Lab-sponsored industry nexus, the sci.virtual-worlds newsgroup  on USENET.   As I read Fred's book, I constantly found myself scratching  my head and exclaiming, "I don't remember it that way!"  In more  than one case, Fred's recitation of "the facts" was contrary to  the situation as I remembered it. Moreover, Fred gives short shrift to  the vibrant community of virtual-worlds developers, writers, and promoters,  in the U.S. and abroad, who contributed to moving the field ahead.  While I  take great pride in the initial vision espoused by Tom Furness for the HIT  Lab, in fact it was through interorganizational, often national and  international collaboration that true progress was made. Finally,  contrary to Fred's account, (1) the HIT Lab did not engineer SIGGRAPH  choosing me to chair the VR panel at SIGGRAPH 90, (2) I chose the panelists  with great care to balance the concrete with the visionary, (3) the panel  discussion was sensible and not ridiculous, (4) Myron Krueger and I did  *not* get in a fight on stage, and (5) Myron did *not* shove me off the  stage.  He stepped down from the stage at Warren Robinett's urging.  A  small point?  Perhaps, but this incredibly altered history makes me wonder  how much of Fred's remaining reportage is credible. Besides, weren't  there more important things to say about the virtual-worlds movement other  than that it was "populated by crazies" (who were a distinct  minority)?  Fred has missed a great opportunity to track an historical and  cultural turning point in the computer industry.
