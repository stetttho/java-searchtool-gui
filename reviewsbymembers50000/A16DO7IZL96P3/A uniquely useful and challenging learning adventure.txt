 Visual language, combining text and images, has been around for a long time -- but only in the last two decades, with the rise of desktop publishing and design, has it become commonly accessible.  Horn, a pioneer  in the field (and inventor of Information Mapping), wants us to acknowledge  the power inherent in this melange. To communicate his case, Horn uses  visual language.  This makes the book twice as interesting:  you, the  reader, learn about visual language as you experience it.  This book is  full of discoveries and demonstrations.  Begin it on a lazy weekend and you  may not want to stop until you're done. It's challenging that Horn uses  clipart throughout, to make the point that one need not be an artist to  write visual language.  That may be so; but clipart, despite the ingenuity  of its authors, has limitations, especially  conceptual banality.  Horn is  a master; others of us might have more difficulty treating complex issues  with visual language based on clipart. No matter.  One can easily  envision a more subtle and sublime form of visual communication using more  eloquent graphics.  VISUAL LANGUAGE remains fun and informative from  beginning to end.  This book is both a text and a how-to.  Read and apply  it well!
