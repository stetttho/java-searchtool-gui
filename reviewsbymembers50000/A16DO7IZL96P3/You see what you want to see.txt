 Communication between babies and their parents is more complex than Indian sign language.  Parents are often highly delusional in projecting what they want to see and do on their kids.  This is a major case in point.  Our baby had two or three "signs" it used to indicate fear, etc., but quickly she passed on to verbal language.  We spent about two weeks investigating "baby sign language" and realized its futilty.  BTW, we're both child professionals.  Baby signing is akin to mood rings.
