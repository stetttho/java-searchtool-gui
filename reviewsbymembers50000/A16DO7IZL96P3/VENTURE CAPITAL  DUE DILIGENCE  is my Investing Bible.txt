 For me as a professional consultant to startups and early-stage companies -- and a former successful CEO -- this book to be an excellent resource.  I can readily share it with clients because although it's thorough and candid, it's not off-putting with technical jargon. It speaks to you, the reader, directly.  If you're a Founder or CEO of a young company, this book will become your peephole into the hearts and minds of your current and prospective investors.    This book delivers.
