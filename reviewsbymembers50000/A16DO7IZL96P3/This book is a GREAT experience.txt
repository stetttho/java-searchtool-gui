 Transformations are what all of us are looking for:  experiences that change us for the better.  Gilmore and Pine maintain that in the coming century, companies that provide us with transformational experiences will  rule the roost.  Pine and Gilmore explain what it means to systematically  design for experience, when "the customer IS the  product." Disney is their hero, and with good cause:  Disneyland and  Disneyworld continue to raise the bar on entertainment experience. But as  the authors point out, experiences are to be found everywhere -- in  customer service, a TV ad, the way people work together, even a cup of  coffee.  And in the commercial future, experience will be king. The  premise and the execution of THE EXPERIENCE ECONOMY are equally  invigorating.  Pine and Gilmore identify existing examples of experiential  design -- and then they go one better, with prescriptions for how to do it  yourself.  Excellent.  So many authors are content merely to reveal The  Truth.  Pine and Gilmore want you and me to apply their philosophy and  start changing the world.  They additionally apply some moral precepts that  this reader found stirring, to ensure that if change is to come, it will be  positive. THE EXPERIENCE ECONOMY is easy to read but not simplistic and  has just the right amount of tables and charts to support and highlight the  authors' position. Most business books get read only half-way through.   Begin THE EXPERIENCE ECONOMY, and you'll not only read it cover to cover,  you'll carry it with you as a reference.  Everytime you try out something  to buy, in a shop, online, or simply in your head, Pine and Gilmore will be  speaking to you.  Like Jimi Hendrix before you, they'll be asking:   "But are you...experienced?"
