 THE COMING ANARCHY is a must-read for every world citizen. Kaplan is a journalist.  His description of the state of the world is harrowing and accurate.  It is impossible to argue with his thesis, that environmental  exhaustion and resource depletion are the most powerful threats to both  national and global security.  I wish it were easier to close our eyes and  hope that the house of cards stands as long as we do; but Kaplan defeats  this possibility.  We are stuck with our situation and must do our best to  keep our leaky, overcrowded ship afloat. Kaplan should have paid tribute  to Robert Theobald's 1967 classic eco-novela, TEG'S 1994, which presaged  many of Kaplan's observations -- but perhaps it escaped his attention,  being out of print. THE COMING ANARCHY is a surprisingly big book despite  its relatively few pages.
