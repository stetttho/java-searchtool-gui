 The other reviewers have captured the essence of THE GIFT -- itself a gift, from the author to his readers.  It has not lost any relevance since its first appearance in 1977:  gifting is still the most important type of  transaction, more fundamental than marketplace selling and buying. I'm  beginning a book on the gift economy.  THE GIFT is my foundation.  It  boosts me easily into the stratosphere, so strong is Hyde's presentation.   Thank you, Lewis.
