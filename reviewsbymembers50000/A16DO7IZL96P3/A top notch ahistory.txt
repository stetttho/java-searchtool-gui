 This is top-notch work.  The ideas presented in this book are challenging, the presentation clear, and the writing scintillating.  Civilizations are ahistorical; this author gets it right.  Iconoclastic historian Felipe Fernandez-Armesto's purpose is to disavow the use of abstractions -- "historical theory," an oxymoron -- to explain the existence of civilizations.   He categorizes civilizations (a wide open term in common parlance) according to their environments, a novel and sage typology.  But he draws few value judgments:  each civilization has its own premises and style of life, according to which it is on its own terms a success, failure, or simply an experience through which its members must live their lives.  Above all, I came away with an appreciation for the relativism and transciency of civilizations, including my own (North American industrial/imperial/multi-environment).  One can already see the writing on the wall and the budding emergence of a more earth-friendly civilization, still inchoate, struggling to self-recognition -- and one hopes, dominance, before it's too late.  This is an excellent read.  I save a chapter for each new day, it's that yummy.
