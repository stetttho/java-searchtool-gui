 This is truly a fine investigation into the design, construction, and experience of sales environments -- not just in the physical world, but also in the virtual worlds of TV, radio, print media, and the Internet.  Sherry is an anthropologist who, together with the other contributors, paints a complex portrait of what it means to create a sales environment, what it means to experience one, and how the two processes relate.  No marketing ace or designer can afford to do without Sevicescapes!
