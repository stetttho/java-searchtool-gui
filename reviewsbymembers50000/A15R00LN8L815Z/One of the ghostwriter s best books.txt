 This is the first V.C. book I've really enjoyed in a long time. I was afraid this book would be a retelling of Olivia Foxworth's story, or worse, Lillian Cutler. However, this book, and its main character, are very  different from those other stories. Olivia Logan will never win the  "favorite heroine" award, but she may win the "least  victimized" award. This book was much better than the Orphans series.
