 I had hoped this book would be done in alternating points of view from all four girls (like If There Be Thorns). Instead, Brooke is our narrator, and the reader is limited to her perceptions. The other three girls become  typecast by their personalities (the wimp, the brain, the troublemaker) and  we lose the intimacy we had with them in their books.  Also, I hope the  plot was meant to show that runaways are on a one-way street to nowhere,  because that's how I felt while reading it. Not the thrilling finale I was  hoping for.
