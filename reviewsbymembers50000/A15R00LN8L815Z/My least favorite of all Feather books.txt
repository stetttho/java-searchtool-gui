 I know it's the first of three books, and maybe that's why things seem either resolved far too quickly and easily, or not resolved at all. And as far as Max and Constance go, I just didn't like their chcaracters, individually or as a couple. There is nothing romantic about this book. The characters go from "let's use each other" to "happily ever after" for no apparent reason. They are both more calculating than anything else. On the positive side, the relationship among the sisters is similar to that of the sisters in "Valentine," and is quite pleasant. That's the only thing that makes me look forward to the next two books, as the other two sisters seem much more likeable than Constance. Also, anyone who's been complaining that Feather's last few books were too violent, too deep, may enjoy this book. There's no backstory of dangerous intrigue or life-threatening situations going on here (although, the possibility for one in future books is offered through one of the loose threads that isn't tied up at the end). Overall, I love Feather's intelligent writing, but these characters put me off.
