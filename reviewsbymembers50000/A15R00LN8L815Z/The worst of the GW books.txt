 I thought I disliked some of the GW books, but this one takes the cake. Hannah is absolutely the least likable VC "heroine" ever. All she does is whine, moan, and cry. She is so spoiled and self-centered that I was hoping Willow would beat her. All the promise shown in "Willow" and "Wicked Forest" goes to the dogs with this one. Skip it...you won't miss anything...and just cross your fingers for Grace's story in "Into the Woods."
