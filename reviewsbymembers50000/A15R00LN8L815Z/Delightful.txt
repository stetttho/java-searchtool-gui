 I would actually give it 4 1/2 stars, just because I felt the ending dragged a little. However, I loved the characters of both Ewan and Annabel. Ewan was NOT a cookie-cutter Earl, which was very refreshing. And seeing the practical Annabel get swept away was a lot of fun. I don't have a problem with switching back and forth between Annabel and Imogen. I think it makes it seem as though you're getting "more book," a story and a half instead of just one!  Before I read this book, I would have bet that the next two couples would be Josie and Rafe, then Imogen and Mayne. Now I'm thinking it will be the other way around...although I'm not sure how the self-centered Imogen will be able to take time away from her own emotions to "tame" Rafe. But I can't wait to find out!
