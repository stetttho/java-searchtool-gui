 I don't know if the GW had thought of this plotline during the Orphans miniseries and decided to do it later or what, but this definitely reads like it belongs in that series. This book has absolutely nothing to do with the other two books! You get a few mentions here and there of Noble, but you don't see Celeste senior until the last 2 pages. And does Celeste Junior really have any psychic powers? Who knows. It doesn't matter.   I really wanted this book to be about Celeste Junior finding out the truth about her parentage, discovering she has actual powers, learning to use them for good, and bonding with the woman she never knew was her mother (let alone a girl!) Instead we get 400 pages of Celeste Junior being alternately spoiled by her foster mother and coerced into being a floozy for the father-in-law. WHAT does this have to do with anything else? It could have been any other character in this situation. Majorly disappointing. Don't bother. Read the other two and make up your own ending for both Celestes.  I can't imagine what the people who gave this book five stars were thinking. After the first two very promising books in the series, this is a horrible letdown.
