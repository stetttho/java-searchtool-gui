 Unfortunately, all Amanda Quick's recent heroes and heroines seem like exactly the same people. There's not much here to differentiate this book from Mischief, Affair, or the last two books. If you enjoyed couples such  as Augusta and Harry from Rendevous or Gideon and Harriet from Ravished,  you'll be disappointed. In addition, the constant references to Vanza drive  the reader insane...I think the word appears on every page! However, it is  a quick, effortless read, and I WAS surprised by the identity of Madeline's  husband's murderer.
