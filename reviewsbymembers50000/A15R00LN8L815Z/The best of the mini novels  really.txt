 As an adult reader, I hadn't been impressed with some of the latest VC novels. Cat's story is reminiscent of the old VC books. Even though we suspected all along what's behind Cat's strange behavior, the suspense  builds until the very end. I felt like the story was actually told by a  tormented young girl with a distinct personality. The surprise at the end  was nice, too...my only complaint is that it wasn't longer. I can't wait to  see what "Into the Garden" brings!
