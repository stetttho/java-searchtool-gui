 I enjoyed this book even more than the Princess Diaries books, which I didn't think was possible. I loved the character of Jenny, who goes from being nice girl to nice girl making a difference. All the characters are enjoyable, from "teen idol" Luke to best-friend-who-needs-attitude-adjustment Trina to "isn't he perfect for Jenny?" school paper editor Scott. I couldn't put it down until I finished it.
