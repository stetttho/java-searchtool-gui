 I really enjoyed this book from start to finish. I found the relationship between Prue and Gideon charming. I'm surprised other reviewers seem think the two characters aren't really well-matched, when I felt their spirited interaction was much more like romantic banter than Con and Max's fights in the first book. Prue and Gideon's relationship, while stormy, had a gentler undertone than Con and Max's constant biting. And, the courtroom drama ensured that I didn't put the book down until I finished it! If I have one quibble, it would be that the reader doesn't get enough of Gideon. He's a fascinating character, and I would have liked to have seen more from his point of view, as well as more of his courtroom flair. (I actually give this book 4 1/2 stars.)
