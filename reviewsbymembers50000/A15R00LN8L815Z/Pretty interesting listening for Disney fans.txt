 This album was better than I thought it would be after listening to the samples...The only real disappointment was "Hakuna Matata," which didn't seem to have any of the real melody in it. If you enjoy Disney  music, especially albums like Heigh Ho Mozart and  Bibbidi Bobbidi Bach,  give this one a try.
