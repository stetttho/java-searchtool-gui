 I don't even know how I managed to finish this extremely tiresome book. Neither of the main characters have any redeeming qualities. Genevieve is completely self-centered, and Dominick is an emotionless, dominating bully. The "history" parts are sketchy at best...the Battle of New Orleans is described in about 3 sentences, despite what the description on the back cover leads the reader to believe. There are plenty of other far more readable Feather books out there...either her writing or her editor improved vastly...so pick one of those. Don't bother with this trash.
