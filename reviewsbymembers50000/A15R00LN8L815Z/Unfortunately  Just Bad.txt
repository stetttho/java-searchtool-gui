 It seems that Jane Feather books are really good or really bad, and this one is BAD. Neither character is enjoyable. The plot kicks in somewhere around page 300; before that is just boring talk about the ship. The heroine is apparently a sex-crazed idiot who's willing to sacrifice her own safety in order to "enjoy" a man she's known for days. This same man basically kidnapped her, lied to her, and she suspects (rightly so) that he is a cold-blooded murderer. So by all means abandon your worried friends and family for "adventure." Just stupid.
