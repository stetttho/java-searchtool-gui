 It ended too suddenly; there's not even a "what happened to everyone" epilogue as in the other miniseries finalies. And what's with the GW and the artist? Can they not decide what these girls look like? Cinnamon now has coal-black hair? Most of the girls' characters are pretty blah, with the exception of Cinnamon. There's the gratuitous near-rape scene, and an almost-incest scene (the GW usually finds a way to make sure the participants aren't blood-related). It did keep me reading until the end, and then it was just...over. All in all, another disappointing effort. When will I learn?
