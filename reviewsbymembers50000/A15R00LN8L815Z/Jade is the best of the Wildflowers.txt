 Like many other VC fans, I'm not fond of these mini books aimed at teen girls. I'm an adult reader, and I enjoyed the old novels. However, if you were ready to give up after "Misty" and "Star," do give  "Jade" a chance. I think that, unlike the Orphans, this series is  actually building to something. Each girl's story is a little more  dangerous than the last, and "Jade" had some interesting twists  in it. I'm looking forward to "Cat" and "Into the  Garden." I just wish this would be the last miniseries, and that  "Rain" would be more like the old books.
