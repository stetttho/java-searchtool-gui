 I love Eloisa James's books, so it didn't occur to me that I would dislike one so thoroughly. Let me just say, I hate books in which the plot hinges on the heroine's lack of virginity. I hate it even more when she lost her virginity to the hero, who doesn't remember/doesn't realize it was her/was drunk off his head. So, when I realized the WHOLE second half of this book was about the hero calling his wife a whore because she wasn't a virgin, I gave up. Definitely not her best; I'm not even going to read the rest of this series.
