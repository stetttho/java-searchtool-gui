 My whole family loves this CD; the jazzy style makes it a real feel-good album...puts everyone in the Christmas spirit! "Sleigh Ride" and "Rudolph" have that big-band energy, while "When My Heart Finds Christmas" and "Ave Maria" are heart-felt and touching. Harry's rendition of "What Are You Doing New Year's Eve" is the BEST!
