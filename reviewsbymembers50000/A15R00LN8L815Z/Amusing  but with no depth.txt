 My overall impression of this book is that it's SHORT. I rather like the characters, but given the setting, there's never any historical depth. Also, the mystery of Honor's husband's murderer is solved rather abruptly. I think it was a cute book, and I'll be surprised if there are no sequels featuring Galen's brothers (I'd most look foward to Fulk), kind of like Jude Deveraux's Velvet books. However, Deveraux's books are stuffed full of historical detail...and so, usually, are Robinson's. I hope if a series is in the works, the books improve over this one.
