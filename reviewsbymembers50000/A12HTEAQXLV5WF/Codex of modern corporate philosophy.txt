 This truly outstanding book is a revelation that helps to understand why Drucker is a guru of management gurus. The book covers all Drucker's major ideas as they unfold in sections about business, individuals, society. Do not look for extensive analysis, theoretical reviews, footnotes or even facts supporting the theory. There are none of them. Drucker is very straightforward, he never hesitates about making his point and very often doesn't even consider alternative theories or options. There is no wonder why he is an outcast in the academic community. Nonetheless, for anyone who practices real business today Drucker does not simply sounds good, you accept his ideas because that's what you always thought about business but couldn't structure so nicely and describe with such strong logic and integrity. For a manager this book could be a revelation as it puts together into a coherent picture thousands of puzzle pieces in a confused business world of today. There is no wonder why Drucker is so popular among successful CEOs.. "Essential Drucker" could be used as an official manual of corporate philosophy and culture at GE, for example. It's evident that Jack Welch's ideas are strongly influenced by Peter Drucker Unlike Welch, Peter Drucker doesn't confuse corporate culture with certain psychological types of personality. He doesn't contradict himself like Welch in describing managerial effectiveness or in formulating strategic mission and strategy. Anyway, if you think Jack Welch's ideas are great you better read "Essential Drucker".
