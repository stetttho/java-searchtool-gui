 This is a wonderful book to be read with caution. What's more - this is a book for people who are very experienced in marketing and business. When you write your x-th strategic marketing plan trying to do it even better incapsulating all new and modern concepts - this book works. It kicks butts. But... It reminds me my old chess tutor who was definitely a big champ. As a novice I was sitting with all those thick chess books trying to analyze some position on board. Then he says: "C'mon! Keep it simple! Forget about complex theories! What you need to do in this position (a) protect your king, (b) don't give up the centre and (c) make a break through on the queen's flank". Simple? Yes. Correct? Yes. Good strategy? Yes, if you are an international master. For a novice his kind of simplicity is very hazardous. What's the use of protecting the king when you overlook a mate in three moves?  To put is short - very refreshing and interesting ideas for an experienced manager but can be very confusing for a novice in business.
