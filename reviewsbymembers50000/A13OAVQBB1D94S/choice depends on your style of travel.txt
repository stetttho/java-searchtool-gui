 I checked this out of my local library along with Lonely Planet's version for comparison before buying a guidebook for my trip.  Frommer's has good coverage of major sights to see in the more popular tourist spots.  However, their book skipped a lot of lesser-known sights and areas that were covered in Lonely Planet (I particularly noticed this for archaeological sites, my own favorite category).  On the other hand, Frommer's provides better coverage of hotels and restaraunts, and includes a wider range of middle- to high-priced choices, especially.  If your approach to travel is to see as much as is humanly possible each day and return to your hotel only to sleep (as mine is), I'd go with Lonely Planet's version for its more thorough coverage of lesser-known destinations and its budget lodgings.  If you like to choose distinctive hotels and restaraunts and spend a significant part of your trip enjoying them, Frommer's is probably a better option.
