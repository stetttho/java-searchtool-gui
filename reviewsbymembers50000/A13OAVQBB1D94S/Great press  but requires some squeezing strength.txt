 I like this garlic press a lot, it's the only one I've tried that can process unpeeled cloves without breaking.  It leaves almost no unused garlic residue in the press, and is easier to clean than traditional presses.  However, it does require some force to operate, especially when squeezing unpeeled cloves.  If hand strength may be an issue for you, you should consider the OXO Good Grips peeler with the black handles and red cleaning head, which takes almost no effort to use (it's also the easiest of all to clean).
