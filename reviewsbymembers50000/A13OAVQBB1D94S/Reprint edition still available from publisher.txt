 This is a very useful volume with a variety of papers on aspects of prehistoric farming including field systems, water control systems, productivity, soil fertility and moisture availability, and traditional beliefs about agriculture, most from prominent researchers in these fields.  Some of these papers get referenced a lot, but first editions are now hard to find and expensive.  As of 2003 those of us with limited budgets can still purchase the 2002 reprint edition instead.  It's available from the publisher, New Mexico Archaeological Council (P.O. Box 25691, Albuquerque, NM  87125) for around $25.
