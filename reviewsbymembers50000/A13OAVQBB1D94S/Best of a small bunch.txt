 This is the most recent and most useful of the small number of guidebooks for Ethiopia available in the U.S.  Descriptions of places to see were clear and informative, and the sections on how to get around, where to stay, good places to eat, and other tips for each town were accurate and well-researched.  This book also contains useful sketch maps of many towns; these are now FAR more accurate than those in older editions, and I found them easier to use than similar maps found in other guides.  There is also a thoughtful section on general issues related to travel in Ethiopia.  I found this far superior to the other commonly available guides I own for information on Addis Ababa, the so-called "historical circuit," and the lowland desert areas (information on this last region is pretty scarce, but this book has more than others).  The book is focused on providing useful travel information and not on long descriptions or photographs; if an informative guidebook to use while travelling is what you're looking for, this one is your best bet.  (Be sure to get the newest edition, though-- the previous ones weren't nearly as good!)
