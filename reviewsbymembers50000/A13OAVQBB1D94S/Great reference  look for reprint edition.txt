 This is one of the most helpful reference books on southwestern North American zooarchaeological identification I know of.  It doesn't contain much text, and is focused mostly on drawings.  These are clear, to scale, and have helpful notes pointing out key features for identification.  While a lot of the book is dedicated to cranial materials, there is an unusually good section on postcrania too.  It won't replace a comparative collection (no book can), but if you don't have regular access to one this book will definitely help you narrow the field of possible identifications and make the best use of your time with the comparative materials, as well as point out key features to look for.   First editions can take months to find and can be expensive, but you can still buy the 1996 reprint edition (identical to the original in every respect) from the publisher, the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology (look for the "Publications" link on their website) for $35.  There are almost always copies for sale at the Peabody booth at the Society for American Archaeology meetings too, if you happen to be a member.  They also publish Olsen's very similar, excellent books on birds and on fish, reptiles and amphibians.
