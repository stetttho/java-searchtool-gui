 Unlike those frustrating "decorative canister set" containers, these Click Clack rectangular canisters actually come in sizes that store dry goods in the quantities they're usually sold in.  Why did it take a New Zealand company to think of that?    The 2.1 qt size holds the contents of an entire large box of cake flour, Bisquick, or corn meal, and the 1 qt size holds a box of cornstarch or powdered sugar.  Even better, the 4.5 qt size (sold separately) holds a whole 5-lb bag's worth of sugar or flour.  The square shape and stacking feature save space in the pantry, and the locking mechanism is nice and tight to keep air and bugs out (but still easy to open).  The wide openings let you scoop ingredients right out of them with a measuring cup.  They will crack if you drop them, but otherwise they're perfect!
