 My family has been using this cookbook for about 15 years, and we all love it.  My brother and I started using it as high school kids, and loved experimenting with the enormous range of completely different cuisines represented here.  When we left home our parents gave us each copies of this book, and it's still a favorite; now my husband loves the Filipino egg rolls, and the authentic Ethiopian section brings back fond memories of time I spent working there.   Over the years we've tried a high proportion of the recipes, and they've never failed or turned out "wrong."  You will need access to some unusual ingredients, but many come in dried forms you could order over the internet if the selection in your town is limited.  There's a helpful ingredient dictionary that suggests some substitutions.  Any unfamilar techniques are explained so clearly, it's hard for even an inexperienced cook to mess things up.  This is a great cookbook for any adventurous eater!
