 Despite the catchy title, this book is primarily a scholarly work written for archaeologists and not for the general public.  However, anyone with some archaeological background (several undergraduate courses, or a similar level of familiarity with archaeological literature for the U.S. Southwest) and a strong interest in the area will get a lot out of it.  It was published in 1991 but has become a classic, often recommended as supplemental background reading for graduate courses and ending up on most student reading lists for candidacy exams.
