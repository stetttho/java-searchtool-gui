 Like several other reviewers (see the many excellent plot summaries on this page), I first read this book in elementary school because I'd enjoyed Garner's other books so much, and I too found it very strange and disturbing.  However, the memory of it stuck with me for years, and I ended up rereading it recently as an adult; it made much more sense this time (knowing the adult-themed myth added another dimension too).  This is definitely aimed at a more emotionally mature age group than Garner's other books, and younger kids will be disappointed.  However, the fact that so many people remember it decades after their first reading suggests it has something unusual to offer older readers.
