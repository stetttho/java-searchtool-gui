 This has a lot of good drawings of North American bird bones, something there aren't many books on.  It can't replace a comparative collection, but will help you narrow things down.  If the prices for used first editions are too high for your budget (they are for mine!), reprint editions (in paperback) are available from the publisher, Missouri Archaeological Society, for $25 as of 2005.  A web search should find their site.
