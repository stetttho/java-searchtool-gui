 I read this because it won an Edgar; I love good science fiction but hate it when it's badly done, and I had some hopes for this.  Unfortunately I was disappointed.  The plot (invisible family fights to free other invisibles from a government conspiracy) had some potential.  However the invisibility concept, so important to the story, wasn't well explained.  In some chapters the invisible people could see each other more clearly than the visible world, but a chapter earlier or later they could only see themselves when wet and only "saw" each other through some poorly explained synaptic memory malfunction.  I wasn't fond of the characters either, particularly the ridiculously stereotyped "shaman."  Many of the problems could have been solved through better editing to catch the inconsistencies and irritating mistakes (like spelling archaeological site "sight").  As it stands, however, there are too many problems for this book to be enjoyable to read.  Despite the award, I'd skip this one.
