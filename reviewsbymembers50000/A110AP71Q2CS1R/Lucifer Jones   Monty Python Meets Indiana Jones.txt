 The Right Reverend Doctor Lucifer Jones is neither a reverend nor a doctor nor right.  He's a bumbling, money-grubbing fool from the Midwest.  This wonderfully clever book follows Jones as he travels the world in search of  a place to build his tabernacle.  But along the way, Jones discovers lost  civilizations, dragons, evil would-be world conquerers and every  conceivable low-life.  Jones is always looking for the next money making  scam.  The fact that Jones isn't too bright makes his adventures highly  entertaining and very humorous.  He eventually gets banned from every  nation he encounters, from Hong Kong and Japan to England and Spain and  everywhere inbetween.  Highly entertaining stuff, laugh-out-loud funny.
