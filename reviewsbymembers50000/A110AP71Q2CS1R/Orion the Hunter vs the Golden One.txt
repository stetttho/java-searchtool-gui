 Interesting book.  The main character, Orion, was created by powerful god-like human beings from the far future.  Orion is a tool of these god-like beings, specifically, one that Orion calls the Golden One (aka  Apollo).  Orion is tired of being a pawn, he wants to forge his own destiny  and choose his own life but the Golden One won't stand for it.  It's any  interesting novel as Orion tries to thwart the Golden One's plans of  rewriting history during the Trojan War.  Orion doesn't do this out of a  sense of right or wrong (even though he is a generally good guy) or to fix  the timeline.  Orion does this to hurt the Golden One because Orion is  tired of being used, he wants his freedom. Vengeance of Orion indeed. I  like this book because we see a character resisting fate and destiny.  Even  though this is science fiction, I do get tired of fantasy characters  accepting their fate as they are drawn into a destiny they MUST fulfill.   Vengeance of Orion is refreshing. Note: This is the second in the Orion  series.  Orion was the first novel and Vengeance is followed by Orion in  the Dying Time.  There are five books in this series thus far but, as of  this writing, I've only read the first three.  Good stuff.
