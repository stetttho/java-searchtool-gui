 I tried but I could not get into this cd.  The musicianship is perfect and I like the music and production.  But it is the vocal melodies and, in some ways, the vocalist that doesn't do much for me. I remain objective,  though.  I'm not as adventurous as other progressive metal/rock fans are.   I do like the fact that Reading Zero avoids technical over-the-topness and  focuses on songwriting.  If you are into the more unusual aspects of prog,  you will probably like Reading Zero's The Actual.  As a previous reviewer  stated, comparable bands MIGHT be Rush, Metallica, Fates Warning and  Queensryche.  I would add Megadeth (the vocals) and Damn the Machine (the  music & vocal melodies) to that list.
