 In the ninth installment of the Vlad Taltos series, Vlad must, again, rescue his friends Morrolan and Aliera.  But this time it is the Jenoine he must rescue them from--the creators of Dragaera! Issola is a good book--and satisfying.  I know many fans were unhappy with recent installments of the Taltos series because they felt Vlad wasn't evolving as a character.  Never fear, my fellow Taltos fans, Vlad does indeed evolve as he faces his most challenging adventure yet. Lady Teldra, Morrolan's "door greeter" at Castle Black, plays a big role in this book.  The interplay between Vlad and Teldra offers fascinating new insights into Vlad's friends including major revelations about Lord Morrolan--revelations that will shock you.  New information is revealed about Sethra Lavode and the Necromancer as well.  Teldra also helps Vlad realize things about himself.  And because of this relationship and the insights Lady Teldra offers, Vlad does indeed evolve. The climatic battle at the end of the book will surprise you.  Something major happens, something that has been hinted about in earlier Taltos novels (Hint: It involves Vlad's magical chain, Spellbreaker). This is one of the best Taltos novels.  There are some big surprises in Issola.  The next step in the evolution of Vlad Taltos is taken.  And it's a big step.
