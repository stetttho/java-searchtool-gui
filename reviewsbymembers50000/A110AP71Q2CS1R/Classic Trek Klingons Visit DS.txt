 In Star Trek: Deep Space Nine's second season, we see this wonderful series really begin to grow and mature.  This is exemplified by the episode "Blood Oath". Three Klingons, each of whom first appeared in  The Original Series, return to Star Trek!  Kor (from the TOS episode  "Errand of Mercy"), Koloth (from "The Trouble with  Tribbles") and Kang ("Day of the Dove") all meet up with Dax  on DS9 to fulfill a Blood Oath the four of them took over 80 years ago.  It  seems a renegade Klingon swore revenge on Kor, Koloth and Kang and  succeeded in fulfilling that promise by killing each of the threesome's  eldest sons.  Curzon Dax, who was negotiating peace treaties with the  Klingon Empire at the time and had become close to Kang, took a Blood Oath  with Kang and company to one day find the renegade and kill him.  Only  problem is that the Oath was made with Dax's previous host, Curzon and not  Jadzia, Dax's current incarnation (you're familiar with the Trill, right?).   Kor doesn't have a problem with this but Kang and Koloth only see a young  woman with little experience and their mission of vengeance seems  ill-suited for her.  Eventually, Dax convinces them to let her come along,  not fully realizing how violent it will be and what it means to take a  life. This is a powerful episode and the violence that marks Jadzia's  coming of age is not glorified: It is violent, bloody and tragic.  Jadzia  grows here but it is a maturation process that she could have done without.   Klingons claim that killing in a just cause is glorious but all we see is  death and destruction.  A coming of age indeed but one that Jadzia realizes  she could have skipped. This is the best episode of DS9's first two  seasons.  It is a good Klingon episode and, perhaps, the best Dax episode.
