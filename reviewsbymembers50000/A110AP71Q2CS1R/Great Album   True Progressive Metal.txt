 Conception does know what great progressive metal is about. It's the songs, stupid. And they succeed with Flow.  Progressive metal, or progressive music in general, is about moving into unusual territory and  pushing boundaries yet at the same time, keeping the song number one.   Technical proficiency and brilliant musicianship should come second to  great songwriting.  Conception knows this and Flow is great  songwriting. Don't look to Dream Theater's recent album (Scenes From A  Memory) for true progressive metal.  Look to Conception's Flow for what  progressive metal is all about. It's the songs, stupid! It also helps  that Conception's Roy S. Khan is the best vocalist I've ever heard, easily  an equal to Queensryche's Geoff Tate or Dream Theater's James LaBrie.
