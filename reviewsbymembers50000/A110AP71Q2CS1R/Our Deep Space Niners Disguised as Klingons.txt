 Klingons are fun.  And whenever an episode of Star Trek focuses on Klingons, we know we are in for a great ride ("The Sword of Kahless" not withstanding)! Odo is convinced that Chancellor Gowron, leader of the Klingon Empire, is a changeling.  Odo, Sisko, Worf and O'Brien set out to reveal the truth by disguising themselves as Klingons.  It is highly entertaining to see our heroes try to make it as Klingons.  Oddly enough, Sisko seems the most at ease as a Klingon, not Worf.  Worf, being an outcast (for the second time--does this guy want to fit in?!?), is in greater peril, though. I admit it, part of the charm of this episode is seeing Colm Meaney (O'Brien), Rene Auberjonois (Odo) and Avery Brooks (Sisko) dressed up as Klingons.  Odo and O'Brien, as Klingons, look extremely dorky.  But Sisko--my oh my!  Does he wear that Klingon make-up well! Their is an interesting plot twist at the end of the episode.  It seems Odo's information about a changeling disguised as Chancellor Gowron was only half right... Anyway, this is a good, solid episode.  It isn't essential for Klingon lovers, but it comes close.
