 The omnipotent Q and Captain Picard's former (?) lover Vash take a trip to DS9.  Q is as good as he always is and Vash is sarcastic and brash -- a  good foil to Q's sassiness and irreverence.  They had been partners as Q  helped Vash search the galaxy for valuable artifacts and such.  But, as  Picard and crew already know, Q can be annoying and Vash quickly tired of  him and his antics.  So, to make this synopsis succinct, Vash is trying to  rid herself of Q and Q is trying to woo Vash.  And the crew of DS9 are the  victims in this intergalactic spat. Good episode and Q even lends a hand  in saving the station from a mysterious threat (gee, another one of those).   But what I want to know is this: Why didn't Q ever return to DS9?  I guess  Picard's Enterprise and Janeway's Voyager are more fun to visit.  Who  knew? I'm giving this episode five stars even though I think it only  warrants four.  Why?  Because the other person who reviewed this episode  clearly meant to give "Q-less" more than one star (read it and  you'll see what I mean) so I'm giving my fellow reviewer a star.  Ain't I  nice?
