 Let's make this review to the point. You wanna know which bands are similar in sound and style to Shadow Gallery's third album Tyranny?  Okay.  I would compare Shadow Gallery on Tyranny to Dream Theater (keyboards,  musical arrangements & song structures), Kansas (vocal melodies), Queen  (vocal harmonies), Yngwie Malmsteen (guitars), Rush (hard to nail down a  particular area, just that the similarities are present, if subtle),  Queensryche (vocals & general tone of the music) and Savatage (song  structures). Shadow Gallery is what I would describe as "epic  progressive metal/rock".  The songwriting is superb and easily on par  with all of the bands I've mentioned.  They also know when enough technical  showmanship is enough -- they never go overboard with the  instrumentals. I hope I've been helpful.
