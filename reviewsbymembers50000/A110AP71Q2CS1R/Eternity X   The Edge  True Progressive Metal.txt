 It seems that there are many bands out there today incorrectly calling themselves "progressive metal".  These bands are all technical and over-the-top and are filled with great musicians.  But progressive they  ain't.  Eternity X is progressive.  Sure, Eternity X is technical (some  people confuse technical metal with progressive metal) but more  importantly, they write good music that defies boundaries.  That is  progressive.  And the Edge is a progressive metal masterpiece.  With the  Edge, Eternity X pulls off an album of such daring and brilliance that it  can only be compared with Queensryche's Operation: Mindcrime.  No kidding,  the Edge is that good.  Okay, so I've told you that the Edge is good.  But  who do they have similarities to?  Eternity X has their own sound but they  were surely influenced by Queensryche, Rush and Styx.  Similarities to  Dream Theater can be found in their sound as well.  If you like your metal  to be a bit different, Eternity X's the Edge will not let you down.
