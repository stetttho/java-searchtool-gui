 Yep.  Ayreon's the Final Experiment is those things...and more! The Final Experiment is a concept album that tells the tale of a blind minstrel who is receiving visions of apocalyptic doom from the future.  The music is  epic, progressive and medieval in sound and style.  Arjen Anthony Lucassen,  the man behind Ayreon, uses a wide variety of vocalists and other musicians  to tell this story.  Whether it is the medieval and bombastic "Sail  Away to Avalon", the quiet and introspective "Ye Courtyard  Minstrel Boy" or the powerful "Merlin's Will", the Final  Experiment delivers on many levels.  There is something for everyone on  this cd -- especially for you keyboard lovers.  If you like a variety of  bands such as Savatage, Pink Floyd and Blind Guardian, you will probably  love the Final Experiment.
