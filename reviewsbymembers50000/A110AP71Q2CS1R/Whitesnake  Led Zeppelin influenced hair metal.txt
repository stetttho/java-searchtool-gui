 Though not obvious on tracks such as "Here I Go Again" and "Now You're Gone", Whitesnake is a band that was hugely influenced by Led Zeppelin. Listen to "Judgement Day" and "Still of the Night" and you will understand what I mean. Though Whitesnake has been much maligned for their sometimes corny lyrics and too-slick sound, they are still a solid band. And though too many sound alike ballads are included on this greatest hits album, this is still a solid disc.  David Coverdale, Whitesnake's singer and main songwriter, is an excellent vocalist. The guitarists on this album (most notably John Sykes and Steve Vai) are excellent so you can't go wrong there.  Good performances all around. If you like Led Zeppelin influenced hair metal, buy this disc!
