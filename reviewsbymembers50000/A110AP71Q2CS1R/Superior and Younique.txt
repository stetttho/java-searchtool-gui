 Younique (not "Unique") is the name of Superior's second album.  I don't have their first album, Behind, but word is that it is a fantastic album and is Dream Theater-like in tone and texture.  From what I  understand, many fans of Superior were disappointed with Behind's  follow-up, Younique.  But, hey, I like it. Dream Theater comparisons are  hard to find on this album.  Sure, Younique is progressive metal but they  also have industrial metal-like touches on Younique.  The use of quiet  piano combined with VERY heavy, crunchy guitar work is fascinating and  captivating.  The vocal melodies are odd but catchy and the vocalist is  good though, at times, his voice is reminiscent of various alternative rock  vocalists -- but don't let that scare you off, he isn't annoying.  Superior  also uses alot of interesting rhythms and electronic sounds -- I'm not sure  how they achieve this but it is very cool. Comparable albums MIGHT be  Damn the Machine's self-titled (and only) album and Reading Zero's debut  The Actual.  There are also little things scattered throughout this cd that  remind me of Pink Floyd or Ayreon. With Younique, Superior accomplishes  something that is seemingly difficult to achieve in progressive metal: They  have their own unique sound and style.  Plus, they avoid the progressive  cliches and technical nonsensse that so many so-called  "progressive" bands are fond of.  And, though not every song here  is great, this band knows what good music is about: It's the songs!
