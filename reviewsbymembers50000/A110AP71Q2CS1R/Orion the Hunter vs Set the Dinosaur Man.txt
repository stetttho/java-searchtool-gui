 Like Ben Bova's first two Orion novels (Orion and Vengeance of Orion), Orion in the Dying Time has the more-than-human, less-than-god Orion being used and abused by by the Creators, a race of very advanced god-like  humans.  This time, they send Orion on an errand to save mankind before it  is wiped out by the maddened alien pseudo-god Set.  Though Orion hates  being the Creator's lackey, he realizes that if his mission fails, humanity  (which includes himself as well as the Creators) will be erased from the  time-line.  Orion then finds himself battling the minions of Set back in  the time of dinosaurs.  At stake is his very existence. This is a good  sci-fi novel that deals with gods, eternity, time travel and destiny --  something Orion constantly tries to thwart, in one form or the  other. Orion hates being a slave to fate.  Can't say I blame him.
