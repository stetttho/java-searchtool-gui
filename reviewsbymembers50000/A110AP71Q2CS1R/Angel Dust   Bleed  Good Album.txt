 Angel Dust gives the listener something fairly unique to progressive/power/epic metal music in that you rarely hear guitars THIS heavy coupled with a piano as is the case on the opening track "Bleed" (keyboards and synth maybe but not a piano, though it may be the keyboards that are mimicking a piano sound)).  I mean, this is some heavy stuff--Iced Earth heavy--but the intertwining piano melody really throws you off.  And that is good!  As the album moves on, the keys take on a more traditional prog metal sound (think Awake-era Dream Theater) but it is still good.  The songwriting is very strong on Bleed and the keys never overshadow the rest of the band as happens all too often in progressive metal (no, I'm not saying Angel Dust is prog but they do have similarities to many prog bands).  Angel Dust's singer is good, though he is a bit rough.  Don't let this scare you off but he (AD's lead singer) kinda reminds me of Offspring's lead vocalist only not nearly as annoying. Angel Dust, from what I understand, used to be a thrash metal band and sometimes you can still hear that side of them.  This is a good thing for it makes Bleed (and Angel Dust) all the more interesting and unique. This album is for fans of Iced Earth, Savatage, Dream Theater & Superior.  I'm not saying that's what Angel Dust sounds like (though there are some similarities to all four aforementioned bands), I'm just saying that if you like those four bands, you'll probably like Angel Dust's Bleed. Angel Dust walks in the gray area that seperates power metal from progressive metal and epic metal from thrash metal.  I don't know what to call 'em, but they're good.
