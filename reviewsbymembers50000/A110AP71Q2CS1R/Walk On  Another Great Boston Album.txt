 To those fans who knock this album... Tom Scholz (get the name right) IS Boston.  He writes and has always written the vast majority of the music, he plays nearly every instrument and he has produced and engineered all of  Boston's albums. Tom Scholz is Boston. I've heard a lot of whining from  so-called Boston fans because Brad Delp doesn't do the vocals on Walk On.   So what?  Fran Cosmo is just as good a singer as Delp is.  Cosmo is  different but I guess some Boston fans fear new things. The songwriting is  as strong as it has ever been and the production is, as always, top-notch.  Walk On is another great Boston album.  And it is Boston because of one  man.  Tom Scholz, musical genuis.
