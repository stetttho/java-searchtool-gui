 The more I listen to and research "typical" hair metal bands, the only conclusion I can come to is that none were "typical".  Most hair metal bands were filled with excellent musicians and, more  importantly, good songwriters.  White Lion was no exception. White Lion  had a sound all their own, a sound that, it seems, was built on Van Halen  and Dokken.  In fact, guitarist Vito Bratta's playing style is somewhat of  an amalgam of Eddie Van Halen and Dokken's George Lynch.  Bratta is really  a top-notch guitarist, easily holding his own with guitar virtuosos such as  Joe Satriani, Steve Vai and the aforementioned Eddie Van Halen.  Vocalist  Mike Tramp has a unique voice (that, for some, may take some getting used  to) that compliments Bratta's guitar perfectly.  As for this album, The  Best of White Lion, it is an accurate representation of White Lion's best  work.  White Lion, unlike many hair metal bands, avoids most of the sleaze  and hair metal cliches.  Instead, Mike Tramp (White Lion's lyricist)  focuses on politically charged lyrics and love songs.  And while I do not  necessarily agree with Mike Tramp's politics, I am at least thankful to Mr.  Tramp for giving us something different. If you like strong songwriting  and catchy guitar work, pick up this album.
