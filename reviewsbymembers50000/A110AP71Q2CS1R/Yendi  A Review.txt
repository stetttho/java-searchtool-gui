 Well, it seems opinions vary on this "chapter" of the Vlad Taltos series.  People either think it is the best of the bunch or the worst of 'em (but they still like it).  Even the author, Steven Brust, has  stated that this is his least favorite of the series (which stands at eight  novels, so far). I loved Yendi and it is one of my favorites of the  entire series.  Are "hero", the assassin-mobster Vlad Taltos,  gets involved in a mob war with another mob boss who is moving into his  territory.  But, as the mob war escalates, Vlad finds a deeper plot that  could threaten the entire Empire.  Fun ensues!  Assassins and mobsters and  wizards, oh my!  What more could one ask for in a fantasy series?  The Vlad  Taltos novels are great fun and an interesting take on your  "average" epic fantasy. Note: Yendi is the third novel (after  Taltos and Dragon but before Jhereg) if your reading them in chronological  order.  It doesn't REALLY matter what order you read the Vlad Taltos novels  in but, hey, I'm being helpful.
