 Man, this is a redundant album. Why is everyone praising Brave New World as "the return of heavy metal" and "the best album of the year"?  This album is NOTHING compared to Maiden's '80s work.  And I do mean nothing. Maiden fans, take off the blinders!  This album is a worthless piece of crap yet, because you are so excited about the return of vocalist Bruce Dickinson and guitarist Adrian Smith, you have chosen to ignore MAJOR flaws found throughout Brave New World.  And, in the end, you encourage Iron Maiden to make more crap albums like this one because you refuse to see it for what it is. Maiden used to be innovators in heavy metal but this album is a parody--a mockery--of what they used to be. I wanted to love this album but recycled guitar riffs, repetitive  choruses and flat songwriting killed it for me. At least vocalist Bruce Dickinson still sounds good. I love Iron Maiden and was excited about the return of Dickinson and Smith but I will not let myself be blinded by love for the band: This album is bad--really bad.
