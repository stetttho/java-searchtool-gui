 The Warning is Queensryche's first full-length album (their first release was an EP) and it is an amazing piece of work.  Listening to this album conjures up images of Iron Maiden and, oddly enough, Van Halen (I think  Queensryche's guitarists are using the same equipment that Eddie Van Halen  was using in the early '80s).  But, even though the music was obviously  influenced by Maiden, Queensryche stands on their own here.  Their unique  style of prog rock (Pink Floyd & Queen) inspired metal would, in turn,  influence and inspire the entire progressive metal genre.  Sure, the  progressive touches are just that -- touches.  But where The Warning is  mostly straight forward metal, Queensryche would continue adding more and  more prog structures with subsequent releases. The "big three"  songs on this album are "Take Hold of the Flame", an excellent  soaring (and I do mean soaring) song.  This is perhaps lead singer Geoff  Tate's best song vocally, he's brilliant here.  "NM 156" is a  very unusual but fascinating song.  It is almost hypnotic with it's creepy  vocals and catchy chorus.  The album finishes with the epic masterpiece  "Roads to Madness".  I get chills everytime I hear this dark and  sweeping journey.  This may be Queensryche's best song. The other songs  are all good, too (especially the sad "Sanctuary"), I'm just  pointing out the best songs.  I don't wanna be here all night, ya  know. Anyway, if you like "metallic opera" (think Queen plus  Iron Maiden), you'll probably enjoy The Warning.
