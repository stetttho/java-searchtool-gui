 Santiago: A Myth of the Far Future reads like an epic Western except the setting is space instead of the Old West.  Perhaps one of the best books I've ever read, filled with mythic characters that do bear some resemblance  to legendary gunslingers of the West.  We see the different characters  weave their way through a series of pitfalls and challenges to, in the end,  face the "villain" of the story, the semi-mythical outlaw  Santiago.  But things are not what they seem in this very fascinating and  clever novel.
