 Second Contact by Mike Resnick is a wonderfully constructed futuristic mystery novel.  The book focuses on a military lawyer who has to defend a starship commander.  The commander is brought up on murder charges because he killed a fellow officer.  The commander did this because he felt that  the other officer was an alien.  Well, things aren't what they seem.  The  lawyer starts investigating the case and, right away, he realizes that  someone -- or something -- doesn't want the truth to be found.  I won't  tell you the ending but it is clever and quite shocking -- but  intelligent. While this novel may appear like the TV series the X-Files  at first glance (it actually preceded that series by a few years), Resnick  adds his unique sense of wry humor to the novel.  This is refreshing  because it seems that many authors take sci-fi too seriously or not  seriously enough.  Resnick has found the perfect balance.
