 Stasheff's Rogue Wizard series is a bit uneven and A Wizard in Chaos is on the ordinary side of the series.  This installment is a sort of amalgam of all the Rogue Wizard novels, we are given nothing new here except Magnus  finally sheds his annoying sidekick, Dirk.  It it a good novel for Stasheff  fans but isn't the author's best work.  All in all, a decent novel but it  could of used a shot of originality.
