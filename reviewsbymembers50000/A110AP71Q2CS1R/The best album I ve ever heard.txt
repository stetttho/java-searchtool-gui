 In 1988, Queensryche was at the forefront of progressive metal, a genre which they helped create.  Their masterpiece Operation: Mindcrime remains to this day not only the best prog metal album ever, but, in my opinion, the best album ever. The album tells the story of a man who buys into government and religious conspiracies.  He becomes a pawn of an extreme left-wing terrorist organization and begins murdering high profile religious and political leaders.  He eventually tries to leave this whacko organization, but they kill his lover--a nun--and he ends up in a mental institution.  The story starts there as he tells the listener how he arrived at that point. A good story, but it is the music that makes this dark story of murder, betrayal and love so great.  Queensryche, helped by the best vocalist rock has ever seen in Geoff Tate, paints a pretty good picture for the listener.  Some songs are just dark rockers, like "Operation: Mindcrime", "Speak" and "Spreading the Disease".  But then you have moody songs that slowly build until they explode with fury like "The Mission" and the epic "Suite Sister Mary".  That's not all Operation: Mindcrime has to offer, though.  There is also the trio of radio friendly rockers "Breaking the Silence", "I Don't Believe in Love" and "Eyes of a Stranger". This is a great album.   For those of you unfamiliar with Queensryche's sound, they're Iron Maiden meets Pink Floyd.
