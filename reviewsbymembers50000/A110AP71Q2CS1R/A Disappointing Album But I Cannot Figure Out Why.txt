 After all the hype, after all the glowing reviews about how this album is supposedly one of the great prog metal/neoclassical releases ever, I finally picked up Symphony X's The Divine Wings of Tragedy. Boy, what a  let-down.  It just did not "grab" me in any way.  All the  ingredients are there to make this a great album from the Dio-like vocals,  and very Malmsteen-like guitar and the Queen-ish vocal harmonies and Dream  Theater sound but when it comes right down to it, I didn't like this  album. I'm not the biggest fan of neoclassical metal but I do like  progressive metal minus the technical over-the-topness many so-called  "prog metal" bands indulge in.  The funny thing is that Symphony  X's technical indulgences are, for the most part, tasteful (except for the  keyboards that are a bit too much at times), I should have liked this  album.  But I didn't and I still can't figure it out.  All the ingredients  are there.  Hey, maybe it was the songs.  Who knows?
