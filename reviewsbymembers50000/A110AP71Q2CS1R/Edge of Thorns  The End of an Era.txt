 With Edge of Thorns, Savatage closes out the Criss Oliva era of the band.  Shortly after EoT was released, Criss, Savatage's guitarist,  was killed in a car wreck.  Knowing this adds depth and emotion to the music while one  listens to EoT.  It hurts knowing that Criss Oliva will never write another  song nor amaze us with an emotional guitar solo.   Edge of Thorns is an  intriguing combination of powerful vocals, quiet piano and racing guitar  work.  There are soaring epics like the title track "Edge of  Thorns", quiet acoustic pieces like "Sleep" and haunting  rockers like "He Carves His Stone".  There is something here for  everyone.    I think this album will appeal to those music fans who like  dramatic and epic hard rock/metal making Edge of Thorns the perfect fit for  fans of Iron Maiden, Queen, Queensryche and Meat Loaf.
