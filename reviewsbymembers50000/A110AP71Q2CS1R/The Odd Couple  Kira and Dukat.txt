 As I'm sure you're well aware, the Cardassians and Bajorans don't like each other too well.  Cardassian occupation and abuse of the Bajoran homeworld will do that to a species.  But Bajoran Major Kira and Cardassian  Gul Dukat must put aside their differences and solve a mystery together.    Kira is forced to bring her nemesis, Dukat, on a mission.  It seems a  piece of a Bajoran ship is found and Kira wants to find out what happened  to the rest of the ship as well as find any survivors (the ship has been  missing for over ten years).  A friend of Kira's was among those who  disappeared.  Dukat has his own reasons for finding this missing ship.    As the story unfolds, we find that Dukat knew one of the Bajoran women  that was onboard the ship when it was lost.  And they find her grave, as  well as more wreckage, on a barren desert planet.  It turns out that this  woman was Dukat's mistress.  And they had a child together, Tora Ziyal.   Dukat wants to kill the child if he finds her because her presence as a  hybrid (half-Cardassian, half-Bajoran) would cause him much grief on  Cardassia and he would be disgraced and possibly lose his position as one  of Cardassia's leaders.  Kira and Dukat find Ziyal (but not Kira's friend  who died a few years earlier) enslaved by the alien species Breen.  They  rescue Ziyal and the other remaining Bajoran slaves and Dukat, predictably,  finds that he cannot kill his daughter.  This is a good thing because Kira  would have killed Dukat if he had murdered Ziyal.  Ain't it fun? Solid  episode and the interplay between Dukat and Kira is good.  The ending was  okay and I found the existence of a Cardassian/Bajoran hybrid to be  extremely fascinating.  There is, as we would find out, much potential in  this development.
