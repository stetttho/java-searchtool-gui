 One of Deep Space Nine's more intriguing elements is the relationship between the Cardassians and Bajorans.  As you probably already know, the Cardassians enslaved, abused and were generally quite rude to the Bajorans  for over fifty years.  Now Bajor has it's freedom but the two species  remain hostile toward one another.  So when a Cardassian, claiming to be an  infamous war criminal, arrives on DS9 with the sole purpose to be executed  for his crimes, DS9's Bajoran first officer, Major Kira Nerys, must decide  if this is indeed the hated general who committed hundreds of attrocities  against the Bajorans or if something else is at stake. The interplay  between Kira and the supposed Cardassian criminal is both intricate and  fascinating as both dance the dance that comes with interrogation.  Kira  tries to find out why this man wants to be executed and the  "criminal" attempts to prove that he is, indeed,  this evil  Cardassian that plagued Bajor.  I won't reveal the ending for those of you  that haven't seen this superb episode but I will say this: Things aren't  what they seem and the ending is both surprising and  tragic. "Duet" is the best episode of DS9's first season and,  overall, one of the best episodes of any Trek series.  And Major Kira, a  character I'm not fond of, is at her best here, this is THE Kira episode to  own.
