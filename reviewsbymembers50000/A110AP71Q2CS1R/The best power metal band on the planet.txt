 Is Kamelot the best power metal band on Earth?  Well, I think they are at least the best European-style power metal band around.  And Khan may be the best singer in all of metal. Some things you should know about Kamelot: 1. Though three-fourths of the band members are American, Kamelot is definitely a European power metal band in style.  In other words, their music has a lot more in common with Stratovarius and Rhapsody than Iced Earth and Jag Panzer. 2. Kamelot isn't cliched like many European power metal bands are.  Sure, they sing about some of the same things (magic, dragons, honor, glory, knights, etc.).  But even though vocalist Khan is from Europe, he commands the English language better than most European power metal lyricists.  Kamelot avoids clumsy and cliched lyrics. 3. Though one reviewer here thinks vocalist Khan doesn't fit the music, Khan is still the best vocalist in all of power metal.  Doesn't fit the music?!?  Would you rather have a vocalist who tries to sing out of his range, mangles the English language and sounds like every other Euro power metal singer?  No.  Khan is a great singer (think Queensryche's Geoff Tate).  He has range and is always in control of his voice. 4. Kamelot, though not really a progressive metal band, does have some prog touches here and there thanks to Khan.  Khan's background as prog metal band Conception's lead singer and co-songwriter serve him well as a member of Kamelot.  Khan's songwriting adds just enough difference to Kamelot's power metal base to make them stand out above the rest of the power metal norm. 5. Guitarist Thomas Youngblood.  His playing style is awesome--equal parts thrash, speed and melody. Karma, Kamelot's fifth studio album, may be the best album of 2001.  It is every bit as good as Kamelot's previous disc, the Fourth Legacy.  Every song is a highlight.  Speed and power with just a hint of progressive is the Kamelot recipe.
