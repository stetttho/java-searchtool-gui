 Pilot episodes deserve to be treated not to harshly.  I will attempt to be as fair as possible, though in truth, I may fail. The first episode of  Star Trek: The Next Generation is both a success and an uneasy beginning.   The plot deals with a mysterious planet/base called Farpoint that holds a  dangerous secret.  This is standard Trek fare, nothing overly brilliant or  clever in this story.  The characters are a mix of great potential and  teeth-clenching ugliness.  The cerebral Captain Picard, the blind Lt. La  Forge and the Klingon Lt. Worf (originally an extra) give us glimpses of  greatness (La Forge never does reach his potential as the series advances,  though).  On the other side, the awful acting of Denise Crosby (Lt. Yar)  and Marina Sirtis (Counselor Troi) made me wonder how these ladies got  their respective parts (I mean, c'mon, there MUST have been better  actresses trying out for those parts).  What I liked most about this pilot  episode was the villainous Q, the beautiful new Enterprise and the  potential the show promised and, eventually, gave us.  In time, some of the  unlikable characters (Riker, Troi, Dr. Crusher) would grow on me, Q would  continue to be a favorite adversary and, even though the ship itself would  grow ugly in my eyes, the show would become great. Again, this pilot  episode isn't great (it's the "worst" Trek pilot--Classic Trek,  DS9 and Voyager had better first episodes) but it is a good introduction to  a series that would eventually rock science fiction.
