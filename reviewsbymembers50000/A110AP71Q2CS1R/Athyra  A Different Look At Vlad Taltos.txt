 Sure, the sixth installment (the seventh chronologically) of the Vlad Taltos novels is different.  We get a look at Vlad from an outsider's point of view.  Some readers haven't liked this different approach but I think  it's a fascinating way at giving us an alternate perspective of Vlad, warts  and all.  Athyra ends up being a strong novel, just as good as any of  author Steven Brust's previous Taltos novels.  I do wonder if, like Vlad,  Steven Brust is having a difficult time deciding on which direction to take  Vlad next.  That's fine, though.  I'm just as happy to read about Vald  Taltos the Wanderer as I am to read about Vlad Taltos the Assassin.  The  progression and growth of this character still fascinates me.  Where will  Vlad end up next?  Who will he end up becoming?  This is a fun  ride! Note: Chronologically, the Vlad Taltos novels go in this order:  Taltos, Dragon, Yendi, Jhereg, Teckla, Phoenix, Athyra, Orca.  I'd start  with Taltos even though Jhereg was written first.
