 Lynch Mob's first album, Wicked Sensation, is simply this: Blistering, aggressive heavy rock.  I don't like every song here but if you want sleazy, in-your-face, kick-butt & take-no-prisoners hard rock/metal, I think you'll like Wicked Sensation.  "Wicked Sensation" is probably the best tune here, it's heavy and powerful with a nasty riff.  Comparable to Dokken at their heaviest.  "River Of Love" is excellent and rolls like thunder, George Lynch is totally rocks on guitar here.  "No Bed Of Roses" is another highlight with it's crunchy guitar work.  "Through These Eyes", though ballad-like, is a very strong song with nice vocal melodies. This CD will appeal to fans of Dokken as well as sleaze metal bands such as Ratt, Motley Crue and Guns 'n' Roses.  If you're a fan of guitarist George Lynch, this is a must have CD.
