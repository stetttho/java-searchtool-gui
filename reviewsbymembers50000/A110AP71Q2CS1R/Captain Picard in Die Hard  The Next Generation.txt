 Sometimes Star Trek: The Next Generation gets bogged down by pretentious moral studies or pompous political agendizing in it's storytelling.  Once in a while, though, TNG steps back from it's oft-times arrogant posturing  and gives us a solid action-adventure yarn.   "Starship Mine"  is such an episode and it succeeds because it is simply this: Picard is  trapped alone on the Enterprise with ruthless thieves who are trying to  steal "trilithium resin", a lethal substance given off by the  Enterprise's engines that can be used to make terrorist weapons of mass  destruction. This episode greatly resembles the first Die Hard movie in  it's plot and Captian Picard is Bruce Willis here.  Picard foils the plans  of the thieves and saves the day through cleverness and a few  fist-fights. Fun episode and a welcome change of pace for this excellent  series that need not have an important moral tale to tell every single  episode.  It's okay to step back and present the viewer with a rousing  adventure such as "Starship Mine".
