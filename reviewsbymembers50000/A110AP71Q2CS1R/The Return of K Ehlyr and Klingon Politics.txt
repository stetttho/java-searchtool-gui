 In season two's "The Emissary", we are introduced to Ambassador K'Ehlyr, a half-Klingon, half-human Federation diplomat and former friend and lover of Lt. Worf. In season three's "Sins of the Father", we are introduced to Klingon politics and subterfuge and Worf is dishonored because of a crime his father supposedly committed. With season four, both plotlines come together in the intense and wonderfully constucted episode "Reunion". The leader of the Klingon Empire, Chancellor K'mpec, is dying and decides that Captain Picard, in accordance with Klingon law, will choose the next leader of the Empire. Two Klingons council members are competing for the throne, Gowron and Duras (Duras previously had dishonored Worf by laying the blame of his father on to Worf's father). One problem: K'mpec has been slowly poisoned by either Duras or Gowron and wants Picard to find out which one has, ultimately, murdered him. Picard has Worf investigate. This puts Worf in an awkward position because, not only is he an outcast in Klingon society and Duras is the one who dishonored him, but his lover, K'Ehlyr (who is assisting Picard and the Federation in this diplomatic mess) just dropped a bombshell on Worf: She has a son by Worf and Worf won't acknowledge their son because he doesn't want his dishonor passed on. Whew! Did you get all that? This makes for a fascinating episode filled with political intrigue and family dysfunction. The ending is a shocker and is quite bold on the part of Trek's creators and I give them kudos for their guts in writing and airing the episode's finale. I won't tell you what happens (you probably already know) but it is both heart-wrenching and, oddly, satisfying. Great episode with great characters, both villainous and noble. What a story!
