 The story takes place on Risa, the famous (or infamous) "pleasure planet" mentioned in other Trek episodes.  Worf and Dax arrive on Risa to take their relationship to the "next step".  Dax meets an old lover (from one of her previous hosts) who wants to shut down Risa because it is not a moral place. Okay, that's fine.  But why portray people with strong morals and beliefs as nuts and radicals?  I know Trek has always leaned a bit to the left, but this episode is ridiculous.  This episode takes cheap shots at every man or woman who does believe that casual sex is wrong.  I guess the creators and writers of DS9 think that half of DS9's fans are just plain nuts.  This episode is insulting and an attack on those of us who have differing points of view.  Plus, it is was too preachy. Bad episode, worse than "Rejoined", which took plenty of cheap shots, too.
