 I've never been fond of Picard's "left hand", Counselor Deanna Troi, nor am I a big fan of the Romulans.  While the former is played by a barely adequate actress who's trying to play a cardboard character, the  latter has a ton of potential but it is potential not yet realized.  This  fine episode succeeds because it finally makes both Troi and the Romulans  interesting. Troi is kidnapped in a complex plot by jaded Romulans who,  with the aid of the Federation, are trying to help a few prominent Romulan  politicians defect to the Federation.  This would be a huge political  victory for the Federation and a big blow to the Romulan Empire.  Troi is  forced to play the role of a Romulan intelligence officer on a Romulan  warship.  The story is intense as Troi clashes with the commander of the  Romulan ship and she (Troi) is almost exposed as a fraud on several  occasions (seems she was kidnapped for her empathic abilities and not her  knowledge of Romulans--which is almost nil).   Marina Sirtis, who plays  Deanna Troi, comes across as a very capable actress here and I come to the  conclusion that she would have been better served by the creators and  writers of TNG if they had fleshed out Troi more.  Troi's inabilities are  not the fault of Sirtis, at least so it seems here. This is a strong  episode and, at the time, was both my favorite Troi episode AND my favorite  Romulan episode.  Pretty cool, eh?
