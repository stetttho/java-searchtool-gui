 Van Halen III is one of the best albums I've ever heard.  Bold statement?  Perhaps.  I mean it, though, this is truly a great album. Van Halen does experiment a bit on this release and that put a lot of Van Halen fans off.   Gary Cherone on vocals didn't help, either.  A lot of fans never gave this  album a chance because of Gary.  It isn't because Gary is a bad vocalist  (he's quite good, actually), it's because people dislike change. There  isn't a weak song on the album except for "How many Say I"  (maybe).  "How Many Say I" is good musically but the lyrics on  the second half of the song are...weak (to put it mildly).  The band does  funk metal for the first time with "Without You", a song that  actually sounds a bit like something Extreme (Cherone's old band) would do.   Good song and the chorus is vintage Van Halen.  Other standouts include  the beautiful ballad "Once" and the dark and powerful "From  Afar", both are Genesis-like in sound and style while the excellent  "Dirty Water Dog" conjures up images of Queen and the progressive  ballad "Josephina" shows strong yet unusual songwriting at  work. I will never understand the hate this album receives.  Despite what  many Van Halen fans may say, this album has not received the fair chance it  deserves.  Many Van Halen fans are too blinded by hate and the dislike of  change to give III a fair shot.  Unfortunately, they've forgotten what  music is about.  It's the music, stupid.  It doesn't matter who is in the  band as long as the music is good.  And good it is.
