 Yes, Ayreon's second album, Actual Fantasy, can accurately be described as "heavy Pink Floyd".  It's a good album, very atmospheric and symphonic.  Arjen Anthony Lucassen (the man behind Ayreon) uses three  different lead vocalists on the album -- sometimes in the same song.  All  three singers are very good and, when you couple this with the catchy vocal  melodies, the result is powerful, sometimes bombastic, sometimes mellow,  Floyd-like symphonic progressive hard rock.  Enough adjectives for you?   That's what happens when a band is hard to describe because they are so  unique.  This is Ayreon. It should be stressed that Mr. Lucassen is a  good songwriter and never sacrifices the song in favor of technical  self-indulgence. I dare say that if you like Pink Floyd and heavier rock,  you will love this album.  I certainly did and I'm not even a big Pink  Floyd fan!
