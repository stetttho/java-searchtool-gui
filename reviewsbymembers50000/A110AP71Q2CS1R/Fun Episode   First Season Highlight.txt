 The first sesaon of Star Trek: The Next Generation was hard to watch at  times.  TNG had yet to "find" itself and the writing  was...uneven, at best.  But toward the end of the first season, the writers  and producers finally gave TNG life with such excellent episodes as  "Coming of Age", "Heart of Glory" and "The Arsenal  of Freedom". "The Arsenal of Freedom" tells the story of a  super-weapon that takes on a life of it's own.  The Enterprise encounters  this device on a planet that is one giant weapons factory.  But something  went terribly wrong.  These weaponeers created a weapon so smart that it  became something more powerful and dangerous than what they intended: It  wiped out every intelligent life-form on the entire planet.  And when  Picard and crew investigate, this weapon attempts to wipe out the  Enterprise as well.  What sets this episode apart is that we get to see Lt.  Geordi La Forge shine as commander of the Enterprise.  Picard and most of  his command staff are stranded on the planet and La Forge has to not only  rescue them from one of the super-weapons but he has to protect the  Enterprise from one of these weapons as well.  It's fun to see La Forge, a  junior lieutenant, face all the problems of command.  He contends with  threats inside and outside the ship as a ranking officer tries to take over  the ship and La Forge stands he ground saying only Captain Picard or First  Officer Riker can relieve him of duty.  La Forge, along with Worf (acting  as both first officer and tactical officer) and two young ensigns save the  entire senior staff and the Enterprise from destruction. Solid episode  and one of a very few TNG stories that spotlights La Forge.  This is THE La  Forge episode to own.  And one of only a few first season highlights.
