 An excellent read, if romance doesn't turn you off, though there is plenty of action and Stasheff's brand of witty dialogue present.  Cordelia and Geoffrey Gallowglass share the spotlight in this one as Geoffrey tries to  soften Prince Alain's character so that he will be worthy of Cordelia.  It  makes for a fun-filled, romantic adventure.
