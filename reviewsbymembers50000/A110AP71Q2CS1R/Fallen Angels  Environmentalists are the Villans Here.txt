 Fallen Angels, in the guise of science fiction, gives us a look at a possible future using real science, not the pseudo-science of today's environmental mysticism movement.  It helps that two of the novel's three  authors are scientists as well. Fallen Angels focuses on a U.S.  government that has been taken over by socialists and anti-technology  environmentalists (Al Gore anyone?).  Individual rights and freedom of  choice are no longer priorities in this new regime.  It's more important to  get rid of technology that may be (or may not be) harmful to the  environment.  The only problem with this is that when one puts a stop to  the advancement of technology, one also puts a stop to human achievement  and the human spirit. And who are the protagonists of the book?  Science  fiction fans.  Now that is worth the price of the book alone.
