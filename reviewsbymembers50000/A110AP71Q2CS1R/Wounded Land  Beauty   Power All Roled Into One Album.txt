 If you like the heavy, less technical side of Dream Theater, the epic side of Ayreon and the darker side of Shadow Gallery, this album is for you. The vocals are very good, the double guitar attack pounds  relentlessly and the keyboard provides a mystical, ominous element. This  is progressive metal at it's finest.  And no technical silliness is  present, either.  Threshold knows the value of good songwriting.
