 Epic metal. That is what Savatage is: epic metal.  Way back in the early '80s, Savatage started off as a Black Sabbath/Judas Priest-type band.  As the years went by, Savatage began adding progressive and art-rock influeces  to their sound.  The result was a type of heavy metal that is pompous,  dramatic and extravagant.  The rssult is epic metal not unlike that of Iron  Maiden. This is metal that uses the piano on nearly ever song, courtesy  of Jon Oliva.  Zak Stevens, Savatage's vocalist, has a voice that is very  much opera-ish but with an edge to it -- it's a combination of Geoff Tate  (Queensryche) and James Hetfield (Metallica).  The music on The Wake of  Magellan can be heavy and powerful or soft and enchanting -- sometimes in  the same song.  Highlights include the powerful and dark "Blackjack  Guillotine", the fast-paced "Turns To Me", the epic  "The Wake of Magellan" and the sprawling finale, "The  Hourglass".  Similiar bands MIGHT be Judas Priest, Royal Hunt, Iron  Maiden, Queen and Ayreon but Savatage has a unique sound all their own and  any comparisons I make do not do Savatage justice.  Savatage is, simply  put, Savatage.
