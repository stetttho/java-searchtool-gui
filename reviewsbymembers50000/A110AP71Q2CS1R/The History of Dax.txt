 The Trill are a very interesting species.  They are two seperate species who live as one.  You have the worm-thing that, because of an environmental disaster hundreds of years ago on the Trill homeworld, needs to form a  symbiotic relationship with a humanoid (the other half of the Trill).  Now,  not all humanoid Trill qualify to host the worm-things in their chest  (belly?) but those that do, bond with the worms for life.  Only problem is  that the worm-things live a heck of a lot longer than the humanoids do.   Jadzia the humanioid is the current host of Dax the worm but there have  been several previous humanoid hosts and, through Trill ritual, we get to  meet 'em all in "Facets".  It's about time!  The hints of what  Dax's former hosts were like have been dropping since the beginning of  DS9's run but here we finally see who they were. This is a solid episode  and it was satisfying to finally find out about all of Dax's previous  hosts.  Jadzia and Curzon we know about, as well as the homicidal Joran but  it was finding out about the others that made this episode fun for me.  A  politician, a musician, a gymnast, a pilot -- Dax has had many incarnations  and many stories.  Good episode!
