 Take the bluesy swagger of Aerosmith and the Rolling Stones, add a guitar sound similar to AC/DC's, throw in the sleaze metal of Motley Crue and pour it into a bag, shake it up and you get bluesy hair metal band Cinderella.   The recipe works.  Some highlights on this wonderful "best of"  collection include: "Shake Me" - This song is very AC/DC-ish in  style, nothing complicated on the guitar here, just a good, hard rocker.   "Nobody's Fool" - "Nobody's Fool" really shows  Cinderella's range as musicians.  This is an excellent Def Leppard-like  ballad. "Gypsy Road" - This is a swaggering rocker, sounding  maybe a bit like Aerosmith and Motley Crue at times. Great song, maybe  Cinderella's best.  "Coming Home" - Cinderella at their best.   This is an excellent ballad played with an acoustic guitar and may be my  favorite Cinderella song.  Very emotional and very moving. This is one of  the better compilation albums I've heard and, unlike many so-called  "best of" albums, Once Upon A... is pretty much complete. Every  song that should be on it is on it.  So, if you are a casual Cinderella fan  (like me), Once Upon A... is probably what you are looking for.
