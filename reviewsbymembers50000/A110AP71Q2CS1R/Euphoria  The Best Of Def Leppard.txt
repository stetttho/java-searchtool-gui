 Def Leppard claims that Euphoria is a return to the Pyromania/Hysteria sound and style.  That isn't quite what I hear when I listen to Euphoria but this is a good album, anyway. The rockers fare better on this album  moreso than do the ballads.  The fast-paced "Demolition Man", the  epic "Paper Sun" and the '70s glam rock-influenced "21st  Century Sha La La La Girl" are the highlights on this excellent  release.  Other noteworthy songs include the dark "Day After  Day", the radio-friendly rocker "Promises", the catchy  "Guilty" and the Satriani-like instrumental  "Disintegrate".  Unfortunately, as I stated earlier, the ballads  keep this album from being a five star cd.  But that's okay, Def Leppard is  back. Is Euphoria Pyromania plus Hysteria?  No.  I find that while  Euphoria does have many similarities to Hysteria, the similarities to  Adrenalize, Retro Active and even Slang are stronger than the Pyromania  similarities.  If you took the best moments off of Retro Active, Slang and  Adrenalize, mixed it with the powerful pop-metal of Hysteria, you'd end up  with Euphoria.  So, in a way, Euphoria is the best of Def  Leppard. Euphoria is Adrenalize on steroids, it's Hysteria injected with  the best of Slang.  It's the best of post-Pyromania Def Leppard.
