 Though I do have vocalist DC Cooper's solo album and his two releases while a member of Royal Hunt (Paradox and Moving Target), this is my first experience with Silent Force (I don't have Silent Force's debut album).  And I am not disappointed.  The brand of music Silent Force plays is Judas Priest influenced power metal.  In fact, the end result sounds like a combination of Priest and power metal act Kamelot.  Former Sinner guitarist Alex Beyrodt has shown me that he is one of the best guitarists in power metal.  His style is aggressive and razor sharp.  The songs vary from Painkiller-era Priest tunes like "Infatuator" to straight ahead European-style power metal songs like "We Must Use the Power".  All in all, this is good package of music.  It should please Judas Priest fans and fans of European power metal bands such as Kamelot and Stratovarius.  It doesn't hurt that DC Cooper may be the best vocalist in all of metal.
