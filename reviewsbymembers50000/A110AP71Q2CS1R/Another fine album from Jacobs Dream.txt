 Jacobs Dream's new vocalist is Chaz Bond who replaces David Taylor on vocals.  While David Taylor sounds somewhat like a cross between Bruce Dickinson (Iron Maiden) and Geoff Tate (Queensryche), Chaz Bond brings to mind Eric Clayton (Saviour Machine), Gene Adam (Iced Earth's first vocalist), Geoff Tate (circa The Warning) and Matt Barlow (Iced Earth's third vocalist).  All in all, Chaz Bond is probably a better vocalist than David Taylor.  Bond has better range and always seems to be in control whereas some listeners were turned off by Taylor's falsetto and lack of range.  The songs here are an improvement over Theater of War (an uneven release) but still don't equal JD's powerful 2000 self-titled debut.  The music effectively combines Warning-era Queensryche, Awaken the Guardian-era Fates Warning and classic Iron Maiden.  There isn't a bad song on the disc though it should be noted that Drama of the Ages lacks truly great songs (even though Theater of War was inconsistent from song to song, there were two outstanding tracks present).  This is a good disc and should please fans of Jacobs Dream.
