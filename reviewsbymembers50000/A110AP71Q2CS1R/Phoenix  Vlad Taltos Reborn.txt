 In Steven Brust's sixth novel of the Vlad Taltos series, our "hero" (Vlad Taltos) attempts to come to terms with his role as an assassin, his "racism" and his job as a crime-lord.  Vlad  begins to realize that, perhaps, what he does for a living is wrong.  He  then confronts his weaknesses head on.  Add to this the fact that everyone  in the book is trying to kill him and you are in for the ride of your  life. If you want to try something new and you are tired of all the  J.R.R. Tolkien clones that make up epic fantasy today, give Steven Brust  and the Vlad Taltos novels a shot.  This is irreverent "epic"  fantasy.  And thank goodness for it. Note: I would start with the first  Vlad Taltos novel, Taltos, and continue with Dragon, Yendi, Jhereg, Teckla,  Phoenix, Athyra and Orca.  That wasn't the order they were written in but  it's the order in which they take place.
