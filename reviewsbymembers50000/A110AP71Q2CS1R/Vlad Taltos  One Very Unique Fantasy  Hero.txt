 The thing I most like about Vlad Taltos (the "star" of Steven Brust's Vlad Taltos series) is that he is Mr. Sarcasm.  He's surrounded by all these mighty warlords and sorcerers and noblemen yet he does not fear  pissing them off with his sarcastic wit and disrespectful comments.  It's  funny as heck! Vlad Taltos is an assassin and a minor mob boss in this  novel.  There are eight Vlad Taltos novels in all and this one (Taltos) is  the best one to start with (even though it was the fourth written).  Good  book -- it turns your typical epic fantasy on it's ear.  Vlad is hired to  steal (he isn't a thief, he's an assassin!) an object for an  "honorable" warlord and a vampire-sorceress.  Somehow, this leads  to Vlad taking a trip to the realm of the dead.  All in a day's work, I  guess. Good novel.  I really enjoy Steven's Brust's work and I think Vlad  Taltos is a most unique fantasy "hero".
