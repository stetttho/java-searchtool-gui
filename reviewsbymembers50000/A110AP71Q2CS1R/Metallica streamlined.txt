 Though the aggressive edge of their earlier work is present, this is a more refined album as Metallica streamlines their approach and boils away some of the excess that was present on ...And Justice For All (I love Justice but the band was in machine gun-mode on that album and they were often excessive and seemed too worried about technique). This album retains the heaviness of earlier releases yet slows down a bit and gives us some of the band's best songwriting to date. Some of my favorite songs include the grinding "Wherever I  May Roam", the heavy riffing of "Of Wolf and Man" and the  powerful "The Unforgiven".  "My Friend of Misery" ranks among Metallica's best songs. After the frenzied excess of ...And Justice For All (my favorite Metallica album), the streamlined song-focused "Black Album" was--and still is--a breath of fresh air.  Metallica doesn't repeat themselves--not then, not now--and I'm glad.
