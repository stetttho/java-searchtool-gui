 Boston, the project of MIT graduate Tom Scholz, stands alone as the greatest debut (rock) album ever.  Scholz knows how to write great songs and the production on Boston is way ahead of it's time.  Do you ever listen  to an older cd and wish it would be remastered because the sound did not  stand the test of time?  Not so with this album, it does not need to be  updated.  Scholz knew what he was doing (a master's degree in engineering  will do that for you). The songs are all staples of classic rock radio  from the emotional masterpiece "More Than A Feeling" to the  rockin' "Smokin'" and the epic "Foreplay/Long Time",  this album is brilliant.  You can sense the depth and feel the emotion in  every note.  Scholz has a talent for writing very melodic guitar parts  coupled with extremely catchy vocal melodies.  The lyrics aren't complex  (you don't get that with Boston) but who cares?  The songs are great.    Brad Delp should also be noted for his amazing vocals.  This guy is one  of the best. I never tire of this album.  It is truly one of the great  rock albums of all time.  Thanks, Tom, you made Boston what they were and  still are today.
