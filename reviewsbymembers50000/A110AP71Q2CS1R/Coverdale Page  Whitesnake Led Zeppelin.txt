 The pairing of Whitesnake frontman David Coverdale and guitar legend Jimmy Page (Led Zeppelin) works.  New trails into musical lands are not forged nor are any musical barriers pushed back.  Instead, we simply get good  music.  Nothing mind-blowing to be sure but "just" good  songs. "Shake My Tree" and "Pride and Joy" are equal  parts Zeppelin and 'Snake and two of the best songs on the album -- they  both rock.  "Whisper A Prayer for the Dying" is a powerful  semi-ballad and the epic "Absolution Blues" sounds like vintage  Zeppelin.  The other songs that round out Coverdale/Page are good (you will  find that some of your favorites differ from mine), all sounding like a  good mix of Whitesnake and Zeppelin (maybe leaning a bit more toward  Zeppelin). Jimmy Page does his best work here since his Zeppelin days.   David Coverdale avoids the hair metal cliches so you needn't worry about  sub-standard or corny lyrics.  Coverdale is no Robert Plant when it comes  to the lyrics (assuming Coverdale wrote the lyrics, the album jacket simply  states "all songs written by Jimmy Page and David Coverdale") but  cheesiness is avoided anyway. I picked up this album as a  "blind" purchase.  I was pleasantly surprised with the result:  Coverdale/Page is a good album.
