 The Ringworld Throne starts off good enough but the later third of the novel seems to lose it's way.  It is still a good read but could have been better with a bit more cohesion at the end, it becomes too complicated.  I  still give it 4 stars because the first two-thirds of the novel is very  good but, to be honest, I almost gave this book 3 stars because the story  just didn't pay off.
