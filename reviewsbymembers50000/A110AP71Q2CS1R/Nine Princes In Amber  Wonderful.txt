 Nine Princes in Amber was the first Roger Zelazny novel I read.  And I wasn't disappointed at all.  The story is fast-paced and exciting.  The primary character, Prince Corwin, is cocky and irreverent but basically a  good guy.  He struggles against his brothers for control over the one, true  reality: The magical realm of Amber. If you're tired of epic fantasy with  it's too-serious nature and pompousity, I'd recommend Nine Princes in Amber  (the first of ten in the Amber series).  It's good stuff.  If you like  Steven Brust, try Zelazny.  It's clear that Zelazny influenced Brust's  writing.
