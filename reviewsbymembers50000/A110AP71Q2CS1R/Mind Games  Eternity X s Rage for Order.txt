 If Eternity X's Operation: Mindcrime (Queensryche) is their third full-length album the Edge, then Mind Games (ETX's second album) is Eternity X's Rage for Order. Like Rage for Order, Mind Games is a horrific journey into the darker side of the human soul. Where Rage for Order questioned technological progress, Mind Games is more psychological than technological. Mind Games gives us a glimpse of the darker side of human nature: Suicide, mental illness and depression are all themes that Eternity X tackles on this album. And they do it brilliantly. Eternity X does progressive metal better than anybody. Mind Games is progressive music at it's finest.  Maybe not a masterpiece, but it does come close. Eternity X does have many similarities to Queensryche.  Other bands I'd compare ETX to (at least on this album) include Megadeth, Iron Maiden and Rush.
