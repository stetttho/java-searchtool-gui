 Some will say that Jacobs Dream does nothing new on their self-titled debut.  But when the songwriting is this strong, does it really matter? Jacobs Dream has a sound and style that is reminiscent of '80s Iron Maiden, early Queensryche and Arch-era Fates Warning.  And the best thing about Jacobs Dream is that they are not pale imitators of the aforementioned bands but instead they combine some of the best elements of those bands rather sucessfully. Jacobs Dream's vocalist is very good, one of the better vocalists in the prog/power metal genre.  His voice sounds like a mix of Iron Maiden's Bruce Dickinson, Queensryche's Geoff Tate and Rush's Geddy Lee.  The vocal melodies are very catchy and the guitar work (which actually comes off as a mix of early Metallica and Queensryche) is filled with great riffs and hooks.  There isn't any bad songs on this disc. This band is writing some very good stuff and I look forward to future releases from Jacobs Dream.  This release is definitely for fans of classic Iron Maiden, classic Queenryche and early Fates Warning.
