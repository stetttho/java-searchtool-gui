 Yin and Yang, dark and light, good and bad...Tooth and Nail.  An album that hits as much as it misses. Dokken scores high with the opening instrumental "Without Warning" -- great tune.  The title track,  "Tooth and Nail", is...not great.  "Just Got Lucky" is  okay and "Heartless Heart" is not good.  "Don't Close Your  Eyes" does nothing for me but that's okay, we've reached the best part  of the album... ..."When Heaven Comes Down" is a blistering  metal tune that rocks and ROCKS!  "Into the Fire" is powerful and  guitarist George Lynch really pours on the catchy guitar work here.   "Bullets to Spare" isn't that good but "Alone Again" is  perhaps the best metal ballad I've ever heard.  The album closes with the  fast-paced, thundering and excellent "Turn on the Action". Good  album with too many misses to make it a five star affair but the hits are  enough to make this a four star release. Musically, Dokken's Tooth &  Nail will remind you of the Scorpions, Van Halen, White Lion and even  Journey.
