 Robert Jordan does nothing new here with "The Eye of the World" as it applies to epic fantasy.  I've just about given up with epic fantasy because so many authors are pale copycats of the great Tolkien.  But, for  some reason, I liked this book.  No, it wasn't great.  And I'm still  bothered by one thing about epic fantasy: the destiny and fate elements --  and this book includes those.  Why are characters willing slaves to destiny  and fate, the enemies of freedom and individuality?  "The Eye of the  World" is no exception, many of the characters calmly accept destiny  (or enslavement, as I call it) with a shrug of the shoulders and a sigh.   Just once I would love to see a character say "no" to  destiny/fate... But I liked the book anyway.  It was because the  character development was good and Jordan draws a good picture with his  words.  I admit, I had a difficult time starting the book but where I was  slow to start, I finished the novel quickly.  While Jordan is another pale  copycat of Tolkien, he's a good pale copycat. And I'm looking forward to  reading the next book in the series.
