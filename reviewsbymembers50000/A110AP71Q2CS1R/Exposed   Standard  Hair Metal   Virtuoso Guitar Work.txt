 Do you like Motley Crue?  Billy Idol?  Damn Yankess?  What about GREAT guitar work? Pick up this album, man, what are you waiting for?   Former Motley Crue vocalist Vince Neil teams with former Billy Idol guitarist  Steve Stevens and the result is some damn, fine hair metal.  Vince Neil,  Steve Stevens, former Ozzy bassist Phil Soussan, Jack Blades of Night  Ranger/Damn Yankees and Tommy Shaw of Styx/Damn Yankees write all the songs  on this album.  It's a good combo and it works (Soussan, Blades and Shaw  don't play on this release, by the way).  Steve Stevens gives us guitar  work that really smokes, maybe somewhat like Steve Vai or Joe Satriani and  even Adrian Vandenburg in style.  So what we have here is good hair metal  with virtuoso guitar playing.  This album rocks with a sassy, sleazy  attitude and all the songs are catchy and infectious, this could easily be  mistaken for a Motley Crue album (depending on which songs you are  listening to). Seriously, the guitar work on this album is as good as  I've made it out to be.  Normally, hair metal isn't associated with  virtuoso playing but there have been exceptions (Extreme, White Lion) and  this is one of those exceptions. If this CD had been released in the '80s  or very early '90s, it would have been a huge hit.  Unfortunately, Vince  Neil's debut album was released in '93.  And by that time, grunge ruled the  airwaves.
