 If you have just about had it with epic fantasy and it's mockery--it's parody--of J.R.R. Tolkien and the Lord of the Rings, give Glen Cook's The Black Company a shot. This ain't no weenie fantasy novel.  No Gandalf, Frodo and Aragorn clones here (Robert Jordan and Terry Brooks take note!).  This is a novel about realistic characters.  Characters who aren't evil nor good.  They're both.  Like real people.  Like you and me.  They are colored gray, not black or white. The novel follows the misadventures of a group of mercenaries.  The story is told through the eyes of Croaker, the doctor/annalist of the mercenaries.  It's a fascinating little romp--at times, very dark in it's imagery.  But it is realistic.  There are no knights in shining armor riding white horses to save the day.  There is just a bunch of mercenary soldiers trying to make a buck. These are guys like you and me.  Just trying to the best they can--sometimes they fail, sometimes they succeed. If you like fantasy authors Roger Zelazny and Steven Brust, you'll love Glen Cook.
