 "The Sword of Kahless" had everything going for it: Potential upheavel in Klingon politics, the return of Kor (from the Original Series  and an earlier episode of DS9), the return of Toral (a son of one of Worf's  biggest enemies, Duras) and, of course, Klingons! When Worf, Jadzia Dax  and Kor find the location of the Sword of Kahless (the Klingons' version of  Excalibur), they must race to find the sword before renegade Klingon Toral  can.  Whomever holds the Sword of Kahless will be able to wield  considerable influence in Klingon politics, you see (it's as if Kahless,  the "father" of all Klingons, has chosen his heir), and Worf and  Kor want to make sure that that isn't Toral.  Good premise but the story is  poorly executed and, in the end, the status quo remains unchanged.  Klinogn  political upheavel would have been fun! This episode could've been a lot  better.
