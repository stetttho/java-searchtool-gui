 Star Trek: The Next Generation frequently explored the Klingon species, their government and their history.  Many of TNG's best episodes revolved around Klingon political intrigue and Klingon culture.  Season six's  "Rightful Heir" continues this tradition of stories that focus on  one of Trek's most interesting species.  But, this time, it isn't wholly  satisfying. The story is this: A group of fanatical Klingon monks, in an  attempt to fulfill the prophetic return of the "father" of  Klingon honor and religion, clone Kahless and succeed in making this  prophecy come true.  At first, they hide the fact that this Kahless is, in  fact, a clone.  The Enterprise soon uncovers this scandal but even though  Kahless the Clone may not be the "real" Kahless, at the least, he  is Kahless's heir.  Chancellor Gowron, the current leader of the Klingon  Empire, takes exception to this clone of the Klingons' spiritual leader and  first emperor and civil war is threatened because this Kahless figures that  HE should be leader.  The Federation does not want civil war to break out  so a compromise is reached between Gowron, Kahless and the Federation.  Lt.  Worf, the Enterprise's Klingon security chief, plays a key role in this  good but somehow unsatisfying episode. I'm not sure why this episode left  me wanting.  Maybe I was hoping that this would be the real Kahless and not  a clone.  But that would have been too gutsy for Star Trek: The Next  Generation, a series which arrogantly denounces religion as superstitious  and foolish.  As if the creators/writers/producers of TNG know it  all. Oh, well.  A good episode nonetheless.
