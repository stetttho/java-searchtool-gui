 Zodiac is best described as "progressive pop (heavy) metal". I can't compare this album with any others because this is a highly unusual and unique release. Maybe if you like Queensryche and Iron Maiden, but aren't afraid of pop metal elements, this album is for you.  In fact, it is heavier than Iron Maiden, but with catchier vocal melodies. Zodiac is a concept album that includes a song for each sign of the zodiac.  "Aries" is a killer song--very heavy and aggressive, "Libra" has a powerful epic feel to it (even though it is only a four minute song) and "Leo" is fun yet thrashy and heavy.  These are just some of the highlights. Vocalist/songwriter Keith Sudano is one of the best prog metal vocalists ever.  He can go from Geoff Tate smooth to James LaBrie harsh.  Bassist Zeek is clearly from the Steve Harris (Iron Maiden) school of bass guitarists.  And guitarist Kevin Riepl sounds like a mix of Eddie Van Halen and Maiden's classic guitar duo Dave Murray and Adrian Smith.  That's a great combination. Like I said, Iron Maiden and pop metal fans will love this cd.
