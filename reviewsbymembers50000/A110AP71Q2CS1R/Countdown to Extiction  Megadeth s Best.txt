 Countdown to Extinction, in my opinion, is Megadeth's best album. I know that many "old time" Megadeth fans look at this release as the beginning of the decline of Megadeth. But that is hogwash! CTE is Megadeth's best! You know why? Because Dave Mustaine has finally matured as a songwriter. Rust in Peace is good, but it was still a bit rough around the edges. CTE is polished yet maintains the aggression Megadeth fans love. Sure, the speed metal of previous efforts is almost non-existent on CTE. But that's okay. The guitar riffs are still brutal and thrashy, the drumming is still heavy and the vocal attack of Dave Mustaine is still gruff and in-your-face. The title track, "Countdown to Extiction", is a great mix of heavy metal and semi-mainstream, catchy vocal melodies. "Symphony of Destruction" is a bruising, dark tune that pummels the listener with every chord. "Psychotron" is Mustaine at his gruff and growly best and the chorus soars! "Sweating Bullets" is a nasty, ominous tune that makes one want to beat up the neighbor after listening to it (I'm kidding). Nearly all the songs here are good. No, this isn't Rust in Peace.  Megadeth need not repeat themselves.  This is Countdown to Extiction, Megadeth's best.
