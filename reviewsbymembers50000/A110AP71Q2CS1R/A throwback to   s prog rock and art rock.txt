 Mixing elements of 70s prog rock and art rock, Ayreon's the Dream Sequencer is a good album, though not quite on the level of other Ayreon albums--specifically The Final Experiment and Into the Electric castle. The Dream Sequencer is part 1 of the Universal Migrator series.  Unlike part 2 (Flight of the Migrator), The Dream Sequencer is a more relaxing, ambient disc.  Elements of Pink Floyd, ELP and even the Beatles can be heard here.  But the Dream Sequencer is not totally devoid of the pomp and bombast of previous Ayreon albums.  There are bombastic moments present, most notably the excellent "My House on Mars".  But, overall this is a disc that paints Pink Floydian landscapes for the listener--with dashes of ELP and the Beatles thrown in for good measure.. Good disc.  If you like Pink Floyd, you'll get a kick out of this one.  In fact, Arjen Lucassen, the mastermind behind Ayreon, performs a few David Gilmour-like guitar solos on the cd.   And Mr. Lucassen has a knack for writing beautiful vocal melodies.  Nearly every song on this album has memorable vocal melodies which, in turn, are sung by a variety of different vocalists.
