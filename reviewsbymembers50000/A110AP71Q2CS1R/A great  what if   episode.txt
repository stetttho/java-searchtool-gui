 Two things make "Parallels" great: 1. It's a Worf episode.  You can't go wrong there. 2. It features parallel (or alternate) realities.  Trek has almost always been successful with this type of episode.  Remember classic Trek's "Mirror, Mirror"?  Or TNG's "Yesterday's Enterprise"?  You get the idea. It's fun to see our favorite characters in new roles.  As Worf bounces around from reality to reality (he hit one of those time warp/quantum flux space anomalies that seem so common in Trek), we see an Enterprise where Captain Picard was lost to the Borg, Riker is now the Captain and Worf is Riker's first officer.  We see a reality where Wesley Crusher is the chief security/tactical officer.  Another reality has a Cardassian flight control officer and the Federation is at war with the Bajorans!  And in yet another reality, Worf is married to Troi!  Fun all around! Usually, this type of episode would feature Riker or Picard or Data as the central character bouncing through parallel universe to parallel universe.  But this time it is Worf.  It isn't that Worf doesn't get his own stories (only Picard and Data had more in TNG's seven year run), it's just that Worf stories are generally tied into Klingon politics or raising his son Alexander.  It's nice that we get to see Worf as the central character in an episode dealing with time and space rather than the interworkings of Klingon politics. Strong episode and one of TNG's best.  It is a darn, fun episode, too.  Worf as first officer...what could have been...
