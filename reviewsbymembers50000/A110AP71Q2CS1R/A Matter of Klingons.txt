 Cultural education and social exploration aside, this episode rocks!  It is fun to see Klingons from an outsider's perspective, true, but it's fun to see Klingons period.  "A Matter of Honor" showcases Commander  Riker and it is Riker at his very best.  The only comparable Riker episodes  (in quality) might be "The Pegasus" and "Second  Chances".  As Riker attempts to fit in with a Klingon crew as their  first officer, he first must gain the crew's respect.  This is no easy task  for a "weakling human" but Riker succeeds is showing the Klingons  that he is no weakling and will not be bullied.  Riker learns a lot about  this pround species and, in the end, the Klingons learn a bit about humans,  too.  The result is that both Riker and this crew of Klingon ruffians grow  and mature.  And when Riker returns to the Enterprise, there is a sense of  understanding and camraderie between him and the Enterprise's resident  Klingon, Lt. Worf. Great episode, maybe the best of season two.
