 After hearing the God Thing for the first time, I'm reminded strongly of Dream Theater.  The keyboards, drums and guitar have strong similarities to Dream Theater (think Images & Words or Awake). But after subsequent  listens, other similarities stand out on this excellent cd.  I find that  the guitar actually reminds me of Dokken and Conception just as much as it  does Dream Theater.  The vocals remind me of Conception, too.  Though  Vanden Plas's vocalist has a higher range than does Roy S. Khan of  Conception, they both have similar voices.  The music is strong and  powerful and Vanden Plas concentrates on writing great songs rather than  self-indulgent technical silliness.  This is where Vanden Plas has the  potential to be superior to Dream Theater, they (Vanden Plas) know what  music is about.   Progressive metal is about musical innovation, not  technical masturbation. If you like Dream Theater and Conception, I think  you may like Vanden Plas.
