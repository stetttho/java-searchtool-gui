 Since the release of Empire (1990), Queensryche's ability to write great songs has somehow been lost.  No surprise, really, considering their best songwriter, Chris DeGarmo, left the band before Q2k was written.  Yes,  Queensryche's last two albums with Chris weren't exactly great but at least  they were decent.  Chris's absence shows.  Q2k is, in my opinion, an awful  album.  It is just awful songwriting.
