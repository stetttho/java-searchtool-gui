 This album, along with ...And Justice For All, is Metallica at their best. It still has some of the edge of their earlier work (which is a good thing) but it is a more refined and mature album. I'm not a big fan of the speed/thrash metal of some of the earlier albums so I like the fact that this CD retains the heaviness of earlier releases without the speed (for the most part). And while later Metallica works have lost some of the edge (though the sellout argument is not a theory I buy into), this disc is the "middle ground" disc where Metallica does everything right. That may upset a few old-time Metallica fans, but I like what I like.  Some of my favorite songs here include the grinding "Wherever I May Roam", the heavy riffing of "Of Wolf and Man" and the powerful "The Unforgiven". The opening bass solo on "My Friend of Misery" (my favorite song here) is cool as is the rest of this angry song. "The God That Failed" is another standout in the same vein as "My Friend of Misery".  And though Metallica has taken a ton of grief over "Nothing Else Matters", it is still a good, introspective song--cries of sellout don't measure up to good songwriting, friends.  This is a damn, good album with only the occasional song that leaves me wanting ("Holier Than Thou", "Through the Never"). And while I do like Load (I can hear the angry gasps), the sound and style Metallica achieved on this album (and ...And Justice For All) is the sound and style I prefer most. The strong songwriting coupled with the attitude here can't be beat.
