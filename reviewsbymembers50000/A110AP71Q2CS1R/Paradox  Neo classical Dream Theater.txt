 Well, yeah -- kinda, sorta. Royal Hunt would be best described as a neo-classical/progressive metal band.  To my ears, Royal Hunt is a pretty even mix of Dream Theater, Shadow Gallery and neo-classical rock.  People  often compare Royal Hunt's neo-classical side to Yngwie Malmsteen.  But it  is the keyboards, courtesy of Andre Andersen (Royal Hunt's main  songwriter), that give Royal Hunt a neo-classical sound, not the guitar.   The guitar is more straight forward, kinda reminding me of George Lynch's  style of playing at times. This is a very good cd which borders on  greatness from time to time.   D.C. Cooper should also be noted for his  excellent vocals.  I think of him as an even mix of Mike Baker (Shadow  Gallery), James LaBrie (Dream Theater) and Dennis DeYoung (Styx) when it  comes to his voice.  That's a dang good combination. The songs are a bit  too much alike at times but they are good.  Many "progressive"  bands like to indulge in instrumental excessiveness but Royal Hunt never  goes overboard.  They come close but they never cross the line that  seperates technical silliness from tasteful instrumentals. Good album.
