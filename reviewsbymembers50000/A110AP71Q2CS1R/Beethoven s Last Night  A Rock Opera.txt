 TSO does it again.  While not as good as their first release (1996's Christmas Eve & Other Stories -- what album is that good?), Beethoven's Last Night is a solid cd.  The story behind the album is great and the  music is fine but perhaps a bit redundant -- maybe too much like the music  on The Christmas Attic (TSO's second album).  A shot of originality is not  really present to any great degree.  But TSO still manages to create  another fine cd. Beethoven's Last Night includes compositions by Mozart  and Beethoven and mixes this with rock opera (think Meatloaf), art-rock  (think Queen), hard rock and even a touch of metal.  If this combination  sounds good and you've enjoyed TSO's previous albums, I think you will like  Beethoven's Last Night.  Plus, if you like more recent releases from epic  metal band Savatage (Dead Winter Dead, The Wake of Magellan), you will  likely enjoy this album as well. After all, TSO is a side-project of  Savatage.
