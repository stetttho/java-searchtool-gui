 Though not as outrageously funny as the Nitpicker's Guide to Classic Star Trek, this volume had me, a grown man, giggling like a naughty schoolgirl (and that's quite a confession).  All the inconsistencies and plot  oversights are handled by a very sarcastic and wry author (Phil Farrand)  who knows how to make us laugh at a great but sometimes pretentious and  pompous TV show in Star Trek: The Next Generation. I've had this book for  quite sometime and I still go back and read parts of it every now and again  when I need a laugh. This book is for the serious Trekker (or Trekkie)  who can take a joke.
