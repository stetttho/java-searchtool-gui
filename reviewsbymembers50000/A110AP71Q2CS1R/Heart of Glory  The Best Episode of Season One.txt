 Star Trek: The Next Generation got off to a rocky beginning.  Season one  was rough with very few bright spots.  The producers and writers had yet to  make TNG consistently good so it was without great expectations that I  watched episode 20, "Heart of Glory", for the first time way back  in 1988.  I'm lying.  I had HUGE expectations for this episode because the  previews promised the first Worf story and, more importantly,  Klingons! When the Enterprise discovers a disabled freighter near the  Neutral Zone, Picard and crew investigate.  What they find is three  renegade Klingon officers who are unhappy with the Federation/Klingon  alliance.  Worf's loyalties are tested by the Klingons but when their  leader, Captain Korris (who is portrayed very convincingly by actor Vaughn  Armstrong), threatens the Enterprise and her crew, Worf shows his true  colors: He's Starfleet, through and through, and no one, not even a fellow  Klingon, threatens his ship and shipmates. Michael Dorn, who has played  Worf on seven seasons of TNG, four seasons of DS9 and three Trek movies,  gets his first chance to shine.  And shine he does.  The audience is  convinced that Worf, though loyal to Picard and company, is an outcast  among Starfleet and his fellow Klingons.  He is a loner who will never  truly fit in.  It's sad yet heroic as we realize, with "Heart of  Glory" and the help of later episodes, that Worf will always be true  to himself and what he believes is right, no matter the cost.  And the cost  will be very high as later episodes will illustrate... Great episode!   One of my all-time favorites of ANY Trek series.
