 Are "lovable" Klingon friend from The Next Generation joins the crew of Deep Space Nine.   The Federation is in a delicate situation with both the Cardassian Union and the Klingon Empire.  The Klingons, allies of  the Federation, want to wipe out the Cardassians but the Federation won't  have it.  That will fall into the plans of the powerful Dominion who wants  to see all their opponents wipe each other out.  It makes it easier for  them to take over, ya see. Captain Sisko has a problem.  And, he figures,  that the best way to deal with Klingons is to get help from a Klingon.   Enter Lt. Commander Worf. I love how Worf interacts with the other  characters on DS9.  He's a man who never has fit in anywhere he's ever  gone.  He finally felt as if he had a home on the Enterprise but the ship  was destroyed several months prior to his arrival on DS9.  Worf is the  ultimate outcast in the Star Trek universe and I really feel for this guy  as he tries to reason and fit in with the Klingons while representing  Federation interests.  It's no easy task but, even though Worf partially  fails, he finds a home.  It's a place he does not fit into (even though DS9  harbors it's share of outcasts) but that's what great drama is about:  Conflict. Worf was a very welcome addition to Deep Space Nine.  His  interaction with all the characters, from Sisko and Dax to O'Brien and Odo,  is a welcome change of pace for DS9 as this excellent series embarks on  it's most exciting season yet.
