 Three stars?  Okay, maybe three and one-half stars. The full name of this album is "Ten More Tales of Grand Illusion". Ten interesting "tales", indeed. Imagine a band who's vocalist is  in the Brad Delp (Boston)/Steve Perry (Journey)/Dennis DeYoung (Styx) vein.   Okay, now imagine that same vocalist singing vocal melodies that are  reminiscent of Boston, Journey and Queensryche.  Are you with me so far?   Now add a guitar that reminds me of Dokken at their heaviest -- times two  -- and even a bit like Iced Earth's (guitars).  Now throw in a keyboard in  the Kamelot style and sound.  This is Balance of Power. It is an  interesting combination of music styles: arena rock plus power metal with  progressive tendencies.  I've never heard a band quite like Balance of  Power.  Ten More Tales... isn't a great cd but it is solid album and a  satisfying listen.  The songs are all good and catchy and the production is  perfect.  The song "Day Breaker" is equal parts Journey and  Dokken (but heavier), "Prisoner of Pride" is Boston meets Iced  Earth and  "Savage Tears" sounds like Empire-era Queensryche  coupled with recent Kamelot.  I would think that if you are a fan of arena  rock bands such as Boston and Journey and a fan of power metal (like  Kamelot) and progressive metal (Queensryche), that this cd is for you.
