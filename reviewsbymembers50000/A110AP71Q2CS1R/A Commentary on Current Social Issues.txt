 The Deep Space Nine episode "Rejoined", in which Jadzia Dax is reunited with the wife of one of her previous hosts (the Trill are a "joined species", you see), is sloppy in it's approach.    Essentially, DS9's creators ridicule, through their characters, those who  have a problem with homosexuality (this is what this episode is really  about, both Trill are women, you see).  While it is politically correct for  intolerant people to use tolerance as a weapon against those they claim are  intolerant (so-called "homophobics", in this case), homosexuality  is never even mentioned (it's Trill "traditionalists" who frown  on relationships where past hosts are involved) but the message is  clear. All that aside, this episode comes off as nothing more than a  story about two hot women who want to "get it on".  And in this  respect, the episode succeeds.  I'm sure twenty-year-old men everywhere  will enjoy this wonderfully acted and incredibly sensuous and sexy episode.   I know I didn't.   I hate episodes that bow to political correctness and  beat the viewer over the head with the message.  Classic Trek was better at  this sort of thing and it was subtle in it's social and political moral  story-telling.  Had this episode been more subtle and not so one-sided in  it's approach, I would've probably enjoyed it more.  As it stands, I didn't  like "Rejoined" at all.  But that's just my point-of-view.   Decide for yourselves.
