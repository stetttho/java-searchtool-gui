 In the early '80s, Savatage started out as a Judas Priest/Black Sabbath-type of metal band.  But, with their fifth release (Hall of the Mountain King), they started adding symphomnic and progressive touches to  their "basic" metal sound.  Thus was created Savatage's unique  brand of heavy metal, best described as "epic metal". Streets,  Savatage's seventh studio album, is an epic metal masterpiece.  The  Sabbath/Priest influences are still present but those influences have been  expanded on by the frequent use of the piano (courtesy of lead vocalist Jon  Oliva).   Streets is a concept album about a former rock star, his second  rise to fame and his second fall.  It's an emotional story and the songs  range from soft and introspective to grand and epic and to fast and  furious.  There is something on this album for everyone. Guitarist Criss  Oliva's style of playing reminds me of Randy Rhoads (former Ozzy  guitarist), though most people think Oliva's style is more like Michael  Schenker's (UFO, MSG, Scorpions).  Whomever people compare him to, Criss  Oliva is a darn good guitarist and has a talent for writing and playing  catchy riffs.  Jon Oliva (piano,vocals) sings just fine on the slower and  more introspective tunes but his vocals on the faster, edgier songs does  take some getting used to (obviously, I got used to it). Streets is  easily one of my top ten favorite albums of all-time.  If you like  interesting music, try Streets.  Think of it as a combination of Judas  Priest, Black Sabbath, Meatloaf and John Lennon (there is a couple of very  Lennon-esque tunes on Streets). That's one heckuva combo.
