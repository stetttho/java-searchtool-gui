 The setting for this wondeful fantasy adventure novel is Dragaera, the same world that the Vlad Taltos novels take place in -- except The Phoenix Guards is set about 1000 years before Vlad Taltos is born. Steven Brust  gives us a fine novel that pays homage to Alexander Dumas and The Three  Musketeers.  Political intrigue, high adventure, friendship and romance are  all woven together to create a fantastic story.  The characters are all  well-realized and each has his or her own unique personality. This book  was fun to read.  This novel, though set in a fantasy world with dragons  and magic aplenty, reads more like an adventure novel, which is just fine.   Steven Brust is an excellent writer and The Phoenix Guards is an excellent  book and Brust breaks those stuffy epic fantasy cliches, thank goodness!
