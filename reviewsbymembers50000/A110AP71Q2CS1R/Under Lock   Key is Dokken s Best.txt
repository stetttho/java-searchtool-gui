 As other reviewers have already stated, this is Dokken at their best.  While some of the songs on Under Lock & Key border on "typical" sappy hair metal ("Don't Lie To Me" and  "Jaded Heart"), you still have plenty of songs with a metal edge  to choose from like the brilliant "Unchain the Night", the  powerful "It's Not Love" and the dark "Lightning  Strikes".  And, unlike many other hair metal bands, Dokken's ballads  don't whine and moan but, rather, they soar. I don't know which bands to  compare Dokken to musically.  The Scorpions and White Lion have somewhat  similiar sounds.  I think that Dokken may have been influenced by the  Scorpions and, for that matter, Van Halen while White Lion sounds like they  were, in turn, influenced by Dokken.  Either way, Dokken was a pretty good  band and Under Lock & Key is their best work.  In my opinion, Dokken  never did another album after this one that was as good.  But Dokken's  guitarist, George Lynch, did with Lynch Mob's first release, Wicked  Sensation. Good music and not a bad song on the album.
