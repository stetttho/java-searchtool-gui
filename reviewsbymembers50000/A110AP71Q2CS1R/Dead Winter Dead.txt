 What do you get when you take Black Sabbath and Judas Priest, add the epic metal of Iron Maiden and throw in the "rock opera" of Queen?  Why, you get Savatage, of course! Savatage's brand of epic metal is fully  felt on Dead Winter Dead.  This album is a concept album about the ongoing  war in former Yugoslavia and Savatage does a wonderful job by not being  political but, at the same time, condemning the loss of life.  As you may  guess, Dead Winter Dead is a very dark album.  Metal guitars, piano and, on  occasion, a back-up orchestra give this unique album life.  Highlights  include the terribly dark "I Am", the forceful "Dead Winter  Dead" and the beautifully sad "Not What You See".  Amazing  album but, be warned, because of the dark subject matter, Dead Winter Dead  can be a bit depressing to listen to. If you want to listen to a band  that has a unique approach to metal, try Savatage.  This is thoughful,  intelligent, innovative and emotional music.
