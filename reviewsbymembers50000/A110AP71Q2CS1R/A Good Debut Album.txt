 Often over-shadowed by their other albums Pornograffitti and III Sides, Extreme's self-titled debut is a good hard rock/hair metal release. Extreme combines the funky swagger of Aerosmith, the art-rock approach of Queen and the guitar pyrotechnics of Van Halen on their debut.   There is variety and solid songwriting on this cd.  From the Van  Halen-esque "Teacher's Pet" and "Mutha, Don't Wanna Go To  School Today" to the Queen-like "Watching, Waiting" and  "Rock A Bye Bye" to the funky, Aerosmith-influenced tunes like  "Little Girls" and "Kid Ego", Extreme delivers on all  fronts. And then you get the finale, "Play With Me", which is  just pure fun and 100% Extreme. I'll admit, some of the songs aren't  great but what they lack in greatness, they more than make up for in  energy. Good album.  If you like Van Halen, Queen and Aerosmith, this may  be a cd you can get into.
