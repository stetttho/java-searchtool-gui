 A different kind of hero Vlad Taltos is. A different kind ofwriter Steven Brust most certainly is.  No epic fantasy cliches arefound here and author Steven Brust ain't no Tolkien wannabe.  What we get with Jhereg, Brust's first Vlad Taltos novel but the fourth chronologically, is a story of deceit, politics and assassination -- all with a sarcastic wit.  Brust is a unique fantasy writer with fascinating stories to tell.  Vlad Taltos is a unique fantasy "hero" and you'll love him. What more could a fan of fantasy ask for? There are eight Vlad Taltos novels thus far.  They weren't written in order but I'll list them in chronological order for you because I'm a nice guy: Taltos (I'd start here), Dragon, Yendi, Jhereg, Teckla, Phoenix, Athyra and Orca. I told you I was nice.
