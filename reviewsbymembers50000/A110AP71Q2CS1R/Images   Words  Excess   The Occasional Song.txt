 Sure, the members of Dream Theater are good musicians (if a tad over-hyped) but there is more to music than technical flash.  To compare Dream Theater's guitarist to Joe Satriani is a bit misleading.  Satriani  knows the value of the song and never sacrifices the song in favor of  technical indulgence.  Petrucci could learn a lesson or two from Satriani.   And even though Mike Portnoy is a decent drummer, he is not the best.  Nor  is he even close.  To compare Portnoy to Rush's Peart is misleading.  Like  Satriani, Peart doesn't sacrifice the song in favor of technical  silliness. My seemingly harsh analysis aside, Dream Theater is capable of  writing great songs.  It is unfortunate that they have decided that  technical over-the-topness is more important than great songwriting.  The  truly great progressive bands know when enough is enough and they know the  value of a great song. Images & Words is a mixed bag.  Songs such as  "Pull Me Under", "Another Day", "Surrounded"  and "Wait for Sleep" show us what great music is all about: it's  the songs, stupid. Meanwhile, "Take The Time",  "Metropolis-Part I: The Miracle & The Sleeper", "Under A  Glass Moon" and "Learning To Live" each have their moments  but are bogged down by technical excess and unnecessary flash. It's a  mixed bag.  It's a worthwhile pick-up, though.  There are a few songs I  never tire of but if you really aren't into overly-technical music, skip  it. Note: Images & Words has a Rush/Metallica/Kansas/Queensryche vibe  going for it.
