 One word that describes Van Halen's first album with rocker Sammy Hagar is "energetic".  You can feel the energy pouring out of 5150.  The whole band must have been on a creative high when making this album because  5150 is crackling with energetic fun.  Rockers such as "Get Up",  "5150" and "Good Enough" really show the lightning Van  Halen captured for this recording.  The powerful "Best of Both  Worlds", the soaring "Dreams", the fun "Summer  Nights" and the radio-friendly duo of "Why Can't This Be  Love" and "Love Walks In" are all highlights on this  excellent release. Van Halen builds on their previous album, 1984, with  5150, 1984's natural follow-up.  In fact, even though 1984 is a good album,  I like 5150, with it's high level of energy, even more.  5150 takes 1984's  formula of hard rock, metal & pop-rock and injects it with  electricity. Great album!
