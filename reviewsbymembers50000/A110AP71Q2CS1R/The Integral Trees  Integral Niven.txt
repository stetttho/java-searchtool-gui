 Larry Niven has a knack for creating unique worlds that are not planets.  Ringworld was the first and in the Integral Trees, we are introduced to a world that is essentially a gas ring surrounding a star.  It's a very  clever concept and the humans (their ancestors came from Earth) who inhabit  this world are truly interesting, it's fun to follow the adventures of this  rag-tag tribe as their home is destroyed and they must quest to find a new  one.  Great book, easily Ringworld's equal.
