 When Dream Theater is more concerned with songwriting than technical indulgence, greatness happens. Awake is Dream Theater at their best. Awake is all about great songs.  Whether it is brutally aggressive  tunes like "The Mirror" and "Lie" or soaring beauty  like "Lifting Shadows Off A Dream" or "Space Die Vest",  this album succeeds on every level.  Dream Theater even shows us that they  can be technical and write a great song all at the same time as is the case  with "Erotomania". Unfortunately, Dream Theater has forgotten  the lessons they learned on Awake and has now almost completely left their  progressive side in favor of a more technical direction. But this album  remains a progressive metal masterpiece. If you like prog rock bands such  as Kansas, Rush and early Genesis and you don't mind that type of music  mixed with, say, the heaviness of a Metallica or Queensryche, pick up this  gem of an album.
