 This is metal that is aggressive, epic and classically influenced.  Guitarist Criss Oliva, who has clearly been influenced by the likes of Michael Schenker, Randy Rhoades and Eddie Van Halen, is great here.  His combination of powerful riffs and mind-blowing solos is sure to please most guitar lovers.  His brother, vocalist Jon Oliva, tends to be overly aggresive and screechy at times (Ozzy Osbourne meets Axl Rose perhaps), yet still fits the music well. Highlights include the powerful "Hall of the Mountain King", the dark "24 Hours Ago", the epic "Strange Wings" and the ominous "The Price You Pay". This is just a good, strong cd--the first in a long line of great albums from this band. Similar bands might be Iron Maiden (for the grandeur) and early Ozzy Osbourne (for the great guitar work).  But comparisons are hard to make.  Savatage is an original.
