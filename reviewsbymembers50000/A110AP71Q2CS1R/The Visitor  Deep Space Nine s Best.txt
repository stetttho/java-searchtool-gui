 Through three seasons, Deep Space Nine had struggled to find it's footing.  Season one was uneven and mostly uneventful.  Season two was, surprisingly, strong.  In season three, the producers and writers almost  dropped the ball -- it was a difficult year, to say the least.  With season  four, Deep Space Nine had found itself. With the fourth season premiere,  "The Way of the Warrior", DS9 had re-introduced us to Worf and  dropped intriguing bombshell after bombshell into the faithful viewers'  collective laps.  DS9 fans were eagerly awaiting the season opener's  promise of Klingon politics and station intrigue.  Instead, without  warning, we get "The Visitor", an episode that strayed from the  interstellar war and galactic conflict that the premiere had hinted at.  We  weren't expecting "The Visitor" and had no idea that this episode  would not only become the most popular DS9 episode ever but one of the most  popular episodes of any Trek series. "The Visitor" gives us a  glimpse at an alternate future where Jake Sisko had lost his father to a  mishap right after the events of "The Way of the Warrior".  We  discover through an old Jake that his father wasn't dead but was  "suspended out of time", never aging, never dying yet forever  alone.  Jake, obsessed with rescuing his father, sacrifices his marriage,  his career as a successful writer and, ultimately, his very life all to  save his father, Ben Sisko.  This episode is powerful and tragic.  We  understand Jake's sacrifice but at what cost?  In the end, we see a lonely  old man, who could never move on, attempt to alter the past so he can be  with his dad again. I challenge anyone to NOT cry at the ending.  This  episode is an emotional triumph, DS9's best indeed.
