 Tired of epic fantasy?  Irritated by authors who imitate Tolkien over and over?  Want something new and different? Put this in your glass and drink it. Vlad Taltos is not your typical fantasy hero.  He ain't no farm boy  with a destiny to fulfill nor is he an apprentice to a mighty wizard blah,  blah, blah.  Vlad Taltos is an assassin and mob boss and most of the Vlad  Taltos novels are told from his point of view. Dragon is the eighth Vlad  Taltos novel (but the second one chronologically).  In this one, Vlad joins  the military, fights in a famous battle and nearly gets killed a few times  -- all in the name of revenge.  There is no destiny here, no prophecy that  must be filled, this novel is about simple revenge, greed and not so  honorable honor. This is epic fantasy turned upside-down and spanked on  it's bottom.  And it is great!  Steven Brust certainly puts the likes of  Terry Brooks and Robert Jordan to shame because Brust presents us with new  and unique fantasy.  It's epic fantasy with a sarcastic wit and very  fallible characters. Hey, Dragon and all the Vlad Taltos novels are good  books.  Pick 'em up.
