 The Next Generation's women are weak.  I don't know if this is because the actresses, Gates McFadden as Dr. Crusher, Marina Sirtis as Counslor Troi and (ugh) Denise Crosby as Lt. Yar, were incompetent or the  writers/creators of TNG just did not know how to write women (I suspect the  latter though Crosby is a poor actress regardless) but they just did not do  much on TNG (especially early on) and have, in my opinion, been fairly weak  characters (though both Troi and Crusher grew stronger as characters later  in TNG's run).  I'm not anti-woman here, just anti-bad characters/bad  writers.  I sometimes wonder if our TNG trio of women was hired for their  appearance rather than their acting ability. "Suspicions" is  not a great episode but at least Dr. Crusher is interesting here as she  attempts to solve the murder of a Ferengi scientist.  The mystery is  secondary to me because I'm more interested with Dr. Crusher's rebellion in  this episode.  She defies Starfleet regulations, Federation protocol,  Captain Picard's orders and Ferengi tradition all in the name of justice.   Go Doctor go!  I don't mean to put down the mystery (it's actually fairly  clever) but I appreciated a strong and well-rounded Dr. Crusher more than  the particulars of a "whodunnit". Good episode, I could've  given it four stars instead of three but what the heck.
