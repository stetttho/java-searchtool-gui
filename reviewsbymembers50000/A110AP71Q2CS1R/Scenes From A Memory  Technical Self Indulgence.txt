 Dream Theater only partially succeeds with Scenes From A Memory.  This is more technical metal than progressive metal.  The two are not the same but somehow have become warped and twisted into one genre.  This isn't Dream  Theater's fault, they are likely making the kind of music they want.  But  if you are looking for songs instead of "musical masturbation",  look elswhere.  Admittedly, the songs that are present on Scenes are very  good but there are not very many of them.   I was hoping for progressive  metal with this album.  Instead, I hear technical metal with some  progressive music scattered here and there. If you're looking for true  progressive metal, go pick up an album by Eternity X.  True progressive  metal cannot be found on Scenes From A Memory, no matter what Dream  Theater's arrogant fans belive.
