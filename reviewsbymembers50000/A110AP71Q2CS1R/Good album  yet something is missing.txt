 I'm not sure what I was expecting with Legacy, Shadow Gallery's fourth release.  Legacy smells like Shadow Gallery, looks like Shadow Gallery and sounds like Shadow Gallery--but is it Shadow Gallery? Well, yeah, it is.  But the things I love most about this band have been perverted or put aside.  Shadow Gallery's beautiful vocal melodies--which have always bordered on sappy--are too sappy here.  The instrumentals--which were tasteful on the last two albums--seemed to have regressed to what they were on SG's debut disc; the instrumentals on Legacy are excessive and too over-the-top for my tastes.  And the lyrics seem rather mundane as they are almost a parody of the lyrics found on Tyranny and Carved in Stone. I'm not knocking the band for this release--it is a good album.  It just seems that the boundaries pushed on previous SG albums weren't pushed here.  There isn't a progression from Tyranny.  In fact, this album seems regressive as it apes SG's debut and sophomore releases quite effectively.  Legacy is basically a cross between the debut and Carved in Stone.  Not a bad thing, really.  But what happened to the progression, the evolution that was Tyranny?  No, I wasn't expecting Tyranny II.  Too many fans fall into that trap.  But I was expecting Tyranny's son, grandson of Carved in Stone.  Instead, I get the inbred child of the debut and Carved in Stone: A cute enough guy, but he's a bit dull--if you take my meaning. Still, if you're a Shadow Gallery fan, this is a good album.  "Cliffhanger 2" is a great song, even though the second half of the song is excessive.  "Destination Unknown" and "Colors" are good, but a bit too sappy in the vocal melody department.  "Legacy" and "Society of the Mind" are pretty good, but they suffer from being too bland and generic. Still, I like Legacy well enough.
