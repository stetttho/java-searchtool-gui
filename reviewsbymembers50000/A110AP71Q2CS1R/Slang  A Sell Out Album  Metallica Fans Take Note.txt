 Def Leppard created a style all their own in the '80s -- a style copied by many bands but Def Leppard did it best.  They combined the heavy distorted guitar sound of '70s glam rock bands such as Mott the Hoople and T.Rex and  fused that sound with elements of Led Zeppelin (pounding drums and bass)  and Queen (catchy vocal melodies). But in 1996, after pop metal had  fallen out of popularity, Def Leppard made Slang. Slang copies every  succesful grunge and alternative band of the '90s.  Slang does succeed here  and there but it ain't Def Leppard at their best.  People accuse Metallica  of selling-out (a term that is over-used) but if Metallica had really  sold-out, wouldn't they have gone grunge or alternative?  Metallica did not  sell-out.  Def Leppard attempted to sell-out on Slang.  Slang is a true  sell-out album, not Metallica's recent stuff. But it ain't all bad --  there is a good song or two to be found on Slang.  It just isn't Def  Leppard at their best.
