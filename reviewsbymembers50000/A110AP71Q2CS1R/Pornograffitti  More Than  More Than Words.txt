 On their self-titled debut, Extreme took the styles of Aerosmith, Van Halen and Queen and successfully melded those influences into their own unique sound.  Pornograffitti builds on the groundwork established on the  debut. Pornograffitti, though, is even more versatile. On  Pornograffitti, we get funk metal fun such as "When I'm  President" and "Get the Funk Out", grand rockers such as  "Money (In God We Trust)", the almost-country "Hole  Hearted", the Sinatra-like "When I Kissed You" and the  popular ballad "More Than Words".  "More Than Words",  though a great song, is not typical of Pornograffitti.  Extreme flat-out  rocks on many tracks, showing a metal side that you wouldn't think existed  if you're only familiar with the aforementioned ballad. This is the most  versatile cd I've ever heard in both sound and style.  Extreme was not just  another hair metal band, they were different -- almost progressive at  times. If you are feeling adventurous, pick this album up.  It's fun,  diverse and brilliant.
