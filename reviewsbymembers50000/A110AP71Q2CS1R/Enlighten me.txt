 I liked Bleed, Angel Dust's previous release.  But it took me a while to get into Enlighten the Darkness.  For some reason, this one is more difficult to digest.  Sure, there are a few songs that I liked right off.  But the rest of the album took some effort to "get". But get it I did. The first track, "Let Me Live", is solid thrash/power metal, like most of the album.  "Fly Away" is a rousing piece of heavy metal.   "Beneath the Silence" is on the quiet, ballad side of things, but it exhibits Angel Dust's strong songwriting.  "Still I'm Bleeding" is an emotional epic.  "I Need You"--wow!  "I Need You" really packs an emotional punch.  It is one heart-wrenching song.  And "Cross of Hatred" is great thrash with an extremely catchy bridge. Angel Dust mixes thrash with power metal quite effectively.  Their sound is difficult to explain.  But imagine a hybrid of Iced Earth (guitars & heavy, thrashy feel), Dream Theater (keyboards), and Superior (vocals & some song arrangements).  Now you are kind of in the neighborhood of what Angel Dust sounds like. It took me awhile to fully get into this disc.  But now I love it.
