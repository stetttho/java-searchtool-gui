 The newest installment of the Rogue Wizard finds our hero on the brink of romance and perhaps true love.  This is the book I've been waiting for, a possible love interest for Magnus, yes!  As far as the plot goes, typical  Stasheff, which means it is a nice read.  To me, this is one of the better  Rogue Wizard novels, a series that has been a bit uneven.  I'm a sucker for  Stasheff's more romantic work (I loved M'Lady Witch) and this one delivers.
