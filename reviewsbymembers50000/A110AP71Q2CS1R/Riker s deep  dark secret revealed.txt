 I love it when we find flaws and dark pasts in our favorite Trek characters.  This time, Commander Riker is the subject and the secret he has been living with for twelve years is one that could alter Federation relations with the Romulan Empire forever! Admiral Pressman, Riker's old commanding officer aboard the starship Pegasus, wants to retrieve the lost Pegasus because it has secret technology that the Pegasus crew had been working on when their experiments went awry (and the ship was lost).  The key is that the Pegasus's crew was working on cloaking technology which, as the episode explains, is illegal for the Federation to use.  Never mind the absurdity of such a treaty (c'mon, this is like the USA banning stealth fighter technology so we don't upset China and then allowing China to use stealth technology--it would be an incredibly stupid thing to do), the important thing here is the conflict generated among Picard, Pressman and Riker.  Riker is torn between loyalty to his former commander and his duty to the Enterprise and the Federation.  There are plenty of terrific, dramatic, and tense moments in this episode.  As Riker, actor Jonathan Frakes shines here.  Great episode all the way! This episode, along with "Second Chances" and "A Matter of Honor", makes up what I call the essential Riker collection.
