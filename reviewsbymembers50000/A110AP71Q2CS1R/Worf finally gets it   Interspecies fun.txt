 I remember watching the fourth season of Deep Space Nine--the first season with Worf--and yelling at the television screen.  It seemed so obvious to me that TNG's Worf and DS9's Science Officer Jadzia Dax were a perfect match.  Yet Worf seemed oblivious to Dax's advances--hints, really.  I mean, Dax has a history with Klingons--her soul is Klingon--yet it just wasn't happening.  But, finally, "Looking for par'Mach in All the Wrong Places" hooks the pair up--and it does so in a humorous and clever way.  Throughout the episode, Worf is either trying to catch Quark's ex-wife Grilka (a Klingon) or help Quark renew the fragile romance he (Quark) and Grilka once had (What would a Klingon/Ferengi child look like, anyway?  And do we want to find out?).  And Jadzia Dax is giving Worf all kinds of hints and suggestions, which Worf is not getting.  This is a fun episode and the ending is great when Worf and Dax finally hook-up. "Looking for par'Mach in All the Wrong Places" is essential Worf.  It's essential Dax.  Heck, it's essential Deep Space Nine!
