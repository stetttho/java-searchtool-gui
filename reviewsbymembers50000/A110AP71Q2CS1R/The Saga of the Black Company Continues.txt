 The Black Company saga continues as Lady, assuming that Croaker has died, becomes Captain of the Black Company.  She assembles legions of cast-offs and wannabes and molds them into a fierce fighting force.  Unfortunately, she unintentionally adds members of a mysterious murder cult to her ranks.  Ultimately, they will betray her and rob her of a most precious gift. Good story and it is fun to finally have a Black Company novel told from someone else's point of view besides Croaker (the Silver Spike did this but is it really a Black Company novel?).  Lady tells the story and author Glen Cook does an excellent job of distinguishing her from Croaker. Be warned: The murder cult portrayed in this novel will give you nightmares.  It did me. Tired of Tolkien-esque epic fantasy?  Does it all read the same after awhile?  Try Glen Cook and the Black Comapny novels.  Good stuff.  Dark fantasy told from the soldiers' point of view.  The first one in the series is titled the Black Company.  Shadows Linger is second followed by the White Rose, the Silver Spike (even though this one doesn't deal with the Black Company directly), Shadow Games and then Dream of Steel.  Bleak Seasons, She is the Darkness, Water Sleeps and Soldiers Live finish off the series--so far.
