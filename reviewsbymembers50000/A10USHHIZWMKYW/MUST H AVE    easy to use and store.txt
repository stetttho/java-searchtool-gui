 I have tried many other types of tongs, and these are by far my favorite.  Easy to clean, compact for drawer space, and EASY to use!  Light weight and far less complicated than traditional scissor style tongs.  Every cook, beginner to Chef, should have these!  Great as part of a gift basket for newlyweds or new home owners too!
