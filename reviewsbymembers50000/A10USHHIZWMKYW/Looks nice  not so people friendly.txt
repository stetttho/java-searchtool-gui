 We paid top dollar for this seat with our 1st child.  We felt at the time it was difficult to install, but assumed they were all that way.  It wasn't until we had our second child and paid about half what we had for the Eddie Bauer, that we realized how terrible this one was.  It is awkward at best, even with the tether system.  That was a horrible cryptic instruction guide.  Not to mention that is next to impossible to clean.  Yeah, anyone can vaccumm out a car seat.  But for those times when it needs a good thorough washing as in leaky diaper, spilled juice...It is impossible.  Once again, it wasn't until we bought the cheaper NON "name brand" seat that I realized how bad and really gross this was.  Our sons seat (the cheap one, seat not the kid) is easy to install, came with plenty of tips for different vehicles.  EASY to remove the cover and clean...wash.  DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY HERE, just because the name Eddie Bauer appears on it.  Don't make our 1st time parent mistake. I gave it 2 stars because it is safe and it looked nice new and clean.
