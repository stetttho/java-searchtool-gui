 I was first introduced to these colorful personalities in 1982...and have not been able to get them out of my head since!  Now that I have started a family of my own...these books are a must have for any chlidrens library.  The story makes adults giggle while the illustraions keep your childs attention; while getting the point across!  Saddly over the years my original copies have been lost, I am so relieved to still be able to get them!
