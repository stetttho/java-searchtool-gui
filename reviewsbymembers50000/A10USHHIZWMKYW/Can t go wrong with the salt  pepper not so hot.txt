 The pepper grinder stopped grinding a few months into it.  The salt shaker is great with it's adjustable dosing, but how technical is that?  I never complained about the pepper mill as it was part of a set, but had I paid $20, there would be some fussing!  I Love OXO products, but I would save your money on this particular set.
