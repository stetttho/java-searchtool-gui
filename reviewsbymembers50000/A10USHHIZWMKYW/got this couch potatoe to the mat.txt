 I have never liked to workout in any way shape or form, but knew I needed to start.  After I had my first baby, I REALLY needed to start, and was lucky enough to stumble on to this tape.  They say you "feel better" in 10 sessions, (which are only 25 minutes by the way), I felt better in 3!  I was able to progress to more advanced moves by 10 and this is from a person who has never been able to sit "indian style" since preschool!  Even if you hate a certain move, you can [...] it up because you only have to do 5 reps of that move.  Most of the positions are really fun...no-one I know ever thought they'd hear that out of this couch potato!  Well worth the money, especially for a beginner!
