 I have had a plastice one with the built in strainer for years...and must admit I hated it, but didn't know why...IT was to smooth and slippery to really grab the flesh. Especially for the produce we get in Alaska, you really have to work for your juice, be from limes, lemons or any other citrus. Things are just not quite as fresh as they are in the states. This reamer rips right through these tough limes and lemons with hardly any effort. WHAT A RELIEF this tool is! I even did my own product test between the old and new with the same batch of limes...I was able to get nearly twice as much juice in less than half the time. If you like to use fresh citrus in your cooking and bartending, but don't want the commitment of a "juicer"...this is a wonderful, easy to store tool.
