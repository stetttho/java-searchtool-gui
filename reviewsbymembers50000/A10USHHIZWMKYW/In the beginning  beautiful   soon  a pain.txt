 When we first recieved this can opener, we were thrilled.  It worked so beautifully that we stopped using our electric one.  It wasn't but a couple months into it before it started skipping spots on a can lid.  Frequent deep cleaning, ( at least once a week), improves it, but it still skips at least twice on an average soup can lid.  I love Kitchen Aid, but this product is not worth it's weight or drawer space.
