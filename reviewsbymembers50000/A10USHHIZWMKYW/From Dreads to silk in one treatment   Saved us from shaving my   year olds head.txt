 I kid you not , i was hours away from shaving my 3 year old daughters head.  Her hair is down to her buns and fine with curl.  We were down to brushing it once a week as i was SICK to death of the fights!  I was complaining to a girlfriend about the battles, and she begged me to try a sample of this before I did it.  In one treatment, we went from starter dread locks, to comeable silk locks.  The tangles were managable, and we actually had people stop us and ask if they could touch her hair.  I have since passed this tip on to other struggling families.  It is great for swimmers as it gets the chlorine out with out destroying it and you MUST by the shampoo. The friend that passed it on to me, was given it on a trip to Hawaii when her long haired girls were in the pool everyday.  My review does refer to using both porducts together!   I never have spent that kind of money on my own hair products, but the change it has made in my daughters approach to hair care, it is well worth it!  The picture is deceving, 33.8 oz is a liter, that will last a LONG time because you only need a nickle size dolup.  =) The scent does take some getting used to, but it is still worth it!
