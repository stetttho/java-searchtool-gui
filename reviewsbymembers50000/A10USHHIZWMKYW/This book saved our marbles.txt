 A wonderful intro into the sleep life of your new baby.  Really helped us to understand, and get over our guilt of letting her cry to sleep.  I have bought this for other parents as well.  Wonderful baby shower gift!  UPDATE;  It is also a great tool for people with older kids who have not developed good sleep patterns.  Everyone I have bought it for, has bought a copy for someone else they new!
