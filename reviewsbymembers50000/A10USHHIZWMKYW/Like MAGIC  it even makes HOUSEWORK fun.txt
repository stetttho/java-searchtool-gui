 I didn't even know I needed one and now I really love it!  Even my 4 year old can work her way around it and navigate exactly where she wants to go.  I recieved it for my birthday, and this little thing makes everything more fun.  The video quality is very impressive, considering it's size especially.  I have to leave home for a couple days a week for work, so I asked my technically inclined husband to load my pilates video on to my 30GB unit.  All be it no Matrix reloaded as far as grahics go, but I am extrememly pleased with the picture quality. (Now if I could just motivate and do the videos). It is a great size for someone wanting to watch something on the commute, plane, train or sitting on the bike at the gym.  Really amazing, and really easy to use.  I agree with other reviewer, the "included case" is nothing to write home about as it is difficult to get your Ipod in and out of.  It does serve it's purpose of protecting the screen though.  I bought a dlo rubberized case, it fits but does obscure the outer edges of the expanded screen.  It will do until the come ut with accessories for this unit. The head phones are a bit uncomfortable ( for smaller ears) as well, but the sound quality is great.   Great gift for anyone, techy or not, who loves music, movies and portability.
