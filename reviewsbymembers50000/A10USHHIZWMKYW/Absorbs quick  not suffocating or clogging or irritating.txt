 I have extrmemely sensetive skin and am prone to painful chin breakouts.  Since I started using this (in combination with ProActive) I have been even and smooth.  It is creamy, smooth and hearty enough for our cold dry Alaskan winters.  Pairs beautifully with the sensitive essentials night cream too.  I tend to feel suffocated with anything on my face, but Not with this.  Never any burning or irritating like with most moisturizers and makeups.  My face actually misses this when I forget to use it.  Especially at work (flight attendant), if I don't keep my senstive skim hydrated, I am miserable.    THIS IS A MUST HAVE, and must have back up as well!  Goes with me everywhere, thank you DOVE!
