 All be it, I just pulled this beautiful piece of machinery out of the box today...but it is incredible!  All it promises to be and more.  Right down to the manual, this is well worth it's price, and we even had to pay shipping to Alaska! It's heavy duty all metal construction really shows through.  So much better than some of the cheap plastic imitators we owned before! =)  It even has some really great recipes included with it.  Just made a perfect batch of strawberry margaritas with real frozen berries, perfect consistency!  I will definitely keep you updated as time goes by and I get to try it out on soups and milkshakes, mousses and dips!
