 I hesitate to write the 45th (or so) review of this product BUT I'm so impressed I feel I must!  I'd been using the Braun Flex 5775 and, although good value for the money, was getting tired of how long it took to shave and that it really didn't shave all that close.  I bought this "reconditioned" product after reading the reviews and need to say it is the best shaver I've used, as well as the least expensive.  Closeness rivals a blade.  As quiet and more effective than the Norelco Quatro without spending money on lotion.  Faster, closer shave (and a lot quieter)than the Panasonic Linear model.  I have sensitive skin and it does not irritate at all.  Cuts the time it took me to shave with the Braun Flex nearly in 1/2.  And I like that it is a "dry" shaver...I simply pop the screen and run it for a few seconds, and brush/air-blow it once a week (all per the instructions).  Although re-conditioned, it came as good as new (If, like one of the reviewers below, you discover dirt, etc - send it back for a replacement!) I almost want to get two to keep one in reserve!
