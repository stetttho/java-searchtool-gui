 My wife and I decided to get this because we like "simple" and this fills the bill:  VCR/DVD and flat-screen TV with one remote. Out of the box all that had to be done was to plug it in and follow the simple directions to set it up (10 minutes).   We purchased it primaily for videos/DVD viewing and it works like a charm.  Speakers are OK, but easily enhanced if you want more.  Delivery service thru Amazon was excellent - on time and they do unbox it for you.  Buy one before they stop making it.
