 This is a guys movie about men teaching a grad college student about men's lives.  They do it by association and without lecturing or posturing.  Tough language in places, but it is how a lot of guys talk. Same idea as Duvall and Caine teaching the kid in "Second Hand Lions", except the 'student' was younger there.  I enjoyed this movie a lot.  Good acting and quite subtle for all the cursing.  By the way, Jack Wallace, who initiates the funny Steven Seagal discussion, played Seagal's uncle in "Above the Law."
