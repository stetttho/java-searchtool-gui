 This was invented by people who are either totally incompetent or have an off-the-wall sense of humor (or both). The "trimmer" looks great, takes a battery, makes the right noises, and does zip.

I didn't make it a day, but after more time then I'd care to admit,  I looked around thinking I was on candid camera.  Threw it out.
