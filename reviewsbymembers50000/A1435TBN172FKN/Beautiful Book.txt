 This is a wonderful book . The pictures work the imagination and the poems are beautiful.   The dual language format will intrigue young readers and just may get them interested in a 'different' language.  In addition this will expose youngsters to some of Mexico's rich culture.  I know several college professors who have adopted this book to use in their Children's Literature and reading courses.  Truth be told, I liked it so much I bought it for myself several years ago and have been 'advertising' it ever since.
