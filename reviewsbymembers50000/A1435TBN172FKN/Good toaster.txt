 I use a toaster primarily for bread and English muffins and had one of those fancy (and expensive) models that never did the job right.  This one does.  It toasts evenly, the browning regulator  works, and the toast pops up where it can be reached.  The exterior stays cool, the design is pleasant to the eye, and the price is right.
