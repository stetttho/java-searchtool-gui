 I bought these for my wife as a bottom of the page special.  She loved them!  "Classic" kind of earrings that can be worn with anything.  Good quality.  Look great.  Price is right.  I wish I'd bought several pair (for gifts) at the discount price, but would still recommend buying at the price offered.
