 This is a good shaver with few frills at a fair (reality-based) price.  I've been using it for two months. It is quieter than the Panasonic "Linear" and noisier than the Norelco "Quatro."  In terms of beard, mine is light with sensitive skin and the Norelco shaved closest but with the most irritation (even with the lotion cartridges and aftershave); the Panasonic came next, but was noisy, didn't fit my hand well and didn't hold a charge long enough for my taste.  The Braun gives the least close shave of the three - I MUST shave again within 24 hours whereas with the other two I could get away with a little more time before looking like I really needed a shave.  However, since I shave every day anyway, for me the Braun has the best combination of convenience, design and performance.  I never use the trimmer, so I can't comment on that.  If you have a heavy beard, my guess is you can do better than the 5614.  If, like me you have sensitive skin, it's worth noting that this razor provided me a much more comfortable shave than the Norelco despite the Norelco's price and hype. Addendum:  After nearly a year of use, I stand by my review, but recently purchased a reconditioned Braun 7505, which is both a better deal AND provides a better shave.  Check out the reviews!
