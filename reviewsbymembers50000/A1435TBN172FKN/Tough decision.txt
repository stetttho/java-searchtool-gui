 It is difficult to purchase a diamond sight unseen.  Here's some things that may help. -You will get a good quality diamond here. -It saves a lot to not pay tax or shipping (why I purchased the Amazon vs. the NY vendor item) -There's not much difference in size between a 1/4ct and a 1/3ct stone and you can get the large stone for about the same as the smaller stone if you buy a I color, "I" clarity.   Advice: -Decide how much you can spend. Cost can increase fast with diamonds and it is helpful to know your budget. -Visit a local jewelry chain and compare sizes of the stones you are considering.  1/4ct is the smallest pendant you should buy and some may find that too small.  I surprised my wife with this, but knew that the size of the stone would not matter. -I opted for a quality stone over size.  That could have gone either way.  If the size of the stone were important, I would have gone with the 1/3, available here for about the same price. -Since my wife's ring is white gold, I wanted a white gold setting for the pendant.  That meant I had to get at least a "H" color or the stone would show just a little yellow against the white setting.   -You can always send it back/exchange it if it doesn't work. The piece itself is a 5 star item.  I gave the whole package 4 stars because the box (which is quite nice) the pendant came in was too large for a 1/4ct stone and made a small stone look smaller.  The IGI certificate that came with the stone also has a different (better) color range than was advertised.  That's good, but it is different and makes me wonder why. All-in-all, if you're looking for a nice diamond pendant you can't go wrong with this one.  Just be sure you know a little about the size and the other factors that go into the stone, although at the 1/4ct - 1/3ct range it really doesn't make that much difference.  And you can relax a bit more purchasing a pendant than an engagement ring, where you may want/need in-person help.
