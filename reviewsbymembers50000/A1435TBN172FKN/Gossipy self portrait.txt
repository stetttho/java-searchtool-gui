 I've been a fan of Helmut Newton since I was about 13 when, Woody Allenish, I miraculously happened upon his pictures of women.  Unfortunately this book captures none of the excitement those pictures generate.  He tells of growing up in Nazi Germany, his escape to China and his move to Australia.  He also shares many (and there are many to share) of his sexual exploits.  The problem I had, is if you take the pictures out of the book, it could almost be about anybody with an overactive libido (or imagination).  All-in-all it is a gossipy read and amusing at that level but with very little to indicate what makes Newton's photographs some of the most recognizable around.  If you're thinking about this book because you know his work, consider one of the books containing his photographs instead.
