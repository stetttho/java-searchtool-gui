 Ok I am not so sure about this set of DVD's, for one thing it was very costly and I didn't see Janis Joplin at all, I thought she had sang there? The best of all part was by far The Mama's and The Papa's I loved! But I think the show was about the audience instead of the music. The camera was on the flower power people a good amount of the show. I don't know if this Monterey Pop Festival was worth it or not, I would have to say no, I guess I am to young.
