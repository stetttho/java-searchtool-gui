 I never knew that Ben Orr sang so many songs, I thought he only sang "Drive" but I guess I was wrong, he sang 12 songs. "I did a little research" I think he had the better voice. It seems it was a well hidden secret that he sang all them songs. Another great singer that past away so young of cancer. This DVD has terrible camera work and looks are pretty bad too considering that it was filmed 1979, but I am still giving it a 5 star DVD... The Cars are a classic band. If you love the Cars you will love this DVD.
