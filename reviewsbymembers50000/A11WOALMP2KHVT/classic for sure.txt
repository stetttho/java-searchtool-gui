 I was 10 when I first seen "Buster and Billie". I just bought the movie on "DVD" 2005, The quality is not so great, but that is ok for me because this is a hard to find "DVD". If you seen this movie years ago or never seen it before, I think you will like this movie. This movie is a 5 star all the way.
