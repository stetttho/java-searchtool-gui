 I have only ONE problem with this video is YOKO the JOKO, I laughed my @ss off! what a weirdo, she sounds so bad my dog would run and hide from this thing called singing! i bought the video just the other day and he is now afraid of the tv...lol wow, chalk boards with fingers running down it sounds better than her! get the picture? if you can get past her singing, John Lennon sounds great.
