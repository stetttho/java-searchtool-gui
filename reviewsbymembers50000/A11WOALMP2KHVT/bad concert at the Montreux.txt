 I seems that alot of music DVD's filmed at the Montreux are not that good. I wish I could give this DVD more stars but I can't. I like to keep my reviews short so I agree with alot of the other reviews and say that the sound was bad but the picture was really bad too. I would have loved to seen a great concert by Johnny Cash.
