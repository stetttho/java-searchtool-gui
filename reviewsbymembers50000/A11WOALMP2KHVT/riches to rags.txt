 Chuck has been from riches to rags and back again, I find the whole story very intresting. I love Three Dog Night and wish he was in the band again but I don't see that happening anytime soon or if ever. This DVD gives you an insite of how the band began. If you are into Three Dog Night, I think you will be interested in this DVD.
