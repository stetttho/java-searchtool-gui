 This DVD grows on ya. It is a fun concert, Crystal blue persuasion, crimson and clover, hanky panky, I think were alone now, mony mony and drag'n the line was great. The song tighter, it just did't sound good at all. Other than that they sounded excellent. I hope he does another DVD. I still will allway's love his voice and music.
