 I did not really like this DVD at all. I had to give it a 3 star beacause I was trying to be nice. One of the songs that I've loved stunk big time! The song was "Fooled Around And Fell In Love" I have alot of music DVD's over 150 and this DVD has to be one of the least favorite to date that an "America" I hope to help in peoples decison in saving money in buying bad DVD's.
