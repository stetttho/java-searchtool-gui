 I exspected much much more from this DVD. #1- he acted weird, like he was on something, #2- his voice was off, he was trying to hard and #3- thirdly he sat through the DVD. I don't think this concert had high energy only he seemed high. he talked way to much. I am going to try another Meatloaf DVD and let this one sit and gather dust. hope this helps you, it would have me.
