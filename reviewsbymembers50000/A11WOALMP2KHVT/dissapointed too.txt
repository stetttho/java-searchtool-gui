 I just had to see for myself and many of the reviews were right, bad! Sound picture and there was interuptions all through-out what was surpose to be a concert. I didn't pay much so if you want this DVD do not pay much for it. I love the fact that you can look at peoples reviews, it really helps with my sellections! Hope this helps yours
