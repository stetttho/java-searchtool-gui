 I don't know if the good singing out weighed the bad because their were some really bad performers and I hate saying this but one of them was... his son Sean Lennon, Marc Anthony, Nelly Furtado, Moby, and Shaggy. The best performers were... Cyndi Lauper, Yolanda Adams, Shelby Lynne, Natalie Merchant, Stone Temple Pilots and Kevin Spacey. Cyndi Lauper had to be one of the best performers and Sean Lennon the worst! I still think this music DVD is worth buying.
