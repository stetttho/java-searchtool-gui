 I wish they made more of these types of movies, I loved it! I just wished the movie was longer. It was very touching, mooving...you get the pitcure. :) Anybody that likes the Coral Reef, you will love this DVD. Plus this movie teaches our children about some Coral Reefs dieing and how we can help. And they have a trivia on the DVD extras. Do not miss this!
