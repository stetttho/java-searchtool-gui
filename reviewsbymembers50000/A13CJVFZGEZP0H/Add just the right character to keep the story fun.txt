 This season picks up after everyone seems to have gotten over the confrontation from the previous finale.  Everything seems to be getting back to "Normal".  Suddenly a small, silent girl with multicolored hair is stalking Suguru. Introducing Minawa.  Every moment she's on the screen I'm reminded of old Buster Keaton films.  Her somber expression is as solid are a rock no matter what happens.  Add to that her clumsiness and apologetic nature and every moment she's on the screen is an invitation to laugh and feel sorry for her at the same time.  She is a tragic comedy all in one. As far as the story is concearned, nothing really happens here that doesn't involve Minawa.  If it isn't enough to deal with a secret army called Vesper involved in a hidden war, now we have to deal with a secret society called Management.  Minawa is somewhat a creation of this society as their scientits take sick pleasure in tampering with nature. Beyond that, it's mostly episodal comedy from here on out.  Mahoro does a good job of disguising herself badly.  Minawa seems to trip over everything, even nothing at all.  The perverted teacher is still perverted.  And all but two girls in the main cast wage war with their... ahem.... insecurities. Most of the episodes on this disk are just for fun.  Technically, The Opening / Ending themes are not as enjoyable as the first season.  I'm still waiting for the story to develop. But, the series has improved a bit.  The humor is less sex oriented (which isn't saying much) and the introduction of Minawa and Management give this season a story without re-hashing the conflicts of the first. Again, Mahoromatic proves to be a fun series with a little bitter aftertaste.  With all that's going on with everybody, one could almost not notice the countdown timer.
