 This part of the series is almost a lesson on pure love.  The good times and the bad.  Everybody starts to show their own conflicts over how to handle the technology of the time.  Some have been shown to empty their lives into a world of technology and have difficulty with humanity.  Others have suffered the loss of loved ones to a fantasy world brought on by that same technology. Chi starts realizing such things as happiness and begins to act upon a desire to see Hideki happy.  Hideki's conflict deepens and he winds up terribly distracted by the apparent moral and philosophical issues with human-machine relations.  The comedy makes a bit of a comeback and adds to the story, but the story could hold up on it's own.  I would actually give the seris 6 stars from this volume on if I could.
