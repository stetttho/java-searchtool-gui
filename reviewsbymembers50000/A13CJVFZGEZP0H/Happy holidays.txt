 Holiday episodes!!!  Love'em or hate'em, here they are.  All in order and on the same disk of all things. Christmas and New Year's go by with the only revelations being Miniwa's desire for a heart.  Beyond that, the episodes are full of overboard celebration and time with freinds.  Mahoro especially enjoys the holidays. The real comedy comes to life with the Martial Arts festival.  While it is a town tradition that Suguru is quite accustomed to, Mahoro is reluctant to allow him to participate this year.  As things turn out, he finds a way to get in the action and accidently drag Mahoro and Minawa along for the ride.  The end-result being the most LOL funny moment of the series.  Especially for someone who grew up in the eighties. Valentine's day focuses around Suguru who has been ignored a bit lately.  Valentine's day involves quite a bit of emotional pressure for guys in Japan, moreso for the ever popular Suguru.  There is also a side-story involving Minawa and one of Suguru's friends that makes for some sweet tear jerking moments.  It's almost as though Minawa is starting to find some humanity in herself with the coaxing of all of their friends. At this point I got very suspicious of the series because I was already aware that there was only one final disk to finish the story.  The countdown timer was still apparent.  And with some subtle revelations and a minor cliffhanger the story is ready to get serious again. On the surface, these are mostly throwaway episodes.  But upon watching them, I found that I was able to like the characters more than ever before.  One by one, each episode is making it more and more difficult to watch that countdown timer advance, even if only one more day.
