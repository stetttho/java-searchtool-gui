 Take into account that this and many other 24+/- episode long series usually air on television only once per week.  The first two episodes on this disk are filler to keep the production schedule alive and to fill holes in the broadcast schedule that would be more easily abused by airing reruns.  Gladly these episodes were not put in their "proper" places on the American release so that the story could flow better in the DVD format. That being said, an addicted Chobits fan like me will be happy to see even the most brief additions of new material.  Even if it is buried in recycled footage. The first episode does actually offer a fair personality profile of Hideki through the eyes of his freind Shinbo.  And I still can't help but get a little misty-eyed during the 'battery charging' scene when Chi awakens and notices Hideki's warmth, no matter how many times I watch it. Minoru and Yuzuki follow with their own analysis of Chi's personality.  After the flashbacks this episode closes with a very sweet moment between the two.  Now that I've seen it, I think it would have been welcome in the main body of the series and would have added to Minoru's character developement. Finally the DVD-only episode.  This is as close to an epilogue the series will ever get.  It's worth a watch no matter how many questions are left unanswered. The final reason to buy this DVD is Chibits.  A fun 15 minute short that reminded me of why I started watching the series in the first place:  Sappy cuteness and laugh-out-loud humor. This disk only serves to complete the series, not the story.  Still, it's an enjoyable experience that the most devoted Chobits fan will not want to miss.
