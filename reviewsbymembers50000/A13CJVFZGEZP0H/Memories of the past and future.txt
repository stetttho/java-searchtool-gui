 So far all of the information about Chi comes from Internet rumors.  But not unsubstantiated rumors.  By now there is a realization that there is something either supernatural or an echo from past memories lost.  What kinds of decisions will have to be made by the  characters and why?  What is Chi capable of?  Does Chi actually posses free will? The so-called "filler" episodes mean more in the context of the story.  Much of the series so far revolves around memory.  Memory that can be deleted from machines, such as Chi's past.  The episodes that seem to be gratuitous frolic help aid the future of the story.  For now, it appears that Hideki still treats Chi like a machine but not without some internal conflict over his feelings.
