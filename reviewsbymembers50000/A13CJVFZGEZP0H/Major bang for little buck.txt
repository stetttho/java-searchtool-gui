 This is the best Ethernet card available in value and in speed. The Windows drivers are flawless and the autosensing works without a glitch.  One error is that this is not the Tulip chip that the Linux vendors say it is. Search for the "natsemi" driver on any Linux discussion group. Someone has posted this file just-about everywhere and it is exactly what is needed to bring this amazing card into Linuxland.  Don't pass this deal by.
