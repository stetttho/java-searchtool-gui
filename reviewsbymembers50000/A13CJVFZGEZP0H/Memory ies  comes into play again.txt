 Face it, hard drives can be formatted, data can be erased.  All that can be considered memories in a computer can disappear in the flick of a switch.  But for humans, memory remains.  Is it futile to try to share memories with a machine?  If the machine loses that data, what comes next?  What could come of such a relationship? This disk asks more questions than it answers.  It's definately worth watching but it makes it all the more painful to wait for the final episodes.  By now the series has become a full blown drama.  Be prepared to cry!
