 The harem aspect of this series has always been a crutch for the most part because the romance between Aoi and Kaoru could hold the story together on its own.  Don't get me wrong, the over the top humor is good.  But, as these final episodes show, it's the moments that involve this young couple's time together that make the series shine. It's too hard to give details about this disk without spoiling the story.  But be rest assured that many of the themes expressed in the first few episodes in the series are echoed here near the end.  But is it the end?  Episode 24 winds up including some preperation for a second season.  While some conflict is resolved, some things were not allowed to happen.  Doubts are left dangling over each character. On a side note, Aoi's father is the most powerfully developed character I've ever seen.  In a matter of seconds his character, disposition, and power is unavoidably revealed.  This is another moment when the English dub falls short.  Compared to the intensity of the Japanese track, the English voice is that of a teddy bear.  More could have been done to assert this character as a dignified and unapologetic man of power.
