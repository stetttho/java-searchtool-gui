 Up to now and even into the beginning of this disk, Mahoromatic has been a laugh-out-loud comedy with fleeting moments of drama and action.  Now, at this point the story takes on a very dark side of Mahoro's life.  Continuing the introspective moments, Mahoro decides that she is going to have to battle her old adversary, even at the expense of her own life.  Because of this, she hopes to give Suguru one last dose of happiness before she disappears with very little hope of returning. The episodes that follow from this decision are some of the most heart-wrenching moments of the series.  Although she still doesn't fear for her own life, Mahoro is no stranger to suffering.  The story is kept a little upbeat with some flashback moments to her training and her time spent with her commanding officers.  But the majority of the episodes remain dark and often quite violent. The way it all ends up is worthwile for the time being.  The story is kept open with anticipation of a second season, while there is also closure of some sort for the current conflict. For me, this first season did not dissapoint me beyond the overt nudity.  The comedy, drama, and action was definately enough to compensate for the fanservice pitfalls this series lands in over-and-over again.  Any casual viewer would be satisfied as this being the end of the series and develop an overall conclusion to the story in their mind.  But.... for me, that countdown timer will never go away.
