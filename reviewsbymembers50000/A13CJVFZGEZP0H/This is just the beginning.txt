 Don't be fooled by the semi-innocent yet sexual persona on the surface of this portion of the story.  So far this series is starting a crack-up & light hearted comedy of a boy and his 'droid.  But... there are some subtle clues placed here and there that echo of a mysterious and possibly painful future.  Remember them. Almost all the characters in the series get fitting introductions in this part of the series.  There is no such thing as filler.
