 Before watching this DVD I was quite annoyed at the idea of another harem series with the (...) girls going to the requisite trip to the beach.  But, here, we have a twist.  The most important girl in the series is too shy to wear a swimsuit.  Most of the frolic occurs off-screen.  So, instead of being completely about the male character falling head over heels for all the bikini clad girls.  We get Kaoru just being his good old self and still wanting to spend time with his one interest, Aoi. The new girl here is Taeko's cousin, Chika.  Upon meeting Kaoru she proceeds to play matchmaker with her cousin and her 'boyfriend', uh 'husband', uh... wait a minute... Tina gets another moment alone with Kaoru and this time it happens away from the mansion, not to mention at a romantic suites hotel.  The tension between the two is expressed so well that it almost seems like they can't avoid each other for much longer.  I'm still left wondering; How long can they stay friends? and What does Tina actually think about herself? The character development flys with leaps and bounds throughout this disk.  This is a rare case where beach and festival episodes are more than just filler and skinfest.  Look out though.  The nudity does arise quite often in and around these episodes and there is a brief moment of underage exposure.
