 Ever since I saw Vampire Hunter D and Tenchi Muyo back when they first came to the US, I've been hooked on Anime (and just about anything subtitled since my TV had no speaker back then). Ever since I heard 'Around The World' I said "ooh, something different". And I seeked out all things Daft. Then Discovery came out.  It was another different move for Daft Punk, but that's exactly what I liked them for in the beginning anyway.  I found small samples of the videos online and enjoyed them greatly.  There was always something in the back of my head telling me that these 'videos' were a little too well produced to be left alone.  There had to be a feature-length story here. Boy, was that little voice ever right.  I'm sure there are a lot of Anime fans out there that like Daft Punk already.  This is the Peanut-Butter Cup of entertainment.  I'm going to be listening to the voices in my head more often!!!
