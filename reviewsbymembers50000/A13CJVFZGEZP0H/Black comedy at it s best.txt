 When I watched it in the theater I heard comments like "it was too gross" "this wasn't scary".  Of course it's gross.  It's about a cannibalistic serial kill that is on the loose.  The lambs have been silenced and not it's Dr. Lecter's turn to have the fun.  Just listen to his lines.  It's a great, gross-out comedy.
