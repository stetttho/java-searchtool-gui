 This series is good couples Anime.  These first episodes bring the relationship of Karu Hanabishi and Aoi Sakuraba to the forefront.  It seems that long ago, when they were children, their families had arranged them to be married.  But, someting went wrong and Aoi wants to find out why... The character Aoi might not be popualr to the modern American audience.   All appearances say that she has grown and developed in a very protective environment only to become the perfect traditional Japanese wife.  Some people may be quickly annoyed by her inherant subservience and overly apologetic nature.  Yet, she has an assertiveness that helps her overcome the bias of her character and helps to round out a very powerful role in the story. Sadly the story falls into some way-too-easy comedic trappings with the 5th episode by introducing the harem aspect of the series with Tina, the "American".  Don't worry though, she will behave herself later. Aside from the culture-shock and boobie-humor that this series contains, there is a good strong beginning to a heart warming and against-all-odds love affair between the main characters. Also:  Look out for the nudity.  It's not detailed, but there are quite a bit of bathtime body pans.  And beware the English dub.  The translated voice acting sounds as if it's being read from a book with little to no attention to the emotion in the scene.
