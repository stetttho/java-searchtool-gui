 ....leave such a deep emotional scar? Just like the third disk of the first season, we get hit with the revelations of battle, the "last date" with Suguru.  And the commemcement.  Again, filled with flashbacks and introspective moments, this last set of episodes make for an intense experience.  As the viewer, many scenes reminded me of moments that occured over the couse of both seasons.  After "living" with Mahoro, Suguru, and friends with such enjoyable memories, it all comes down to keeping Suguru away from danger.  We get a deja-vu moment of "the picnic that never happened" from the first series.  And we are left to our own imagination to decipher what we just saw. Saying much more than that would be too revealing of the plot.  Way too many people have spoiled this story in their reviews, here and on other sites.  For better or worse, I think it takes a work of genious to seed such strong emotions in an audience.  Mahoromatic is that work.  To quote another opinion on this series, "Mahoromatic betrays the atmosphere, and more importantly the carefully constructed character personalities developed throughout the series."  That betrayal is the finishing touch on a true work of art that breaks the rules right when everybody expects the norm.  The end result being a solid polarization of the audience containing both good and bad reatcions. This series has been over the top in every way.  From the beginning, it was aparrent that this story would come out no-holds-barred.  Perverse, funny, corny, sweet, and upsetting.  This series is an experience that I'm glad I subjected myself to. (Vague Spoiler Warning) To debunk any Television Economics Naysayers.  I have seen a scan of the final page of the manga.  The story wasn't butchered for the sake of television.  In fact, I would conclude that Gainax merely sprinkled a little sugar on it.
