 "A naturally fore-ordained event.  A state in which other outcomes are impossible...."  Such is the wisdom of Yuko, the female lead of this series.  I was drawn to this book by the look on her face on the cover artwork.  To me the look in her eyes was a glare as if to say "I dare you to guess how old I am and all that I've seen."  The story places her in the position of mentor for the spiritual newbie Watanuki Kimihiro, a guy who seems to be carrying a cursed ability to see spirits.  While there doesn't seem to be any single cohesive story yet, the random encounters and episodal nature still pulls me in to the characters' lives.  Many scenes play out as an educational process for Watanuki.  The events revolve around the spiritual nature of habits, desires, and the Yin-Yan nature of granting wishes.  Many things that would appear iconographic or symbolic become incarnate and wield real power in the hands of Yuko.  I found the TsubasaRC crossover a little distracting to the flow of the story as it was presented a bit more abruptly than the other encounters.  Then I decided to buy TsubasaRC vol-1 to see what was going on.  I probably wouldn't have been interested in TRC otherwise.  But by now, I've bit the baited hook.  The combination of the parallel yet individual story lines, Japanese mysticism and an almost metaphysical nature with a twist of String Theory makes XXXHolic my new addiction.  Clamp does it again...
