 This portion of the series offers enough character development and endearing scenes between the main couple to remain enjoyable.  The comedy offers nothing new.  Yes, it's funny, but we all know what panties look like by now. Taeko is one of the most enjoyable character aside from her clumsiness.  Her drive to be "good enough" is such a strong aspect of her character, it seems that everybody could learn from her will alone.  And, typically the only reason to bury a girl's face in those huge glasses is to make her a beauty in disguise.  Once those frames come off, she may become irresistable to the male characters... If her.. ahem.. "assets" aren't impressive enough. Tina's character also grows as certain events give clue to a possible inferiority complex.  One could only hope here character is given more depth as the series continues. All-in-all this is still an enjoyable series which has greatly lightened up after the first disk.  The story still shines best when Kaoru and Aoi spend time together or express their desire to do so.  Episode 10 makes for the nicest misty-eyed experience.
