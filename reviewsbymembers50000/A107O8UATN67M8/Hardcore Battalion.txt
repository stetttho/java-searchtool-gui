 This book hits you harder than a 7.62 slug to the chest. Every page is full of action. Hack takes a unit that "couldn't fight its way out of a retirement home" and turns it into one of the most lethal battalions in Vietnam.  Hack had to use his own tricks because our manuals were outdated and designed for fighting World War II. In fact he had to WRITE a manual (The Vietnam Primer)! Why a colonel, who is close to collecting his pension, would risk his career for a third tour of duty in Vietnam (with the worst performing battalion in the war no less) is beyond me. The only explanation is that Hack is absolutely passionate about the "enlisted swine". His lead-from-the-front style, his maverick attitude, and his outside-the-box tactics will amaze. A word of warning: the military won't let you do "radio patrols" and they sure as hell won't encourage you to  steal the enemy's AK-47. Throughtout his career as a journalistic and soldier, Hackworth has somehow managed to piss off just about everyone in the Pentagon. This book is for those who are mature enough to handle "the ground truth" about Vietnam. If you like warrior leaders who won't put their troops through anything they wouldn't endure themselves, then you'll love this book.  If you're an officer who's been trained to believe that war is a giant game of Pac Man, then you'll probably hate this book!
