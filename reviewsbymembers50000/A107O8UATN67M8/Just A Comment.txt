 I'm really not a fan of these kind of productions. As a guy, you won't see me browsing through the bookstore for Jane Austin novels.  But I did happen to catch The Aristocrats on PBS and I was taken by the actress who played Sarah (Jodhi May). What a beauty! I had never even heard of her, matter of fact I didn't even follow the plot but I tuned in just to get a glance at her and listen to her silky smooth voice. As Homer Simpson said: Woo-Hoo!
