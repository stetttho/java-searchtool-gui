 This is an excellent book on Japanese foreign policy written by someone now working for the National Security Council.  It draws upon on copious research including interviews conducted by the author, as well as Japanese and English language secondary source materials.  Green convincingly argues that Japanese foreign policy is particularly driven by parochial domestic considerations, and in this respect the book is quite timely in light of the political changes occurring in Japan.  I learned quite a bit from reading this book -- even regarding issues on which I thought my own prior knowledge was significant.
