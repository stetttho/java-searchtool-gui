 Recorded live by at the Antibes Jazz Festival on 25 July 1969, three weeks before the start of the "Bitches Brew" sessions, with the kernel of that band - Miles, Wayne Shorter, Chick Corea, Dave Holland, and Jack DeJohnette.  The set list shows the transitional nature of the repertoire - it includes everything from "Round Midnight" and "Milestones" which Miles had first recorded in the 1950s; Shorter's classic "Footprints" from the mid-1960s, and radically different compositions such as Joe Zawinul's "Directions," Shorter's "Sanctuary," and Davis' self-credited "Its About That Time," which had yet appear on studio recordings.  (Oddly enough, the original studio recording of "Directions," for years a Davis concert staple, would not be released until 1980.)   The band seems to be in transition as well - they don't seem to have mastered the newer material, but they don't play the older material with particular grace or sensitivity either (that said, Dave Holland nails "Miles Chases the Voodoo Down" - he's got to be the funkiest British bass player ever).  It would in fact take Davis years to get to the point where his band could reproduce the aural pastiche that he and Teo Macero were able to construct through judicious editing of studio tapes.  From a marketing standpoint it would have been a no brainer not to release this material when it was first recorded, and indeed, this recording had only an extremely limited release on vinyl in the early 1970s.  An interesting postcard from a period of transition, it probably is only of interest to committed fans of late 1960s Miles Davis.
