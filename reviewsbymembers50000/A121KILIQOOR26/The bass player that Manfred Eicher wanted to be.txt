 Two cuts "More Colours" and "Moana II" are essentially set pieces with string sections from symphony orchestras.  Three cuts "A Dark Spell," "Touch," and the wonderful 12 minute long "Eyes That Can See in The Dark" pair Weber with veteran sax/flute player Charlie Mariano, drummers John Marshall and Jon Christensen, and pianist Rainer Bruninghaus.  (Art Tatum - that sounds like the name of a jazz pianist.  Even Chick Corea sounds like the name of a jazz musician.  Rainer Bruninghaus does not sound like the name of a jazz piano player - but believe me, this guy cooks.)   With Weber and Christensen on the opening cut "Sand" are Ralph Towner on guitar and Jan Gabarek on sax.  All in all, a very nice introduction to the varied music of the bassist that Manfred Eicher always wanted to be.
