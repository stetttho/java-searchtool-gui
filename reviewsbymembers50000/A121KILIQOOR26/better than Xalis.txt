 The second CD from Etoile de Dakar.  More accessible than the first:  the band plays harder, the addition of a second sax player gives the horn sound greater depth, and the CD is better recorded than the first.  Nevertheless, the sound is rather thin or flat.  While it is not difficult to imagine this band taking it completely over the top live, the CD does not seem to fully capture their sound.  Stern's Africa really should have combined this with Xalis, their first CD -- together the playing time is just over an hour.
