 By 1975 Miles had a band that could, in effect, play his and Teo Macero's sonic collages live.  And although its easy to dismiss Michael Henderson as a low-rent Bootsy clone, in this context with so much going on between the two guitarists and the two drummers and the two horn players, the repetitive nature of his bass playing actually anchors rather than smothers the mayhem going on around him - there is a reason that a rock fan friend of mine says that the Miles records with Michael Henderson on bass are his favorite. And what a slab o' sound it is.   If Henderson makes his limitations a virtue, then Miles has in Sonny Fortune and Al Foster the perfect exponents for this sound who seem to have distilled everything in the African-American musical tradition that had come before them.  Mtume and Reggie Lucas sublimate their egos and fit in - in the best possible sense. And then there is Pete Cosey.  If Fortune and Foster sound like they have synthesized everything in jazz, then Cosey sounds like he's dialed in from another dimension. As Miles said, Jimi Hendrix wasn't available.  Never have strings been strangled to such good use.    So with all the superlatives, where's the downside?  Well, at times the music meanders, especially on disc two, track 2's mistitled "Theme From Jack Johnson" (disc 2 track 1 is "Right Off" from "A Tribute to Jack Johnson" as can be verified from listening to the audio sample, I suppose that makes disc 2 track 2 "Interlude"), and while someone (Cosey?) seems to be having fun making these Stockhausen-like white noise static blats using a synthesizer, I recoil in mock horror every time Miles reaches for the organ ("oh no, Miles, not the organ!").  That said, it is still a remarkable, though perhaps not essential disk.
