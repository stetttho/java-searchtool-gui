 This volume is a very useful synthesis of trade and growth theory, pulling together a lot of related models and presenting them in a systematic manner with unified notation.  One is struck at the end how much the results turn on traditional differences in factor usage intensities across industries, and as a consequence, how non-robust many the results are in a prescriptive sense.
