 This is a great album - the single best introduction to TVZ's music around, superior to the anthology that came out a few years back.  This was TVZ in his most congenial environment - a tiny club in Houston with a dedicated and familiar local audience.  The relaxed, non-threatening atmosphere (listen carefully and you can hear beer bottles chink and, at one point, the bar's phone ring) brings out is best performances and jokes, before hard living wore his voice down to a croak and wreaked his time and rhythm.   This newly restored CD brings back all the cover material ("Who Do You Love," "Cocaine Blues," "Nine Pound Hammer,") that was omitted from the previous release, presumably for money/copyright reasons. I got to know Townes a little, and he was a really sweet gentle soul. This disk captures him in performance as I like to remember him.  Countless friends became TVZ fans listening to the original album.  Get it.  You won't be disappointed.
