 This is not the Great American Novel; it is not the Great Indian Novel; it is probably not even the best novel published in 2000.  But it is a lot better than the 1 star reviews would suggest, some apparently motivated by Sharma's unflattering portrayal of India. Prospective readers should think of this as sort of low rent Naipaul:  a bleak landscape populated by characters unable to exert much control over either the historical forces that shape their environments, or even their own urges.  From a storytelling standpoint, Sharma has trouble bring the narrative to a conclusion, and the novel falters in its final quarter, but the ending, at least, rings true.
