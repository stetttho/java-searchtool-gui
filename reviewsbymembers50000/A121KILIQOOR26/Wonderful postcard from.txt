 When Ernest Tubb and the Texas Troubadours rolled their tour bus into Tacoma, Washington in 1965, former Troubadour drummer Jan Kurtis was there to record the show.  The result is a wonderful un-retouched snap shot of Tubb's live show.  Tubb is thoroughly relaxed, taking requests, laughing at blown solos, dedicating songs to people in the audience.  During one number a flashbulb in an audience member's camera audibly explodes and Tubb starts laughing about how he thought it was a jealous husband from their previous stop after guitarist Leon Rhodes. ("And if I was scared, think about how Leon felt!").  The Troubadours, led by Rhodes and steel guitarist Buddy Charlton are in fine form. After years of smoking Tubb's voice is sepulchral, but who cares? Remarkably fine sound quality.
