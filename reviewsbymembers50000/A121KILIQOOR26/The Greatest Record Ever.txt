 OK, maybe not the greatest record ever, but pretty close. Politics, sex, drugs, commerce, literary allusions, rock music illusions, and Elvis all wrapped up in one big post-punk package. Multiple writers, multiple singers, multiple perspectives maintain the creative tension and keep it from getting all bogged down. Sally Timms' difficult personality, beautiful voice, and probably Jon Langford's best guitar playing on record. Life embossed on a small laminated disk of metal. Get it.
