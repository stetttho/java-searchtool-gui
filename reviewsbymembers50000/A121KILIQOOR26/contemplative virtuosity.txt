 Folk-music based intrumentals from Mali.  This disk works as both foreground and background music: the mood is contemplative but the playing is extraordinarily demanding  - so the listener can either listen "hard" and be astonished by kora-player Toumani Diabate's virtuosity, or one can lay back and just let the music flow over you.  The disk's production values are not the best, but it just adds to the air of authenticity of three skilled musicians interacting in the moment without the intermediation of studio trickery.
