 This recording of Coltrane's classic early 1960s quartet (Trane, plus McCoy Tyner, Elvin Jones, and by this point, Jimmy Garrison on bass) just doesn't get the attention it deserves, overshadowed by "Live At the Village Vanguard."  It contains arguably Coltrane's finest performances of "My Favorite Things" and "Naima," as well as fine performances of less frequently heard material such as Mongo Santamaria's "Afro-Blue" and Billy Eckstein's "I Want to Talk About You" (Trane's cadenza on that last one it simply astonishing).  As several other reviewers have noted, Tyner's playing is particularly strong on these performances as well. Unless you are a completist, get this recording and the "Live In Stockholm" disk with Eric Dolphy and save some money by skipping the "Live in Europe" box.
