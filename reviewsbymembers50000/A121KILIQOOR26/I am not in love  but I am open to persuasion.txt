 ...is one of the great opening lines of pop music ("Love and Affection.") Story goes that Armatrading thought she'd be a songwriter.  Fat chance.  Way too idiosyncratic. Hard to imagine others covering these songs, though there must be a tribute album in the works somewhere. Standard greatest hits (and near hits).  Standard greatest hits package gripe:  no documentation.  None of the musicians who played on any of these pieces is credited, so if you want to know who played the bass...well, you're out of luck. About 20 years ago an out of town friend came to visit.  Wanted to go see Joan Armatrading.  I went along to be hospitable.  Expected singer-songwriter wimpiness.  Instead, I was treated to a much more energetic show than I had expected. This comes across in the closing "bonus track" of this disk, a previously unreleased live version of "Kissin' and A Huggin'".  The inclusion of this track really sets this disk off from the other collections and compilations of Armatrading's music which are currently available.
