 And since this is predominately a Ghanaian collection, the emphasis is on pop sweetness. Classic 1970s highlife:  basically "Yaa Amponsah"-style guitar bands with horn sections influenced by soukous from Congo/Zaire. Most of the Ghanaian stars of this period are represented.  This was arguably the golden age of Ghanaian pop music, before the economy completely collapsed, and most of the musicians fled for Europe.     The inimitable A.B Crentsil/Sweet Talks/Super Sweet Talks/Sweet Talks International agglomeration represented by "Abeye Amawo" in which during the coda/fadeout Crentsil lists roughly half the musicians on this disk (including this collection's producer)who will "help out Sister Adjoa"...Teddy Osei/Mac Tontoh/Osibisa amalgamation appear on three cuts:  "Kwaa-Kwaa," "Pete-Pete," and an (innappropriately?)upbeat  cover of "Malaika" in which the Ghanians joyfully mangle Swahili. "Matutu Mirika" and "Odo Bra" are from Eric Agyeman's 1979 "Highlife Safari."  The ever populist Gyedu-Blay Ambulley contributes an updated "Cut Your Coat" in which he complains about "managers conniving with the traders" and advocates soaking the rich.  George Darko and Jewell Ackah are among the other stars of that era who appear on this collection.
