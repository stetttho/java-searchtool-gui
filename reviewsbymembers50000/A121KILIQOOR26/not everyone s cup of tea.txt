 "Brimful of Asha" was the pop hit; the rest of the disk is considerably more idiosyncratic (scratching, rapping, instrumentals, songs in Hindi(?), strange mixes, use of found sounds etc.) and fewer simple hooks.  Indeed, the diversity of styles on this disk is remarkable.  Not without its charms, but surely not for everyone either, closes with a Hindi novelty version of "Norwegian Wood."
