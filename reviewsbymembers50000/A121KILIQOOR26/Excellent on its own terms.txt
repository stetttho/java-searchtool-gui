 Gee, am I the only person here who thinks this record is better than "Car Wheels On A Gravel Road"? To paraphrase someone else's review of Paul Westerberg's latest disk, Lucinda Williams today isn't the person today who recorded "Lucinda Williams" 15 years ago. So get over it.  This is an excellent record on its own terms.  If you want to hear "Car Wheels" go listen to "Car Wheels." If you want something different, listen to this one.  Remember, we're talking records here, not spouses - you can love more than one. OK, now that I have that off my chest, why do I think this record is good?  This is a passionate recording in the sense of both the spirit and flesh, and passion is one thing that animates LW's art.  The melodies are the strongest she's written in years.  While the lyrics don't have some of the narrative detail of her other songs, thematically songs are more introspective and less narrative than in her previous recordings.  Repetitive?  Sure, at times, but repetition is used as a device, for effect, much in the same way that the classic bluesmen of the last century used it.  Does she sometimes sing out of tune?  Maybe, but in the same way that Ornette Coleman has been known to play out of tune - sometimes it is right - even if the books tell you its not.  Is Gurf Morlix a better guitarist or producer than Charlie Sexton?  I haven't a clue - and I don't care.  The musical settings on this disk are varied, yet cohere as a whole, and in the end, that's all that really matters.
