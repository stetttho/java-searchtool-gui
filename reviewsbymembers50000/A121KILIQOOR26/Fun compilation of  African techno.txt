 Fun compilation of "African techno" -- whatever that means.  I suppose what it mostly means is modern mixers sample mainly old tracks and combine them with techno beats.  Although the approach is generally similar across the tracks, the results are not, and this makes the collection enjoyable to listen to straight thru since the music varies from track to track and its not just the same electronic dance beat from start to finish.  Some of the most interesting are tracks where the sampled music is played on traditional string folk instruments Issa Bagayogo' "Diarabi" and Organic Grooves' "Sutukung" where the combination of the traditional instruments and the electronic beats create a nice tension.    Neba Solo's "Noumou Foly" is a variant on this approach, but the main folk instrument, the balafon (a wooden xylophone with gourd resonators) already sounds like an electronic beat so the folk-instrument-meets-the-beats contrast is a little more blurred. Masters At Work "MAW Expensive" is a remix of Fela Kuti's "Expensive ..."  -- see the Amazon page of the original recording for the details of the song's origins -- and its similarity to the original recording brings home just how timeless those 1970s Afrobeat recordings were.  Joe Clausell's remix of Les Go's "Dan Gna" is a fairly straightforward remix of a 1999 international dance tune. Finally, some of the other tracks go the other way - are more techno than African, such as Bob Holroyd's "Waking the Spirits" where despite the sampling the African input is pretty incidental.
