 The conventional wisdom is that X sold out on this one -- hired a heavy metal producer to get a radio hit etc. etc. etc.  True, as far as it goes, but consider this:  those all-but-sanctified Ray Manzarek-produced albums have a thin, flat sound. X was a great band, and those were some great songs, but they were not great (or at least well-produced and recorded) records.  If I had been in X I'd probably wanted better sounding records, too.  No selling out, just better sounding records. So while on this one Michael Wagener makes them sound like Bon Jovi, the desire for more aurally attractive recordings than the ones Manzarek was producing is entirely understandable. So what do we have then?  A record that thematically is more focused on romantic love (more specifically the problems of romantic love) than their other recordings, in the context of the dissolution of the principal songwriters' and vocalists' marriage.  Call it "Rumours" for punks.  Its not a bad record.  And quit yer whining (or we'll whack yer yappin' dog).
