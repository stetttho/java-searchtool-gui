 Kenji Jasper is obviously a talented writer, and this novel is an easy, though not entirely satisfying, read.  As indicated in some in previous reviewers' comments, there is a superficiality of his treatment of some of the thematic issues, starting with murder.  The end result is sort of the novelistic equivalent of a made for TV movie.  That said, Hollywood managed to take "The Beach," a similarly underachieving psychological novel and turn it into a major motion picture starring Leonardo DiCaprio, so perhaps the question ought to be "who will play Thai in the movie?"
