 A while back I was leaving an ABB concert, stoked, and passed a vendor selling "Eat A Peach" t-shirts.  He had one left, it was in my size, and I bought it.  I normally don't wear t-shirts advertizing things (shouldn't they be paying me to wear it?) but I'll wear my Eat a Peach t-shirt -- and I get constant reactions from people when I do. How does one explain "Eat A Peach"? How does one explain cultural revolution?  Because in the South in 1972 this _was_ cultural revolution. You can give all the sociology and history and gossip that you want, but in the end its the music.  A great band suffering a body blow.  Putting studio and live tracks together to get it done.  A cd that doesn't split "Mountain Jam" in two like my worn out records do.  Blues covers, country originals, country-jazz?, a lost brother, and an acoustic guitar duet to close. What more can you ask for?
