 There is a dearth of material on Mali in English (much more in French) so at least in English, this volume has little competition.  I found the information in this book quite accurate, though a bit dated:  as of March 2003, a number of new roads have been paved, and, as the book correctly anticipates, a number of hotels etc. were constructed after the book's publication for the Africa's Cup soccer tournament, and, as a consequence, are not included in the descriptions.  The material on Pays Dogon is good, but far from comprehensive - some of the most interesting villages I visited were not even mentioned in the book.  Like other Bradt guides it shows a good cultural sensitivity to travel in very low income countries, for example providing some useful suggestions on how to constructively handle the frequent requests one gets from village children for candy or pens. (The claim in another review that the book encourages giving such gifts is a flat misrepresentation of the author.) So, the book is quite good though a bit dated - nothing that could not be addressed easily in a new edition.
