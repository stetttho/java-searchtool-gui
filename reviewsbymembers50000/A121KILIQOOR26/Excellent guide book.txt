 The book is highly informative:  I found the characterizations of the bars, restaurants, etc. spot-on (as of March 2003), and did both of the self-guided walks without trouble.  The main weakness of the book is the relatively inadequate fold-out map.  But this is easily remedied - virtually every kiosk and hotel in Prague sells a larger street map with the primary sights as well as all the mass transit routes clearly marked for approximately $....  So buy this book for pre-trip preparation and reference while in-country, and spend a buck on the better map once you're there.  The combo is hard to beat.
