 Field recordings of Akan folk music from the Central and Western Regions of Ghana made by ethnomusicologist Roger Vetter in 1979. In this respect the disk is more narrowly homogeneous than some similar ones:  only the Central and Western Regions are represented, although the bulk of the Akan population of Ghana lives in the Ashanti and Eastern Regions.  And, obviously, if it is a disk of Akan music, it does not include music produced by other ethnic groups in Ghana. What the disk lacks in geographical and ethnic diversity, it makes up in stylistic reach. The music in these recordings is played by non-professional and semi-professional players, and although most of the music is quite traditional (i.e. shows little European influence) some tracks include instruments that originated outside Africa such as the tuba or the electric guitar, and some of the repertoire including waltzes and gospel music show a Western influence transmogrified in the local milieu.  In this regard the recordings are authentic:  the variety of music produced for local performance and consumption in the Akan coastal regions of Ghana was (and remains) varied, reflecting a variety of cultural uses and influences.  While most of the music on this disk was meant for dancing, one of the most interesting tracks is a talking drum piece in which the message is not only played but recited, allowing one to hear the translation from speech to drumming. The accompanying booklet documenting the cultural background, the players, their instruments, and the various musical styles is highly informative.
