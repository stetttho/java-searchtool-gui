 ...you get to record the mott the hoople song you loved when you were 17 and actually make money doing it.  ok, maybe not a lot of money, but nevertheless... this is a collection of covers and originals, with the now trademark buzzsaw electric guitar meets the cello ensemble.  the "live in the studio" sound means that the this version of "guilty" is pretty similar to the one on the live album.  the john cale and lou reed covers work pretty well.  escovedo's voice probably isn't up to the jimmie rodgers cover ("california blues"). the standout cut, cover of the year, is the extraordinary cover of "sex beat" by the gun club.  i don't know if it was inspired by jeffrey lee pierce's death or what, but here it is performed as a dirge:  the tempo is slowed way down, and the buzzsaw guitar is replaced by a spare slide, a harmonica, and some minimalist backing vocals, and some fine drumming.  it is absolutely arresting.  i must of listened to it six straight times the first time a played the cd.
