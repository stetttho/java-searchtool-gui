 Robert Christgau once wrote that Steve Winwood is what happens when one has more talent than brains.  Listening to this CD evokes a similar response. Maria McKee possesses undeniable talent and beauty.  If she had been born 50 years earlier, some studio or Svengali producer would have surely harnessed that talent and beauty and made her a star.  However, it appears that her career has been left to her own devices yielding this highly uneven collection and less than household name recognition. The amber warning light goes off when one realizes that some of the strongest material a) was written by others, and b) is off the first Lone Justice album, before that band first splintered then collapsed.  Although McKee has put out some good solo material, it is much more hit and miss.  The collection reaches its nadir with a pointless live cover of "Sweet Jane."
