 By this point the story is well-known:  in 1970 James Brown's band quit en masse, and he recruited a group of unpolished kids featuring the 18 year old Bootsy Collins to be his backing band.  He would hold this band together for a year before Collins et al. would quit. This band was not without its weaknesses.  The horn section was no match for Maceo Parker and the other 1960s veterans who had quit.  The call-and-response was reduced to James and longtime sideman Bobby Byrd. But, heavens above, what grooves.  They are absolutely relentless.  If this music can't get you up, you'd better call the undertaker. Working with the resources at hand, pushing Bootsy's bass to the front, JB maximizes what he's got.  The high point is a previously unreleased 15 minute version of "Talkin' Loud and Sayin' Nothing" in which JB goes into a rant on self-respect, race relations, taxes, drugs, and whatever else came into head that night -- "I don't want a cat tryin' to drive a plane who hasn't been to school!" If I wanted to explain to someone what America was, I'd hand 'em a copy of this CD.  It's a true cultural artifact.  It ought to be in the Smithsonian.  It ought to be required listening in public schools.  They ought to put JB on a postage stamp.  Next time we send one of those vehicles into deep space we ought to broadcast this to anyone who's listening and help them get a groove on.  Get on up!  Get into it! Get involved! Get involved! Get involved!
