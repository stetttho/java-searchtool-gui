 Given Cale's background in classical music and the sheer diversity of musical settings that he has performed in over the years, it is oddly ironic that perhaps his most effective recording is of a live concert during which he simply accompanies himself on piano or guitar.   Stripped of artifice, some of these performances surpass the more elaborately orchestrated originals, "Dying on the Vine" and "Hallelujah" in particular.  (Not to knock the late Jeff Buckley, but his version of "Hallelujah" is to Cale's as boys are to men.)  Despite his limited vocal range and the simplicity of the instrumental accompaniment, Cale manages to convey a kind of hardboiled maturity that virtuosos like Buckley can't touch.  And he can still scream ("Leaving It Up to You.")    By this 1990 concert Cale had put behind him some of the problems that contributed to a career that another reviewer correctly described as "uneven," and behavior that might be charitably described as "erratic."  He had more than twenty years of output to draw upon, so there is little "filler." Some of the songs are more effective than others (lyrically they range from musical settings of Dylan Thomas poems to free association doggerel).  The breath of themes and emotions traversed in these compositions is such that it would be surprising if they evoked uniform responses across listeners.  Different listeners will have different favorites.  I have mine. Not background music, this disk rewards serious listening.
