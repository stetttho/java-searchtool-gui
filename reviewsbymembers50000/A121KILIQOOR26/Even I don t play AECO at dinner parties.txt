 I once put on "A Love Supreme" at a dinner party and was surprised how well it was accepted.  But as the late great Lester Bowie once observed "I don't want to hear "People in Sorrow" when I am at a party," and, in general, people don't want to listen to Trane, much less the Art Ensemble of Chicago, while eating.  Or drinking colored martinis, for that matter.  "The Mirror Conspiracy" fits the bill -- hip background music for dinner parties -- and I don't mean that negatively.  Everyone hosts parties, and everyone wants cool music that won't [upset] their guests.  This seductive, ingratiating music sounds like Morcheeba gone Latin ((So Com Voce, Samba Tranquille, Shadows of Ourselves), indeed Pam Bricker on the standout cut "Lebanese Blonde" sounds like Skye Edwards from that aforementioned band. And although this may sound like damning with faint praise it is sincerely not meant that way -- this is a fine recording and these guys are clearly a cut above (no pun intended) their down-tempo brethren. So next time you're hosting a get together...
