 this is basically a marriage of techno with jazz. it would make an excellent gift for someone who needs their ears opened a little.  yet despite liberal (and generally quite effective) borrowing from disparate sources -- a variety of samples, ernest ranglin on guitar, west african talking drums -- this is actually a pretty conservative disk.  live jazz musicians play over sampled rhythm loops and the repetitive nature of these loops give it an undeniable groove.  but is also creates a rhythmic straightjacket, despite the talking drums which, in effect, also play over the loops. the result is some genuinely appealing music that never really goes over the top -- it can't, really.  contrast this with some of the studio pastiches that miles davis and teo macero created in the late 60s/early 70s using only an analogue tape recorder -- and that davis' bands were eventually able to recreate live (cf. "jack johnson," "agartha"), or with similar contemporary work that is more adventuresome (e.g. ex-centric sound system).  i'd definitely give this to someone for christmas -- but i wouldn't expect it to change their life.
