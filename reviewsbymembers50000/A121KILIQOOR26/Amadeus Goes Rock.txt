 Clayson, stuck in lo-fi obscurity, plays Salieri to Winwood's Mozart, asking why Steve has all the talent, money, and girls.  More funny than bitter, Clayson's experience as a rock musician informs his understanding of the music industry and Winwood's remarkable career.  In this sense the book is almost as much about the British pop music industry in the 1960s as Winwood per se.  Definitely a cut above the usual pop star hagiography, despite lack of access to its subject (Winwood did not cooperate in the production of this book), a surprisingly good book.
