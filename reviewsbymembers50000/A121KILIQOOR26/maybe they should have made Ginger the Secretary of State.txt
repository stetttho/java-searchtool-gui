 I bought this record as a lark when it came out (Ginger Baker?  with Charlie Haden and Bill Frissell??!!)and was stunned by what I heard.  Good writing, a couple of decent covers (Thelonius Monk's "Straight No Chaser" and Ornette Coleman's "Ramblin'"), and concise intelligent playing by three middle-aged guys who had definitely paid their dues. And then came "East Timor." Cockney-accented Ginger starts with a spoken word introduction of slightly clumsy rhymed couplets about that country's annexation by Indonesia (with the acquiescence of the US, Australia, and other powers) as he starts beating his toms with more and more intensity ending with the impassioned declaration of rememberance that "There WAS a bloody war!!!!" like some kind of latter-day Old Testament prophet.  Frissell launches into his best Jimmy Page imitation and its like three old lefties saddling up for one final battle with the powers that be.  I just stared at my speakers.  I still do.
