 What can you say about a band that hit the big time rhyming "much" with "tush"? This is ZZ Top before Billy Gibbons discovered synthesizers, before MTV was invented, before the long beards and fur-encrusted drum sets.  This is Nudie-suit wearing, stages shaped like Texas accompanied by buffalo and vulture, era Top. The national hit "LaGrange," mumbled vocals about a house of ill-repute over that John Lee Hooker riff and scalding guitar, the regional hit "Francine," which caused the Stones to reconsider the advisability of booking Top as their opening act, and eight more cuts off their first four records.  A lot more fun than a boxed set.  Almost as fun on CD as eight-track.  Give it to someone you love.
