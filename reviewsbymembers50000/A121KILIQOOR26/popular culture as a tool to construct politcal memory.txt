 This is a fascinating account of the use of popular culture in constructing nostalgia and with it collectively shared political-cultural narratives of the nation's history.  It is particularly apropos during an election centered, to a strange degree, on events 30 to 40 years ago.  The book focuses on two iconic public figures, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton, who each successfully constructed alternative interpretations of the 1950s and 1960s and rode them to the White House.  In some sense Reagan's was the simpler task, using his personal charisma to frame a nostalgia evoking American dominance and stability, "a chronology of 1950s normality, 1960s deviance and trauma, 1970s hangover and stagnation, and a 1980s return to health and glory," aimed at a largely white and male core political constituency for whom such a narrative did not do tremendous violence to their personal interests.     Clinton's task was harder-as Marcus observes, "American imaginations find it difficult to hold onto the image of an antimilitaristic, psychedelicized, left-wing white southerner." But Clinton managed to turn the trick, reaching back to JFK and Elvis as his touchstones.  Indeed, Marcus argues that the death of George Bush's southern guitar-picking political advisor Lee Atwater deprived him of the one political hand who might have had the cultural instincts to fashion a successful counter to Elvis as Policy Wonk, and with an assist from Ross Perot, Clinton went on to win in 1992.   Reading this well-written book one wonders what Marcus would have made of the media's hagiographic treatment of Reagan at the time of his death, or the weirdly backward looking focus of the current presidential election campaign.  But it is precisely that backward gaze which demonstrates the contemporary relevance of this book.
