 As Rod Stewart once said, some guys get all the luck.  If Christine Anu had been born in America, with her looks and talent, she'd probably live in Silverlake, hang out with the stars, and have her life documented by the National Inquirer.  As it is, she makes the cover of the Australian issue of Vogue, and gigs in Parramatta.  Such is life.  C'est la vie. Christine Anu is a performer of aboriginal ancestry from Thursday Island (TI) who bears striking resemblance to 400m star Cathy Freeman (with whom she apparently occasionally hangs.  Actually, come to think of it, being Australian and hanging with Cathy Freeman probably beats being American and hanging with, say Charlie Sheen, but that's another story).  Anyway, the disk is pretty generic international pop.  There are some tracks based on aboriginal music, some use of found sounds and samples, and some aboriginal themes in the lyrics, but at the end of the day, this is a pop record.  And a pretty good one.  Her new record is supposed to be even more pop oriented.
