 Field recordings from Francophone Central and West Africa.  Strengths:  a fair amount of diversity -- the recording locales range from Algeria to the Congo, so there is a lot of stylistic variety.  (Special award for authenticity:  during the "Danse Touareg" recorded in the Sahara, a huge gust of wind comes along and makes this screeching static sound in the mike.) Weakness:  its pretty scattershot - not a lot of coherence. The accompanying booklet is in both French and English, not particularly informative, tends toward the "noble savage" school of romanticism.
