 On this disk Steve Earle manages to harness the thematic and stylistic diversity of his work into a masterful whole.  Love, politics, race relations, and a dirge meet Americana/ alt.country, bluegrass, vocal duets, the Fairfield Four, and grunge.  Some people find the stylistic diversity and production touches (i.e. the faux record scratch on "The other side of town;" the vocal compression on NYC) bewildering - I think they're great - keeps the record from bogging down in two guitar/bass/drum sonic sameness.  Personally, it is my favorite Steve Earle record.
