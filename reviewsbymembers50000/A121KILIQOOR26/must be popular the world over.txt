 ...I first heard it while riding in a taxi cab in Seoul. Enjoyable "world music," takes songs from a variety of sources and then applies modern pop music gloss.  Closest referents Ofra Haza and rai.  Not up to Don Was - Khaled standard in terms of either the hooks or inventiveness of the arrangements, still enjoyable "crossover" appeal. One song in English, brief translations of the Hebrew lyrics into English in the accompanying booklet.
