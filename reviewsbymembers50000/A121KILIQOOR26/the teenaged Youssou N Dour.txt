 Very short (less than 28 minute) CD recorded in a Dakar nightclub in 1978.  A few tracks feature the teenaged Youssou N'Dour.  Not bad music, but hard to imagine that this CD would have a lot of appeal for non-Senegalese.  The follow-up, Volume 2:  Thiapathialy is longer, more accessible, and better recorded.
