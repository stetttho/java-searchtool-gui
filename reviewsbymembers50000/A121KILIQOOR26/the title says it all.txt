 This is a collection of Kenyan guitar band music from the 1960s and early 1970s, before it was stylistically supplanted the more dance-oriented, Zairean-influenced, benga.  Typical line-up is two guitarists, one playing lead, one rhythm, and simple percussion (shakers etc.) accompanying a vocalist.  Sometimes there is a bass, horns, or a flute.  Most of the songs might be described as folk-pop:  relatively simple melodies and accompaniment.  The version of "Malaika" that is included would be on the pop end of the spectrum.  Cut for the ages:  a Swahili version of "La Bamba." The collection closes with a song celebrating Kenya's first great runner, and later a great humanitarian, Kip Keino.
