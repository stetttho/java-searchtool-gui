 This beautifully written memoir brings home some very unpleasant truths:  war can be fun and addicting (along with horrific and repulsive); the casual abandonment of social constraint can be fun and liberating; and after too much fun it is difficult to downshift into "normal" society (so self-medicate).  It is an extraordinarily passionate and personal book, and evokes equally intense reactions in its readers as the reviews attest. It is not too hard to jump from Anthony Loyd's discomfited Englishman looking for his place in the world to the thousands of muhajideen wandering through the Balkans and Central Asia looking for theirs.  Post 9/11 we may be dealing with thousands of these war addicts for years to come. The chapter on Chechnya, in which Loyd temporarily leaves the Balkans for the even higher dosage action in Grosny (in which the Russians reportedly hit the city with 30,000 shells in a single day) is the worth the price of the book alone.  It puts the far more modest US bombing campaign in Afghanistan into a certain perspective. In the end, this book is so intense that it is difficult to write about it at all.  Read it and see for yourself.
