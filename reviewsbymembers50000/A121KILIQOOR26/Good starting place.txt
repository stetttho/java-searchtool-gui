 This two-disk set has replaced "The Essential Steve Earle" as a greatest hits package covering the early part of his career (1985-1990) when MCA was trying to figure out how to market the talented but trying Mr. Earle. I would like to thank the thief who stole my copy of that CD in a burglary for encouraging me to purchase this one.  I can only hope that you have the taste to appreciate what you stole. Steve Earle is a good musician and an astonishing songwriter.  Bruce Springsteen is probably his only contemporary in American popular music to have such a lyrical facility with American vernacular. The songs in this package tend to be narrower both stylistically and thematically than Earle's later work, which, depending on one's taste could be a good or a bad thing.  The cuts on the first disk, in particular, largely taken from his first two albums, are much in the mold of mainstream Nashville production of the time - heartbreak, white lines, stadium drums, and overdubbed guitars galore.  In evidence is the populism that would later turn more explicitly political (again, a good or a bad thing depending on one's perspective). The second disk is more transitional - by this point MCA's country division in Nashville had given up dealing with the notoriously difficult Earle and transferred his contract to the rock division in LA.   Less formulaic rock producers and deepening personal problems lent themselves to more musically diverse, darker, songs, and by the set closing live recording of "West Nashville Boogie" from 1990, Earle is howling desperate lyrics over the John Lee Hooker/ZZ Top "LaGrange" riff. This, in turn, would give way to jail and drug rehab, followed by an artistic and personal renewal in the latter half of the 1990s.  Highly recommended as an introduction to Earle's music.
