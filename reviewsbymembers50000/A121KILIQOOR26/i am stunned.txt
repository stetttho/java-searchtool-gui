 i was absolutely stunned to see the many five star ratings. i bought this disk a while back on the basis of iz's killer version of "over the rainbow/wonderful world." it is an undeniably outstanding version:  iz had a beautiful voice and did some interesting things harmonically on that track.  but to my ears at least, the disk went downhill pretty quickly from there, hitting the bottom with a cloying rendition of "country road" (ok, from my perspective that last phrase involved an oxymoron).  i sold the disk at a used cd store. iz is a cultural icon in hawai'i and i am sure that all those five star reviews are perfectly sincere, but this isn't a five star disk, to my ears at least.  its a wonderful world, to each his own
