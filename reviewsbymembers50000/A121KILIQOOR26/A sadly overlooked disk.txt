 The Village Voice ads for Syd Straw's shows used to bill her as something like "Lower East Side Country Girl" which sort of captured her spirit - in the positive sense. This was a sadly overlooked record from a career that never seemed to connect with either the indy rock or alt.country audience the way it should have.  This disk features some interesting songwriting ("Sphinx" a fantasy about her alterego, "Almost Magic," a faded love country song), playing (guitar virtuoso Richard Thompson turns in accompaniment on a couple of tracks, a partial list of the side-men is extraordinary: Thompson, Ry Cooder, Don Was, Bernie Worrell, Marc Ribot, Dave Alvin, Tony Levin, Benmont Tench, Greg Leisz et al.,), and duets with Michael Stipe and John Doe. Straw has a good voice (I still hear her on commercials now and again) ...  Somehow, it never all connected though. Maybe it was because Straw made a lousy video bimbo. Anyway, it's worth taking a flyer on this intriguing disk.
