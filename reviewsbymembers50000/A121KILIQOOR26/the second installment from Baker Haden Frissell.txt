 This CD may actually be a little more consistent than the first one,though it lacks anything as explosive as "East Timor." The addition of a second guitarist and Bela Fleck on banjo on a few tracks fleshes out the guitar-bass-drums trio sound. So, if Baker, Bruce, and Clapton in their twenties were "Cream" these guys must be "Cognac" or something.
