 Odd, charming CD.  Alt.country meets chanson (or should it be chansonne?) in the form of singer/songwriter/guitarist T. Durbin and his partner Bernadette Colomine.  Band name presumably refers to the French nightclub dance routine - not Native Americans per se.  Literate, idiosyncratic songs, perhaps best conveyed by some of the song titles:   "Merle's Cravate," "Last Night I Was Bad Person's Plaything" "My Baby - Il Est Souvent Au Lit," plus covers of "Je N'Ai Besoin De Personne En Harley-Davidson" (the Brigit Bardot song) and Cole Porter's "I've Got You under My Skin."  Durbin and Colomine's second effort appears as "Shoofly." Definitely worth taking a flyer on this one.
