 This a very accessible, though dated, introduction to Ghana written by a political scientist (now in the Israeli Knesset) and an anthropologist.  The only real problem with the book is that the story ends in 1979, just as Flt Lt Jerry J Rawlings comes to power and initiates a significant reorientation of the Ghanaian economic and political system.  It is a pity that Pellow and Chazan have not updated this book.  Now of interest more as a history than a description of the contemporary scene.
