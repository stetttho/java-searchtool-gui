 The authorized biography, written in 1980 and updated in 1990.  Not a bad book, summarizes Smith's life and contains a number of testimonial's by former players, including an introduction by Michael Jordan.  Not as detailed as Smith's own recent memoir nor as revealing as Art Chansky's book, really only for the dedicated Dean Smith fan.
