 A generous workout from an unusual sax/guitar/organ/drums line-up.  Despite David Murray and the late Don Pullen's avant-garde reputations, they understood the African-American gospel and blues tradition, and with Pullen playing a Hammond B-3 instead of his usual piano, the whole record is infused with a kind of soul jazz feel - sort of like what those old Blue Note records would have sounded like if they had absorbed the subsequent 25 years of developments in jazz.  The highpoint is the closing track, Pullen's "Milano Strut" which he originally recorded as a duet with drummer Don Moye on an obscure Italian label.  Here it gets a fuller reprise with the addition of the sax and guitar.
