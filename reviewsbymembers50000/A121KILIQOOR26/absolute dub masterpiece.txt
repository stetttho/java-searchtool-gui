 This CD consists of what originally were two records issued separately -- "Marcus Garvey," Burning Spear's stunning 1976 debut, and the dub version of the record titled, appropriately, "Garvey's Ghost." "Marcus Garvey" was a masterful record that influenced a whole generation of musicians, combining political lyrics, Winston Rodney's instantly recognizable, yearning, beseeching vocals, and stellar musicianship under top producer Jack Ruby. The follow-up dub version was a revelation in itself.  Some of the remixes emphasize the rhythm section of drummer Leroy "Horsemouth" Wallace paired with bassists Robbie Shakespeare (who would go on to form Taxi) or Aston Barrett (of the Wailers), to form trance-like dubs which became the standard for Jamaican music of the late 1970s and early 1980s.  Other tracks rearrange the vocals to create wholly new songs. The pairing of the two records on a single disk is brilliant.  Not only does it take advantage of the greater capacity of CDs, but the ability to program players to play the disk randomly means that one can intersperse the original and dub versions of these songs in a single listening. Punch up the bass on your amplifier and enjoy this absolutely wonderful introduction to reggae music!
