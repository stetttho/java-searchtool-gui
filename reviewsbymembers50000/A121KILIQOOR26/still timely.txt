 This is a nice introduction to various schemes to stabilize the oil market.  It critically examines some "bad" approaches, and then proposes a market-based solution drawing on the theory  of commodity price stabilization and the use of financial instruments to neutralize the impact of commodity price volatility.  The author manages to combine intellectually rigorous analysis and detailed institutional knowledge of the oil market into a readable volume.
