 This is an encyclopedic survey of contemporary sub-Saharan African music up through the mid-1980s.  Organized by country, Graham provides a brief background on local traditional and mid-century popular music and then concentrates on the music of the 1970s and the first half of the 1980s.  Covers religious as well as secular music.  Includes brief discographies.  I did not identify any factual innaccuracies within the realm of my limited knowledge.  Excellent index.
