 ...could be used to describe either Mingus or this collection: producers Joel Dorn and Hal Willner have chosen to lead off with "Cumbia/Jazz Fusion" a sprawling 27 minute piece that (unjustly) received little attention and virtually no airplay when it was released in 1979. This is followed by a solo piano piece "Myself When I am Real." The listener is well over forty minutes into this collection before encountering well-known "hits" like "Haitian Fight Song" or "Goodbye Pork Pie Hat." The subtext of the collection seems to be to establish that Mingus was a jazz composer comparable to a giant like Ellington. And it is true, the sweep of this music from solo piano to big band, from chorus-bridge-chorus songs to multi-sectional suites is impressive. In this regard, this anthology succeeds as an introduction to Mingus' music. However, the inclusion of some of this material is done at the cost of omitting many of Mingus' better known (and more typical) works.  If one just wants to hear Mingus and his band at their peak, get the late 1950s classics like "Ah um." The CD includes good liner notes. All musicians and recording details documented.
