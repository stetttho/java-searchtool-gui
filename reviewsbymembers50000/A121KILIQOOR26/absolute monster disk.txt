 from the deejays of a now defunkt south london club.  man, i wish i had made it to that club.  disk arranged geographically:  start out in south asia (bally sagoo's mix of "kinna sohna" by ustad nusrat fateh ali khan, then to the north africa (funk club mix of "didi' by rai singer khaled, on to sub-saharan africa and the power-pop sweetness of "angelina" by the ghanaian highlife band sweet talks, across the ocean to latin america and brazilian percussionist airto's "samba de flora" and end up in the states with luther barnes and the red budd gospel choir doing "my god can do anything." and this disk nearly does everything.
