 A highly uneven collection of 12 remixes, mostly of female jazz vocalists from 1960s, from the archives of the Verve label. As another reviewer observed, most of these remixes are likely to satisfy neither techno/downtempo/whateveryouwanttocallit nor jazz enthusiasts. Basic problem is shoehorning the jazz vocals into shoes that lose the rhythmic suppleness of the originals. The two that to my ears work the best, Rae and Christian's remix of the jump blues "Is You or Ain't You My Baby?" by Dinah Washington, and Masters at Work version of Nina Simone's "See-Line Woman," work the best precisely because the originals are the most R&B-oriented of the underlying tunes and the remixes stand up to the originals nicely. (The video for "Is You?" is quite entertaining as well.) The open triumvirate of Dormeister reworking Willie Bobo's "Spanish Grease," MJ Cole's version of Carmen McRae's "How Long Has This Been Going On?," and Thievery Corporation's remix of Astrud Gilberto "Who Needs Forever" make for nice party background music. The last three cuts, UFO/Sarah Vaughan "Summertime," Tricky/Billie Holladay "Strange Fruit," and King Britt/Tony Scott "Hare Krishna" bear out the adage that not all experiments succeed.
