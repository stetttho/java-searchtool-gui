 Ghanaian singer A.B. Crentsil has fronted a series of bands since the 1970s: Sweet Talks, Super Sweet Talks, Sweet Talks International et al.  He has a highly distinctive voice and is both a popular, and in some respects, controversial, musician: although he has recorded gospel music, some of his music has been deemed sacrilegious and banned from the radio. This recording from the 1970s reflects his varied interests.  It begins with a straight, highlife rendition of the Lord's Prayer, which is then followed by the infectious, 10 minute plus hit, "Adjoa" (a common female name), in which Crentsil advises the song's namesake to get with the program and give it up to the soldiers of whatever military government happened to be in power at the time.  He then flips back into contemplative mode for the album closing "I Don't Know Why."  Neither do I, but I can dance to it.
