 This superb book should become the standard popular reference on the International Monetary Fund and the financial crises that swept the globe in 1997-98.  Paul Blustein has a background in economics and first-hand experience in Asia where the crises originated.  The book is well documented:  Blustein conducted hundreds of interviews (unlike his Washington Post colleague Woodward, he actually names his sources) and is familiar with the academic literature on the subject.  Indeed, this entertaining book does a marvelous job of explaining the substantive economic issues while at the same time conveying the very human disorder of crisis management as practiced during these episodes. It is less doctrinaire than Friedman's cheerleading for globalization in "The Lexus and the Olive Tree" and is far better informed on economic policy making than Woodward's "Maestro."  (Simply compare Blustein's highly informative descriptions of the Korean and Long Term Capital Management crises with the complete hash of the same episodes that Woodward produced in "Maestro.")  Highly recommended.
