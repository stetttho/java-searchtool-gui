 ...and Frank Zappa is still wrong:  rock music journalism does not have to be people who can't write interviewing people who can't speak for people who can't read.  This installment of the Da Capo "Best Music Writing" series features a wide range of pieces both stylistically and in terms of subject matter.  Nik Cohn's article "Soljas" on the New Orleans rap scene, originally published in Granta, is an astonishing piece of writing and would deserve to be in a collection of "Best Writing of 2002," music-oriented or not.  Three other contributions are striking for their biographical writing, illuminating broader, non-musical themes:  RJ Smith on the LA enigma Korla Pandit, Michael Hall on Texas psychedelic rocker Roky Ericson, and Matthew C. Duersten on jazz diva Anita O'Day.  There are more traditional musicological contributions (David Cantwell "Help Me Make It Through the Night") and humorous satire from the Onion.  A very enjoyable volume.  Would make a good gift for anyone interested in popular music or just good writing.
