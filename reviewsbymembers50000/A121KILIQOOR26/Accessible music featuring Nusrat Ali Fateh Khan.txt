 Music from the soundtrack to the film "Bandit Queen."  The three basic components are Nusrat Ali Fateh Khan's vocals, Roger White's synthesizer washes, and drumming. Occasionally there are other voices, other instruments (flutes, some kind of strings instruments), and incidental sounds.  The cuts with the additional instruments beyond the synthesizer and drums tend to be more melodic.  The ones with the synthesizer and drums only tend to be fairly "atmospheric."  The late Nusrat Ali Fateh Khan's vocals are astonishing.
