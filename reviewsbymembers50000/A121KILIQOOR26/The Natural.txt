 One night many years ago, I saw Kris Kristopherson, Lou Reed, and Neil Young perform within the span of a single week. I had an epiphany, towards the end of Reed's show, while watching him gamely try to make it through "Heroin" for what I calculated must have been his 10,000th public performance of the song. Like Kristopherson, on "Help Me Make It Through the Night" (also public performance number 10,000), he was trying to do something with the song to fight off the ennui and boredom, but just didn't have the chops to quite pull it off. A few days later I saw Young. Roughly the same age as the other two, he came off as a complete natural. It was like bounding around the stage like he was 17. He confounded his band by launching into an extended feedback drenched solo mid-way through "Mr. Soul" (quick check, public performance 10,000), who all looked at each other with these "what is going on here?" expressions and on their faces and tried to keep up while Neil jerked around the stage like an epileptic on speed. I turned to a friend and said "he's going to be doing this when he's 70." "Ragged Glory" from 1990 is one of Young's stronger outings of the last 15 years or so. As one of the other reviewers noted, the songs are pretty simple frameworks through which Young and Crazy Horse bash away with reckless abandon. He's go that same technically-limited-but-hear-me-wail solo style that he's had since "Everyone Knows This is Nowhere," but he's got better equipment and a fuller sound. Personal favorite is "Love and Only Love," (too bad you can't hear the excerpt of that one) but there are a bunch of good'uns on this one. Definitely a guitar player's record.
