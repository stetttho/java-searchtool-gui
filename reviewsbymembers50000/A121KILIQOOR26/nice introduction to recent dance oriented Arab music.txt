 Nice sampler of dance music from twelve artists hailing from five North African and the Middle Eastern countries (and in the case of Natacha Atlas, the UK).  With the exception of Khaled's "Mauvais Sang" (1992), the cuts are from 1997-2000.  Highpoints:  the (uncredited) soul chanteuse vocals on Abdy's "Galbi," the use of undulating ululations instead of synth squiggles in Hamid El Shaeri's "Hely Mely," Natacha Atlas' Arabic trip-hop "Kidda," and Cheb Tarik's relentlessly syncretic "L'histoire" in which he manages to jam rai, reggae, hip-hop, and dancehall into one cut.  Not definitive, and everyone can come up with cuts that they would have liked to see included, but a pretty nice introduction to recent dance-oriented Arab music, nonetheless.
