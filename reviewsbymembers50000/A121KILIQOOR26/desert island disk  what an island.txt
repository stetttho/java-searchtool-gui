 Excellent compilation album for those who don't own or don't want to buy all of their output.  Traces their rise from the idiosyncratic retro gangsta vibe of Southernplayalisticadillacmuzuk to the breakthrough singles "Ms. Jackson" and "B.O.B." off of Stankonia, plus some new unreleased tracks.  Booklet useful for the lyrics (glossary, anyone?) and the photos which document Andre 3000's increasingly, uh, ...out there fashion sense (anyone who caught their last tour or the Grammy performance will catch my drift).  If I had to pick a single rap CD to cart off to the desert island, I think it would be this one. I can hear the PE fans wailing already, but, hey, I'm from South...
