 A few weeks ago I had this disk on a home and two of my guests enthusiastically asked about this "new music" that was playing.  They were stunned to learn that it was recorded more than 30 years ago.  I guess it was the retro-resurgence of the electric piano that fooled them. "Return to Forever" really is a stunning disk - Chick Corea's self-conscious attempt to write more accessible compositions after more experimental pieces of the late 1960s early 1970s, with a band that spanned the acoustic and emerging electronic frontiers of jazz.  That band was a remarkable confluence of backgrounds and talents:  reedman Joe Farrell's traditional jazz background, from Brazil Flora Purim and Airto on vocals, drums, and percussion, the teenaged prodigy Stanley Clarke on acoustic and electric bass, and Chick Corea's unique talent for making an electric piano sing.  The music that they created was at once challenging, accessible, and joyous.  "Return to Forever" together with the companion disk "Light as a Feather" taken from the same recording sessions capture a singular moment that stands with anything that these musicians subsequently produced.
