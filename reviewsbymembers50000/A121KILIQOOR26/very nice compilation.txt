 Very nice compilation of mostly previously released Six Degrees cuts.  Most cuts put non-Western popular music into a techno or ambient context. Given the different musical traditions that these remixes are built on, there is considerable diversity across the 11 cuts.  Highlights are Zuco 103's "Outo Lado," remixed by Wu Tang collaborator Carlos Bess, Euphoria's "Sweet Rain" remixed by Fila Brazilia, and Karsh Kale's "The Longing."  Another Fine Day's aptly named "Flying Headcase Dub" version of "Scarborough Fair" is possibly the oddest cut in the collection.  I don't know about you, but I always think "ah yes, let's do some scratching" when I hear traditional English folk melodies.
