 People like to make lists and talk about the 10 best of this or the essential list of that, but in my work I travel to, and live in, places that are the cultural, if not geographic, desert islands.  No, I'm not talking about Nebraska.  I'm talking places where they don't have compact disks.  Which means that you have to bring your own (or at least you used to -- technology may obviate that need now).  Anyway, many times I have been forced to pack a limited number of CDs which I knew that I would end up listening to multiple times.  This disk has always made the cut. It is a startling collection in many ways. The range of covers from John Philip Sousa to Ives to Muddy Waters to Dylan and Madonna is eclectic to say the least.  This is real Americana. The instrumentation -- drums bass guitar accordion clarinet -- is similarly unique, and allows for some really unusual voicings.  The ensemble playing in consistently intelligent and it up to the material.  Just a really wonderful disk.
