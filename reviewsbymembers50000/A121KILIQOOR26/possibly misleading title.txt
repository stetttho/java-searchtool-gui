 This is indeed a CD of 1970s-80s East African guitar bands, but these guys play with little sustain, and despite the length of some of the cuts, these guys are a lot closer to Joe Pass or Chet Atkins than Jimi Hendrix -- i.e. don't expect rock guitar "heroics."  Or histrionics either, for that matter. Instead, this is benga, a heavily Congolese-influenced style.  Typical line-up of a band on this collection is one or more singers, two guitarists, a drummer, a percusionist, and a bass player.  Some of the bands have horns.  The style often takes the form of the two guitarists playing intricate repeated patterns behind the singer(s) with one of the guitarists stepping out occasionally for a solo.  The rhythm sections are typically more subdued than their West African counterparts.
