 A short, readable, though dated, introduction to Philippine history.  The emphasis is almost proportional in distance in time from today:  the monograph is strongest on pre-Spanish history, the narrative more or less peters out post-Independence, and Arcilla is careful not to make value judgments about contemporary Filipino leaders such as Ferdinand Marcos. Yet this is not without value to those interested in the Philippines today - reading the section on banditry and insurgency in Mindanao in the 1500s one cannot help but reading into Arcilla's narrative a remarkable continuity to the present.
