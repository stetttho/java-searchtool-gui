 The Memphis-based Rich embodied the confluence of that city's multiple currents of American music.  The result is genre-busting American popular music integrating country, jazz, blues, R&B, and even gospel into a seamless whole.  Most of the tracks feature a piano/guitar/bass/drum line-up augmented by horns on half the cuts; the selections range from public domain blues ("Juice Head Baby"), to Rich originals, standards ("Mood Indigo"), and the songs by other accomplished songwriters (the title track by Doc Pomus and Dr. John). The final cut, "Feel Like Going Home," is a fitting epitaph for Rich who died not long after its release.  Definitely a desert island disk.
