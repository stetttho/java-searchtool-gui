 Hailing from Owerri in Eastern Nigeria, Godwin Kabaka Opara and his brothers in the Oriental Brothers International and subsequent offshoots (Dr. Sir Warrior et al.) took the relatively gentle guitar highlife music of Ghana and threw it into overdrive.  If the Ghanaians are a sleek sedan, these guys are a 4x4 SUV:  declamatory vocals (kind of like Kansas City blues shouters) interspersed with spoken parts over relentless guitar- and percussion-fueled riffing.  With the advent of the lp as a medium by the 1970s (when this was recorded) these guys were extending the jams to whole album sides in effect creating 12" singles which might run 12-18 minutes. Thematically the material ranges from gospel "Oh Dear Jesus" to modern traditional "Mmawu Egbu Special" to proverb-based title track "Onye Ikewere Mekeya."  "Oh Dear Jesus" is particularly interesting:  in most parts of the world one can instantly recognize gospel music by its chordal and rhythmic conventions whether one understands the vernacular language or not.  Not here:  this hymn consists of urgent prayers sandwiched between 12+ minutes of fast tempo guitar solos which would sound right at home in any African club at 2am on Saturday night. Praise be.
