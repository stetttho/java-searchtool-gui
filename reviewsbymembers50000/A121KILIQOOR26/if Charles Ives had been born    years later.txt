 he might have written something like "Spangled Banner Minor and Other Patriotic Songs" which... plunders not only "The Star Spangled Banner," but "Deutschland Uber Alles," "La Marseillaise," and the "Colonel Bogey March" as well (hey, this was a _European_ tour).  This disk is dated in a pleasant sort of way:  some of the soloing is pretty "out there" and due to the economics, it is hard to imagine anyone touring today with a band like this one, consisting of ten musicians each formidable soloists in their own right. Bley's writing and arranging are strong. The 19 minute "Spangled Banner Minor..." is the standout cut.
