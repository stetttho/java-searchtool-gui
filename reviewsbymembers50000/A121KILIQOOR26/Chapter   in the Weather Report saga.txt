 Chapter 6 of the Weather Report saga finds our man Joe Zawinul obtaining an Oberheim polyphonic synthesizer.  The good news is that nobody can play them like our Mr. Z, though by this point the experimentation of the band's eponymous debut and the open-ended jams of "Sweetnighter" have been left far behind for much more tightly structured, daresay poppish, compositions. It is not hard to imagine Mr. Z careening around his Pasadena home studio like some deranged mad scientist proclaiming "I've got zee formula!!!"  (Electronically reprogramming his keyboards so that the bass is on the right hand side would not come until Chapter 9.  That stint in the Aspen ski lodge would be even later still.) As Chapter 6 opens, our Dr. Funkenstein ("so ziss ist zee formula!") is still holding Wayne Shorter incommunicado in a safehouse in Newark, only allowing him occasional public appearances such as the well, elegant, "Elegant People."  Legions of drummers are brought in (and out), reportedly a half dozen at one recording session.  ("Vee can play zeese rhyzems.  Vy kon't you?") A photographer is hired to provide an illusion of fraternity -- the band sitting around a communal fruit-laden table.  But look carefully:  only Zawinul and drummer Chester Thompson have both hands visible.  Shorter's left hand is not visible - he was chained to his chair, as was percussionist Alex Acuna.  Only Thompson was able to escape.  (That actually isn't Jaco Pastorious in the middle - it's a cardboard cut-out.)  The hidden story behind Chapter 6:  Alphonso Johnson.  Give Jaco his due - his bass playing is superb on the two cuts ("Cannon Ball," "Barbary Coast,") on which he plays, but it was Al who was holding down the fort for the rest of the production and turns in the sadly overlooked "Hernandnu." (Try saying that ten times real fast.)  "Black Market:" the final shake-down cruise before Dr. Z sent his juggernaut plowing into chapter 's 7 "Heavy Weather."
