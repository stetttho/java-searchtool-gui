 There's a beer company that is currently running an ad campaign that features a bunch of old jocks who are supposed to be "originals" and somehow drinking this beer is supposed to make you "an original" too.  Naw, that ain't original. This is original.  This CD defines original.  The graphic on the picture dictionary entry for "original" ought to be the cover of "Lubbock on Everything." I can't imagine who would have played this when it came out.  Country radio wouldn't touch this with a barge pole.  Same for rock.  Maybe a "progressive country" station or two in Texas.  Its a wonder that it even got made in the first place. Still have never heard it on the radio, web or otherwise. I bought this disk because a buddy of mine from Texas swore that this was "like, the greatest record ever made" and forced his band to cover "The Girl Who Danced Oklahoma."  I don't know if its the greatest record ever made, but it certainly fits into a handful that I have heard (Conlon Nancarrow, Captain Beefheart) that reflect one pretty unique vision. The instrumentation is pretty conventional country, and Allen has an adequate, limited voice, and a West Texas twang.  But, Lord, what songs.  The man has a real eye for characterization, and the parody of "Wreck on the Highway" ("Truckload of Art") complete with dobro and yodeling may be the funniest song that I have ever heard.
