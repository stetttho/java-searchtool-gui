 This memoir is consistent with what I have observed of Smith over the years:  intelligent, organized, interested in the world outside of basketball, publicly reserved, and loyal to a fault.  The last two characteristics make the book a little frustrating to read:  Smith will not name names or criticize his former players or coaches, though if you are fan of Carolina basketball you will know the names to fill into the anecdotes and incidents he describes (e.g. J.R. Reid's suspension from the 1989 ACC tournament semifinal for missing curfew.) Nevertheless, it is far better than most other sports memoirs (i.e. he actually had a life off the court)and should broadly appeal to people not especially interested in basketball in general or Carolina in particular.
