 One great song: Bob Mould meets Richard Thompson on the cathartic "Dying From the Inside Out;" one pretty good song, the Michael Stipe vocalist "Alive and Living Now;" and a slew of Amanda Kramer atmospheric ballads, the best of which is "The Haunting." It may be possible to get this one really cheap used, otherwise try to find a download of "Dying From the Inside Out" and skip the disk.
