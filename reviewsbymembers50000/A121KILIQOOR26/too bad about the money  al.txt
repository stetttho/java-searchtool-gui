 really nice disk from austin-based alt.country rocker alejandro escovedo.  actually, the alt.country label may be both overly confining and misleading:  escovedo started out as a punk (the nuns) and subsequently moved through a variety of bands including  punk-country (rank&file) new romantic (the troobs) revivalist (buick mckane). his bands often feature strings (as in violin and cello).  so what we've got is a middle-aged singer-songwriter with a punk background and string players in his band. uh-huh. one could argue with some of the song selections (where's "put you down"?) but the covers are interesting (the stones "sway", lou reed's "street hassle" and a violin/cello driven version of the stooges' "i wanna be your dog." yeah, you read that last part right.  he turns the string players loose on that one and they make like the second coming of john cale.
