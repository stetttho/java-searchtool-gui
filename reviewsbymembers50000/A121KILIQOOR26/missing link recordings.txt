 From the late 1960s, these are "missing link" sessions between the classic Miles Davis 1960s quintet and the more electric music of "In A Silent Way," "Bitches Brew," etc. that was to come.  The title track is a Wayne Shorter composition featuring a plaintive Davis, superior here to the performance on Shorter's solo recording.  The quintet is augmented to a septet by the addition of Chick Corea on electric piano and Dave Holland bass on "Two Faced" and "Dual Mr. Tillman Anthony," creating a near dual rhythm section.  Its unfortunate that this recording has not received wider circulation.
