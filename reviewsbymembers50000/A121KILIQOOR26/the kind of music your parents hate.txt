 ...you know, unintelligible lyrics, out of tune guitars, the f word -- great work guys! saw these guys live in japan once.  they were awful.  would have gotten booed off the stage in the states, the japanese kids just stood there looking befuddled.  lesson:  save the money you would have spent on tix and just buy this disk. i actually wrote the better part of a book listening to this cd on three different continents -- considered thanking the band in the acknowledgements -- the perfect portable accompaniment to any alien environment. the disk is solid from start to finish.  favorite cuts:  "unfair," the bands exploration of californian geography hydraulically and culturally, "5-4=unity" which is what happens when a bunch of slackers take on dave brubeck's favorite time signature, on "range life" pavement does country complete with venomous put-downs of other bands, and "fillmore jive," what it means to be old when you're, like, 30.  "silence kit" is a great song and "cut your hair" was their mtv hit when mtv still showed music videos. carry, on boys.
