 This is a very useful travel guide.  Some of the information is outdated (several new regional airports have been constructed and roads paved since this edition was published) but presumably the forthcoming edition will bring the descriptive material up to speed.  What really makes this guide, though, (and why I think it is superior to the Lonely Planet guide)is the background material on Ethiopian history and culture.  Since it is for historical and cultural reasons (as opposed to say viewing wildlife) that many travellers will visit Ethiopia, this part of the book is a real strength, as is the chapter on intercultural interaction.  Reading this guide you get the sense of real human beings writing it, not some generic "three stars for this castle and here is a good restaurant." Definitely recommended.
