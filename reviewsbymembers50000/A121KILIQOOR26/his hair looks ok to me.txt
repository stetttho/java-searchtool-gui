 well, any country singer who bases his lead single on a nursery rhyme ("barlight") and closes his record with a fantasy about burning down nashville ("molly's blues") either has some seriously large huevos as we say in tejas, or a professional death wish.  i hope its the former for all of our sakes. my criterion for 5 stars is whether every track is memorable -- this disk meets that test.  sufficed to say that robison is a strong writer, and lloyd maines' production is stellar.  this one has been in my personal heavy rotation for months.
