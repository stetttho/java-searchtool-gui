 At this point in his career, Steve Earle has enough creativity and chops to produce a fairly wide range of pop music stylistically.  Their underlying quality is the reason that these disparate pieces hang together, even if they don't really cohere.  Which is to say, this disk would probably be a lousy introduction to Steve Earle for someone who had never heard him, but dedicated fans would probably enjoy it - but for different reasons.  The sheer diversity of the cuts on this disk means that it is highly unlikely that any listener will like them all equally - and equally unlikely that any two people will agree on which are the best.  That's a mug's game that I leave to others.
