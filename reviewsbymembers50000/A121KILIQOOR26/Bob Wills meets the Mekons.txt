 Pretty good musicianship: some good guitar work, nice to hear those mariachi-by-way-of-Lubbock horns on "San Antonio Rose," but the rhythm section doesn't seem to understand that this music is supposed to swing.  Oops. Vocals extremely variable:  the girls (especially Kelly Hogan and Jane Baxter-Miller) can sing, but the boys can't, more or less.  This is a problem, if, like me, you grew up on the originals.  The most painful example is "San Antonio Rose" where Alejandro Escovedo seems lost (and out of his range) while Tommy Duncan's vocals on the original sound nearly effortless. Jimmie Dale Gilmour is wonderfully suited for this material, but the other male vocalists tend to be less successful. Robbie Fulks can sing but exhibits his tendency to degenerate into howling on succeeding verses - Bob Wills as incipient psychopath - hadn't thought of that one. This one is hard to rate inasmuch as the quality varies so much from track to track.
