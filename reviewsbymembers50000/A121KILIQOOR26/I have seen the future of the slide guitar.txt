 ...and its name is Robert Randolph.  Who would have thought that the true heir to Duane Allman would turn out to be an African-American from New Jersey, but the Lord works in mysterious ways.  Friends, I am here to tell you that this is the Truth. A bunch of country pedal steel players have been talking about doing some kind of collaboration with the steel players from the House of God, but John "the Baptist" Medeski beat them to it, and boy did they nail it.  No small label obscure disk with a few old guys listening to it - no way.  They've got Medeski's following and a young pedal steel messiah and they're going to take this thing right over the top. Randolph is an astounding talent, pulls vocal-like sounds out of his guitar like nothing you have ever heard (in addition to this disk check out "Without God" on the Sacred Steel Live disk - absolutely awesome).  Closest referent is the Allmans at their peak circa. 1971.  Next one's gonna have vocals and soon we'll all be in church.  Just you wait and see.
