 true story I:  i was getting married in africa and we had to get a band.  i was traveling so my wife and best friend go out to check out the recommended band and come back with a report that "they can play anything" and "want to know what you want to hear." veritable human jukeboxes.  right.  so if these guys are so accomplished, let them try this on for size, and i flip them a tape of "n'ssi n'ssi." a couple of weeks later, i stumble into the wedding reception and this band strikes up a dead-on perfect version of "serbi serbi."  they had everything but the steel guitar. threw in a cover of "n'ssi n'ssi" to prove it wasn't fluke.  came up to me afterwards and asked if i had anymore khaled tapes.  wanted to learn more songs. heard that they now cover "didi" and "aisha" as well. true story II:  my buddy, who doesn't speak a word of arabic, walks into my house and "serbi serbi" comes up on the player.  "this guy has lost his girl."  i guess some things are universal. the lesson in all of this, is if you're interested in hearing some new music, or rai, or khaled, or you're just the Writer from running times who wants to know what world record marathoner khaled khannouchi listens to in his car, check this out.  you won't be disappointed.  i've got african wedding bands and college professors the world over as my witnesses.
