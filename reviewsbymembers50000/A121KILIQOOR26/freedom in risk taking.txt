 Barbara Sfraga is no spring chicken.  She will not be the next Christina Aguilera.  But that has its advantages.  Not having to worry about being the next Madonna conveys a certain amount of freedom to do your own thing and let the chips far where they may.  This album in an interesting mix of standards "I Didn't Know What Time It Was" and originals.  The standout track is her cover of Jerry Lee Lewis' "Great Balls of Fire" which has got to be the most unusual version of this tune ever recorded.  It works.  Unfortunately, the straight jazz treatment of Cream's "Sunshine of Your Love" is less effective absent Jack Bruce's monster bass riff.  Her backing band is quite good.
