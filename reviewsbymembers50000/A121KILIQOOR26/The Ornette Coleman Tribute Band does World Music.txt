 The Old and New Dreams Band could be regarded as Ornette's classic quartet with Dewey Redman standing in for Ornette, or, since Redman later played with Coleman, the Ornette Coleman quintet without Ornette.  The disk starts out with an extended and compelling performance of the classic "Lonely Woman" on which bass player Charlie Haden really shines. This is followed by two African-influenced originals, "Togo" by drummer Ed Blackwell, and "Guinea" by trumpeter/pianist Don Cherry. The disk loses steam after these first three tracks. Its back to Ornette for "Open or Close," followed by Redman's "Orbit of La-Ba" on which he wails like a muezzin on the musette. The disk concludes with Haden's "Song for the Whales," "written with respect for all species of whales, in the hope that they will soon be protected by international law." Well, Charlie got his wish fulfilled, though one can argue about just how effective the International Whaling Convention actually is. I once read somewhere that the song of the humpback whale spans eight octaves. From the way this track sounds, Mr. Haden's bass can span eight octaves, though, having demonstrated that, I am not sure how many listeners would want to hear it done repeatedly.  As another reviewer observed, with the deaths of Blackwell and Cherry, we are never going to have the opportunity to hear this band again. Only more reason to treasure their recorded output.
