 This is a sort of problematic collection consisting of the originals from which the Verve Remixed disk remixes were derived.  Ten of the twelve cuts are female jazz vocalists bookended by Willie Bobo's opening cut "Spanish Grease" and the closing chanting of Tony Scott's "Hare Krishna." If one just thinks of it as a female jazz vocalist compilation (or if one is energetic enough to program the player so that it becomes a female jazz vocalist compilation), it is enjoyable though not definitive.  The Willie Bobo cut stands out because it isn't female jazz vocals, but it's a nice tune.  Tony Scott's chanting will probably send many listeners scrambling for the eject button.
