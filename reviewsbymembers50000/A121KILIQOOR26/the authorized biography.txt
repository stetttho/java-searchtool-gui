 Author Sara Corbett was granted exclusive access to the 1996 US women's basketball team, and this amounts to their authorized biography.  Corbett is a good writer and manages to convey a series of themes:  the tenuous existence of women's basketball in the US in 1995 when the team was formed, the heterogenous backgrounds of the players and coaches, the incipient rivalry between two nascent professional leagues for the allegiances of the players, to name a few.  And Corbett is to be commended for managing to integrate this disparate material into a single narrative.  But in basketball terms she is a "homer" -- and one wonders whether the exclusive access that she was given, implicitly or explicitly, informs this relentlessly positive depiction of the team. That said, it is probably a very good book for teenagers of either gender interested in basketball.
