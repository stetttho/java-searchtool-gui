 This book is a veritable blueprint on how to do economic research.  Leamer starts with a concise review of the underlying Hechscher-Ohlin theory (this chapter alone is worth the price of the book) and then moves on to descriptive/graphical/visual analysis of the data and finally rigorous econometric modeling.  Although the frontiers of academic research have moved on beyond what is presented in this book, in part due to Leamer's subsequent work, this is a real classic.  Ought to be required reading for any graduate student doing research in international trade. So why _is_ it called "pure" theory?
