 This is not your usual sports book: here are some of the index entries for the first seven letters of the alphabet: anxiety attack, bidet, condoms, drugs, Clint Eastwood, Sigmund Freud, and ginseng i.e. Jayson Williams has a broad range of interests that he covers in a colorful way.  Unfortunately, there is really no narrative structure to the book, and the material, however provocative, the writing has that "as told to" blandness to it.  Entertaining, though not great literature, the paperback will make good beach or airplane reading.
