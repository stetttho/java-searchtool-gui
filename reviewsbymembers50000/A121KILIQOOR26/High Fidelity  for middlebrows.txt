 Will make good beach reading when the paperback edition comes out.  May not have a lot of appeal beyond a) males of a certain age and disposition, b) people who like rock music, and c) residents of Seattle.  Big ups for the reference to "Hospital" by the Modern Lovers.  If you catch the reference you'll probably like the book, if you don't you probably won't. So who will be cast as Pete in the movie version?
