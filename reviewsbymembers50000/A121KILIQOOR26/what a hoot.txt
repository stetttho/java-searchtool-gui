 What a blast from the past! -- they don't write them like this anymore. Originally published in French in 1966, French Arabic-speaking Marxist takes on all comers (most prominently Max Weber) on the topic of Islam and capitalism.  Tendentious, polemical, caustic:  it brightened up my afternoon. The "About the author" blurb says that Rodinson spent seven years teaching high school in Lebanon -- I'd bet those kids came out bent. I'd love to see Rodinson and Samuel Huntington locked in a room.  An intellectual steel cage death match. Probably could sell tickets and broadcast it on CSPAN (even I don't think that they're quite ready of pay-for-view).  What did you say about clash of civilizations?  Hats off to translator Brian Pearce.
