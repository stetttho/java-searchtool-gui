 Poor Kip Hanrahan.  What bad timing.  If he had only made this record in say 2001 instead of 1987, the current generation of hipsters would have snapped up this ingratiating mix of New York latin jazz, tango, arch lyrics, and unabashed romanticism, and he'd be a household name.  Instead, this CD slips in and out of the catalogue.  Muscianship is first-rate; among the musicians appearing on the disk are Jack Bruce, Steve Swallow, Allen Toussaint, Astor Piazzolla, David Murray, John Stubblefield, George Adams, Anton Fier, Fernando Saunders and a host of others. Get it while you can.
