 Former Joi singer Susheela Raman's debut outing was short-listed for the Mercury Prize in the UK.  It is an interesting an enjoyable album - but be forewarned it is much closer to Sheila Chandra than Joi.  Raman's is an exceptionally rich voice.  Instrumental backing mostly low-key and acousticky (guitar, cello, bass, and percussion with clarinets, electric pianos, trap drums, and snoring (?!) occasionally joining the mix).  Opening cut "Ganapati," which includes trap drums and guitarist Sam Mills steps out a bit more than elsewhere on the record, sounds a bit like the Abercrombie-Holland-DeJohnette Gateway trio meets South Asia. Indeed, the traditional Indian songs tend to work better than the originals in part because they have stronger melodies and in part because I can't understand the lyrics so the vocals just sort of wash over me.  Indian lyrics translated into English in the CD booklet if you're really interested.  Really to bad that this disk hasn't received more attention in the US - certainly deserves more.
