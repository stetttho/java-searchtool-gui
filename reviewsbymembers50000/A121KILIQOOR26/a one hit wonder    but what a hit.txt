 Dawn Penn has a reputation as a one hit wonder -- her performance of "No, No, No" is mesmerizing, and it went to the top of the charts twice -- in the 1960s when first recorded, and then again in this 1994 remake (which appears in two different mixes on this disk).  But after "No, No, No" the rest of the material is pretty undistinguished, even working with several production teams. She has a good voice, and apparently could get steady work as a backing singer, but she seems to lack the personality or charisma to really shine as a solo artist -- except on that one song.  One might want to skip this disk and obtain a recording of "No, No, No" off a collection.
