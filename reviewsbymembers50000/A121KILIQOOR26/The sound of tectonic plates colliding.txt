 Edgy, gnarly music.  Two long, weirdly dreamlike pieces - a series of grooves interspersed with collage-like breaks, some echoing fragments from other compositions such as "Ife" from the Miles book of this period.  Parts sound like someone's very bad dream.  I can see why Miles went into seclusion after producing this music.  Sounds like he ran the voodoo down, caught it, and strangulated it.  Musically, drummer Al Foster and oft-maligned bassist Michael Henderson lay down the groove; percussionist Mtume, more prominent here than in the companion disk "Agartha," plays off of Foster and Henderson.  Foster and Henderson maintain a steady forward momentum and the music avoids the meandering that sometimes afflicts "Agartha." Guitarists Pete Cosey and Reggie Lucas lay down chordal rhythm for Davis and sax/flute player Sonny Fortune, with Cosey alternately breaking out for string-strangling solos, plus added percussion on "small instruments" a la fellow AACMers, the Art Ensemble of Chicago, and occasional synths.  Miles manages his organ better here than on "Agatha."  Anticipates Ornette Coleman's harmolodic jazz from Prime Time and its offshoots. Really sounds like nothing else around.
