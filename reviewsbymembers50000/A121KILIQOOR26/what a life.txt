 Record "Rescue Me," marry Lester Bowie, and then get Wayne Horvitz to produce your comeback gospel album.  Way cool! Great material. The band cooks and she's got some acccomplished sidemen (Lester, Stew Cutler, Marty Ehrlich, Hamiet Bluiett, Dave Douglas et al.) playing on this record.  When I see this disk in a used CD store I buy and give it to a friend.  It is that kind of record.
