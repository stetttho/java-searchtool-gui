 My criteria for five stars is that every cut has to be memorable.  This one nails it. There are six tracks.  Each composition is strong and vary stylistically from the hard driving Hammer compositions to the more contemplative piano-guitar duets.  Hammer and Abercrombie vary the instrumentation enough from track to track that despite the trio format, the tonality of each piece is quite also distinct. (I still can't figure out how they made some of those sounds.) The playing is superb. My impression is that the ECM "Works" series, which made for convenient samplers, is out of print, and as much as I love Dave Holland's playing on the Gateway disks, if I were looking for an initiation to Abercrombie's music, I'd start with this one.
