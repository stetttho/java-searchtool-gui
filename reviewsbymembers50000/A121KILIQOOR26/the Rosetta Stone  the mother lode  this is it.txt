 This is it.  An absolutely extraordinary musical document.  Actually, an absolutely extraordinary American cultural artifact. Young blues-based rock musicians appropriate jazz...and nail it.  Expansive jams that...actually go somewhere.  "Frere Jacques" as a coda to a nightmare.  "Joy to the World."  Freight trains. You could start "You Don't Love Me" at the guitar-drum duet, move it to the beginning, and start the whole thing over and it would still make sense. Around 10 years ago when my ex-wife was teaching at one of the top three liberal arts colleges in the US, she expressed the view that Gregg Allman was a moron who married Cher and passed out in a bowl of spaghetti.  "True," I admitted, "but he wrote "Whipping Post" at the age of 21, and I'd stack it up against any of the senior theses that you are grading," I replied.  No matter what he subsequently did, he had a pass for life in my book. Multiply that by six and you've got "Live at the Fillmore East."
