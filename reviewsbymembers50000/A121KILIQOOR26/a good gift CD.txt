 This CD would make a good gift choice:  the compositions are varied, listener-friendly, short, and have a pretty high familiarity quotient (hard to imagine anyone who has heard at least one of these piece before).  Radio on a CD.   The St Louis Symphony under Slatkin sounds good, and the Telarc engineers did a good job of recording.
