 Postcard from Rachid Taha's recent world tour. The Led Zep reference is not a joke - he gives them a shout out in "Foqt Foqt" and indeed this music is closer to rock than to rai.  Aurally, the sound, featuring Taha's declamatory baritone and the Francois Delfin's hard edged lead guitar, reminds me as nothing so much as late 1970s/early 1980s John Cale, but with derbouka (percussion), lute, and keyboard synths providing the Arabic orchestral string parts.  Steve Hillage adds a second guitar on six cuts, and on some cuts ("Medina," "Voila Voila") the band, in effect, plays techno live. Quite a disk.
