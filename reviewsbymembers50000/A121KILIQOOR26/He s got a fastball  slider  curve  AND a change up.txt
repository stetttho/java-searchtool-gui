 My criterion for 5 stars is every track is memorable. Well, every track on this one isn't memorable, but there's a lot of tracks and enough are...so, hey, give'm that last one. Some great lines "I wanna hit this town 'til its teeth come out," an inspired cover "The Joker," a gospel song that works "Once He Finds Us," gentle humor "Doublewide Blues," some really tasty slide work by Will Kimbrough (and a nice rocker "Godsend" by Kimbrough too). But it's the songwriting that really puts this one over the top. Not generic -- behind 'em is a real person with a keen eye for detail and more than one pitch. Put 'im in the game, coach.
