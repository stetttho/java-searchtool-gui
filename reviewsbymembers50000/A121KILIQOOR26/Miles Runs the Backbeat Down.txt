 OK, maybe the monstrous Billy Cobham pattern that kicks off "Right Off" isn't a classic 4/4 backbeat, but you get my drift. This disk gets little respect from jazz critics, though it was probably an entry point to jazz for a lot of rock and R&B fans of a certain age as the many reviews attest. Like one of the other reviewers said -- you can play this one at a barbeque.  The concept was pretty simple:  from his previous "electric" forays, retain the horn solos and Teo Macero's collage editing, but can the subtle jazz rhythm section and replace it if something more primitive.  For the recording Miles recruited drummer Billy Cobham whose toms and cymbals work are so muscular on "Right Off" that Led Zep fans would (and undoubtedly did) feel right at home.  Guitarist John McLaughlin in full Mahavishnu electric mode. Take away Herbie Hancock's piano, and give him an organ, add an R&B bassist, and, voila! a rock rhythm section for the horn players and McLaughlin to solo over.   This was the model on which "fusion" was built.   On the considerably less propulsive, "Yesternow," the band is augmented by the late (and uncredited) Sonny Sharrock on second guitar.  Michael Henderson repeats (and repeats and repeats) a bass vamp while each of the players takes turns soloing and Teo does his cut-and-paste thing.    What sets this recording apart from a lot of what followed is that this music is not formulaic.  As with most of Miles' recordings there's an open ended-ness to this music that his imitators couldn't capture. Run on. And pass the barbeque.
