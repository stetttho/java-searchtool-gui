 I like punk rock music.  I like avant garde jazz full of squeals, honks, and atonal blats.  The female singer-songwriter genre is not my usual cup of tea.  This is a great CD. She's got a massive hook "Last Night was a Big Rain," a JB tune ("This is a Man's World,"), and uses a plastic hose swung around her head to get a theramin-type sound on one cut.  The Art Ensemble of Chicago would be proud. I have only heard a couple of Sara Hickman's other CDs.  I didn't think they were as good as this one:  the songwriting was weaker and tended toward cloying earnestness.  But this one is great.  Take it from an avant punk.
