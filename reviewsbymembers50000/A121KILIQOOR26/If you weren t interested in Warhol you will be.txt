 a stunning, intensely personal, heart-felt work, as two middle-aged artists try to come to terms with each other and their former mentor. it strikes me as a surprisingly fair treatment -- they dodge neither warhol's shortcomings nor their own. essentially structured as an autobiographical narrative: childhood ("small town" -- pittsburgh  doesn't literally qualify, but i suspect 1950s oakland, the neighborhood in which warhol grew up in some cultural sense did), the move to new york and warhol's start as a commercial graphic artist ("open house"), and then the blossoming into greater artistic ambitions and the establishment of the factory (""style it takes," "work," et al.).   (if you are ever in pittsburgh stop, by the warhol museum.  if you have never had the chance, you can see the mao prints, the cow wallpaper, floating silver cushions, and other warhol creations mentioned in these songs.) Valerie Solanis tries to kill him ("i believe," in which reed/cale endorse the notion that her execution would have been the appropriate response), and in significant respects its downhill from there for warhol.  the work closes with an epilogue "hello, its me" from reed/cale's perspective. aurally, its a remarkably diverse disk, given that its only   reed (vocals, guitar) and cale (keyboards, viola, vocals).  with no rhythm section and only limited tools they create varied soundscapes, particularly in cale's dream-song "a dream." my work carries me to some pretty obscure points on the earth for extended stays, and i have considerable experience with packing desert island disks. this one is always at the top of the stack.
