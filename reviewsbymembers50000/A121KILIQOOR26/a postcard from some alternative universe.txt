 In some of his novels, William Gibson has characters, not particularly cultured or sophisticated, who find themselves in situations involving technology and forces with which they are not prepared.  Somebody named Jim White may exist contemporaneously in the same universe as me; he may have once been a taxi driver; he may get played on the radio; a couple of the tracks on this CD may have been produced by Morcheeba, which is a British band consisting of two brothers and a singer.  All of this is too limiting. I prefer to approach this disk as a work of science fiction  the diary of one of Gibsons products of white trash inbreeding encountering situations for which he is unprepared.  This enlarges the zone of empathy and dulls ones instinct to criticize the indulgent.  As a postcard from some alternative universe it works.
