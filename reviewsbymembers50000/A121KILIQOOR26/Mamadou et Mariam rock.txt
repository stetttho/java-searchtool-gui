 Normally, that isn't saying much, but in this case the rockers in question are two blind Malian folkies. A couple of blind Malian folkies rockin' out is something behold, indeed.  I mean, wouldn't the world be a better place if Beavis wore a Mamadou et Mariam t-shirt and pumped his fist to "Mon Amour, Ma Cherie"?  Seriously, "Mon Amour" rocks harder than anything Metallica has produced since they cut their hair. Really, seriously.  There is a sense of urgency to this music, even when it doesn't have the backbeat of "Mon Amour." The first time I heard "Teree La Sebin" I thought "I don't know what this woman is saying [the songs are French and Dogon? -- whatever they speak in Mali] -- but whatever she's saying she means it."  Quick check of the lyrics "But no one can escape his lot/I say that illness of the eyes isn't good/But what can I do?/Amadou plays the guitar, Mariam sings/We came for that/For us its our destiny/I said sorry to everyone but they accuse me of everything/I apologized to everyone/But they called me every name under the sun/My older brother...my brother I am not the only one/They put the evil eye over my head/What did I do to God for Him to take my eyes?"  Want a love song?  Check out the sample of "Je Pense A Toi."  Wouldn't the world be a better place if they put THIS on MTV?
