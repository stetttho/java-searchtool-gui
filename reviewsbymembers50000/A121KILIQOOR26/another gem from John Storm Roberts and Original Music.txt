 Recordings from 1958-1972.  Mostly Nigerian horn-driven highlife love songs.  The two cuts by Prof. Y.S. & His B.B. Band show a strong James Brown influence.  The two cuts by the Junkers are more or less rock and roll.  The track by Pepsi-Orlando is proto-juju with a melodica break of "500 Miles from My Home"(?!).  A couple of overtly political numbers "Lumumba Calypso" and "President Tubman."   Good guitar work throughout. The disk ends with the aptly named Charlotte Dada covering the Beatles "Don't Let Me Down" over a traditional metal percussion choir.
