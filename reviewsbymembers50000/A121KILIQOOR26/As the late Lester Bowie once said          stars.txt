 This is an absolutely, unbelievably, grotesquely underappreciated album. It ought to be a best seller. I totally indebted to the friend who gave it to me as a gift. Four fine young musicians solve the chronic problem of weak original material by recording compositions at the interstice of jazz and R&B by Thelonious Monk, James Brown, and Rahsaan Roland Kirk (hence the name T.J. Kirk). The two guitars really mesh (Charlie Hunter is surreal) and they really get inside these compositions in a wonderful way (e.g. quoting JB in Monk's "Humph" and turning Kirk's "Volunteered Slavery" into reggae). Total funk workout. One of the disks that I inevitably pack when heading off for desert islands. Give it to someone you love.
