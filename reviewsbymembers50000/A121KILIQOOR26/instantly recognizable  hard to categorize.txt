 "Odyssey" was a recording that Norwegian guitarist Terje Rypdal made with his road band.  While it is usually categorized as fusion jazz, it utterly unlike the virtuostic overplaying typical of that genre.  If it is reminiscent of anything, it is some of the work of Miles Davis, in that musician's downplaying of "chops" in favor of spare soloing inside fairly skeletal frameworks. These pieces tend to be built on similar lasts:  a repeated bass vamp; organ or synth laying down chords; drums essentially for coloration; and a kind of counterpoint or call-and-response between Rypdal's biting electric guitar tone and Torbjorn Sunde's trombone. Contra to one of the previous reviews, the 26 minute "Rolling Stone," the most rock-oriented track on the original 2-disk lp, is not included on the single disk CD for reasons of space.
