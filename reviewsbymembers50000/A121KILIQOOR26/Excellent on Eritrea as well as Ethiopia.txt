 "Smallchief" mentioned that he had used this book in only in Ethiopia; I can attest that the Eritrea section is excellent as well.   The walking tours of Asmara are a particularly useful and enjoyable introduction to a beautiful and eminently walkable city.  Some of the information is out of date - a number of the establishments mentioned in the book are now closed, presumably due to the Eritrean economy's difficult straights.  Let's hope that Ethiopia and Eritrea can overcome their joint and singular difficulties.
