 This is a wonderful disk. I am saddened and astonished to see that the only cut that one cannot hear a sample of is "Dreaming of the Master," Joseph Jarman's homage to Miles Davis, the standout cut on this album, and a staple of the AEC's live shows. The music is highly varied from the reggae of the opening "Ja," to the Ellingtonia of "Nice Guys" to the percussion piece "Folkus." The really standout piece though is "Dreaming of the Master" with its elegant counter-melody and double time break. Since unfortunately you cannot hear a sample, think Oliver Nelson's "Stolen Moments" played by free jazzers. This cut alone is worth the price of the disk.
