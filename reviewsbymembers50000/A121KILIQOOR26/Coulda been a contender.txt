 Ingratiating power pop from a victim of video culture and grunge, the aptly named Matthew Sweet.  (Uh, well, aptly named as long as you don't pay attention to the lyrics, the weirdly paired the anthemic chorus and lyrical self-loathing of "Sick of Myself" to start.)  Nice lead guitar, especially from Robert Quine ("Girlfriend,""Sick of Myself," "The Ugly Truth"), to go along with the keening vocals.  Ace production values. Coulda been a contender.
