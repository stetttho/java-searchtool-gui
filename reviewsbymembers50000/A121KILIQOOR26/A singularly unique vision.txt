 Listening to this disk for the first time in a long time, I am struck by just how strange it is.  I wonder how Jonathan Richman convinced the other Modern Lovers to publicly participate in his unique musical vision  after all, these guys were pretty good musicians (later playing in the Cars and the Talking Heads among other bands) so presumably they had other opportunities, and this material was not exactly mainstream or fashionable stylistically, thematically, or any other way in 1972-3 when these recordings were made.  Indeed, some aspects of these recordings (e.g. some of Richmans spoken word introductions) verge on being painful.  Some nights it must have been embarrassing to be on stage. So why do it?  Well, its a pretty thin line between being a crank and being a genius, and some of these songs are brilliant.  Anyone could recognize that.  And they are unique.  Despite their obvious stylistic borrowing from the Velvet Underground, nobody sounded like this either. So how about the disk?  Well, the songs heavily overlap with the John Cale produced first album ("The Modern Lovers"), and given that records live in the studio sound, the bands sound isnt much different, though the audio quality of this disk is worse (no surprise).  So, if you dont have the first album, youre probably better off starting with it. However, if youre a dedicated Jonathan Richman nut then this one is worth having  some of the songs dont appear anywhere else, the performances are generally strong, and then there are those weird spoken word introductions to remind you just how unique this band was.
