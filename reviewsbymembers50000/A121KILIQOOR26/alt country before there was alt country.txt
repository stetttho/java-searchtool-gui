 There is something wonderfully weird about the bent observations of the lyrics delivered in a West Texas twang to the accompaniment of a simple 4/4 beat, parlor piano, and pedal steel.  One can see why Terry Allen is David Byrne's favorite Texan.  Although never reaching the oddball grandeur of Allen's true masterpiece, "Lubbock (On Everything)," this two-fer nevertheless has its moments, including the delightful "Gimme a Ride to Heaven, Boy," still a staple of Flatlander live shows. There are surely Waylon Jennings tribute albums in the works; maybe Robbie Fulks or some other country insurgent ought to cover "Are You Sure Hank Done It This Way?" as "Are You Sure Terry Allen Did It This Way?" - he's the grandfather of them all.
