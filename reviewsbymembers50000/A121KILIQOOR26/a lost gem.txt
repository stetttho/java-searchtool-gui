 I am quite surprised to see that this disk is marked "limited availability" and had not been reviewed.  This collaboration between June Tabor and the Oyster Band is possibly her most accessible work for those outside the traditionalist ghetto.  On it they cover songs by a variety of well-know writers (Lou Reed's "All Tomorrow's Parties," Richard Thompson's "Night Comes In," Billy Bragg's "Valentine's Day is Over," Shane McGowan's "Lullaby of London," et al.)  They also perform traditional tunes ("Dives and Lazarus," "Susie Clelland"), and Si Kahn's "Mississippi," probably the least well-known of the covers, is gem.  Unlike some of her other forays into pop music, this one seems to work, presumably because the Oysters are a working band with a distinct approach and sound, and not just a collection of musicians hired for a one-off project.  Not everyone will love every one of the covers (I suspect that the breakneck tempo "Night Comes In" will not be everyone's favorite).  Nevertheless, this is a very strong collection and I am really surprised by this recording's apparent lack of visibility.
