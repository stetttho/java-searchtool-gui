 Eric Agyeman was a highly popular guitarist from the Ashanti region. Mostly recorded in 1979 with the core of the Sweet Talks band. This is guitar-driven highlife with some horns and cheesy synths, representative of the style that was popular in the late 1970s/early 1980s -- a harder, more aggressive sound than the "palmwine" and horn-driven dance band styles that preceded it, and less Westernized than the "Burger highlife" sound that became popular later when many of the musicians ended up in Europe.  A variety of singers including the inimitable A.B. Crentsil handle vocal duties.
