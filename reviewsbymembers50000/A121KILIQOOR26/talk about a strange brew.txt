 A friend of mine used to joke that his hometown of Bloomfield NJ was where "Italy meets Africa in America." Well, this CD is what happens when Israel meets Ghana in in a Tel Aviv recording studio. (Israel meets Ghana in a lot of Tel Aviv restaurant kitchens these days, but that's another story.) What comes out is a kind of techno dub with the traditional West African percussion providing both rhythmic propulsion and a human touch.  The sampling sources are extremely diverse and masterfully interwoven into the soundscapes.  Some of the tracks are anchored in traditional Ga and Fanti folk tunes ("Agbae")justifying the Sankofa visual proverb (retrieve the past to move forward) used as the band's logo. Among my favorinte tracks:  "Lullaby" and "Kokobi." Nana Dadzie's suit of Ghana independence 40th anniversary cloth in the liner photo gets them that last star.
