 This is a slightly strange, idiosyncratic disk -- but not in a bad way.  Robin Holcomb has a thin country-sounding voice.  She plays piano and writes unusually literate and harmonically open songs.  Her better known keyboardist husband, Wayne Horvitz, assembled some really crack jazz musicians (Bill Frisell, Marty Ehrlich et al.) to interpret this country chamber jazz.  The results will probably not be to everyone's liking, but I note that the used copies are being practically given away, so why not take a flyer on it?
