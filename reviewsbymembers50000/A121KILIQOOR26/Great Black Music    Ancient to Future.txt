 On this album the AEC sets about to demonstrate the content of their slogan, performing an original composition, then works by Duke Ellington, Otis Redding, Bob Marley, Jimi Hendrix, and Fela Kuti.  Lester Bowie gets astonishing vocal-like sounds out of his trumpet on "These Arms of Mine" mimicking Redding's vocals on the original recording.  Malachi Favors manages a huge bass sound on the propulsive cover of "Zombie."  Great disk.  They must have had a ball making it.
