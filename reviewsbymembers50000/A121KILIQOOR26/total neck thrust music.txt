 these guys are the lynyrd skynyrd of highlife.  standout track:  "ihe eji aku eme" by dan satch opara -- 19 minutes of relentless guitar riffing behind urgent declamatory vocals.  an nigerian acquaintance says that the lyrics are a plea to stop the killing, achieve peace and brotherhood etc. etc. i'm down with it.
