 Although the subtitle of this collection is "1960s guitar band highlife," stylistically some of this music sounds older -- as the liner notes indicate some of these performers were already well-established in the 1940s, and one might think of this as a link between more traditional folk music and the popular music of today i.e. if one buys this disk expecting world beat one will be disappointed.  The standout cut is the title track King Oyina's "Menya Me Dofo" [I've Found My Love], a truly beautiful song -- someone ought to cover it.  The disk closer, The Royal Brothers "Ohia Woa Enwu" [Don't Commit Suicide Over Poverty], points the way toward the more electric, harder-edged styles that would follow.
