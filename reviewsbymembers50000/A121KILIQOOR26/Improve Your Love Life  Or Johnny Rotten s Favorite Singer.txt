 A true story:  One afternoon, many years ago, several acquaintances were discussing dating stratagems.  Each offered their nominee for best "make-out music."  Some of the nominations were a bit odd (The Modern Lovers' first album?  Right - if you're trying to land Psycho Girlfriend), when one certified 1977 punk offered up "Dancing on the Ceiling" by Jeri Southern. Huh?   "Uh, wasn't she some 1950s chick singer?" We all laughed Mr. Mohawk's suggestion...and then I spent the next 15 years looking for that bloomin' album.  Never did find it. Believe all the reviews that say this is a wonderful disk.  Southern was much more than "a chick singer" - she was an extraordinary musician as the small group selections on which she plays piano brilliantly attest.  Do not believe the reviews that say this music is easily available.  Southern's music goes in and out of catalog with distressing frequency, and of the disks that I have come across this one is miles away the best.  Get it while you can.  You won't be disappointed.   And, yes, it will improve your love life.
