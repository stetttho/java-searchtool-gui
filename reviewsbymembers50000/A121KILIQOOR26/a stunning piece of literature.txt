 The previous 17 reviewers have given this book 5 stars, and I really have nothing more to add that hasn't been said already, but please permit me this personal indulgence. I am a (white) American with a longstanding interest in Africa. I had always meant to read this book.  I even knew of Malan's record reviewing under the name Nelson Mandela.  While vacationing in Southern Africa a few years ago with my (black) African wife, I ran out of reading material so I picked up "My Traitor's Heart" while browsing in a bookstore in Cape Town. A couple days later after a day of sightseeing, we returned to our hotel room and I lay down on the bed and began reading the book.  It was an eery feeling to realize that, unknowingly, earlier that day we had visited the very farm where the transgressive act had taken place that sets the whole Malan family saga into motion.  The book became a kind of companion for the rest of our stay in South Africa. Much of the literature produced during the apartheid period now seems dated. This book does not.  People will still be reading it years from now.
