 Percussion, accordion, cheesy synths, and Khaled's wail: these are Khaled's rougher, funkier recordings from the 1980s before Don Was et al. smoothed them out for worldwide consumption.  A number of these tunes are his original recording which turn up again with the rough edges smoothed on later more broadly targeted disks"Serbi Serbi" and "Chaba Bent Bladi' [N'ssi N'ssi], "El Harba Wine" [Kenza], "Haya Ya" [Sahra].  If you have enjoyed Khaled's work over the past decade, check out its roots.
