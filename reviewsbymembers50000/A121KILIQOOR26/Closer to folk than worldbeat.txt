 This is an interesting disk by the Trevor Watts-led Moire Drum Orchestra, consisting of the English saxophonist, a Scottish bassist, and five Ghanians who double on various percussion instruments and traditional wooden flutes.  Most of the pieces are largely based on Ghanian folk melodies and on the folk-jazz continuum the playing is closer to "folk" than to "jazz."  In contrast, the original compositions by Watts sound more like traditional jazz.  An oddball rendition of "The Rocky Road to Dublin" rounds out the collection. The playing is first-rate and this is an enjoyable disk.  But be forewarned:  it is not  seize-you-by-the-throat worldbeat pop.  It is much more folk-based, in some ways resembling Nana Danso Abiam's attempt to create indigenous Ghanaian classical music with the Pan African Orchestra.
