 Martin Amis once said that Maggie Gee was the only female author of his generation that he would bother to read.  And while one might not endorse such sentiments wholeheartedly, in this dystopian novel with its themes of man's relation to nature and technology and relations between men and women it is clear that she has an unusual capacity for writing from the standpoint of her male protagonist-narrator.  The novel has both suspenseful and darkly humorous moments, and although it won't make anyone forget "1984," or even the more contemporary writing of Octavia Butler, it is certainly a good read.
