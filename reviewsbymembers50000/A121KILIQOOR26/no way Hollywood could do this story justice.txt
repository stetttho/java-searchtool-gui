 I have never been to Sierra Leone and cannot speak to the issue of whether Dooling's depiction of the Mende is accurate or not.  But I have lived and worked in both the US and West Africa (and dealt with Americans in West Africa) and the author is so dead-on in some of his characterizations that it is mind blowing.  The only thing he left out was the juju man in fill-in-the-blank West African capital city's main market listed in the travel guides who sells young European tourist amulets at 50 bucks a pop, though the Peace Corps amateur pornographer was a nice touch.  If Dooling had written the book today, he could thrown some Lariam-induced psychotic reactions into the mix. No, if Hollywood got a hold of this, the Africans would be simpletons, and the Americans noble, and the kids with automatic weapons would be cartoonish instead of truly frightening.  Besides, 17 year old Americans aren't interested in places they've never heard of. On the other hand, if they could get Terry Gilliam to direct, this could have potential...
