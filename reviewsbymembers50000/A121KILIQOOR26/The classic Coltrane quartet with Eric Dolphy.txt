 The classic Coltrane quartet (McCoy Tyner, Reggie Workman, and Elvin Jones) supplemented by Eric Dolphy on flute ("My Favorite Things"), alto ("Blue Trane," "Impressions"), and bass clarinet (a lovely "Naima").  Unless you are a Coltrane completist, get this and "Afro-Blue Impressions," skip the "Live in Europe" box, and save some dinero.
