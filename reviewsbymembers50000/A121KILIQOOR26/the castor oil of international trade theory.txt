 This volume synthesizes decades of research in international trade theory. It is comprehensive, and graduate students and working professionals will find it a handy summary of a huge corpus of research. Material is presented in verbal, graphical, and light algebraic form, and the key background references are given at the end of each chapter. These are a little sparse but this is a quibble. Be forewarned:  the book is densely written (Jagdish saves his spare words for his polemics), and generations of graduate students have told me that they hate it.  Big deal.  This is the castor oil of international trade theory -- open up and drink it down -- it's good for you.
