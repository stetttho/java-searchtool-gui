 I bought this CD after hearing the Ulali/Mahotella Queens track "Ma' Africa" on web radio. It is a truly astonishing track.  (Contrary to the Amazon.com editorial review, Ulali is not an African poet (that would be Moseo), but rather a trio of Native American women). Bridgeman and Catto are obviously accomplished musicians (and connected - getting all the guests on to their CD is an accomplishment in itself) but in the end what does all the talent signify?  My guess is that part of the favorable response is simply to the familiar voices (Baaba Maal, Michael Stipe) put in unusual, pleasant, and high production-value musical settings - which is to say that these tracks are easy to listen to, and the songs and lyrics inoffensive (some would find them inspirational), but apart from "Ma' Africa," not particularly inspired.  A bit of a souffl, tasty, but puffed up with hot air.  I like a good souffl now and again, but I would not want a steady diet of them, and it is hard for me to believe that five years from now this disk will be in heavy rotation.
