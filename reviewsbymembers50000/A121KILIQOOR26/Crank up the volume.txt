 Seize the Rainbow (1989), Highlife (1990), and Ask the Ages (1991), the last three studio recordings that guitarist Sonny Sharrock made before his untimely death in 1994 could be regarded as thesis, antithesis, and synthesis.  "Seize the Rainbow" is a guitarists record -- it is the most rock oriented, and indeed heavy metal listeners would feel right at home on the opening track,  "Dick Dogs."  This is a guitar record with a muscular rhythm section of Melvin Gibbs on electric bass and Abe Speller and/or Pheeroan Aklaff on drums. I can still remember Sharrock with a crazed look on his face moistening his guitar picks in his mouth.  Play this one loud -- its the way Sonny would have wanted it.  "Highlife" was recorded with Sharrock's touring band, and while never entirely checking his free jazz credentials at the door, the inclusion of keyboardist Dave Snider and an emphasis on song forms and the inclusion of recognizable tunes (the traditional "All My Trials" and British prog-rocker Kate Bush's "Cloudbusting"?!) makes this a more broadly accessible disk - i.e. the one your wife doesn't tell you to turn down. "Ask the Ages" reunites Sharrock with fellow Coltrane acolytes Pharoah Sanders and Elvin Jones, and with Charnett Moffett on acoustic bass, they make the unusual line-up electric guitar/sax/drums/acoustic bass work. The compositions are more developed than the guitar rave-ups of "Seize the Rainbow" but more harmonically open-ended than the more pop-oriented material of "Highlife."  The most firmly rooted in the jazz tradition of the three, "Ask the Ages" is a worthy synthesis and a sad though ultimately fitting close to Sharrock's career.
