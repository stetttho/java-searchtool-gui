 In this edition of Da Capo's "Best Music Writing" guest editor Nick Hornby has put the  emphasis on relatively established writers tackling music-related themes though not necessarily the music per se.  Two of the standout pieces from this mold are South African journalist Rian Malan (author of the incredible memoir "My Traitor's Heart") on the vicissitudes of the continuing legal wrangling over "Wimoweh" in which New York business sharks in essence defrauded its illiterate South African writer Solomon Lindo who died in poverty; and Nick Tosches funny piece on a group of now elderly wiseguys reminiscing on the underworld connections that made 1950s-1960s rock and roll.  Granta editor Bill Buford contributes a very revealing portrait of alt-country singer-songwriter Lucinda Williams.  Three unusual and enjoyable pieces are alt.country singer-songwriter Robbie Fulks' encounter with the IRS (think low-rent Willie Nelson), the fan letter of Jonathan Lethem (editor of the subsequent 2002 collection) to the Go-Betweens, and Jim DeRogatis' acrimonious interview with Third Eye Blind singer Stephan Jenkins in which he invites Jenkins to give as good as he gets.  A good compilation, would make a good gift for anyone interested in popular music.
