 Few bands can lay claim to the the sort of creative run that Roxy Music had in 1972-73:  in less than one year they released two extraordinary albums successfully integrating everything from vocal crooning to electronic experimentation into rock music.  By the end of that first year, experimentalist Brian Eno's departure put the band onto a trajectory toward a much more conventional sound (and greater commercial success).  These are the recordings of a young, aesthetically rambunctious, genre-busting band before they grew up and became pop stars.  (And good ones at that.)  This compilation includes the highlights from the first three albums plus two singles.  As another reviewer observed, there is no substitute for the first three albums in their entirety, but this is a great place to start. The tracks have been remastered, and those from the first eponymous album no longer sound like they were recorded in a shoe box filled with cotton.  There are a few recordings that I listen to and am continually astounded by how fresh and vital they sound, though they were recorded decades ago.  The tracks here are among them.
