 "Someone Loves You Honey" was a monster hit back in the early 1980s.  Cpoyright problems kept it from being released on CD until recently.  The version included on this disk does not include the toasting by Prince Mohammed on the original release.  The rest of the material on the disk is by and large similar to "Someone" -- 1960s/1970s country and pop tunes done reggae style -- though none of the other tracks match the wallop of the title track.
