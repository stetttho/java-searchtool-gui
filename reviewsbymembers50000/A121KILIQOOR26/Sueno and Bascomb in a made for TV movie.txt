 If "Jade Lady Burning" was a film noir, then this one is the made for TV movie.  While Limon's first novel was really quite cerebral and the action required only minimal suspension of disbelief, this one involves too many "perils of Pauline" scenes which detract from the plot's plausibility.  Nevertheless, it is a good read.
