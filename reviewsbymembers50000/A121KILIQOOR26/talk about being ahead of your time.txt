 If they had only been 10 years later they could have been the Spice Girls and think of all the money they could have made. Really.  This is great girl-pop.  C'mon you can't imagine the Spice Girls or Destiny's Child or any present day competitors doing anything as sly as "Robert DeNiro's Waiting"!  And besides, its got "I Heard A Rumour." If they had only been Americans (or at least had American producers) they would have had the greater rhythmic sophistication that it would of gotten them the whole five stars.  (Gotta give Destiny's Child that much.) Could have been a contender.
