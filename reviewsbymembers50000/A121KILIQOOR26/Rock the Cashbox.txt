 Cheaper than "The Clash On Broadway," nice introduction to "The Only Band that Matter(-ed)."  Some disparage the lack of chronology in track orderings, but it's really not a problem:  just invert the order of the disks.  Disk 2 which has the more punk sounding songs from the first three albums, while Disk 1 has the later "hits": "Train In Vain," "Rock the Casbah," et al. Actually, that shouldn't be taken too disparagingly:  by the later records the Clash had significantly broadened their sonic palettes beyond the harder/faster punk aesthetic, and Disk 1 provides a nice overview, without, for example, actually having to sit through "Sandinista!". Usual anthology quibbles about song selection (where's "Guns on the Roof"? or "I'm So Bored with the U.S.A."?), but the liner notes are amusing, especially the story about Roxy "they came, they saw, they split" Music. So where's volume 2?
