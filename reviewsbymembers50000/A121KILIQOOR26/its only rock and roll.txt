 but I like it. Although the story is undeniably about the culture of popular music, thankfully the author doesn't go for the usual VHS "Behind the Music" plot of sudden fame/ band breakup amid drug problems and ego conflicts/ then triumphant reunion "for the love of the music." Instead, the main protagonist is an A&R (artist and repertoire) man and the plot is grounded in the business side of show business. Without giving away the plot, the narrative arc of the story follows the transformation of the recording industry from its music-loving visionary founders to the corporate bean counters who dominate it today.  This is not The Great American Novel, but it is an enjoyable read, which as Lou Reed correctly notes on the cover, it is, at times, "laugh-out-loud" funny. Despite the wildness of some of the antics recounted in the story they have an undeniable ring of plausibility, suggesting to me, at least, that this indeed more of a roman a clef than some would allow. Good reading for the airplane or the beach.
