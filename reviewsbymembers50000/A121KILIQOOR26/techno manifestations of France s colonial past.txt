 This is a disk of house or techno music from 1995 based on "African and Arab music that has worked its way into French culture."  Two and three remixes of tracks by Algerians Khaled and Rachid Taha, respectively, and two from West African Mory Kante.  The remixes tend to simply preserve the vocals from the originals and replace the instrumental tracks with typical techno programming.  Less organic fusions than, say, the typical cut on a Six Degress collection.
