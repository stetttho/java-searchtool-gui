 This is an outstanding collection.  It gets docked 1 star because at four disks it is probably one disk too long -- some of the pre-ABB material and some of the later stuff on disk 4 could have been cut and it would have made for a tighter and more consistent set.  As it is, I often find myself listening from the latter part of disk 1 through the disk 3.  Given the title of the box, it would have been nice to include either the eventual studio version or a live version of "Dreams" in addition to the demo version included in this set. OK, so much for the minor gripes.  This is powerful stuff.  Duane Allman's spoken intro on "You Don't Love Me/Soul Serenade" in which he condemns King Curtis' murderer with "I hope what did it knows what he done" and then interpolates Curtis' "Soul Serenade" into "You Don't Love Me" is worth the price of the box alone.  The chronological organization of the collection makes his disappearance on disk 3 particularly poignant:  there is a hole in the music, and one gets a sense of the band starting the founder, despite its commercial success.  Even the late-period material (which in retrospect was more like the band's mid-life crisis given its subsequent revitalization) has its moments.  One can't help but empathize with Gregg Allman's weary vocals on "It Ain't Easy."
