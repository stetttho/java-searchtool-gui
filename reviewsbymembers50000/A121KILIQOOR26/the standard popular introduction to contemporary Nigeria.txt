 An accessible account of contemporary Nigeria.  Maier is a good storyteller (gets the hook of Gen. Sani Abacha overdosing on viagra into the first chapter) but the book is more than mere sensationalism.  It is good on the multitudinous conflicts in Ogoniland which culminated in the execution of playwright Ken Saro-Wiwa; and is quite good on the constitutional maneuverings that have led to the introduction of Islamic sharia law in several northern states.  Should be the standard popular introduction to contemporary Nigeria.
