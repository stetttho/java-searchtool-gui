 more from the djs at the late lamented mambo inn.  this time the tour starts in brazil across the ocean to west africa and then back across the ocean to the caribbean.  fewer remixes heavier emphasis on latin music than the first, so the lower rating my be interpreted purely as a matter of personal taste.  your mileage may vary. standout track:  baaba maal "hamady boiro" total rhythmic drive with macka b toasting a short history of senegal for those of us who are not fluent in woloff. if you can't dance to this you might want to check with your cardiologist because in all likelihood you are dead.  other standout track: wagadu gu's epic note-for-note better production values weighing in at 14 minutes plus version of prince nico's "sweet mother," complete with the two guitarists playing in different keys during one of the guitar breaks. "you can get another wife, but can you get another mother? nooooo!!!!"
