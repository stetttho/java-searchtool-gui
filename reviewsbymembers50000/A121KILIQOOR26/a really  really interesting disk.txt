 Ghana's Nana Danso Abiam has set about on an interesting cultural project:  create African "classical" music.  What is involved:  well, for starters, establishing standardized tunings for folk instruments, establishing a large ensemble (approximately 30 members),and then creating an orchestrated  repertoire, based largely on folk tunes, the last a standard strategy of Western composers (Dvorak's "Slavonic Dances" et al.). The result:  striking music that lies somewhere between traditional Ghanaian folk music and Western classical music.  Do not be mislead:  this is not "worldbeat" and this music will undoubtedly not appeal to everyone. Taken on its own terms, though, it is quite appealing.
