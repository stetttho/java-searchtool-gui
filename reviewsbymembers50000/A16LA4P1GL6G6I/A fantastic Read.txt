 A fantastic read that is well researched and insightful. I remember the smell of Greely, CO when I would drive up there. I would hit you 7 miles from the town! Anyhoo, I digress. Go out and buy this book from a local bookstore (sorry Amazon, you can't have all of the business) and sit down a read it with your next Big Mac.  Also, check out Troy McClure's visit to a slaughterhouse with little Timmy on the Simpsons. Truly a TV moment to remember! All this talk has made me hungry.
