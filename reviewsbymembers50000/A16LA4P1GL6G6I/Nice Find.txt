 I found this book sitting tattered on a bookshelf while staying at a bed and breakfast in Tennessee. I could not put this book down and would recommend it to anyone who feels alone when issues come up regarding work and how it affects their lives. Although written in the early 70's, this book speaks of many issues that confront workers today.
