 I hope to God this DVD release will be a better quality than the video set release. The VHS set was one (if not the worst)collection sets I have ever seen. The quality was horrendous and my hope is they put some effort into the DVD. My tapes of the show I recorded myself were better than the released VHS! With that said, if the quality is there buy this DVD set. Twin Peaks is the greatest story ever told on television.
