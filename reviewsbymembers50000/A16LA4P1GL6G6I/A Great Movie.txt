 Clockers is a shocking, crime film with fantastic performances. I won't go into the plot because you can read about that below. I will say that the performances are nothing short of brilliant. The brutality is honest and true and the depiction of the neighborhood balanced. Yes folks it is true, not everyone who lives in a supposed ghetto deal drugs or commit crimes and I appreciate Spike Lee for showing that. The performances are brilliant especially Kietel. I am a fan of Harvey Kietel and I love his character in this film. Filmed as a typical racist(maybe just ignorant) cop and in the end coming to a realisation that he played a part in the violence.  I too believe this to be Spike Lee's best film(I can't believe I just said that). Yes, even better than Do The Right Thing in my opinion. Check this film out, you won't be sorry. BTW, the soundtrack isn't too bad either. A great songs by Seal and Desiree stand out.
