 Is this the greatest movie ever?    This film is nothing short of pure brilliance. How can you argue the storyboard, camera positioning and most important, the performances. I have seen this movie at least 100 times and have yet to tire from it. Orson Welles was a genius and not only that, had the balls to take on Hearst in a passive aggressive fest that could do nothing but provoke anger from the publishing magnet. Visualy stunning and intense, this movie should be in every dvd library.  Is this the greatest movie ever? Well, Seven Samurai comes close but Yes, this IS the great movie ever.
