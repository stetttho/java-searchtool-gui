 ...  Now regarding the book....If you are a white person who wants to feel that they have learned something about Native oppression and want to get all angry at the mistreatment of Natives, then this is the book for you. If you are looking for an intellectual stab that falls along the lines of bell hooks, Cornell West then I suggest you read something else. Ward's facts about Native portrayals in mascots, movies and general exploitation are dead on, but his commentary regarding those facts is hard to stomach. His recycled prose is tiresome. He comes off as a whiner and of course defensive. When you read one of his books, you have read them all.
