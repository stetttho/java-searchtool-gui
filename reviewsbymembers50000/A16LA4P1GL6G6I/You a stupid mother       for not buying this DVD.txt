 The Dave Chappelle Show is a savior for tv. I have never seen a show express the outrages of racism, classism, every ism, and then slap it around to show the ignorance of what we make or do with it. The best thing about the skits, we laugh hard. His points are well made, sometimes subtle and sometimes just uncomfortable which may because we find ourselves laughing at the offensive. I believe the skit on the Black Klansman could have been the most offensive moment in television history. I was extremely uncomfortable but also laughed so hard it hurt. The next few days I thought about the skit and what it meant to me. Again that is the genious of the show, it will check you if you let it. Dave's show makes me think about the absurdities of people from across all color lines. This show makes you think. Season Two: So far the best skit  "When Not To Keep It Real"
