 I picked this book up in Germany before I headed over to France and to my surprise it was actually fairly useful.  The dictionary in the back wasn't very thorough.  I ran across many words in day to day activities that  weren't in the book.  However the book is well organized by subject  category.  For any given instance this book had several phrases to use.  It  certainly came in handy where a straight dictionary would have not.
