 For someone who is new to A/V and Home Theater and wants to ramp up the initial learning curve quickly this book will come in very handy.  He  explains all the various standards and formats, general tips on choosing  what to buy, and finally how to setup your system once you have everything.   At the back of the book Harley provides a fairly comprehensive glossary  and scattered throughout are warnings for what to watch out for when  looking at various specifications.  However if you are looking for really  in-depth information this book is not the place to look and I'm not even  sure such a book exists.  If you plan on replacing that old stereo setup  with the reel-to-reel tape and quadraphonic sound then I highly recommend  reading this book to get you going down the right path.
