 This Italian and English language book covers the history of the infamous Mugello track now owned by Ferrari SpA.  It includes a number of historical photos from the early days of the track and more recent photos from Ferrari Club Italia's Mugello meet.   For some this may be an interesting book, particularly if you are curious about the track's history.  It includes a large number of unique photos detailing the track's construction, some interesting bits on the history of racing in the area before the track was created, and the describes the issues involved in the design of the track.   Unfortunately, I noticed several errors in the identification of different Ferrari models and therefore I'm not sure that the historical information about the track can be completely trusted.  If you are interested in the track's history or are filling in a complete historical Ferrari library I'd recommend purchasing this book, otherwise leave it for another time...
