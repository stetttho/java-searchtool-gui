 Destined to become one of the greatest artists of the 21st century Alexandra Nechita amazed the world at an early age with her unique mix of a several modern artistic styles.  Like many of the great abstract works by  Picasso, Chagall, Klee, Matisse, and Miro her work captivates the story of  life through the use of vibrant colors and the unique shapes.  Even in just  the last year you can trace the process of refinement and experimentation  that has occurred in Nechita's work.  "Outside the Lines"  chronicles a large number of her paintings from 1995 through the use of  photos and accompanying description, in her own words, of what Nechita was  trying to accomplish with the work.   Although my personal tastes align  more with the types of work she has been producing in the last several  years this book should be on any Nechita or cubist art fans bookshelf.   Unfortunately there are currently no mass-published books that cover her  more recent works.  The only other book available is the one that  purchasers of the lithograph pairs of the recent "My Journey" portfolios  receive.
