 Bruce Anderson, author of several Porsche books, has created a book that any Porsche enthusiast who aspires to learn the technical wizardry behind  these machines shouldn't be without.  The book, now in its second edition,  covers all 911 models through 1996 and includes detailed photos, charts,  and diagrams that will allow you to determine how effective that engine  rebuild, exhaust modification, brake upgrade, suspension change, or chip  switch will be.  And for those who are not yet owners a chapter on buying a  used 911 covers what parts of the car warrant a detailed inspection,  descriptions of where the car wears quickly, and details on the known  problems for various models.
