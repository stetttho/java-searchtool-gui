 This is one of the best historical works about motor sports published during the last twenty years. With over fifteen years of research put into this work Michael Shoen has created something we will long refer to as a classic. In an era where automotive racing was almost completely dominated by European sports cars Carroll Shelby managed to not only build a competitive sports car but also upset the seemingly invincible position held by Ferrari.  The Cobra-Ferrari Wars 1963-1965 accounts, on a race by race basis, the amazing story of the Cobra's climb to the top during those glorious three years. Not only is this book extremely well written and thorough but the accompanying photographs and diagrams bring this infamous battle to life.  Few other motor sports books have been able to accomplish this.  I wouldn't recommend this book to the average Cobra or Ferrari enthusiast, however for the serious die-hard this is definitely a must have!
