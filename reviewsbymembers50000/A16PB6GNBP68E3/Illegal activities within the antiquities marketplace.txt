 Long-time art world journalist Peter Watson takes us undercover to follow the trail of illegal excavation, theft, smuggling and trade of unprovenanced antiquities that eventually find their way into the catalogs of the world renowned Sotheby's auction house.  This well-documented investigation begins with an undercover effort to illegally export an old master painting by Nogari out of Italy for an upcoming London auction held by Sotheby's to the theft of religious antiquities from a remote village in northern India.  With the help of documents kept by an ex-Sotheby's employee and several undercover investigations Peter uncovers the auction house's blatant disregard for the laws protecting antiquities from the appraisers all the way to the top chain of command. This book makes interesting reading for anyone who enjoys reading about real-life international intrigue, smuggling, and unscrupulous business practices.
