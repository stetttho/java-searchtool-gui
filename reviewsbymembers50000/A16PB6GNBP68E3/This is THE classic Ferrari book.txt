 This book contains the entire history of Ferrari up until the mid-70s.  If you are a Ferrari enthusiast of the older cars this is a required book on your shelf.  The book contains hundreds of black and white photos as well as several color fold-outs.  ISBN 0878800190 is the third revised and enlarged edition of the original Ferrari classic.  Note that there is a fourth revised edition.  If you are a collector I highly suggest getting a 1st edition and a 4th edition for the comprehensive extra information.
