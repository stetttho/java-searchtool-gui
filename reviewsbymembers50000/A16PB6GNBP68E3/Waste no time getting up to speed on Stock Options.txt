 One of the few books available today on incentive (ISO) and non-qualified (NQ) stock options this does an excellent job of describing the basic ins and outs of how each type of employee stock option works.  Unlike "Stock Options" by Robert Pastore, which is quite dry, this introductory book presents the material concisely and in a well-organized manner to quickly get up to speed.  Of course a significant amount of the material found in this book can be read for free on the publisher's website.  I would also highly recommend purchasing Pastore's book since it provides more strategies that you can actually apply, but read "Considering Your Options" first and then just flip through Pastore's book this to look at the strategies. Just keep in mind that both of these books are only a first step at figuring out what you plan on doing.  There is no substitute for a good tax account who is knowledgeable in the areas of stock options and estate planning.  In addition there are many strategies that exist which aren't covered in either of these books.  If you are trying to sort out what your strategy is for exercising your stock options it is well worth your time to read both of these.  And you can't beat the price.  If nothing else it saves you from shelling out $175/hour to hear an experienced tax accountant educate you on the basics.
