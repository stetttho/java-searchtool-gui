 A classic book by the well-regarded late Ferrari author Dean Batchelor.  Although titled as a "buyer's guide" this is a great reference book on higher production models.  Each model is covered with a general overview, several photos showing the different varieties, detailed specifications, chassis number ranges, and an investment rating based on Dean's five star system.
