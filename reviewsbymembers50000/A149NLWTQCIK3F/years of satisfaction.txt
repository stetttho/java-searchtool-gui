 I find the wild vacillation in customer satisfaction rather puzzling.  Although I initially experienced some of the problems described by other reviewers, all were resolved by appropriate grind adjustment.  I have been using the machine twice a day for the past nine (9) years with satisfaction.  No, that is not a typo folks...9 years!  Since the pump is now showing signs of imminent demise, I am contemplating purchasing a new machine.  Hopefully, I will not experience some of the major disappointments expressed by so many reviewers.  In any case, I will report subsequent experiences.
