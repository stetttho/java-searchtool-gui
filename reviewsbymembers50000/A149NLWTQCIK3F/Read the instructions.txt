 This quality and highly efficient thermos works perfectly if you simply follow the enclosed written instructions.  It is plainly stated that no part should be placed in the dishwasher.  Also, if you make sure that the caps are properly aligned the thermos is absolutely leak-proof.  This rugged, smartly designed thermos packs easily, insulates well, and avoids sloppy spills by utilizing a deeply recessed sip cap.  I am completly satisfied with my purchase and expect it will give me many years of service.
