 One of the most memorable and magical nights I ever experienced was spent seeing and hearing Rahsaan Roland Kirk at the old Colony Club on Alvarado Street in Monterey, California around 1967-69.  At one point he handed out little wooden flutes to the audience and we all played along to "Here Comes the Whistle Man."  Although I wish I could re-visit that particular wonderful night, this performance at the 1972 Montreux Jazz Festival comes as close to capturing the music, spirit, and essence of Rahsaan as one can get without having been there.  If you were fortunate enough to have seen Roland Kirk live, perhaps you may feel, as I do, that all the instruments he played were merely accoutrements.  Rahsaan himself was the instrument.  If you can find a copy of the video version of this performance entitled "The One Man Twins," grab it. You will be totally amazed by what you see and hear.
