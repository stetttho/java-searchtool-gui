 It's a good thing that Collins and McDuffie "changed every name to protect the innocent and the guilty" or everyone who reads their book might sue them.  You will no doubt recognize yourself, as I recognized myself, in the pages of BlindSpots because most of us are either far-sighted or myopic.  Either we can't see it coming, or we've already tripped over it.  The authors offer wise counsel on how to remove the scales from our eyes and, more importantly, from our consciousness.  Visual acuity improves dramatically as we put these sound principles into practice.  Illustrated by real life stories, insights unfold effortlessly on every page.  Where others have laboriously explored similar territory, the authors take us on a journey laced with good humor and a light touch.  Using the time-honored evaluation process of diagnosis, etiology, prognosis, and prescription, the "SpotDoctors Rx" is easy to swallow and very effective relative to positive outcomes for your personal, professional, and interpersonal goals.  Highly recommended.
