 I had the good fortune to attend a number of Alan Watts' live talks in the Monterey-Big Sur area during the sixties.  Some 35 years later his body of work continues to stimulate my growth and understanding.  While Watts never proclaimed any one person as his teacher or guru, the 17th century Zen master Bankei (1622-1693) appears to have been a major influence.    As early as 1950 Watts specifically identifies Bankei as a resource in an article he wrote for the journal of the Buddhist Lodge in England.  He quotes Bankei even more profusely in his 1957 opus The Way of Zen.   Finally, in his autobiography In My Own Way, published a year before his death in 1973, Watts reveals having spent many hours studying Bankei and elevates him to a representative of "Zen at its best."  He said that he referred people to Bankei's observations whenever they accused him of misinterpreting Zen. I am delighted to find that the teachings of this Zen iconoclast par excellence are available once again in the revised edition of The Unborn: The Life and Teachings of Zen Master Bankei, translated by Norman Waddell.  Highly recommended with one caveat:  if your feet are firmly planted in orthodoxy, anticipate the appearance of major cracks in your foundation.   A retrofit will not necessarily be an option.
