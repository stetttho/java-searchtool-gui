 The previous reviewer was apparently laboring under the false  assumption that this was a Freddie Hubbard session. Although the CD is packaged in way that could easily mislead, it is actually a loving and competently produced tribute to Freddie and his music by a group of his peers that came together for this one-off session under the collective title The Essence All-Stars.  Led by drummer and executive producer Lenny White, the group included such luminaries as Cedar Walton on piano and Ron Carter on bass. Hubbard's traditional trumpet role was performed by Marcus Belgrave, Eddie Henderson, and Wallace Roney.  Saxophonist Javon Jackson completed the ensemble.  The fact that there are no real surprises here is more than compensated for by the straight ahead playing, chemistry, and obvious love and respect for Hubbard's music.  Marcus Belgrave's sensitive interpretations of Little Sunflower and Pensativa are as enjoyable as Freddie's original recordings and add a new dimension to these Hubbard signature pieces.  It is an album of great subtlety that tends to become more appreciated with repeated listening.
