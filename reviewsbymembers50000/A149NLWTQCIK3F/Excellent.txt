 While much of the same can be said about this timeless trio's previous outings, the set is not only perfectly balanced in the choice of material but Jarrett's sometimes overly-audible vocalizing is absent as well.  Although, those who complain the loudest about Keith's tendencies in that direction remind me of those tightly wired types who drive their spouses or partners crazy by screaming hysterically in the middle of the night, "I hear a faucet dripping!"  They seem to intentionally listen for the slightest suggestion of Jarrett's vocal exuberance.  Perhaps the sound of cactus growing in the middle of the Mojave Desert would drive them to distraction.  For me, it's all about the music and I enjoy listening for the Bud Powell flavored phrasing I hear on some of the tunes rather than wasting time obsessing over minor vocalisms. The selections range from songs penned by Cole Porter and Jimmy McHugh to Gerry Mulligan and one Jarrett original.  The concert closes with the Tommy Edwards `50s pop hit "It's All In The Game."  Trivia: the lyrics, "Many a tear has to fall...," were written by Charles Dawes, U.S. Vice-President under President Calvin Coolidge (1925-29).  While Keith performs the ballad without excessive sentimentality, it still may strike some deep chords of remembered romances in some listeners.   Jarrett leaves ample room for Peacock and DeJohnette to shine, and the group plays energetically and elegantly throughout without ever degenerating into stereotypic "smooth jazz."  This is one of those rare performances that is strong enough to warrant your complete attention in the foreground or can be  equally enjoyable at low volume in the background.  Highly recommended.
