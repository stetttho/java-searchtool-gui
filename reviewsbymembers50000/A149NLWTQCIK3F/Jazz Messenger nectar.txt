 The essence of New York hard bop by the group that brought the genre to it's pinnacle.  The band sounds relaxed and at home in the club that Art Blakey dubbed his favorite venue.   Brief introductory comments by Blakey and Birdland's diminutive M.C. Peewee Marquette's raspy glass-shattering voice contribute to the high-energy atmosphere that often reigned at jazzdom's most famous Mecca.  Soaring solos and tight ensemble playing mark this 1963 Messenger live performance.  The well-disciplined edition of the group obviously enjoyed their free-spirited romp playing energized up-tempo numbers as well as two elegantly executed ballads.  An essential all-star group at the height of their power, sounding as fresh today as they did on the night of June l6, 1963.
