 I share the enthusiasm of the previous reviewers for this definitive biography of the man who introduced Rhythm and Blues  to a young white audience as Rock 'N Roll.  As a teenager, I remember standing in long lines outside the Brooklyn and Times Square Paramount theaters waiting for those electrifying 12 to 15 act shows to begin.  Little did I realize that the musical foundation for my kids and grandkids was being constructed on those stages between 1954 and 1959.  It is not hyperbole to say that Alan Freed and the music he supported made a major impact on many social and cultural levels world wide.  John A. Jackson approaches his subject with both passion and compassion for a man who's life ended prematurely and tragically at age 43.  He neither sensationalizes nor glamorizes the dark side of the music business in the process. His fascinating behind-the-scenes account of this champion of American music is well deserving of the Rolling Stone/BMI Ralph J. Gleason Award for Rock & Roll Journalism it received.  Highly recommended.
