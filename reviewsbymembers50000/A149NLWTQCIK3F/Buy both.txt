 As of this date, there are only two comprehensive English translations of this essential teaching on the nature of Zen:  Norman Waddell's The Unborn: The Life and Teachings of Zen Master Bankei and Peter Haskel's Bankei Zen. Much of what I offered in my posted review of Waddell's translation would equally apply to the Haskel text reviewed here.  Subjectively, I feel that the Waddel version is a slightly more fluid read.  Bankei Zen, however, offers the additional benefits of selected letters and poems including Bankei's famous "Song of the Original Mind."  Photographs of his calligraphy, paintings, and intricately carved statues further enhance the text. Both volumes were originally published in 1984, and there is inevitable overlap between the two texts.  Nevertheless, they are complementary and each has its own merit.  I have personally benefited from reading both.
