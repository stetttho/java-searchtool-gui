 This is authentic Tibetan tantric chanting and instrumentation recorded on location at the Khampagar Monastery almost 30 years ago.  It is an integral part of the sadhana and invocation of Padmasambhava and the fierce dharma protector Mahakala.  It is a deeply moving meditation for those who have been initiated into this easily misunderstood tradition.  This recording was never intended as enhancement for the "New Age" feelgood expectations implied by one reviewer.
