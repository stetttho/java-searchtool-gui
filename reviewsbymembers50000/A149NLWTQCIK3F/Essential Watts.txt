 This latest Alan Watts compilation, "Zen: The Supreme Experience," contains previously unpublished manuscripts of his most lucid talks.  The text is lavishly enhanced by photographs on high quality glossy stock. This volume may serve as either a great introduction or appropriate summary of his work for many generations of readers.  Highly recommended.
