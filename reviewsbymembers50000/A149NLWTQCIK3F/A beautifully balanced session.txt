 Musically and technically, this is a beautifully balanced session in every way.  On the initial listening, it can be a bit disconcerting to hear Monk soloing on the first track through the right channel only. When the other players come in on both channels, however, it becomes obvious that the instruments have been appropriately separated for a very "live" effect.  The program material is also very balanced, providing three originals and three standards.  The format ranges from Monk's solo interpretations of two ballads to the full quartet treatment on the medium up-tempo tunes, and the best-of-both-worlds long piano intro and finish on "Lulu's Back in Town."  This is a truly outstanding interpretation of a tune Monk performed frequently.  Everyone plays with focused, elegant confidence throughout.  This CD could serve as a starting point for exploring Monk's music.  If you're already a fan, it might be a very worthwhile addition to your collection.
