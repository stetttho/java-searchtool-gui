 Forget the niggling, critical reviews.  If it's a literary masterpiece you're looking for, read Shakespeare.  Rahsaan Roland Kirk fans, however, will be grateful to John Kruth for his hard work and dedication in gathering insightful glimpses into the life of this enigmatic genius through the narratives of those who knew him best.  Charges that Kruth has written a hagiography or "puff piece" are unfounded.  Although he is obviously an unbridled Kirk enthusiast, he does not hide the fact that Rahsaan had an overly defensive, contentious, and often abrasive side.  Yes, we want to know more about personal relationships, e.g., with his son Rory and first wife Edith.  True enough, there are elements of redundancy to be found within the 400+ pages.  But then again, breathing is redundant yet essential to us jazz fans...and others.  Read Bright Moments while listening to your favorite Roland Kirk CDs and it will all come to life.
