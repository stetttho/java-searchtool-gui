  Receiving my first copy of The Way of Zen in 1959 set me on the path of exploring both the literature and the practices of Eastern traditions for the next 47 years.  My original copy became so well-worn that I recently had to relegate it to archive status and purchase a new working copy.  All these years later, this title still remains for me the classic work for Western understanding of Buddhism.   I am amazed at the proliferation of books on the subject to be currently found on Amazon.com.  Separating the wheat from the chaff can be a daunting challenge.  Many interpretations of the Dharma, especially by Western authors, often seem to be tainted by naive New Age idealism on the one hand, or dry pedantry on the other.  Although Watts was academically disciplined, reading the text with appropriate reflection can be simultaneously an intellectual and experiential endeavor (although not in the "how-to" sense).  Watts wisely points out, with ample historical support from past Zen masters, that while so-called techniques for enlightenment may serve as transitional supports along the path, they ultimately lead to dead ends.   The Way of Zen, despite some rather petty criticisms by pedants and literalists over the years, has survived as one of the most lucid expositions of Zen specifically and Buddhism in general.  Highly recommended...still.
