 So here I am, reviewing an Animal Collective record whose clear intention is to lure me in. I suppose the accepted convention among my peers is to simply refer to changes like these as making the product the band's "most accessible to date." It is, don't get me wrong. It just feels weird. And goddammit, it's luring me.  Fans of the traditional Animal Collective theory of composition and instrumentation ("Hey, let's add more moans and flanges!") need not worry, though. The middle of the album builds on prior sounds. By and large, however, this is a catchy album, boasting hummable melodies and even songs that GO somewhere.  So what's happened to Animal Collective to make them so (relatively) well-behaved? Whatever it was, Animal Collective have produced this record under the shadow of Sung Tongs. It's certainly at its most widely listenable in the first few tracks, but the entire album bears the sheen of a band who know what they're trying to do. For better or worse, they did it.
