 On hearing the Lovetones for the first time, you'd be forgiven for wondering whether the Australian indie-psych outfit is for real. After all, this is a band who name their paisley-tinted second album Meditations; who write songs like "Was I There in Your Future?" and then decorate them with trippy analogue synth atmospherics; who aren't afraid to drop the occasional prominent sitar line into a bubblegum tune about a girl with "stars inside her hair." These guys aren't just your garden-variety walking anachronisms, in other words. They've listened to the flower people and listened well, and the worst thing about their latest album is that it occasionally threatens to sink into outright parody. But when Meditations isn't bogged down by meandering drone-rock jams, self-consciously "retro" conceits and the kind of lyrics that started to sound dated around the time the Summer of Love's leaves turned brown, it's actually quite a good LP...erm, CD.  But something happens in the record's second act, something that makes the rest of the album feel just a little hollow by comparison. Quite simply, the Lovetones drop their facade. They show us something of themselves from beneath the rosy haze of Gen-X imagined '60s nostalgia. And honest to god, they're a better band for it. Songs like "Across the Sea," "A Place for Us" and "Wrapped Up in You" give a sense of the Lovetones that could have been, the Lovetones that indeed could be: melodic, pop-savvy, contemplative, even a little bit druggy; everything that makes the band as it is worth listening to. But with an individual flavor that plucks them out of the tribute-band circuit and into the world of relevance. One can't help but wish that next time, they'll take a cue from these tracks, bring the tunes and leave the patchouli back at the pad. The Lovetones have spent five years living in the past...now it's time to step into the future. I, for one, plan on welcoming them with open arms.
