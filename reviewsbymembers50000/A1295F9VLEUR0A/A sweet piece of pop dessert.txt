 I have a fascination with sad music. For me, it's the equivalent to a friend you can trust above all others. They understand, and that's what's important. They don't try to sugarcoat life and make it nice and folded and tinsel silver, they understand the grey and the golden days. Rogue Wave's latest, Descended Like Vultures, is one of those albums.  Within the stutters, whispers, noises, and sweet melodies of Zach Rogue's voice, a shocking intimacy forms between him and the listener. It's hard to conceive after this song who would not agree with Rogue and his whispering asides and playful noises. And if he doesn't sell you, then listen again to the shimmering vibraphone, the ethereal background vocals, the tinkerbell click of tambourine and layers of guitar. Who can say no to something so golden pretty?  The best part of this album, though, is the fact that it is so soothing, but never to the drowsy proportions of southern comfort or warm milk and honey. Even the songs that I began mildly disliking, such as "California," forced themselves into appreciation after frequent listens. Yes, there are hints of the political on this album, but I've already read far too many reviews which ignore this lovely album for its artistic value and instead evaluate it merely for the messages lurking within. When you listen to this record, instead of quickly picking it apart like vultures (so to speak), please take the time to digest a sweet piece of pop dessert.
