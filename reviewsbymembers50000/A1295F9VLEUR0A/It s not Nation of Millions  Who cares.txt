 When are we going to stop demanding another Nation of Millions from Public Enemy? After all, it's more than evident that Chuck and company could care less about recapturing their "golden era"; if Odor is stuck in any time period, it isn't the late '80s or even the early '90s, but 1994, the year PE released their hugely misunderstood Muse Sick-N-Our Mess Age. From the punning title and hand-drawn cover art to the Bomb Squad-free, live-instrumentation arrangements, Odor is a sister album of sorts to Muse Sick - and a worthy follow-up at that. But just like that earlier album, it's unlikely that anyone will be listening until years down the line. Put simply, this was - and remains - a different group altogether from the one who recorded "Fight the Power," "Bring the Noise" and "Rebel Without a Pause." The sound is mellower, atmospheric, almost minimalist; nothing like the dense Shocklee-helmed sonic barrage which peaked on 1990's Fear of a Black Planet.But excitement? Is any Public Enemy track NOT exciting?  The fact is, New Whirl Odor's highs far outnumber its lows...and even the lows speak to this group's continuing vitality, their willingness to take risks. Closing track "Superman is Black in the Building" stands as a testament to this: nearly twelve minutes long and not a second wasted, it's at once an epic recap of everything that continues to make Public Enemy great, and a bold excursion into new heights of jazz-flavored funk and soul. It's the kind of thing that makes you think twice about writing off these hip-hop elder statesmen, even if their "glory days" have long past. Because whether you like it or not, Public Enemy doesn't need to make another Nation of Millions. They just made their first New Whirl Odor, and that's plenty good enough.
