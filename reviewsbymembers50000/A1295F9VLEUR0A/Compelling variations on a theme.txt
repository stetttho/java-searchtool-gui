 Thee More Shallows dip into slippery electronics, self-aware strings, and 2005's near-mandatory clean rhythm guitar parts to assemble More Deep Cuts' twelve tracks. They leave a jagged enough edge, though, to avoid the "destined for The O.C." tag, while still producing sounds light and accessible enough to make a few listens worthwhile. In short, Thee More Shallows' latest effort puts the band in a fine position to be the thinking man's Death Cab for Cutie.   This atmospheric pop band's atmosphere is set from the first track. By the end, however, it begins to stifle. I didn't hear anything in "Walk of Shame" or "Ask Me About Jon Sross" that I hadn't heard in earlier slow tracks, or, truthfully, really needed to hear repeated. In this reviewer's mind, that is a stumbling block for many bands whose preferred style stresses a unified recounting of musical ideas - one must be careful not to repeat oneself. It's rendered many a post-rock album unlistenable if not entirely superfluous, and Thee More Shallows prove their uncommon quality by having simply recorded a few too many songs. With palette limitations entirely self-imposed, the band has nevertheless recorded a compelling set of variations on a theme.
