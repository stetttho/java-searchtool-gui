 Excerpted from modernpeapod.com:  Let's face it: Ryan Adams the Belligerent Drunk was such a high-profile character two years back, the record-buying public all but lost sight of Ryan Adams the Singer/Songwriter, hidden behind the ever-inflating head of his own personal Mr. Hyde. But  now, Adams drops the first in an alleged trilogy of 2005 releases - and it's an absolute stunner, a stone-cold one-two punch out of left field. First track "Magnolia Mountain" alone salvages Adams's reputation, with the Cardinals' providing the kind of grandly rugged, guitar-and-pedal-steel foundations Crazy Horse used to build for Neil Young circa Everybody Knows This is Nowhere. And Adams sounds like Young, too, in the best possible way: a kindred spirit rather than an imitation, he strikes the perfect balance between soul and vulnerability.  Of course, the rest of the record isn't as good. It couldn't be. And of course, Adams's lack of ability to self-edit is felt in spades - there are a few too many samey "weepers" on this double album to truly justify its length. At the same time, however, Cold Roses has far too many high points for anything but the mildest of reproaches. "Cherry Lane" is indie-country-pop perfection mixed with foul-mouthed, literate relationship confessional, delivering at last on the promise Bright Eyes made with I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning. The title track, meanwhile, is that rarest of beasts: a fist-pumping, lighter-swaying, bona fide classic rock jam that doesn't seem superfluous even for a second, electric guitar riffage giving way to lush beds of pedal steel and the whole ridiculous thing coming off absolutely note-perfect.  It's a success that's shared by the album as a whole: Adams, beyond all expectation, finally seems to be keeping his mouth shut and letting the music speak for itself. And it works. Brilliantly. Here's hoping album number two keeps up the good work.
