 Oh Guitar Wolf, for you and me it was love at first howl. And apparently, it was the same way for all of the bands collected on I Love Guitar Wolf... Very Much. Most of these brave artists break out the flame-thrower microphones, rev up the motorcycles, and chug their beers with pride. There are some issues, though. Puffy Amiyumi's cover of "Can-nana Fever" is just too cute. You can tell from their sugary-sweet chirps that these women would never be able to pull a sword out of their guitars. The song is fun, sure, but no one's going to break stuff to it. And also, with the exception of Total Dork's cover of "Shinkasen High Tension", the songs are just a little too quiet for my liking. Guitar Wolf are the supposed creators of the loudest album ever made, Jet Generation, and it's of my opinion that the listener should get more of an idea of that from this record.  Then again, I Love Guitar Wolf does exactly what a tribute album is supposed to do. No matter how much I found myself enjoying the covers, especially The Hellsquad's "Kawasaki ZII7 50 Rock 'N' Roll" and Lightning Bolt's "Planet of the Wolves", they only helped to to make my thirst for real jet rock and roll even stronger. And besides, Guitar Wolf as a whole have gone through a rough year. If anyone needs a tribute album at the moment, they do.
