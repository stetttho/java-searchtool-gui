 Remember when rock'n'roll was still evil? The Immortal Lee County Killers do. With their third full-length (and, incidentally, third line-up), the Nashville-via-Alabama rock demons have taken the Deep South voodoo punk blues of their first two records and added a liberal dose of post-Stooges bad-acid rock. The result? These Bones Will Rise to Love You Again is a churning, reverb-drenched beast of an album, with caveman lyrics about sex, death, God, and more sex. Is it evil? Hell yes. And like all the best rock'n'roll, it feels so much better than being good.  Pull pretty much any tune at random from this record and you'll get the idea: These Bones is thrillingly organic, one sweat-soaked howler bleeding into the next, with only the sinister opiate blues of "Stitched in Sin" and the love-as-salvation prayer "Lights Down Low" providing respite. There is a drawback to this approach: a handful of tracks have a tendency to blend together, the result of a shortage in hooks or a homogeneity in approach or both. But let's not forget, the Immortal Lee County Killers aren't here to make the album of the decade...they're here to kick your ass and leave you wanting more. And with just over half an hour of no-holds-barred electric mud, These Bones gets the job done. Evil has never sounded quite so good.
