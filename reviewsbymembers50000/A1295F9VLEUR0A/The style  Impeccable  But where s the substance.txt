 Excerpted from modernpeapod.com:  On You Could Have It So Much Better, Franz Ferdinand prove one thing: these guys can party. The much-awaited sophomore record opens with "The Fallen", a hedonistic plea to cut loose, with overtones of champagne and destruction that could easily chronicle any notable rock star's Saturday night. In fact, the whole album seems to explore Saturday night in all its aspects, ranging from the manic high of an alcohol-soaked hook up ("Do You Want To") to a snapshot of the solitary couple who spend their evenings at home watching black and white movies ("Fade Together"). But, just like most Saturday nights, a good deal of these songs begin to blend together. Franz Ferdinand seem to have figured out a recipe for dance numbers: add one slower tempo, speed up tempo, mix in one catchy phrase (often double-tracked), plug in guitar, clear throat. The recipe may work, but these songs are the equivalent of musical Twinkies: sure they taste good, but is there any substance?  Of course, substance is not the point of You Could Have It So Much Better. Franz Ferdinand are just trying to have a good time, and there's no reason to fault them for that. The whole problem lies in the aforementioned "Fade Together," as well as "Eleanor Put Your Boots On," a sweet afternoon love affair where two adults become children. If these two tracks hadn't been included on the album, the listener would never have the sense that there is a greater, more timeless depth to Franz Ferdinand (one which may or may not resemble a much more attractive Paul McCartney). "Fade Together" and "Eleanor" prove that there is a versatility to Franz Ferdinand that could make them just as historically memorable as their namesake if they choose to pursue it...for the time being, however, they just make the rest of the record look very shallow indeed.
