 [...]  Let's take a vote: who would have suspected that some of the most interesting songs in recent memory about slavery, voodoo and black oppression would come from a white woman from Alabama? Furthermore, how many of you would've suspected that her name would be Orenda? Me neither, guys. Me neither.  Invisible Ones is one of the most thought-provoking records of the year, both lyrically and instrumentally. Unlike a good deal of her Saddle Creek compatriates, Fink's music is a satisfying mixture of intellectualism and emotion. Her music ranges from the wry lounge feel of "Blind Asylum" to the southern gothic world of Flannery O' Connor with my personal favorite song, "Les Invisibles". Admittedly, there are some stylistic missteps; especially during "Miracle Worker," a kind of new age trance music, overlong to the point of actually putting the listener into a trance.  Also, lyrically speaking, I should be rolling my eyes at Fink for writing songs that have to do with the experiences of people who are primarily of African descent. Yet never at any time do I sense a hint of patronizing or exploitation; Fink truly seems to empathize with the persons of Haiti and share a delight in their culture. And through it all we are able to find her, the songwriter, amidst all of the glamorous scenery. Fink's voice is raw and matter of fact. The lyrics might not even be based upon a real event, but she does a damn good job of making it seem so.  In fact, throughout the course of Invisible Ones, Fink does a fabulous job of taking the listener on an ominous adventure. There are moments to catch your breath, but the songs where it feels as if Fink herself was swinging from rope to rope, dodging tigers, and carrying a machete in her teeth - such as "Animal" - are the moments that really make her so exciting. Orenda Fink may not have a trademark hat or a movie trilogy, but she knows how to leave a listener waiting for her next album.
