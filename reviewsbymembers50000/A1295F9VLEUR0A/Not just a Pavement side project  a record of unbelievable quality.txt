 Excerpted from (...) Tanglewood Numbers is a richly evocative album. David Berman's well-crafted lyrics enable the listener to take flights of imagination along with him, through the exasperated playfulness of "How Can I Love You" to the rich poetic imagery of album-closer "There is a Place." This is one of those few albums out there that could have all of its instruments stripped away from it, be converted to book form, and still be enjoyable.  But good writing isn't the only thing Tanglewood has to offer. There are the lush country overtones, tempered with tiny slices of indie rock oddity, the driving singing of Berman and the lovely background vocals of his wife Cassie. All of the songs have a lively quickness to them; even in the seven-minute long "The Farmer's Hotel", there is not a dull moment. The instruments all chase and tease one another, becoming more and more exciting as the songs progress. What results is a record of unbelievable quality.  Honestly, what's slightly less (or more) remarkable than the fine craftmanship is how easy it is to forget the indie notables who play on the record. It's only after "The Poor, the Fair, and the Good" comes around when it really becomes noticeable that Stephen Malkmus is playing guitar; as for Bonnie Prince Billy and Bob Nastanovich of Pavement, I'm sorry I didn't even notice you at all. Tanglewood Numbers is truly Berman's show. It's a large, wonderful push to get the Silver Jews out of the shadow of the "Pavement side project" (or even worse, the "Stephen Malkmus side project") and to receive the fame they deserve as simply the Silver Jews.
