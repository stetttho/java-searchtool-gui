 Excerpted from modernpeapod.com:  It's been six long years since we last heard from Fiona Apple. And yes, she's still angry - but it is an enthralling and perpetually shifting anger. Here in Michigan, there is a saying: "If you don't like the weather, wait five minutes." With Extraordinary Machine, if you changed the length of time to fifteen seconds, the saying still applies. Apple's voice is intensely compelling because it is a mirror to her mind; every stray thought affects the tone of her voice. In "Get Him Back", for example, Apple's voices starts at a sultry, pissed-off growl, rises to a conversational undercurrent, and even finds its way into wistfulness...all within four minutes and forty-one seconds. You can't help but sympathize with the pure raw emotion in her voice.  The problem with this record, then, is that Apple is such a force of nature that I resented the intrusion of so many instruments. Many of the arrangements are too glossy and, frankly, feel as if the producer assumes everyone who's listening to Machine has ADD. Lush with Broadway showtune tinsel, the background music would probably be emotional within the realm of the stage; but when a singer has a voice as powerful as Apple's, LET HER SHOW IT OFF. "Used to Love Him" is a key example of this: Apple's voice sounds as if she's a 1930's night club singer, but the carnivalesque music is just so damn distracting that I'm compelled to start a website begging for someone to "free Fiona" from the horrors of overproduced records.
