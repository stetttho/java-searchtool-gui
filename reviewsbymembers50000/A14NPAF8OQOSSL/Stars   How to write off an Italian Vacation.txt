 The Broker, while not terrible, is far from Grisham's best work.  What starts with an interesting premise (man on the run dropped in a totally new environment) devolves into an impromptu Italian language and geography lesson.  Too much time is spent describing the Italian culture and surroundings.  The (charitably-called) literary device of typing out an Italian phrase followed by its English translation becomes grating extremely quickly.  In this case, the plot suffers at the expense of the setting.  Characters are introduced, given elaborate back-stories, and then discarded (some without ever speaking).   Loose ends that are presumably meant to make us curious are disclosed at the end with no real timing or fanfare.  The ending just seems to happen: no building tension or real difficulty befalls the protagonist.  It turns from a whodunit to a whocares.  While a decent beach read, The Broker is not an example of what Grisham can do as much as what he can get away with.
