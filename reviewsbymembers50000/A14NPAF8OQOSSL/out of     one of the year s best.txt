 This was my first introduction to Masta Ace, and I came away impressed with his skill, and angry with myself for sleeping on him so long.  In a time when many artists strive to release a cd with 3 or 4 hot singles, Ace opted instead to tell a story.  Theme/concept albums when done well can be spectacular: that is the case here.  Set as a prequel to his last cd, Disposable Arts, Long Hot Summer is the story of two hustles colliding: Ace's musical grind and Fats Belvedere's criminal/strong-arm exploits.  The interludes are frequent but relevant and non-intrusive.  The songs however, are amazing.  It is difficult to pick a favorite.  Is it the clever Jean Grae-assisted Soda and Soap?  The smooth flow to Brooklyn Masala?  The Ninth-Wonder banger Good Ol' Love?  The rowdy Oh My God, featuring the Beatnuts and Rahzel?  With so many gems on the album it is difficult to name any of them high points: the whole album is a high point for me.  While my intro to Ace was his outro to the game (he has said he will release no more albums) I still have him to thank for making my long hot summer a great one.
