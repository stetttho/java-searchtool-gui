 I am uncomfortable labeling something "real hip hop."  Obviously hip hop is different things to different people.  That being said, I think that Like Water for Chocolate embodies the best of what I feel hip hop has to offer: consciousness, clever lyrics, experimentation and good beats.  The first single I heard from this CD was the Premier-produced 6th Sense.  "If I don't like it I don't like it, that don't mean that I'm hating" became my new mantra when discussing music that did not move me.  From the unconventional rhyme style on Funky For You to the tongue-in-cheek Film Called (Pimp) with MC Lyte to the back-and-forth with Mos Def on Question, Common provides a complete CD that remained in my changer for almost a year, and still gives a good listen.  Less experimental than the later Electric Circus and farther reaching than his earlier One Day It Will All Make Sense, Like Water for Chocolate should occupy a place in any hip-hop head's collection.
