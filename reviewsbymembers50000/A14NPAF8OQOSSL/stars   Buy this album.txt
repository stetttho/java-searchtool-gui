 The Legendary Roots Crew occupy a unique place in hip hop.  They are critically acclaimed, possess name recognition from the music-buying public and their live shows are the stuff of legends.  However despite their diverse catalog, devoted fanbase, and willingness to experiment, their talent has yet to translate into proportionate sales.  That is a shame, and it is the driving force behind The Tipping Point.  This is by far the Roots' most structured and accessible album to the "average" music demographic that has not latched onto them yet.  While this has led to grumbling from both the old-school fans of Do You Want More and the Phrenology fans of experimentation, TTP is a solid offering.  With only 10 songs (not counting bonus tracks), they set out to grab you and not let go.  Star is an excellent first song (and good current single) - the condemnation of the American cult of celebrity.  I Don't Care is a good follow up.  The irony of the hook is not lost on the discerning listener.  In fact, the album as a whole seems to take digs at the average music buyer, while attempting to cater to them at the same time.  More than anything else, this album should propel Black Thought into the upper echelon of MC's (many would argue that he has been there for a while).  His mimicry of Kane and G Rap on Boom are amazing.  Somebody's Gotta Do It is another high point: graced by the incredibly talented Jean Grae, while Devin the Dude lends his smooth voice to croon the hook.  While this is a good album, there are some parts that I could have done without.  Too much singing on the hooks, and a cheerfully calculated (while tongue-in-cheek) feel to the album keep it from being a 5-star classic to me.  However, it is still one of the 5 best hip-hop cd's to come out this year, and remains in constant rotation to me.  The sales so far have been disappointing, I believe the Roots' tipping point is still ahead of them.
