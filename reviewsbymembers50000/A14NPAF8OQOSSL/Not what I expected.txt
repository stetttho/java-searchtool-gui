 I am a huge fan of Timbaland and Magoo's body of work.  I felt that Indecent Proposal was an excellent cd that was virtually ignored by the public, and that Tim recently did great work on both Under Construction I and Deliverance.  With that in mind, I was eager to pick up Under Construction 2.  It is hard to describe the disappointment I felt after listening to this cd.  First of all, I will state the obvious: people do not buy Timbaland and Magoo music for the lyrics, they buy it for the beats.  These beats were pedestrian and spare.  Minimalist production has its place, but when the artist isn't a great rapper anyway, and is known for the beats, it is fair to expect better.  It seems that Tim is saving his best beats for other artists.  Annoying hooks ("that s#$t ain't gon' work") prevail throughout.  Even the usually dependable, if not spectacular, Magoo falters in this one.  It is almost as if he is matching his partner's lack of effort.  This avoids one-star status due to "Indian Flute," a catchy song, if derivative of "Indian Carpet" from their last album.  If you haven't bought this cd yet, get Timbaland and Magoo's earlier work instead: this one falls short both lyrically and production-wise.
