 This album is like candy for hip-hop lovers in a good way: sweet, unsubstantial, and satisfying.  Over infections, 80's pop tunes Killa Cam makes the most of each beat.  Hip-hop does not always need to address the wrongs in society - sometimes it is enough just to have fun.  Cam's off-the-cuff tales of womanizing and drug-selling are of course present, but they are secondary to his amazing alliterative wordplay.  On some songs it seems like he is determined to test the English language's boundaries, and go just beyond them.  This cd will not change your life, but it is a decent album to bump in the car.  Personal favorites are Killa Cam (with a chorus that will stay in your head for days), Hey Lady (infectious beat), and Girls.  Check this cd out if for you sometimes the music can be more important than the message.  DipSET!
