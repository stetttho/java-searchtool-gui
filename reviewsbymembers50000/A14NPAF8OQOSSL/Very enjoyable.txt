 I chanced upon this book when it given to me by my aunt.  I started it with no expectations, and was pleasantly surprised.  This book is extremely gripping.  Usually I can predict the way these books are going to: this story kept me guessing up until the end.  The narrative was smooth and interesting, the protagonist flawed and compelling, and the characters and situations were not clichd (with the exception of a scene between O'Loughlin and his father).  I am sure other reviewers have provided synopses, and I do not want to give away any of the numerous well-crafted plot twists.  I will instead heartily recommend this book, and suggest that you read it when you have a block of time set aside so you are not forced to put it down.
