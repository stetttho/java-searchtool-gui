 I think it is inarguable that Eminem is one of the most talented MC's currently putting out material.  That is what makes Encore so disappointing.  Lazy raps over monotonous, repetitive production ruin what could have been the album of 2004.  Some lowlights:  - Just Lose It: unless you live in a cave you have heard this single; a lazy mishmash of his other work where he stops and just babbles for a while.  "Stop, pajama time?"   - A$$ Like That: an entire song as Triumph the Insult Comic Dog.  Reread that sentence.  Goes over about as well as you would expect, which is terribly. - Puke: another ode to Kim.  What has been funny, disturbing, or at least interesting in the past has been transformed to an amalgamation of body noises. - My First Single: more body noises.  It seems that Em is determined to prove he could s___ on record and people will still buy it. The rest of the album is largely forgettable, but saves itself from one star status by having a couple of decent songs.  Never Enough with a wicked hook by Nate Dogg (and where 50 cent actually outshines Em) bumps, and Toy Soldiers is an interesting take on the recent Aftermath beefs with near everybody.  I think a line for that song sums up the album perfectly.  Em says that while the battle (with Ja) was won, he felt he lost it because he but so much effort into it.  He is right: that effort translated into excellent tracks.  This cd could have used some of that effort.  It would be easy to say what Eminem needs to do to make a better album (stop producing, TRY), but in reality the answer is nothing: this is going to go multi-platinum and the fans will refuse to hold him accountable for this hot mess.  One can only hope his artistic pride will have him work harder on his next endeavor.
