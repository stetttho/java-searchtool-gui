 After hearing/seeing J-Live as part of the Okayplayer Winter Break, I decided to pick up one of his EP's.  I was pleasantly suprised at both the quality of the production (all his work) and the precision with which he rhymes.  He is clever, the rhymes are tight, and the songs seem to flow together.  This is the first J-Live cd I have bought, and it will not be the last.  My personal favorites are Add-A-Cipher (where he uses a numeric formula based on the number 5), Car Trouble (excellent use of metaphor, comparing his rap career to a cabdriver's) and Walkman music (head-nodding beat with smooth flow).  Since this is an EP, it is modestly priced, a good gamble if you are looking for an alternative to the current hip hop trends of violence, drugs, and money.  Hope you enjoy it.
