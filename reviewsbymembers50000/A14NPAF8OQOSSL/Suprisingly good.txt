 I will start off this review saying that I am no fan of crunk.  I am one of those pretentious backpacker nerds who tend to look down on what other people like.  I listened to this cd with that perspective expecting not to like it - and was pleasantly suprised.  Trick sounds hungry on these tracks.  Great beats, and while Trick will never blow you away with his lyricism, he rides the beats extremely well.  The album has varied content - part southern thug bravado (f&*kin around), part hungry artist just trying to get by (I Wanna Sing), even a couple of love songs.   While Sugar sounds like a rehash of In Da Wind (beat almost identical, Cee-Lo singing the hook) it still bumps, due in no small part to a stellar guest spot from Ludacris.  Even a questionable Sabbath sample (Let's Go) works on this album.  Especially with the recent trend of disappointing hip-hop albums out there (*cough Encore cough*) Thug Matrimony is a breath of fresh air.  Will not change your life of anything, but it is fun and worth a listen.
