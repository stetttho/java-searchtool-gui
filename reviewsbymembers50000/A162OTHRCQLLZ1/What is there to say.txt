 These are insanely handy. I only wish they sold them in packs of more than 8. I bake a lot for fun, and wind up giving away a lot of cakes. With these, I no longer have to worry about keeping track of plates or trays. Plus they're very handy for making layered cakes.  If you like to bake and wind up giving away or selling cakes regularly, you need these.  EDIT: Huh. I just ordered two 8-packs, and I recieved two dozen. That's a pleasant suprise. I can't guarentee you'll get twelve packs as well, but hey, four free circles per pack. Not a bad deal.
