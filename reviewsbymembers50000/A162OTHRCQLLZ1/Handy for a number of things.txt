 You need a peel for any serious artisan breadmaking and definitely good pizza making. This is a good one. It's got a good weight to it, and it's easy to use. The wood is thicker than a metal peel, which makes it sturdier, but a little more difficult to move things into and out of the oven. But I feel that the added stability is worth it.  Get yourself a pizza stone, and get this, and life will be good.
