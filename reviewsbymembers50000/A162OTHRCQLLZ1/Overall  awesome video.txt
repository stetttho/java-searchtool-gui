 I only rated this at 4 stars for two reasons: First, it's not available on DVD. Seriously, it's not the 80s any more, upgrade the media. I had to dig out my old VHS player from the basement to watch this. Second, it would have been nice to have a little narration. Explanations of the trick, advice on performances, that kind of thing. But no, the guy is silent through pretty much the entire video.  That being said, this is still worth every penny. I've only watched it once through so far, and already I'm much improved, with a couple new tricks under my belt and a better understanding of the ones I already knew. And there's still a whole lot left in there for me to learn. Excelent video with a couple flaws. If you want to get good at the Devil Sticks, buy this now.
