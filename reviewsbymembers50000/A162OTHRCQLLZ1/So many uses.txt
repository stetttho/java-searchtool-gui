 This thing makes life so much easier for anyone doing serious baking.  First, obviously, it's great for baking on. No longer do you need to expose your baked goods to unnecessary grease, butter or other chemicals to prevent them from sticking to sheet pans.  Also, for me, rolling doughs was always something of a challenge, because my counters did not have enough texture for flour to cling to, so I couldn't coat them with it, so my dough always stuck and clung while rolling, and I wound up repairing a lot of torn dough. No more, though. This makes an excelent dough-rolling surface.  Although, probably the most useful, is for making caramel decorations. This is where I find a good Silpat absolutely essential. When dealing with sugar at temperatures at or exceeding 320 degrees, it is essential that you have a good surface to work with. Piping liquid sugar this hot onto a bare sheet pan would make it impossible to remove without destroying the fragile decorations. And over parchment paper? The paper will actually bond to the cooling sugar when it's that hot, and you'll never get it all off. Not tasty. But they come clean off of a Silpat.  There are probably hundreds of potential uses for theese. They're not cutting boards, so don't cut on them. But I've used them for everything from opening stubborn jars to caramel spirals that my friends always beg me to tell them how they were made.
