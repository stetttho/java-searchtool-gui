 Call me a food snob, but I believe strongly in the right tool for the right job. And, sorry kids, the right tool is almost always a sharp knife and a little skill. There is no replacing that.  Slicing vedgies? Get yourself a mandoline. Chopping them instead? 8 inch chef's knife. Grinding cheese? That's what they make cheese graters for. You don't use a food processor for mixing, mincing or grinding either. Why? Simple. Consistency.  Your hands and your skill are your most valuable kitchen tools. When you work with your hands, all of your senses are in action to help ensure you get the best quailty end product. By tossing things into a processor and hitting a button, you take away virtually all the sensory feedback that helps you perfectly prepare good food every time. And consistency is the key to quality.  Are they useless? No. I use mine for making breadcrumbs or a half dozen other applications in which the end result is a powder or puree (except, really, I prefer a blender for pureeing. The cyclonic action of a blender leads to better results, in my experience). But to think that this will slice, chop, grate, grind, mince or mix on par with what your hands and a sharp blade will do, is simply mistaken. Will it do it fast? Sure. Do you have to have skill to use this? Nope. But quality is more important than convienence, and skill will always produce better results than any gadget.  Also, I agree with what some other reviewers have said, this peticular model is much too small for most serious applications. It's pretty, though. That counts for something.  So, I guess, if you MUST have a food processor, this one will do the job. But please don't over-use it.
