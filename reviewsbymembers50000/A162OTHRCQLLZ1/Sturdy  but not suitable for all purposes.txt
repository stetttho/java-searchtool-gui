 Starting with the positive: This thing is well-made and holds plenty of whatever you intend to put into it. Very strong, it doesn't even begin to show strain even while forcing through even the toughest doughs. Most of my tubes fit fine, except for the smallest and largest of them.  The only real negative, outside of the fact that it doesn't work with all my tubes, is that fatty or oily things leak through the canvas, and I wind up with hands covered in grease that can't grip anything properly. It would have been nice to see a plastic lining along the inside of the bag, which would have prevented this problem.  So, really, a good product, but not good enough for the 5 stars.
