 Cast iron is excelent for general purpose cooking, and Lodge Logic makes good stuff. Plus, the fact that it comes seasoned means it's ready to use straight out of the box.  Cast iron is naturally non-stick, and so minimizes the additional chemicals that your food comes in contact with. Plus, the lack of an artificial nonstick coating means you can use a metal spatula or fork to stir and not worry about it reacting with the surface of the pan.  It's not perfect for every situation, though. Searing and other fast-heat techniques require a thinner metal, so I still have a copper-bottomed pan around just for that. But It's in a dark corner of the kitchen, and the Lodge Logic is right on the stovetop.  The only thing that holds it back from a perfect score is that, in my experience, the pre-seasoning is a bit shoddy. I lost the origional seasoning just a couple of weeks after getting the pan. Noticed the distinct metal-taste in whatever I cooked. But, of course, a couple quick coats of crisco, a couple trips through a hot oven, and it was back up to 100%.  Every cook should have a good set of cast iron. Even, gentile heat is perfect for most every cooking situation. And it can be used as a very handy weapon in case of intruders or bears.
