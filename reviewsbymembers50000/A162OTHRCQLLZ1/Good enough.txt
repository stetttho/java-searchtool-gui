 This does it's job. It levels a cake, but I don't reccomend that you use it for cutting cakes into layers.  The probelm is that the bottom level is still about an inch tall. This means that you cannot use it to cut a cake under that inch. I was using it to cut a heavy cake into half inch layers, and had to resort to my old cake knife to finish it off.  If you just want it to cut the tops off of cakes, it's fine for that. If you were wanting something that will help you cut a cake into several thin layers, this will help to a certain extent, but it'll never replace skill and cake knives. As with so many kitchen products, my advice is to buy a good knife and learn to use it well.
