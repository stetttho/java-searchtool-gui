 I bought this because I needed to weigh some ingreedients for a cake I was making, and, living in a small town, had no other options.  Five bucks is a fair price for this thing. It measures accurately, if you don't mind getting on eye-level with the counter to read it. Setting it to zero is kinda a pain, as a full twist of the knob only moves the needle about 1/8 of an ounce. But, if you're in a pinch or have low expectations, this thing does a fine job.  I've got a Baker's Dream scale on it's way to replace it, because this little thing just does not meet the needs of anyone who needs a serious cooking scale. But I suppose that's not quite what it's designed for.  Decent, does it's job, very small. Good enough if that's all you need.
