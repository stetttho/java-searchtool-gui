 I'll be comparing these to my canvas pastry bag (which I also rated a 4 of 5).   Let's start with the positive. These are very much convienent and easy to use. You can even store things in them in the fridge. Just don't cut the tip off 'till they're ready to use. There's a cool spiced cream cheese and blue cheese sauce that I love to put on anything from chips to baked potatoes. I keep a pastry bag full of it in my frige, ready to pipe onto anything. If you seal up the end of the bag and don't cut the tip, it works just as well as a zip-top baggie. These work with all of my tubes. And cleanup is a snap. Just cut the tube out of the bag, and throw the bag away. Done. Also, my canvas bag tends to let fatty or oily icings seep through the bag, causing greasy hands. These don't do that.  The negative? Well, they can get slick if your hands are greasy or wet. Also, they're not quite as large or easy to load as my canvas bag. And, although most people probably don't use their bags like this, when forcing through stiffer materials like cookie doughs, my tube will sometimes blow out of the tip of the bag.  So, definitely worthwile for the convienence, but still, not quite a perfect product.
