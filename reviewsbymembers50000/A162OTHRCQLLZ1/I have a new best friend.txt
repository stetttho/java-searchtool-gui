 As I write this, I have a bowl of the best ice cream I have ever eaten sitting on my desk. I don't typically like to keep food near my delicate and expensive electronics, but I can not help myself right now.  What amazed me most about this machine, is the speed with which it worked. Granted, I have only used it twice so far, but neither of the two ice cream recipes I made took more than 10 minutes to solidify.  The recipes it comes with are decent enough, but the really great part is that the manual gives you guidelines and instructions to help you make your own unique flavors. It explains how to substitute different milks or creams to achive different consistencies, and explains when and how to add alcohol to your ice cream if you should desire it. It encourages creativity. And I think that's what cooking is all about, creating new and origional things, not just following recipes mindlessly.  The first batch I made was a very passable vanilla. Starting with the basics. It was quick, easy, and very tasty. But I like to experiment. So I played around with the proportions and fat content in their chocolate-mint ice cream recipe, added some peppermint schnapps and some busted up Keebler grasshopper cookies, and now I have on my desk a bowl of what is simply the best ice cream I have ever eaten.  So, yeah. The recipes in the manual aren't the best in the world, but they're definitely a good starting place. And for those lacking imagination they're definitely good enough to keep you happy for a long time to come. The machine itself is easy to use, easy to clean, fast and by and large the best non-restraunt ice cream maker I have ever used. You should buy one.
