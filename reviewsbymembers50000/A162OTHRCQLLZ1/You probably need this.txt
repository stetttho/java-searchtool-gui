 If you want a highly accurate, compact, good looking scale for your kitchen, this is almost certainly what you need. Not only is it accurate to an eigth of an ounce, it switches smoothly between U.S. and metric measurments.  The bowl is large and easily holds several pounds of flour without any worry about spillover. The design is slick and looks awesome in the kitchen. It is easy and enjoyable to use.  The only thing in my mind that keeps it from a perfect 5 rating is that the stand which holds the bowl is not flat, which means that measuring anything outside of the bowl becomes something of a balancing act. Not impossible by any means, but more difficult than it would have been had they simply leveled the bottom of the bowl and the top of the scale.  But still, a vast improvement over my crappy mechanical scale I had been using, and it's good looking to boot. If you want a good digital scale, you want this scale.
