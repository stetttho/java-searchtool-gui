 For those who were extremely dissapointed with "Coming Home" and it's jumpy plot, this is a must read.  Pilcher at her finest.  Actually, the beginning is a little slow but after the first chapter or so the pages flew by and I finished in no time.  This novel is basically about character development and how people's lives affect one another.   Each character, and the supporting characters, are so vividly detailed that the reader feels like he or she is the reader's close friend.  I think this is a must have for those who are authors or English students.  This is what character development really is. Two thumbs up!!
