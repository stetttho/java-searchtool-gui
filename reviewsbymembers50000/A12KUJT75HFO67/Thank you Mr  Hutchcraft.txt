 It's hard to get my husband to read anything that's not fiction, let alone about childrearing.  But Ron Hutchcraft didn't dissapoint me and has written a book that was easy to read for everybody.  I love listening to Ron on the radio with his 5 minute "A Word with You" and this is the first book of his I've read.  The book is good for all parents of any age and experience .  It is written in a clear, straightforward format with examples from his personal life.  I'm going to pass this book on to friends.
