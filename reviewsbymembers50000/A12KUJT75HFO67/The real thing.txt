 Forget Harry Potter; forget the cheesey alien books.  Tolkien is the grandfather of all fantasy and can not be matched. Yes, these books can be a little dark and scary.  But the lessons clearly taught are valuable.  Each person is important and valuable.  Team work gets things done.  Absolute power corrupts absolutely.  And even the smallest of the smallest people can make a difference in the world. For younger readers, start off with C.S. Lewis.  But junior highers and older can handel this.  I even reccommend it for adults. Make it your summer reading.
