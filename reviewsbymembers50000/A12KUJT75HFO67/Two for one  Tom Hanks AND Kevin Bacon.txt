 Looking past the Big Names and high budget production, there was a lot of great acting done by the supporting characters.  I was impressed by the protrayals of the ground crew and how each actor made the crew real people. Other than the sexual conitations in the opening scenes, this is a good, clean movie and would recomend it for anybody 14 and up.  Not younger because the climax is a little intense, even if you do know the outcome.
