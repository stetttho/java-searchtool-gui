 I have enjoyed this series but I was quite dissapointed with this book.  The title is attractive.  The beginning of the book and the plot development is fine.  But the further I got into the book, the more far-fetched the plot. The first half of the book was well written and the who-dunnit solution was unplausable. I felt like Davidson didn't know how to end her story and rushed it.  But don't judge the whole series on this one book.
