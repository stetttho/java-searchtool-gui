 Sex Begins in the Kitchen ... is more than just a book about sex.  It's about the husband/wife relationship including topics like birth order, previous sexual relationships, and communication.  This book is written  by a man who understands both men and women and is able to explain things  in a way both sexes can understand.  His comedy keeps heavy issues light  enough to deal with without watering down the importance of the message.  I  would recommend this book for couples who are having trouble, those in good  times and for those who are engaged.
