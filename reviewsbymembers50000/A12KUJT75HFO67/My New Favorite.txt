 Straight to the point: I Love this Book.  My eighteen month old son loves books that ryhme and loves animals so Sheep in a Jeep is close to heaven.  The vocabulary is very simple but gains momentum right along with the rolling jeep.  And the illustrations are perfect.  I love the little frog that kind of follows the jeep.  But I must warn you, if you buy this book your child will have you reading it over and over and over.
