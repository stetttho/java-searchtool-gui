 What I appreciated most about this book was that it was NOT pornography in disguise.  Most sexual 'how to' and self help books can be quite degrading, graphic, or base.  This is a text book.  These two doctors know their stuff and went to great lenghts to write medically accurate and proffionally.  (Still, I got a giggle that the doctor's last name is Heiman.) I like the fact that this book doesn't have a right way, only way, or quick fix formula.  It helps one explore all possiblities for sexual dysfunction and helps the woman better unstand her dysfunction. The tone of this book is very encourageing- just what women need to hear, that your problem does not isolate you or make you different.  My doctor reccomended this book to me.  I reccomend it to you.
