 As a consumate Veggie fan, I looked forward to this release ~ but was sorely dissapointed.  Unless you have seen the recent verision of Lord of the Rings(and our small children who are VT's target audience should not have seen it)this story doesn't make too much sense and requires a lot of explaining.  My first grader has watched it twice now, and still is confused about what's going on.  Technically, this tops all previous Veggies.  And Wynnona's music is great.  But I felt like the producers wanted to spoof LOTR more than they wanted to get a valuable message across to kids.  Much, much dissapointed.
