 This short, well put together story is for children of all ages.  It's very different from Jan Karon's "Tale of an Honest Bunny" or "The Trellis Seed."  I read this to my six year old son.  When we finished, he actually sighed and said, "What a nice story."  I then shared it with my mother who called me crying saying it was beautiful.  I highly reccomend it.
