 While I was a little disapointed with "Autotainment" "The Ballad" restores all confidence in VeggieTales.  A wonderful tale that shines the light on "why bad things happen to good people" in simple language that children of all ages can grasp with being engaging enough for adults.  The animation in this one is phenominal!  And "Belly Button" should be the new top Silly Song of all time.  And the best part was not having to skip through any commercials that proceed the majority of children's films.  Pure family fun.
