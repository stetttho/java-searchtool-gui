 Ellis Peters is not only a great writer but was first a historian, and that knowledge shows through in her writing.  I was enterested to see how acurate her descriptions of the early/mid part of the second century was  that I did a little research of my own and she is right on.  I enjoyed  "The Rose Rent" so much that it is now packed in my bag that I  will take to the hospital when I deliver my baby.
