 A Snoodle's Tale is the only Veggie episode that has made me cry.  It's a blend of Dr. Suess narration and Max Lucado plot but VT pulls it off so beautifully that I was moved.  But in true Veggie form, there's a lot of fun, quirky stuff on the CD as well.  Dr. Jiggle made me giggle more than think.  And Tom Hodge's take on SUV's is now my family's favorite Silly Song.  Veggie Tales is right on track with this release.
