 I checked out this CD after it was featured on NPR's World Cafe.  Since that show very rarely repeats music, I wanted to hear more since it was playing her stuff fairly regularly. Amy Rigby is open and honest with her lyrics without being overly sentimental or trying to be shocking.  She asks the same questions that the average woman thinks about in a day.  If you're a tough-guy or really young, this album might not appeal to you.  But for all else, it's a must have.   And I hope I'm not the only person to cry everytime I hear "Don't ever change."
