 I bought this for my husband and he really enjoys it.  The graphics are good but you will need a fast pc to make it look good.  There is a wide variety of choices/options that can constantly change the game.  But I was a little disapointed that I couldn't play one event right after another.  Great family game- no violence, gore or sexual content.
