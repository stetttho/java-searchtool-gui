 I very rarely buy hardback editions because of the cost but couldn't wait for a paperback version.  I was not dissapointed!  This finally episode of The Mitford Years wraps up every loose end up beautifully and gives the reader even more insight into the lives of a group that now feels like my own family.  Have kleenex handy; I started sniffling on page nine and and didn't stop for the rest of the book.
