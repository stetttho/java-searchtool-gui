 Don't expect this book to be like her Brother Cadfael series.  I bought this book because I have every Brother Cadfael book and wanted to expand my Ellis Peters/ Edith Pargeter collection.  I found this book to have little  to no character development and made large jumps in time that were akward  to read.
