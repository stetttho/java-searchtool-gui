 Actually, if you are  preschooler, this is a great video.  True, the Ant/Itsy Bisty Spider lady does grate my nerves and "The Noble Duke of York" is turned into a politically correct "Captain Brown."  But the video isn't suppose to appeal to adult- the target audiance are preschoolers.  And it works.  My three year son could watch it all day.  The songs are good, clean, children's classics. And there is a nice mix of girls/boys and ethnic children.  And I the "extra" skit after the credits is cute.  I would rank this a five star video except for all the advertisements at the end of the tape.
