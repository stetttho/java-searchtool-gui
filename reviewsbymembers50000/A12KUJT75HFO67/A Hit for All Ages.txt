 Okay- I was allready a Neil Diamond fan but when I put it on the sterio last night, I was reminded why.   Diamond creates a feeling with each song and the listener gets caugt up in that feeling. Feeling the lonliness in "Shilo", the excitement in "Brother Eli" and the tenderness in "Play Me". Also, the music crosses generations.  Listening in my house was a 46 year old, a 24 year old and a 2 year old.  All three couldn't help but dance around, sing and goof off.  The music just commands that you listen and interact. My only problem with "Hot August Night" is with "Soolaimon."  For long time fans, you may have noticed that on this recording Diamond pronounces it "Soolaiman"- not "Soolaimon."  Why the change?  I found it distracting.   One last thing, I actually like "Soggy Pretzels."
