 As a huge Enya fan, I am disapointed.  The 34 minutes of music was much shorter than the other albums.  (When the CD stopped, I actually thought there was something wrong with my player.) And the music that was on the CD all sounded the same.  THere was no new sound, no new inovation, and each song sounded just like the previous. If you are a new Enya listener, start with Paint the Stars, her "Best of" album.  And if she does a second "Best of" none of these songs will on it.
