 This tribute to Mississippi John Hurt is one that I keep gravitating back to and giving "nuther listen to".  The artists (save perhaps one) are impressive in their interpretation of John's wonderful witty and humorous music.  Those last two qualities seem to be the only thing that they just couldn't copy that Mr Hurt seasoned his works with so naturally.  My ear always "trips over" Victoria Williams "Since I've Laid My Burden Down".  Her performance is done in a style that is more suited to the Bulgarian Womens Choir.  I loved the Taj Mahal performance of "My Creole Belle" and Geoff Muldaurs "Chicken".
