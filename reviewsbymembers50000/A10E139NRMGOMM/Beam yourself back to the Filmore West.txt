 This live album typifies the great performances by QMS that once was the standard of Bay-Area based groups of the 60s, such as Jefferson Airplane and Spirit.  This performance rocks, with the intro to "Who do you love?" It weakens a bit with "where, how and which do you love" (all continuations of the intro track).  It picks up again with "Mona and Maiden of the Cancer Moon".  This work was recorded prior to the advent of CDs.  The contents display a "side one and two"  refering to those back disks that we used to be real careful not to scratch.
