 This collection of charming compositions are bright single blossoms that make up a great wildflower collection, only this bouquet will hardly wilt overnight.  "When Love is New" is a beautiful melodic performance that will no doubt be escorting and soothing many a summer traveller caught on a frustrating interstate.  Dolly and Emmy, my hat's off to you!  Emmy, your acappella "Barbara Allen" sent chills down my spine.  The Emmylou Harris performance of the same tune is a pure delight done as only Ms Harris could do.  "Moonshiner",  performed by Allison Moorer, with its wonderous harmonium and guitar intro and backdrop is a great rendition of a good traditional tune that I heard as a child on the front porch of a neighbors house in Austin TX, long ago.  I love Julie Millers "All my tears"  Gillian Welch's banjo and Tammy Rodgers fiddle give the piece its great "American Backbone".  "Mary of the Wild Moor" is a transplanted European song that could be called a soothing summer lullaby.  The second acapella piece in this collection could be called the brother of the song "down to the river to pray" which was performed by Allison Krauss on the "Oh Brother  Where are Thou" collecton.  The Dylanesque "Cukoo Bird" with its rapid fire rythm and cleaver lyrics will send one off humming the tune well into the day.  Hazel Dicken's, David Patrick and Bobby McMillen's  conversation with death contiues Ralph Stanley's missive "Oh Death" from the "Oh Brother" collection, and done with great virtuousity I might add.  The third acapella piece is a charming rendition of "Single Girl".  This Album will no doubt be spinning on my player for years to come. I'm a Texan and will be quick to tell that music like this is what is making Greune Hall in New Braunfels and The Cabaret in Bandera very famous, very fast.   Thank you Ladies and All who had a part in this great collection!!
