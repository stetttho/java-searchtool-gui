 I waited a long time to write this review because from the first listen to this album till now I am compelled to compare this music to one of my favorite guitar slingers and every time I listen I can see Mr Brown twanging away at these tunes.  I am Speaking of Junior Brown.  The guitar work in this album is innovative and highly inventive, if not darn right outlandisly clever.  Muted plucks to add to a percussive effect, ala Junior Brown and even strums on the strings above the fretboard, then bending their strange twinkle using a wammy bar.  Manuel and Ry share an understanding of just how to break free of the pink stuccoed walls of this genre of music and with a bit of inventiveness and perhaps painful twisting have launched a great big pink flamingo pheonix from the ashes of salsa/merengue.  This is one great piece of music, from a blues guitar appreciator's point of view, and one that will keep you guessing "just how did they do that?"  I hope Junior has given this one an ear.  Good Job Ry and Manuel!!
