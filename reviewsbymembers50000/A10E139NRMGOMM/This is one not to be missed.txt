 I dont often purchase "archival" performances on DVD due to the often poor quality of both picture and sound.  This one, however transcends the archival dust truely conjures up old nuances and feelings that modern bluesmen rarely pull out of the hat.  Johns 1965 performance of "Hobo Blues" is a tribute to his dark and smoothly melodic blues.  "Im in the Mood" with Bonnie Raitt, raises gooseflesh on me like no other wonderfully performed, almost extemperaneous blues rendition either modern or historical.  This collection of both very old and performances from the sunset of his life is full of rare jewels that keeps me poping the DVD back into the player.  I applaud and thank the Estate of John Lee Hooker for allowing us the ability to bring him into our homes.  He is truely missed, but I hear him all the time listening to Van, Eric, Bonnie, Susan and even myself when I perform.  He lives on in us.
