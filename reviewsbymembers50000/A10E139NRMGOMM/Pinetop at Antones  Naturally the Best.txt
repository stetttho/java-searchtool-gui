 I just returned from a live performance by the "living legend" of Boogie Woogie.  Prior to my trip from San Antonio to Antones blues clup in Austin to See Mr Perkins perform, I gave this CD a listen.  This recording truly captures the ambiance of the Austin blues club that has been the "Fort Apache" of the blues south of Chicago.  Pinetops personable performance on the recording is exactly the way it is if you were standing next to the piano (as I was).  "Big fat Mama" tends to stand out as my favorite boogie woogie tunes done by Mr. P, though his others such as "Pinetop's Boogie Woogie" with it's halts in the progression by Pinetop instructing "Stop!, dont you turn a page"  This performance was recorded when Pinetop was 86 years old.  He is 88 now and still rocks those keys as if he were 20.  I couldn't help but tell Mr P "Pinetop, you the Best!"
