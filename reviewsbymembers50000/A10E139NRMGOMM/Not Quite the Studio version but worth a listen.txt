 There are no bad tracks on this album.  All have the same spirit as the movie soundtrack.  There's some new vibrations contained within that have the same Americana charm as their forerunners. Thank goodness there is a Chris Thomas King track on this collection (I was hoping for more), lest the album's artwork of the crossroads where the fleeing convicts met up with "Tommy Johnson" would have imparted an ironic note.  It is a real good listen, worth the expense.  My only gripe is that it wasn't performed and recorded at Gruene Hall.
