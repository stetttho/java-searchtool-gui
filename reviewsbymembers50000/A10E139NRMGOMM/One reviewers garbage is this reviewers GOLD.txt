 Junior, in my humble opinion has done it again.  Mixed bag is just as the title says, Junior jumping from one style to another and doing it quite well I might add.  When Bob Dylan went electric there were people even during his performances calling him "Judas".  I have been to a couple of Mr Brown's live perfomances and they too have been a "Mixed Bag"  all the way from an excellent homage to Hendrix with even a tribute to "Close Encounters" to bringing smiles to a country crowd with his "Bandera Waltz".   Junior "smokes" Jerry Hubbard's "Guitar Man".  "Aint gonna work today"  is done in the great tongue-in-cheek style that only Junior can do, which kind of causes this reviewer to compare him with Mississippi John Hurt in his humorous seasoning of his creations.  "Riverboat Shuffle" is probably the one cut that would cause a bit of dissent among dyed-in-the-wool enthusiasts of Junior's style.  I feel that, as with any artist especially one of Juniors virtuousity, it is departures like this one that cause the artist to grow and create a little "elbow room" for up and coming new feats. The track seemingly does not want to belong but after giving it a couple more listens, I can see where "Loonier Junior" is coming from.  I had the same misgivings about "Hong Kong Blues" off another of Junior's albums.  Cagey Bea is one song that I must thank Junior for recording.  After hearing it live I wondered who had written it and now my curiosity is satisfied.  "Catfish and Collard Greens" is a good example of what to expect from Hard driving start to Guit-Steel faux toss finish of one of Junior live shows.  Gol, durn it Junior, You've done it again.  Good Job Pardner!!!
