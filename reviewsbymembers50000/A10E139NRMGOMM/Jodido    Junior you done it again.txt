 For those of you who have not been blessed with the opprotunity to experience the Semi-Crazy Junior live, this as close as you can get to it.  Just put this CD on and plunk yourself down in a nice comfy chair.  If you want realism turn down the lights and have a few ciggies burnin somewhere in an ashtray, an brotha you are there.  Juniors live performances are nothing short of electric, licks that are timed with the precision of a brain surgeon and quips ala his guit fiddle "Big Red" that will get you in a chucklin mood.  Junior seems to "channel" into some twangy funk river that flows nearby and with the aid of his band serves it up with humor and an ambiance that we thought was lost with the 60s.  Every track on this CD takes me back to the last time I saw Junior live.  All his best are here, enjoy!!
