 I am a "born again" blues listener.  This colletion of three CD's could probably be called the rollercoaster of Texas-based blues.  Ms Thornton is the connection to past female blues greats, such as Ma Rainey, Bessie Smith and Memphis Minnie.  This is the performer that inspired Janis Joplin.  The first CD, (a live performance recorded in a jail) includes "Ball and Chain", which she dedicates to Janis.  The second CD entitled "Sassy Mama" includes "Rolling Stone", "Mr Cool and "Sassy Mama", the title track rocks as if it were a live recording.  The final CD is a previously unreleased collection that, to me is the best of the three.  All are good! The collection includes a booklet written by Ed Ward, the rock historian for National Public Radio's "Fresh Air".  In this booklet one will discover that Ms Thornton was a far more flamboyant personality than Janis, preferring Gin and Milk to Janis' Southern Comfort.  Another fact that will surprise you will be her connection to Elvis Presley's fame.  Every track rocks, she lifts you by the collar and screams you into the blues.  This collection is a must for anyone that enjoys hard drivin female blues vocalists
