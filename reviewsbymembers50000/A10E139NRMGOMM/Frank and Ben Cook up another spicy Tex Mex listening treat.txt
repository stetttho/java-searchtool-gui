 Frank, with the help of Ben Tavera King has done it again, this time instead of movies and cantinas, the influence is on cooking and yummy Tex-Mex treats.  Frank is accompanied on this album by Los Tortilleros (the  tortilla makers) who consist of:  Ben Tavera King who plays rhythm guitar,  lead guitar on the cut "Enchiladas Rojas", harpa Mexicana and my  favorite the corn tortillas, (which don't last long in my possession to use  as an instrument); Jose Alfredo Trevino who provides the "gritos"  in just the right places in the  musical dishes.  There is a double delight  to this album, which is a collection of six traditional Tex-Mex recepies  from the pen of Melissa Guerra, the celebrated PBS-TV chef.  Track number  10, El Porro de Jaime, an adopted traditional Colombian folk tune is the  intro music to Melissa's TV program, "The Texas Provincial  Kitchen"  Included in this platter is "un poco the todo" (a  litte of everything) musical to cook and savor by.  Track # 2  "Jesusita En Chihuahua" is a yummy spicy polka number used in the  move "Like Water For Chocolate".  Each track has it's own flavor  which  like "Mira Luisa" and "La Bamba" adds a bit of  spark to "comiendo o cocinando" (eating or cooking).        My  sombrero is off to chef Frank and his most able assistants Ben and Melissa  in assembling a treat for both ear and palate.  What a great idea!
