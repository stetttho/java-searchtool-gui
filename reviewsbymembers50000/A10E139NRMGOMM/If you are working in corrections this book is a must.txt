 I've been in the Jail bussiness now since 1996, and I can tell you that a read of this book will instantly give you a years expereince or better in the corrections proffession.  It includes all the "tricks" that inmates and criminals use to "get one over on you"  Since these people have nothing to do all day but dream up new crimes and manipulation techniques, the knowledge this book will impart will allow one to "see them coming a mile away". Reading this book will enhance ones safety both in the corrections environment and on the street.
