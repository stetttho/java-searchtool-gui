 After listening to Frank Corrales in person and enjoying his personable and light hearted stage presence, the first thing anyone would want to do is to preserve the moment in owning a recording of this spicy and  melodically happy music.  These are musical pieces that were heard in movie  theatres and cantinas from the early 1900s to the 1950s, played in exactly  the same fashion.  I heard music on this album that was incorporated in the  soundtrack of one of Clint Eastwood's spagetti westerns and the opening  music to the Robert Rodriguez movie Desperado, all done on acoustic guitar.  A charming rendition of Manuel Ponce's Estrellita finishes the album.  This  is truely a time machine to the  music of the working class of Texas and  Mexico during the first quarter of this century.
