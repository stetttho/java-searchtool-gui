 I have nothing but praise for this accomplishment of DA Pennebaker.  I saw this in the theatre when it was first released on film and was awed by the performances of some of the greats of that time, some no longer with us ie Janis and Jimi. Viewing it today has the same impact on me now as it did then.  This 3 disc set is chock full of performance gems and brief glimpses of the spectators of this event, used like seasoning to set the mood of the performances.      Disc one is the original movie mentioned above, disc two contains performaces by Jimi Hendrix and Otis Redding, done as only Mr Pennebaker could present it, but disc three is the real treasure as it contains footage not released until now (that I know of), which includes artists such as The Association, sounding a bit like Devo or Talking Heads; The Paul Butterfield Blues Band featuring the late Paul Butterfield laying down some wild Blues Harp licks that harp players today emulate; Al Kooper, of the Butterfield Band with his awesome blues talent; and rare footage of Quicksilver messenger service.            I am unable to find anything approaching boring or not enjoyable within this 3 disc set.  Im glad I waited for it to come out in this format
