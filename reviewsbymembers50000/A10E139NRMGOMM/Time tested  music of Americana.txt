 Here we are in the year 2001.  Thirty years ago I purchased this album in that black plastic format that my son asks me "how do you play this thing, Dad?".  I have since picked it up in CD format.  Now I observe a quickening of artists vibrating in unison to music of "Americana".  The fiddle playing hand in hand with the harmonica and banjo, pouring out tunes transplanted form Ireland and England that made appalachia so famous.  Bob was into this over thirty years ago, and Self Portrait is his testimony to it.   Ive heard a lot of whining about this collection of songs, and Ive also heard a lot of praise.  Yes, a bunch of this music Bob did not write, but to sit and listen will give you an earfull of what is now in the year 2001 being refreshed musically.  "All the tired horses" can hypnotize you into the correct mood for listening to this collection and "Wigwam" will keep the mood going for some time.  "The Boxer"  is Dylans version of a popular tune of the time, done in a very nice country format.  "Copper Kettle", the moonshiners ballad, can stir up images of an illicit trade that supported many an applachian family during very hard times.  "Little Sadie" and "Minstrel Boy" are two tunes that to this day amaze me with their cleverness.   Bob continues to amaze me in his inspiration and creativity in this, one of my favorite Dylan collectons.
