 Before one starts to be critical about the technical expertise of this documentary, one needs to remember that this was filmed in 1966.  All performers were at their peak of their careers and were natural and unpretentious while being filmed.  Howlin Wolf and Son House had an interesting dialoge about Howlin's definition of the blues.  I am pleased with the performances, the camera is blocked by a dancer or two, but only briefly.  If you are a real fan of Son House, Bukka White and Howlin Wolf, you will not be dissapointed.
