 There is, I think, a general suspicion of travel writers who engaged in their adventures as opportunities to write - in a search for "fodder".  Hessler, in Rivertown, is quite up front about seeking out his Peace Corps position as an occasion and subject matter for this book.  It doesn't matter.  The experience is so fully immersive and complete that Hessler is forced to venture far beyond any writerly conventions to take a very fresh and engaging look at a place completely at odds with his own personal experience.  The results are often fascinating.  Hessler's never quite escapes the culture shock (both for him and his Chinese neighbours) that his teaching position in Fuling provides.  He is stared at, mocked, and humiliated, but also adopted, pampered and adored.  A book about his special status as an outsider in China would have been very interesting in its own right, but Hessler struggles to find ways to fully connect with the people of his town.  That he is only partially successful is part of the story, and his attempts to make this connection are captivating if sometimes heartbreaking.  From his early struggles with doctrinaire Chinese instructors to coping with traffic, noise and alienation, he paints a very honest picture of both himself and his situation.  Insofar as he makes the connections he is looking for, the book paints a remarkable picture of Chinese life in a town that will soon be largely submerged by the rising waters of the Three Gorges Dam.  The immediacy of the place, and his willingness to share his sometimes ungainly appreciation of his role there, make this both an unusual and dramatic discussion of modern Chinese life that is at once personal and universal.
