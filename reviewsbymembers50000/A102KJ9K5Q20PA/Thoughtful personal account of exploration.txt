 Some reviewers have complained that this is a book of ideas, and certainly it is.  It is not a book of macho adventure, though his lack a natural sailing ability does make for some harrowing moments.  His trip between Vancouver Island and Tahiti serves more as reference point for deeper, more personal reflections than a pure narrative, and he manages this without any penchant for flakey expostulations about his personal growth or metaphysical speculations about the nature of travel.  Indeed, along the way he finds himself dissatisfied with the presentation of travel that he finds in other writers, like Chatwin or Theroux, and in taking them to task he exposes much of the myth of travel as a way of finding one's self.  This is heady stuff, but he manages it without preaching or self-congratulation.  It was for me a very satisfying read (and one perhaps more valuable because I had read Chatwin and Theroux already).  I was disappointed to find Patterson's book so poorly reviewed here, because I felt many of things for which he is taken to task are precisely the things that made his efforts so valuable and worthy.  I think if you are interested in the art of travel rather than perhaps its faultless execution, you would do well to have a look at this book.
