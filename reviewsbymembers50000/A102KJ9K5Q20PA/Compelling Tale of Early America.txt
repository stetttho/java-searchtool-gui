 The beginning of America was, of course, more than just pilgrims.  Indeed, some scholars suggest that the American infatuation with the story of the Mayflower colony comes not from its role in the birth of the nation, but rather as a consequence of the large proportion of New England academics who founded the Smithsonian institution.  Whatever the reason, the story of the creation of England's first North American colony is altogether more darker than the foundation its more famous Massachusetts cousin.  Milton captures this complex story very clearly, managing to give robust characerizations of the many individuals who come and go throughout the story.  The two main figures, Sir Walter Ralegh and Queen Elizabeth, are clearly conceived despite the fact that Milton avoids the temptation to speculate about matters not covered in the historical record.  Given this admirable restraint, Milton's story more than succeeds on its own terms.  The historical account is gripping -- and the mysteries contained therein are pursued clearly and rationally.  The writing, though remarkably detailed, never gets bogged down in them.  Milton manages to give a panorama of the times without ever seeming explicitly engaged in academic history.  It is a painless way to learn but still remarkably satisfying.  If I have any complaints, they come down to some of his conclusions.  He claims, for example, that the ultimate success of Jamestown was a result of the final acceptance of Ralegh's stricture that peace with the natives is essential.  I agree that while this is very important, there appears to be no question that the real reason for the success was not merely that peace was achieved (through a marriage) but rather that the growth of the tobacco industry in the new world helped sustain the infusion of capital that made the colony possible.  Love didn't create America, money did.
