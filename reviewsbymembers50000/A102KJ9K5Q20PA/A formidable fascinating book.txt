 A tour de force of science writing -- does for molecular biology what David Attenborough's films do for the natural world.  The explanations are never mundane or dull, though one is often positive that the science itself must be on some level (or else I would have gone that way in college).  In large part, the examples help -- they are never less than fascinating, and the writing is a marvel of clarity.  It's a book I wish I had written, because I like to think I am that clever.
