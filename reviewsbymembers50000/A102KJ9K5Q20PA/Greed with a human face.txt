 The title seems to me all wrong, but that's about the only complaint I have about this informative, fascinating peek into the last forty or so years of Congo's history.  Mobutu was no Kurtz, even if he might have been something worse, and the few parallels drawn do not advance the themes of the book itself.   This is a minor complaint, since the book itself is remarkably engaging.  By combining a first person perspective on many of the events surrounding Mobutu's last days in office with interviews of the significant players in the Mobutu regime, Wrong is able to paint a broad canvass of those factors that led both to the creation of Mobutu the president and the myths and realities that surround him.  It's a fascinating job, and an enlightening one.  I, for one, am less enamored of being a dictator than I once was, and certainly more appreciative of those factors, both within a country and without that contribute to their existence. I think however the true glory of this book comes not from the sweeping sociopolitical account of Mobutu's years in powers, but rather from the delicate handling of the details which define life under a totalitarian third world regime.  Wrong has a wonderful eye for these things, both within her own experience but also how they manifest themselves in the lives of the downtrodden and impoverished.  As the book moves into its final third Wrong's attention to these details fades under the pressure for a resolution that, at least for the people of Congo, never comes.
