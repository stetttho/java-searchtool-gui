 It seems that everyone is writing a naval series these days.  I know my paperboy started one and the guy at the video store looks to be publishing his third.  It would seem then that you would have to be doing something pretty special to justify a new series -- especially when you consider the works of Forester and O'Brian.   I think Stockwin is trying for something special, in part by setting this his first story in the ranks of common sailors, but also from taking the naval aspect of these stories very seriously.  You do get a healthy sense of sea life in this tale, though you are often frustrated by the very limitations of this life.  It is hard to get a bigger picture of things precisely because these sailors were largely in the dark.  This sense that anything can happen out of the blue often gives the story a kind of disjointed feel, as if each episode is unconnected with the rest.  Moreover, there are a lot of episodes.   Despite this, and a sense that Stockwin is a much better observer of naval life than human character, the story was often gripping and the narrative never flagged.  If you haven't read Patrick O'brian's novels, I would start there first before considering Kydd, but with the passing of O'brian and the Aubrey-Maturin series, Kydd warrants a serious look. I wish there were room for half-stars, because three and a bit seems right to me.
