 This is a good time for Pepys.  Clare Tomalin's new biography has received lots of attention -- while a new weblog of Pepys' diary has been highly publicized (and is well worth checking out in its own right).  I came to Coote's book for the meanest of reasons -- it was cheaper, but I have no regrets.  This is a very readable, sometimes rollicking, turn through the details of Pepys' life.  Don't expect careful analysis of the literary aspects of the diary nor rich historical background.  (This is a popular history in both good and bad senses of the term.) Pepys is front and center on every page of this book and were it not for the extraordinary nature of his life it might have grown tiresome.  We are with him in broad strokes and minor flourishes -- from silly infatuations to grand schemes of Royal skullduggery we see remarkable detail of both the man and the time.  It is fascinating stuff and Coote doesn't get in the way.  The details move quickly and coherently and when the diary itself ends the reader hardly notices.  Compiling a detailed account of Pepys' subsequent trials and tribulations from letters and parliamentary reports, our vision of the man remains steady.  Perhaps the greatest value of a biography of this sort is that it moves you towards the diary itself.  This is no small achievement for Coote and says something about Pepys' himself.
