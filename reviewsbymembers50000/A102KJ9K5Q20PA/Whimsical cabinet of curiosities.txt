 Allin describes a custom of the Victorian age in which the landed gentry would collect and display a broad spectrum of natural curiosities.  You would find skins of various creatures, bones, unusual stones, and so on brought together not because of any intrinsic affinity amongst the items, but rather as a display of erudition and education.  Seen in the same way, one could regard both Allin's subject, Zarafa -- the first giraffe on the European continent since Roman times -- and the book itself as examples of the same kind of intellectual curiosity.  Much of what Allin describes is connected by the thinnest of threads.  His history of the French occupation of Egypt, of the Mamelukes and Napoleonic sea battles have all but the slimmest contextual connection with the life of the giraffe first corralled in Ethiopia and transferred to Paris.  This would be a greater complaint if the stories were less compelling, but on some level the book doesn't quite rise to the sum of its parts.  Ultimately, this is the story of a sensation -- of the exotic species that briefly bewitched the French in the mid-nineteenth century -- but one in which the object of this sensation is never quite more than an ethereal object of gossip and speculation.  At the center of the story the giraffe is strangely (though perhaps not surprisingly) absent.  As if its magic is exhausted by its docility.  This disappointment is met by the interest I found in other aspects of the many storylines, but none of this is terribly compelling, even if it is well told.
