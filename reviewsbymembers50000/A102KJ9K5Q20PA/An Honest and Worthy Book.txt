 Even if this book was simply an attempt to cash in on the turn of  the millenium a couple of years ago, it is nevertheless a fascinating and well written piece of popular history.  Indeed, contrary to what some reviewers say, I think this book would be welcomed by historians.  It neither glamorizes nor sensationalizes the privations and accomplishments of the time, but rather sets about putting medieval life (especially in England) into a larger communal context.  There is no overemphasis on kingship and battles, but rather an attempt to portray the gritty and sometimes harrowing details of daily life.  This is a "what it was like" approach to history that remains conservative in its goals and straightforward about its sources.  In following the book of days around the calendar year, we get insights into the daily life of peasants and aristrocracy alike -- with a special emphasis on how the moving calendar had an impact on the lives of the people living on the land.  This is a special and modest insight, and I think an interesting one.  The book is, for all that, quite short and very readable.  Now that the millenium is passed, this book remains a worthy and valuable contribution for those who want a taste of the Earth over a thousand years ago.
