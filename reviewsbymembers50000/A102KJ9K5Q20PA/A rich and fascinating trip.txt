 One might think that Thurston Clarke is compiling his travel books by geographical feature, first a book on the equator and now one on islands.  We might expect his next to be about the Tropic of Cancer or salt marshes.  Whatever it is, I suspect it will be a worthy and fascinating concoction.   While he writes this book from the perspective of what he calls a "islomane", one who fascinated with islands, it makes compelling reading for someone who lacks this particular fascination.  As a prairie boy I am more fascinated by mountains than islands, but because Clarke weaves so much collateral information into his text, you will never be anything less than fully engaged.  He visits all kinds of islands from tourist meccas to summer cottages to northern coal mines.  These journeys seem terribly difficult, but Clarke never lets the encumbrances of modern travel get in the way of his examination of both the fascination he has with islands in general and the particulars of what makes any given island worth visiting.  He comes to many surprisingly interesting generalizations about the nature of islands and islanders (that for example changes on islands are usually more permanent than elsewhere).  As a traveler he reminds me of Paul Theroux, and certainly his writing is on that level, though without the annoying flashes of ego that often make Theroux painful.  It is interesting to compare Clarke's island jaunts with Theroux's Happy Isle of Oceania.  Both authors distinctly render the sense of desperation that emerges from these isolated places, but Clarke appears to have a greater sense of the humanity of the people who inhabit them.  Perhaps it takes an islomane to truly empathize with those likewise afflicted. Much as I enjoyed this book, I would also recommend Clarke's book on his travels around the equator.  I found these places more interesting, and the quality of the writing is just as high.
