 I am not sure what book Spence set out to write here.  Was he trying to write a scholarly history of the Taiping rebellion or was he writing a popular one?  The level of detail in much of the book suggests the former -- using long quotes and a passion for detail that often renders the text dense and unwieldy, Spence manages to make much of this story impregnable.  This would be fitting, and all too common, for an academic history, but clearly this is not his intent.  Leaving out such things as the ultimate influence of the Taiping rebellion on Chinese life or the Qing perspective on the rebellion makes the story rather less than complete.  But if this is a popular history, then why the long interludes about the exact details of Western missionary movements around Southwest China prior to Hong Xiuquan's conversion?  I found this segment excruciating and entirely unnecessary.  Perhaps there is more justification for his extended discussion of Taiping theology, but these seem unduly detailed for a popular history.   The saving grace in all this is the story.  The events of the Taiping rebellion are so unlikely and remarkable that even with these textual issues, the book is difficult to put down.  The fantastic, anomolous story of Hong's revolution is nail-biting stuff and certain worth trudging through the muddy prose through which it is conveyed.  I am not sure I would pick up another book by Jonathan Spence, but I am glad I made it through this one.
