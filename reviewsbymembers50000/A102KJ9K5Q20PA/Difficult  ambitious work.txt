 There is so much that is lovely and fascinating about this book, that it is especially sad that it fails to come together on so many levels.  Others reviewers have, rightly in my view, criticized her cryptic style.  She tends to use pronouns in the place of names so frequently that often it is difficult to know who did what to whom, and while her use of Dayak words can give a sense of place, the glossary in the back is so incomplete that it became a running joke for me to spot the occasional word that is defined.  Characters drop into and out of the narrative with such amazing speed that recognizing their names when they die seems almost a triumph -- and they do tend to die.  Godshalk spends almost all of her emotional capital by the end of the book. While each of these elements contributes to one's overall frustration with the book, the larger problems emerge with the narrative.  We view the story first from Gideon Barr's perspective until he marries and we take up his wife's view.  Barr disappears, as a rounded character, in favour of the wife, who despite what seems like a great effort on Godshalk's part, never becomes one.  She remains a largely passive figure, who's tribulations and mental anguish become the central focus of the book.  Much of this reads like a bloated exercise for a creative writing class -- and often makes the book's four hundred pages seem interminably longer.   The fact that Godshalk puts fictional characters into a real time and place, usurping the fascinating people whose story is apt to be more interesting is itself problematic, but I couldn't help feeling for the great naturalist Alfred Russell Wallace who becomes, in Godshalk's hands, a sort of lovesick puppy.
