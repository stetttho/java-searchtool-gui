 William Smith certainly led a fascinating life. Born of humble origins, he managed, despite enormous pluck and know-how, to return to them in his dotage. The great arc of this life is very interesting and Simon Winchester does a marvelous job in putting together the pieces of this story in a way that not only portrays the development of Smith's famous map, but also the historical context in which it was developed. I found much of this background material as rewarding as the narrative itself. However, if both components are strong, sometimes it seems as though Winchester was worried about their cumulative effect. He tends to overhype the map - noting not only in the title that it changed the world, but throughout the book itself. Unfortunately, if it was a new way of looking at the world, Winchester spends little time showing how the map could exert its influence. How does a two dimensional map portray the three dimensional strata of the earth? The problems are not merely technical, for while Smith came to be recognized for his contributions, it is not clear how others built on them and how they have had a lasting influence. These concerns, coupled with a tendency to overpersonalize his attachment to Smith's story, were my only reservations. Winchester is an otherwise clear and enthusiastic writer and the book moves quickly through the details of Smith's life with compassion and understanding. This is certainly a book I would recommend.  Online buyers should also note that the book jacket itself unfolds to become a bright coloured replica of Smith's original map. This is a very nice touch.
