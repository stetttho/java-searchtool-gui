 I read this book after hearing it recommended on NPR.  It was hard when coming to the book to disassociate Kauffmann's incredible and horrible experiences as a hostage in Beirut from my appreciation of the book itself.  Every piece of ennui, every flat, sad phrase seemed to take me back to the chair in which he was blindfolded and chained for three years.  I think it would be impossible not to attribute some significance to his past, but it is something Kauffmann fails to address in any way at all.  (It is mentioned only in passing on the book jacket.)   What we find instead is a troubled man coming to terms with a troubled place.  But here his insights aren't very deep.  He seems utterly amazed that this place, so far away from anywhere, is still France.  This is an glimpse into the Gallic mindset that perhaps only an Englishman could appreciate.  He also feels very impressed with being there.  He seems to pinch himself a lot.  Wow, I am in Kerguelen!  Apparently, it's windy.  His attempts at a back story -- his attempts to show why this place has haunted him for so long are unconvincing and rather dull.  He includes what history he could find about the place, but, sadly, there isn't so much.  For an example of this type of writing at its finest, I would check out Bruce Chatwin's In Patagonia and Kevin Patterson's excellent The Water Inbetween.  Both of these books come from similar emotional places, but engage the reader in more interesting and varied ways.
