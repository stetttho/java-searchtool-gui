 The title is perhaps a misnomer: the story is never quite so dramatic as it promises to be.  I was led to this book by an episode of the PBS series Nova about the dispute over the relative heights of K2 and Everest.  It was fascinating and it drew into the debate the story of Lambton and Everest's survey.  I was hoping that this book would give me some of the details that the television show lacked the time to include.  The book is solid on the history, but manages to keep its distance from the key characters (while letting interesting side characters and assistants slide from view).   I was disappointed by the end, not really knowing much about the cantankerous Everest, or Lambton, and not full grasping why the British seemed so obsessed about a survey that they hadn't even completed for the British Isles.   The naming of the mountains is something of a footnote, and I believe hardly a definitive account of the politics behind it.  Despite this, Keay is a capable writer, though one, it seems, hardly in the thrall of his topic.  I was hoping to get a simplified, but vivid account of how surveying works, but I found the discussion a bit murky in the beginning, and no clearer by the end.   These complaints are apt to seem minor if you come to the topic with an avid interest in how India was mapped (though, of course, this would make you rather unusual), but I don't think you will develop that interest in reading the book.  Good nonfiction should stimulate the reading of more nonfiction in related areas, but I find myself looking elsewhere now.  Clearly, the great arc was one of the most incredible scientific achievements of its or any other age -- taking over fifty years to complete.  It's a shame that Keay's book doesn't really convey both the enormity of the task and the passion that led to its completion.
