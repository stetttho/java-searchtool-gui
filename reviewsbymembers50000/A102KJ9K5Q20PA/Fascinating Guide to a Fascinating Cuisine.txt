 Mexican cuisine is difficult not merely because the ingredients are often hard to find, but also because it represents an almost wholly original approach to these ingredients.  As a truly indigenous cuisine, it represents an approach to cooking almost totally unfamiliar both to home cooks and classically trained chefs.  This is why Bayless' book is such a valuable contribution for those interested in getting away from American interpretations of Mexican food.  While he emphasizes traditional recipes, Bayless is not doctrinaire.  He also adds contemporary interpretations of classic dishes which at once preserve the authentic quality of the originals, while exploring and incorporating new ingredients.  Moreover, he offers more than simple recipes, but also a guide to understanding what it is about traditional Mexican cooking that leads to its unique flavours.  This helps inspire substitutions for ingredients not readily available and greater skills in creating notoriously difficult to reproduce Mexican standards like refried beans or ceviche.   If I have any complaints about this book, they come down to the following.  There are relatively few recipes in the book, which is largely a function of the explanations I endorsed earlier.  There are also many recipes in this book which are quite similar to dishes provided in his other cookbooks.  Somebody already familiar with Bayless' work might find this somewhat frustrating.   However, as a first book on Mexican cooking, I can think of none better placed to produce a better meal.  This is an expensive book, but one that is nicely adorned and marvelously designed.  I would recommend it to any seriously interested in coming to knwo one of the finest cuisines in the world.
