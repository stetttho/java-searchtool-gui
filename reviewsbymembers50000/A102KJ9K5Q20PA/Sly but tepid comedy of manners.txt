 I have been very impressed in recent years by Steve Martin's contributions in the New Yorker.  They are sly and funny and over the course of two or so pages they build to a sardonic conclusion that effectively skewers his chosen target.  At times, in Shopgirl, he seems motivated by similar satirical goals.  He has trouble with Los Angeles and does much to undo the pretense without being didactic or overweening.  But the satire never builds and largely dissipates by the story's conclusion.   The story faces similar obstacles.  The two lead characters, well meaning both, are shy and hesitant (and as such easy to identify with), but we can neither love them or hate them.  Mirabelle's mistakes come as much from her own vacuity as the shallowness of the world, and her ultimate rehabilitation goes no deeper than the self-help books that guide her prospective beau.  Ray's appetites are no less shallow or easily satisfied, and his preoccupations altogether as banal and self-involved as Mirabelle's, if not morally worse. It is not that these are loathsome characters, in fact we can see ourselves too easily in them.  They simple don't draw us in.  Martin is fascinated by the awkward moments in conversations, and yet apparently bored by any other.  His characters fumble for what to say in a world where any response is either a cliche (and hence dull) or truthful (and hence dull and hurtful).   Despite these complaints, there is certainly nothing in this work that suggests that Martin is not a capable and interesting writer.  There are many valuable and interesting observations of modern life in this book -- often bluntly but accurately drawn.  However, a better example, I think, of the kind of book he wants to write might be Nick Hornby's High Fidelity or About a Boy, both of which take on the kinds of relationship issues Martin is concerned with but strike a better balance between the selfishness of the characters and comedic or satirical elements of the book.
