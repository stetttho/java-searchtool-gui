 Gourevitch's earlier book was such a fine piece of writing and journalism that I had high expectations for this one when I spotted it at a bookstore a couple of days ago.  It should be noted, especially for those shopping on Amazon, that it is a very slim volume.  That they were able to squeeze nearly 200 pages out of the original manuscript says more about the printers, triple spacing and wide fonts that it does about the author's legwork.  I was able to finish it in slightly less than two hours, which makes it an expensive read for the time it takes up.  It is perhaps no coincidence that the story itself seems better suited to a Reader's Digest than a full length book treatment (but then again this is hardly a full length book).  Gourevitch seems motivated to write a sort of hard boiled story about a kid on the wrong side of the law and the dedicated cop who brings him to justice.  He keeps his sentences very short, and his descriptions are limited to characters who look like Bogart and bad guys with ruddy complexions and New York dialects.  Perhaps he was aiming for a sort of genre story, but the format limits him considerably.  The cop's story is hagiographic and the murderer's tale is told with a sympathy that Gourevitch feels compelled to deny.  The capture is embarassingly easy (and points out rather awkwardly that police incompetence might be more responsible for the murderer's time on the lam than his genius) and the subsequent denouement couched in cliches rather than insight. (I cringed at the portrayal of the money grubbing Jewish lawyer who, apparently, performed most of his work in this case for free).   This is not to say that the book is racist, but hackneyed and while the story can hold your interest, it stays disappointingly close the surface.  If you are a fan of the true crime genre, then this might make a quick and interesting read, but certainly Gourevitch is capable of something much deeper and challenging than this.
