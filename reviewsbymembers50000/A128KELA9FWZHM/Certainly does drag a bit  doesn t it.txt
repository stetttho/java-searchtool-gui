 I loved the ending, but maybe that's just because it took me months to  read the middle. I was very excited that it was almost over. I knew who was  who (except for one little bit that wasn't nearly as important as the book  thought it was), I knew who was going to find who and where they would end  up ... yet the book would just keep going, and going, and going. There's  only so much description of pot-scrubbing one person can take.
