 One of the shadowy, half-remembered books in the back of my mind is a big  hardcover in a scratchy green cloth binding, a book called Thursday's Child  by Noel Streatfeild. I despair of ever finding that book again, because  this one, an out-of-print British paperback Amazon found for me after  searching for YEARS, isn't the right story. It has the right characters,  like the lovely Lavinia Beresford and the central Margaret Thursday, but I  fear it has been abridged. With an axe. This is the kind of thing that  makes me want to cry.
