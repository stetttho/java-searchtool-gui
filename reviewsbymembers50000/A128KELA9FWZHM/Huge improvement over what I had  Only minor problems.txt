 These speakers sound amazing in comparison to my PowerBook's built-in speakers, which is what I've been using, and that fills my needs. I'm no audiophile, I don't need 5.1 on my computer, all I need is decent sound for (mostly acoustic) music, DVDs, and World of Warcraft. For the price (same at Amazon as where I bought them) these sound great. Quibbles: I wish the subwoofer level were adjustable without kneeling on the floor. The three cords hardwired into the right speaker are heavy and throw off the balance so the speaker is unsteady on its stand. The speakers do not come with a Y-cable (mini-plug to RCA), even though the instructions refer to one.
