 If I were the author of The Road To Wellville, I don't think I'd print  that on my books. I think I'd just coast on having a wonderful name like  "Coraghessan" to throw around. In any case, 56-0 was sort of  heartbreaking, and Top of the Food Chain barreled down a road I'd always  wondered about, and Big Game I really liked, for being about Hemingway a  little, and Filthy With Things scared the living daylights out of me,  reminding me more than a little of the Stephen King story Quitters, Inc.
