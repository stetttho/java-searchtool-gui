 It's very hard to pick a single favorite CD out of all the music I listen to, but somehow I keep coming back and back and back to Passion Train. No matter the state of my life, I can close my eyes, listen to this CD, and forget (or remember) whatever's going on. I'm a sucker for creative, thoughtful lyrics, and every single song on this album just soars. "Two Faces Have I" sounds like an ancient folk song, even though Bruce Springsteen wrote and released it in 1989, and "Rocky Mountain Side" is as good and angry a love song as I've ever heard. Don't be afraid of the word "bluegrass" -- Salamander Crossing is wonderful.
