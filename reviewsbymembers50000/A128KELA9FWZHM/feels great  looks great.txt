 I get compliments on this stylus all the time. People love to take it from me and just hold it. It truly feels great. I tried literally dozens of different brands and types of styluses (stlyii?) before I decided this was the best one. I don't need one that's four colors of pen and a pencil and a stylus and has a pocket clip. All I need is a stylus that feels right when I write with it. This one is just about perfect. It's much, much heavier than the standard Palm stylus, and it's longer. The orange tip is highly visible against the screen or the backlight; it almost looks like it glows in the dark. And most importantly, the stylus fits exactly into the Palm III stylus slot, and it stays put. The only little quibble I have is that the stylus comes unscrewed a little too easily (there's a reset pin inside), but then again, I come unscrewed easily myself, so I can relate.
