 Remember the animated specials with Edith Ann in them? As much as I adore  Lily Tomlin, as much as the little girl in the huge chair cracked me up,  the Jane Wagner version, the smart, sarcastic, slightly sad little girl  with the big head, is better. Her voice is perfect, and some of the things  she says are things I say, or wish I'd thought of first. "Childhood is  the leading cause of stress among kids my age."
