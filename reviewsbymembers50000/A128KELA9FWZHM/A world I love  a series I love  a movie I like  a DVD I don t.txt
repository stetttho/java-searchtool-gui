 I love the world of Firefly/Serenity and saw the movie on opening night with great joy. I really enjoyed the movie and liked the resolution of the questions the series left hanging. My main disappointment with the film was that it doesn't use the beautiful Firefly series theme song at all. I bought the DVD as soon as I saw it was out. I gotta say, it's a disappointing DVD package. The front cover is so shiny (and not in the Firefly vernacular way) and features an unflattering picture of River way, way too big (the movie, need I repeat, is about Mal). There is NO paper collateral in the DVD--nothing but an ad for Battlestar Galactica. Nothing! I was amazed. There are copious special features on the DVD, but the packaging makes this genuine release look like a bootleg. When I opened it I honestly thought I'd been ripped off somehow.
