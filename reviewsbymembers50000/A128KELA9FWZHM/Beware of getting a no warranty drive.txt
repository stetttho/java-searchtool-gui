 I ordered this drive to replace the one that has just gone bad in my Sony UltimateTV receiver. I was expecting to receive a retail box, with the all-important warranty, but I got a brown box, an OEM product, instead. If the warranty is important to you, buy this drive from a retail store or someplace that guarantees it will not be DOA or offers their own warranty. This drive from Tech Depot ships with no paperwork or retail packaging, just the drive itself in a brown box. The drive itself is fine, but I am disappointed that it wasn't clearly stated it was an OEM product and not full retail packaging.
