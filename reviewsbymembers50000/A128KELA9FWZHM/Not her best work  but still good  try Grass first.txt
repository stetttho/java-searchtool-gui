 It's been a while since I read this, and it just hasn't stayed with me the  way most of her books do. I really loved The Family Tree, and this one's  just not as good as that one was. It has a twist, yes, and I didn't see it  coming (except that there's always always always a twist in her books, so I  was looking for one), but all of a sudden I can sort of see the point of  people who say she writes the same book, about women oppressed by society,  over and over again. No, I don't mean that. I still love them.
