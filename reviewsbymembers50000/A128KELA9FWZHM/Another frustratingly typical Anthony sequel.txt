 I've said it before, and I'll say it again. Piers Anthony books are like  crack. They're everywhere, and once you start, you have to read them all.  It's awful. Because everyone I know who's read them has read them all, and  I suspect almost everyone who reads them reads them all, and yet at least a  third of every one of them is exposition. You can skip whole chunks of any  book that's not the first in a series, and you will miss nothing. It's like  old newspaper serials, where "The Story So Far" would be twice as  long as the new installment. I've been here before. I know these people.  Get on with it. And this is not complicated stuff to begin with. This is  not hard to pick up.
