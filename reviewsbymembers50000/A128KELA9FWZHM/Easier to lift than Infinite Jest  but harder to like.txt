 I would have adored this book, except for two things. One is the character  of Rick Vigorous, and the second is every scene in which he appears. To  misquote and mangle Will Rogers, I have metafiction I didn't like! You can  see the genius that would produce Infinite Jest in certain scenes and  especially in the minor (unfortunately) character of Stonecipher LaVache  Beadsman. He's quite good. The book has other glimmers of joy in it, no  doubt, but all in all I just didn't want to read it very much. What can you  do to suspend your disbelief when you have characters named Judith Prietht  and Candy Mandible?
