 I ordered one of these as a gift for a friend. I expected a product called "The Tingler," and instead I got a product called "Happy's Head Trip." Luckily my friend won't mind, and I don't mind much, but that's a ridiculous name, and if I had known that was what the package I was buying would say, I would have bought another brand.  Secondly, the package I received (one of those plastic blister-packs) was NOT NEW. It had been opened and scotch-taped back together at the bottom. Luckily my friend won't mind, but I do. When buying gifts from Amazon I prefer to get new, unopened products. I will feel like a loser giving this opened package as a present.  I'm sure the head massager is fine, I just wish I'd gotten an unopened one and that it didn't have such a stupid drug reference for a name.
