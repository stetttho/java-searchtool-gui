 Maybe it's just me. Because some people loved this book. I missed the Christ allegory, apparently, and I guess I was wrong about the point of the  story. I wanted to know more about how the communities worked; I was  properly spooked by the assignment of jobs to twelve-year-olds with the  line, "Thank you for your childhood," but I wanted to know what  happened later on. The story seemed to end without ending, and the big  secret revelation was obvious to me from the start. Unpleasant, to be sure,  but hardly surprising.
