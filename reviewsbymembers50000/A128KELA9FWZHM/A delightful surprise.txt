 Douglas Coupland (who coined the cursed term 'Generation X') suffers from  pigeonholing. His writing goes so far beyond inside jokes that appeal to  techies (although he's good at  those) and characters fond of all-night  coding runs and Skittles. He writes about people, and Microserfs made me  laugh and made me cry. And it was wonderful!
