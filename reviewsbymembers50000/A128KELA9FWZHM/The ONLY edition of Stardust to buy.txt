 This oversized illustrated edition is the ONLY edition of Stardust that does the story justice. The pictures are amazing, and even the typography occasionally changes to serve the story. I received this book as a gift several years ago, and I treasure it. I was amazed and disappointed to discover the book was ever released without these illustrations, and that some people actually would only know it that way.
