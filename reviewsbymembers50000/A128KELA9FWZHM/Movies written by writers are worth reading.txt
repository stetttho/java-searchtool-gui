 I'm a sucker for this guy. No, not that guy, not Hugh, but Richard Curtis.  And Tim McInnerny. I liked the movie, of course--otherwise I wouldn't have  bothered reading the screenplay--but the screenplay was better than the  movie. Edited-out scenes, alternate storylines, a very funny afterword,  lovely pictures. Plus the book's printed on just the most wonderful paper.  I'm a sucker for good paper.
