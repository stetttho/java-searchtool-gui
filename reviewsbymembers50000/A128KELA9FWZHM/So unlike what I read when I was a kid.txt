 I liked this quite a bit better than The Giver, but I've been assured I missed some symbolism or something in that book. Holes is full of  sidetracks, little stories that don't seem related, and the whole thing  becomes a bit of a riddle. The good guys win, mostly, and history repeats  itself in the most lovely way, and there's a lot of grownups being very,  very mean, which is always fun to see.
