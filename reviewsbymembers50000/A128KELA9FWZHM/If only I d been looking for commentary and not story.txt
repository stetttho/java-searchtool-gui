 An excellent book, to be sure, and a distant future that leaves one  somewhat discouraged and terrified, and an interesting glimpse into the  workings of a church in isolation, if not exile. But nevertheless a  disappointment. It was recommended to me very highly, and it just never got  to that high point. Nothing really happened. There didn't seem to be any  message, any purpose, any great design. But I do love this, from page 265:  "When the world was in darkness and wretchedness, it could believe in  perfection and yearn for it. But when the world became bright with reason  and riches, it began to sense the narrowness of the needle's eye, and that  rankled for a world no longer willing to believe or yearn." I suppose  that's enough of a comment on religion for any one novel to hope to  accomplish.
