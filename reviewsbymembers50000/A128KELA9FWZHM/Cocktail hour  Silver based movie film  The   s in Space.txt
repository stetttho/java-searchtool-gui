 I first read the Fuzzies books in high school. I was glad to find another  in the series. And it certainly reads like the real Piper. When you read  Jules Verne, you're amazed that a writer a hundred years ago could predict  things like weightlessness. When you read H. Beam Piper, you're amazed that  a writer thirty-five years ago couldn't predict that anything at all would  change. There are so many anachronisms. And then there are quasi-melting  pot names like (get this) Hirohito Bjornsen. Hirohito Bjornsen?!
