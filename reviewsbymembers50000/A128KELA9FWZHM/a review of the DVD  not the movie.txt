 I won't review the movie like everyone else has. I have the same minor quibbles about the movie that everyone else has. I missed Peeves, and I missed the logic puzzle, and I missed Norbert's escape. But the movie isn't what's for sale here. The DVD is. I'm so disappointed in the quality of the DVD that I doubt I will ever watch it again. Not one of the special features works for me. My Sony DVD player will not show them at all, and the special features as well as the DVD-ROM-specific features have never worked on my computers. I'm no technophobe and no idiot; I've tried this DVD in three DVD-ROM drives on three computers, in at least four different pieces of DVD player software, and I have yet to get past Ollivander's without catastrophic crashes and multiple scripting errors. I'm considering buying this movie on VHS so that I can see the extra scenes; I know they're on the DVD, but they simply don't work.
