 Though I took copious notes on reading headers, reporting mail fraud, and  tracing spammers back to their sources, this book solved my problem with  one simple piece of advice. I set a filter in Netscape to shunt any mail  that doesn't have part of my own email address in its "To:" field  into a "low priority" folder, except for a few mailing lists  (like Suck) that I actually want. It works perfectly. The junk e-mail  doesn't clutter up my inbox, and I can get rid of it all with a glance and  a click.
