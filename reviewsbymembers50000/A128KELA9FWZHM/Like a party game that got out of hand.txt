 I like this idea. It amuses me greatly. It amuses me that Dave Barry got  to start, and he named a manatee Booger, and then a whole bunch of other  Floridian authors kept laying traps for each other. The best trap by far  comes in chapter 3, Paul Levine's chapter. Until then, you think the book  is just silly, and then you read his surprise, what he left for Edna  Buchanan to get out from under, and things leave "silly" and  start to turn seriously WACKY.
