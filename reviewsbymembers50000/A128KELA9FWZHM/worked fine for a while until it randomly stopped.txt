 This worked fine for over a year (unpowered) and then one day it just stopped. It hasn't worked since. The LEDs don't even light up. I tried plugging it in (the adapter this comes with is huge and very heavy and unwieldy), but that didn't work either. I'm going to switch to a different brand and a powered hub. This is the only Belkin product I've ever had a bad experience with. I would definitely not buy another Belkin USB hub.
