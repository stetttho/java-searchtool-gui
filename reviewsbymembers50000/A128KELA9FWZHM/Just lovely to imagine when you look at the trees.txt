 I really like the idea of postage stamp-sized windows and doors opening in a huge tree, and tiny people in suction-cup boots walking out and strolling  through the ceiling of the forest. I like the idea of a swan big enough to  carry a not-so-small boy while flying. "And above all, watch with  glittering eyes the world around you because the greatest secrets are  always hidden in the most unlikely places. Those who don't believe in magic  will never find it."
