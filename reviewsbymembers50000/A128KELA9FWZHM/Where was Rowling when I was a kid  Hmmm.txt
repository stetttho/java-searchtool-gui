 I feel lucky that I never outgrew children's books. But then I feel  sorryfor all the people my age (and older) who think they have. I might be  mistaken, but I'm pretty sure that when I was ten or twelve, there weren't  books as perfect as these. There weren't 400-page novels that spoke to me  like a person instead of like a child, with characters who were people and  just happened to be children. There damn well should have been.
