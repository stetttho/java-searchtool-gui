 Ordinarily, almost everything of Neil's gets 5 stars. I love the stories  in this book. I love "Troll Bridge" and "Chivalry" and  "Looking For The Girl." The thing is, I read Angels And  Visitations ages ago, and before that I read a Datlow/Windling anthology or  five, so I've read "Troll Bridge" half a dozen times. And  "Babycakes." And "Virus." And even though this  collection has more stuff in it, and more comments, and I liked "When  We Went To See The End Of The World by Dawnie Morningside, age 11 1/4"  very much, it doesn't make up for it. I want to see the new stuff.
