 I plugged my LightWasher in when I got it, and it worked for about ten minutes before there was a little "zap" and it died. Something inside had burned itself out. ... In any case, despite the immediate failure of the first one, the replacement has worked like a charm. It hasn't been turned off in months, and it illuminates the wall just beautifully. I change the speed/mode of it to suit my mood (it's usually on the very slow color wash), and it's just lovely. More fun than any "normal" nightlight, and it doesn't get hot!
