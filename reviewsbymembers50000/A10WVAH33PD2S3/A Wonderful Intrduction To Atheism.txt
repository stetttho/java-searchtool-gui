 This is a great introduction to atheism and the arguments against theism.It is written in a style that is accessible to most readers without watering down the subjects discussed.  From the first chapter this book is reader freindly.If you have ever read a book that spends chapter after chapter on just a few points,and the only thing you understood was the summarization that took just a few pages or perhaps a few paragraphs, don't worry. This is not one of those books.  Chapter one highlights the opinions of fifty famous people on religion or freedom of conscience.Chapter 2 summarizes what will be discussed in greater detail throughout the book.The topics include: *The origin of the universe-with a great section on "cause and effect" *The miracle of planetary clockwork. *The miracle of life on earth. *Answering creationists arguments. *Can Genesis be reconciled with modern science? *And others.  One shortcoming of the book ,in my opinion,is  the last chapter entitled"Was America Really Founded on Christian Principles?".The chapter is too short to really give any worthwile account of the founding of our country and the religious beliefs of "the founders".Although many were deists,they were also nominally christian in that they belonged to particular churches,even though many did not believe in a literal interpretation of the bible,miracles,etc.  With that one caveat, I highly recommend this book.Whether you are an atheist already,a christian with some doubt, or just have an interest in atheism you will enjoy this book.  *
