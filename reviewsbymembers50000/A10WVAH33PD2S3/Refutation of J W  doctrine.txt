       After reading Crisis of Conscience,I had to read this follow up by Ray Franz.The reading can be a bit tedious but it is well worth the time.        He considers such topics as:  "The channel of God"- The Watchtower Bible and Tract Society's claim to be the one and only channel of god,through which he directs "his" organization and of course disloyalty to the organization is the same thing as disloyalty to god.  "blood transfusions"-what is allowed ,what isn,t,how it has changed over time ,and why men and women would die or risk the lives of their children because they wanted to look to "God's Organization"for answers.  "Legalism"-While they don't want to see it, J.W.'s look to the W.B.T.S. for direction in almost every area of their lives.What type of employment is o.k.? Can I grow a beard? Alternatives to military service is o.k. if a judge orders it ,but not if a draft board does?How many witnesses were disfellowshipped or spent years in prison because of this kind of idiocy?Is sexual foreplay proper?What about oral sex?After a while J.W.'s can no longer make even the most personal decisions without knowing what "The Society" thinks.  "Argumentation and Manipulation"-The society encourages people to have an open mind and not let their ministers or religious authorities decide for them whether or not they will study with J.W.,s.But for J.W.'s themselves, the exact opposite is true.They can't read "apostate" literature,which is anything that questions the j.w. doctrine and the authority of the society.The amazing thing is that they don,t even realize it.  Other topics include disfellowshipping,abuse of authority by elders,the "informant system"(other witnesses are always watching you),the divine name,holidays, and where to go next.  As I said the reading can be tedious, but worth the effort if you are a witness or if you are interested in how an organization like the Watchtower Bible and tract Society can exert so much influence over the lives of people,it is worth the time.  Although he advocates individual responsibility in Christianity,he doesn,t seem to be able to question Christianity itself with the same rigor that he has examined this particular sect.  All in all a good read,and good second step for j.w.s who want to think for themselves.
