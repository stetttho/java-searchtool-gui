 This book absolutely blew me away.The ideas in this book are not new to new testament scholars,but they were certainly new to me. In the introduction to the book the authors state that they wanted to make their ideas accessible to the general reader,rather than writing some dry tome.They accomplished that brilliantly.The book is incredibly interesting and fun to read.  The argument put forward in the book is that the story of Jesus is not the literal biography of a historical messiah,but a myth based on perrenial pagan myths,a Jewish adaptation of the ancient pagan dying and resurrected god-man.As the authors admit "this is certainly not the last word on a complex subject"but it really stimulates the reader to think and re-evaluate what he has always believed.That is what a good book should do.  It has been generally taught that gnosticism was a second century deviation from original christianity.The authors argue that this idea is backwards,that orthodox christianity was in fact a later deviation from gnosticism.Christian gnosticism was basically a synthesis of Judaism and pagan mystery religion. It was meant to be a mystical teaching designed to lead a person to the knowledge(gnosis)that they,too can become a christ(the essential divine nature that we all share-our higher selves).  You don't have to believe in the mystical teaching itself,but there is an abundance of evidence presented to support the idea that that was the original meaning of the story.The authors discuss the lack of any reliable historical evidence for Jesus outside of Christian sources.  The oldest references we have to the Jesus story are in the letters of Paul,where christ is almost always referred to as a mystical dying and resurrected godman.The gospel of Mark was written as a quasi-historical setting to make the story appealing to Jews,who were continually disappointed by failed messiahs,perhaps attempting to give them hope in a mystical messiah.The gospels of Matthew and Luke were written for the purpose of helping their own spiritual communities;they are more recent and both used Mark as a source,while adding the birth and resurrection narratives.These books were not meant to be taken literally as they contradict each other at every turn if you do.The problem is that they were taken literally and the true gnostic tradition was supressed.  This book helped me to realize that I can't just believe something because that is what I've always been taught.For over 18 years of my life I had a fundamentalist,literalist belief in the Bible.After investigating my own denomination of Christianity and finding it authoritarian and bogus,it did not make sense to stop there.I needed to examine the foundations of Christianity itself,and this is where I started.These authors helped me on what I hope will be a life of continual learning and examination and hopefully some measure of freethinking.For these reasons I thank them and encourage you to read this book and think.
