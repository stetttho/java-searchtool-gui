 This book is a great introduction to a study of the four works of myth or fiction that we call the gospels.It is a short book and it is very well written and an easy read.It is not loaded down with long drawn out arguments that make reading a chore - this book was a pleasure to read.  Helms begins by giving the description of a man who lived in the first century and"taught the worship of one true god...the practice of charity and piety and the shunning of hatred and emnity...leading his followers to claim he was the son of God". The similarities to Jesus go on and on including his death and resurrection,then we find out that we are learning about Appolonius of Tyana,who died around 98A.D. Claims such as these were not uncommon in the ancient world, and they certainly were not exclusive to Jesus.  In Helms' view the gospels were not written as historical biographies but as narratives "whose purpose is less to describe the past than to affect the present".In following the consensus of biblical scholars that Mark was the first gospel written, he shows how Matthew and Luke used it as a source for there own gospels.Each of the four gospels was written for a specific religious community with different theoligical purposes behind the writing of each one.When they are held to be inspired of God in makes no sense that they contradict one another,and not only in small details.When one realizes that they were never meant to be a literal recounting of historical events,and that these types of writings were a common form of religious literature,they make much more sense.  This is certainly not the last word on new testament scholarship,but it is a great place to start.I was a Jehovah's witness for eighteen years and took the bible as God's inspired word.If my blind faith can be shaken and I can begin to think for myself anyone can.I highly recommend this book.Others may dispute some of Randell Helms' claims,but he doesn't claim to be inspired of God.
