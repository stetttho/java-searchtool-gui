      This is the first step for any one of Jehovah's witnesses who is struggling with doubt or apprehension about the Wathtower bible and tract society's claim to be "God,s Organization". It is also a great read for anyone interested in the inner workings of a highly controlling religious organization.       Raymond Franz, a former missionary and a former member of the "Governing Body" of jehovah's witnesses has written a compelling,eye opening account of the authority structure of Jehovah's Witnesses and the inluence it had on even the most personal decisions of its members.       I was a J.W. for 18 years and I had served as a ministerial servant twice.I read this book after several years of decreased activity and increased doubt.Once I got up the nerve to buy the book and read it(yes,after 18 years, it can be a struggle to decide for yourself what to read-you wouldn't want another witness to see you reading "apostate literature")I could not put it down.       Raymond Franz does not write with bitterness and hatred, but with calmness,compassion,and at times even sadness.He gives a personal narrative of his life in the organization & how that ended when he could no longer abdicate his freedom of conscience to the W.B.T.S.He recounts the history of the organization and the society's propogandistic version-its organizational origin myth,if you will-that it presents to its members.         When one has spent a lifetime abdicating personal freedom of thought and responsibility to a church or any other organization it can be difficult, first of all to admit that you have been bamboozled.This book was the first step in helping me to break free from the mental and spiritual shackles of jehovah,s witnesses and then from religion altogether.       Please, read this book. Then continue to diligently guard your mental and spiritual freedom,lest you find yourself in the dungeon of some other high control group,cult or literalist religion.
