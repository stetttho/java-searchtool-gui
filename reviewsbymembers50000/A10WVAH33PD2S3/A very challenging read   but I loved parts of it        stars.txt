 The first two chapters are very challenging if you don't have any background in philosophy or physics,While some of the other chapters are very accessible to the avg. reader.In my opinion this is not an introductory book to atheism or the arguments against theism.If you have read some other books of this genre and you enjoy a challenge there is much to like about this book.  Edis begins by showing how the god of the philosophers is such an abstraction that we don't even know what it is we are talking about."Not much to build a religion on" as he puts it.The problem for me was that for much of the chapter I didn't know what he was talking about,although the summarizations helped me out somewhat.  His summarization of evolution was pretty good and I enjoyed this section, but my favorite sections were his summarization of the evolution of the myths of Judaism, Islam, and Christianity.He gives a great synopsis of the latest biblical and New Testament scholarship, Even though he dismisses the Jesus myth theory too easily,I really liked this part of the book.  In his chapter on physics he takes apart the arguments of theists and new agers trying to use science to bolster their claims.He takes on William Lane Craig's Kalam cosmological argument that states that anything that has a beginning must have a cause.Since the universe began to exist it must have been caused and this cause would obviously have to be the god of the bible.How convenient that this argument exempts God from having to be explained by a cause.Edis dismantles these and similar arguments explaining that"the standard big bang is the beginning of spacetime itself,not an event in time" and "the state arising from such a singularity is fundamentally random.At the singularity there is no physical law , no causation; the singularity itself stands uncaused."  His chapter on good and evil and moral values is also very helpful in correcting the notion that without God(whose god?)we can have no ethics or morality and anything would be permissable.If those who claim that the Bible or the Koran contain absolute moral principles would actually read those books we would be better off.They would see what these man-made gods are really like and we could possibly move beyond such silliness.  A difficult read in parts,but all in all I'm glad I bought it and I have referred back to it a time or two already.
