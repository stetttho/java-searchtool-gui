 Richard Elliot Freidman does a good job putting this book together so that it is understandable to non-scholars,like myself.This is a great place to start for those who think the bible is God's infallible word,or for those interested in biblical scholarship.  The evidence points to the bible being written by several different authors in different historical ,political ,and religious contexts.These separate works were combined and edited several times for the same type of reasons.   The book of J(the yahwist)was likely written as a religio-political history in Judah after the kingdom split in two but before Israel was destroyed by Assyria in 722 b.c.e.The E document was probably written during the same time period in Israel.The two were synthesised by an editor after the defeat of Israel by Assyria.The author points out that a likely historical scenario is that the Levites would have brought these writings with them as they fled to Judah.The two documents were similar because the two nations were once one and they shared the same legends,myths,and history.  The same type of process happened with the documents of D(deuteronomist)and P(preistly).The book is written in a style that is accessable though not lively.All in all it was a great introduction to Biblical scholarship.As I read somewhere(I can't remember where now-perhaps in another review)"The bible was writen by men with a political agenda,edited by men with a political agenda,and used to manipulate others by men with a political agenda".
