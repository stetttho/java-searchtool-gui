 K&D have an amazing talent for remixing and mixing the work of others into downtempo dub-alicious stylings.  They draw from works of diverse artists--Lamb, Bone Thugs 'n Harmony, Depeche Mode, Rockers Hi-Fi--and  rework and reconstruct it all together in a seamless voyage of dub, that  ranges from vienneese drum 'n bassanova to dub-reggae to trip-hop.  This  double set improves with repeated and closer listens.
