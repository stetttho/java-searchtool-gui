 Frontside definitely embraces raveland and its phat beats and high powered drugs (track 1).  "L.B.P." and "Evol" are as thumping and as irresistable as want dance tracks to be.  "Kate Moss" and  "Dammerung" hover near the trance vibe successfully.  However,  the remainder of the album tends to drone and requires serious commitment  or heavy intoxication for the full effect.
