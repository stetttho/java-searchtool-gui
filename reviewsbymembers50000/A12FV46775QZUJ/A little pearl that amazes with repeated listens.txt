 It's a recipe that really isn't that new--lay down driving breakbeats and loops, add psychedelica production sensibilities, and drop some bizzare hip-hop/poetic-type vocals--and you have "How to Operate..."   Like the Chemical Brothers, Fat Boy Slim, and their big beat brethren, the  lo-fidelity All Stars have been heavily influenced by hip-hop and  electronic music.  The beats generally lack the rave/arena style bombast  (with the exception of "Laser Sheep Dip"), but they are complex  and interesting.  However, what sets this album apart are the vocals, which  are at times funny, brutal, silly, preachy, over-the-top, and insane.  It  is clear that the lead vocalist with his snarling, slurring English drawl  has done his fair share of intoxicants--so, it is hard to take him  completely seriously.  But this album is not going to change you  life...rather, it's meant to bob that head, perk that hear, and shake that  bum.
