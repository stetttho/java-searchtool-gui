 Artists have been trying to splice drum 'n bass with other genres of music for some years now.  Three years ago, Lamb emerged with a minimalistic soulful hybrid that had truly amazing moments but at other times seemed  awkward with crooning lyrics combined with scattershot beats.  With Fear of  Fours, Lamb has toned down much of the fast beats into a jazz noir/dark  step marvel.  Often the lyrics can be over-the-top, but the album flows  smoothly with more coherence than the debut.  Differences include more  well-timed jazz instrumentation and voice tinkering (a la Portishead).
