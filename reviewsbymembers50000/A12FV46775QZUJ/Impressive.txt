 A marriage of hip-hop and drum 'n bass that actually works.  Typically, such experiments (which sound fine on paper) sound lackluster on vinyl.  Hell's Kitchen (like the name implies) is definitely a NY album with Big  Apple influences...but it does have a tripadelic appeal like similar  releases from across the pond.  Furthermore, it is a dynamic album that  keeps the listener's attention with thickets of meaty beats and mad-bombin'  MCing.
