 Probably, one the most anticipated albums of the decade, The Fragile had a lot to live up to in hype and to its predecessors.  It has the trademark howls, brooding mumbles, distorted guitars, ambrasive drum loops, et.al.   However, musically the album is very inventive with interesting sounds and  rhythms.  The lyrics are often as very poppy (which is OK, when done  right).  Its harshness and its accessibility make the album a  success--particularly in rock music world starved for exceptional works.   In the angry guitar music scene full of Limp Bizkits (with startlingly  immature lyrics and riffs), its nice to find a hard, vicious, and mature  album that can still uplift.
