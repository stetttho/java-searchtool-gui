 Orbital (deservedly) has the chops as the probably the finest electronic band in the world.  Their works border on compositions with interwoven layers and melodies.  Middle... continues in that tradition but is a  significant drop off from In Sides and definitely from Orbital 2.  The  album begins like a coronation but muddles until to the visceral and  outstanding "I Don't Know You People".  Unfortunately, the album  returns to unspectacular.  Luckily, their skill means that this listener  will buy anything they produce and will gladly see any live show that comes  through town.  From a lesser DJ/electronic artist(s), this album would make  a career.  Too bad, Orbital has such high standards to live up to.
