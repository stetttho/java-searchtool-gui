 Smith & Mighty date back before Massive Attack diaspora and are probably just as valuable.  This DJ Kicks installment starts with reggae/trip-hop aesthetic and flows into bouncy dub-hop and finally slides  into smooth, soulful jungle.  Easily, one of the best DJ Kicks collections.   It's a shame that they fell out with their record company and have  subsequently missed the trip-hop renaissance/gravy-train.  For any listener  who wants accessible, diverse bass 'n beats--this album will not  disappoint.
