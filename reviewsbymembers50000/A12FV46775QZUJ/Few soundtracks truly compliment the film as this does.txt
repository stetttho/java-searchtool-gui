 If you have seen the film, then you know about this soundtrack--which is really made for and by the film.  The beats and loops are fast and adrenaline-fueled.  It is fun, fairly intelligent, and entertaining--much  like the film.  My only criticism is that, the album is essentially  different mixes (albeit good ones) of the same four tracks.
