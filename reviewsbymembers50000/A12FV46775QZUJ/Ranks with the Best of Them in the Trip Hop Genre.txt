 Move over Blue Lines, Dummy, and Maxinquaye, you have company in the Trip Hop Album Hall of Fame.  Making Bones is jazz-ier and drum 'n bassier than its brethren.  The bass and drum loops are heavy, sharp, and striking.  MC  Det (MC-ing on 3 tracks)and Allison David (crooning achingly on 2 others)  seem born for this style of music.  All together, the atmosphere is smooth,  brooding, and dynamic.
