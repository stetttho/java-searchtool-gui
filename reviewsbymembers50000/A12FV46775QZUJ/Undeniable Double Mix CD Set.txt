 Like the DJ Kicks Series, the Global Underground collection is a near can't miss for underground electronica.  Nick Warren drops and flows through progressive trance, techno, ethno, electro, and acid house with  grace and ease...the beats and loops are diverse, eclectic, and infectious.   Nick has got skills, nice production sensibilities, and great taste in  music.  I can't see him being without a DJ gig anytime in the immediate  future...which is a good thing.
