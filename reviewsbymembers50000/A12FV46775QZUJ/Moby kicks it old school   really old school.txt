 The Godfather of Modern American Electronic Dance Music, Moby has never shied away for pushing the envelope.  When the rave scene became a "scene", he drifted back to his hard rock roots (with varying  success).  As what many call a return, he releases this dance-y gem with  heavy deep delta blues influences.  Mixing gospel and blues samples with  sheened beats and loops and dropping in the occassional organ and guitar,  he has dropped one of the most novel and likable albums of the decade.   Some may have disdain for its accessibility and catchiness, but its appeal  and creativity are undeniable.
