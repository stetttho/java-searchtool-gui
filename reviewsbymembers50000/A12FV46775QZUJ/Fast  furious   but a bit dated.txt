 If you want to catch an idea of how fast the electronic/dance genre keeps shifting and changing and eating its own...then you should buy this box set and the Global Underground--Sasha set in Ibiza.  The former represents  early rave past and the latter represents dance floor's future.  Tony can  mix extremely well, but this double CD package contains synth-loops and  effects that may seem obselete in today's dance culture.  That is not to  say that it is not enjoyable...it is, but the emergence of progressive  trance through other artists (Oakenfold, Sasha, Warren, Digweed, et.al)  have succeeded in mixing the loop and beat science of Orbital with dance  floor sensibilities.  As a result, when you listen to this box set, the  listener may get a little nostalgic.
