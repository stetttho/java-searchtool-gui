 Midnite Vultures features alot of the same qualities as Odeelay--tripafied lyrics, alt-rock leanings, scratching, and electronic sampling and looping.  However, Midnite's subject matter is more adult--with Beck's quirky take  on the intimacies.  Also, he lets some of his influences come through with  nods to the Stones and Prince (his falsetto is strong).  He's the  post-modern poster-boy shaped by alternative rock, electronic, and hip-hop  genres.  As always, his stuff is never really heavy, but his skill and  creativity are very serious.  In the end, Midnite has growing, crawling  appeal with repeated listens.
