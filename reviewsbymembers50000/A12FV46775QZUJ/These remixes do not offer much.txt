 Let me first state that I am a Thievery Corporation fan, but this is an incredibly underwhelming CD.  Most of the remixes do not really take the listener anywhere and do not significantly modify (or  "reconstruct" or "abduct") the original recordings.  If  you want to enjoy Thievery Corporation, then purchase "Sounds of the  Hi-Fi" or the "DJ Kicks Compilation".  If you want to hear  creative remixes of other artists, then buy Kruder & Dorfmeister.
