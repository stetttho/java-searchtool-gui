 Kid Loco brings an ambient/trip-hop/acid jazz/edgy audio trip with this DJ Kicks installment.  In fact, it is very difficult to define his schtick--and that is probably the finest compliment you can pay to this  album.  This mix provides a sort of gooey, funky, artsy background  soundtrack to chilled-type indoor activities.  It definitely requires  additional listens and a worthy sound system to guage its true value.
