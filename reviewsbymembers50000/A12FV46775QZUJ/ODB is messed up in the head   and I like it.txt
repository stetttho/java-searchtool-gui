 Hip-hops critics always fault the genre's lyricism that can be misogynist, violent, and thuggish...well, "Ni@@a Please" is all of that and more...so, if ya gonna play in the gutter, ya better be good at it...and  ODB is that.  While other MCs may come of menacing, it's hard to truly take  ODB all that seriously...because he's a lunatic.  He's part Flava Flav,  part Biz Markie...but he can more than carry his weight on his own album.   The beats are simple and a little retro.  The rhymes are bizarre and  over-the-top.  All in all, it's a freak show...
