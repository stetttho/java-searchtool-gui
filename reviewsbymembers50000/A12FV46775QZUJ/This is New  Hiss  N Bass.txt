 Crackles, sparks, pops, hisses, and static farts generally provide the percussion throughout this truly interesting album.  Definitely background music, Pole 2 pulls its influences (barely) from dub and at times ragga (to  even lesser extent).  It's surprisingly minimalist and sparce but still  manages to create an dense aesthetic.
