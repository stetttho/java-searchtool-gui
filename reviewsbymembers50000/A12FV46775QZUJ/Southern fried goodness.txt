 By the middle of second track "Return of the Gangsta", the listener realizes that this is one of the best hip-hop albums ever.  When you hear: "let's talk about time-travelin', rhyme-javelin',  mind-unravelin'--get down!", you understand that Outkast is engaged in  a battle for the ear and the soul.  This album is funky as James Brown's  works, lyrical-deft as Rakim in his glory, catchy as L. Hill's solo joint,  and psychedelic as G. Clinton's (who cameos) funkadelic trip.  The  production pushes conventional limits but still retains accessibility.  The  rhymes are truthful, playful, inspring, and exceptional.  It is great to  see the diversification of Southern hip-hop that provides meaning and  gravity beyond the Master P onslaught.  Even if you are not from the  Dirty-South, you have to root for this duo and applaud their success.
