 RATM's explosion onto the music scene ushered in the unfortunate rise of nu-metalists (e.g. Limp Bizkit) who tap into that pit of despair called surburban angst.  It can be argued that the Beastie Boys really made all of  this happen.  But that does not take away the value of the band--we can't  discredit the brilliance of Nirvana because of the worthlessness of  Candlebox.  However, where the Korns of world stop, is where RATM begins.   RATM has a sense of seriousness, credibility, and sincerity that the  johnie-come-latelies do not.  While being highly politically charged in  lyrics, multi-ethnic in make-up, and uncompromisingly hard in sound, RATM  distinguishes itself from the pack.  This album has more features of a  successful band (great production, electronic tweeking, etc.), and it does  succeed beyond "Evil Empire", but it does not surpass the group's  debut.  Nonetheless, it is a fine, smart, and hard piece of work.
