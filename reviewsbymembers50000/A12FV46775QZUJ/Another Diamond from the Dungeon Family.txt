 Goodie Mob, like Outkast, changes styles with each release...for artists with a good sense of success, that's downright ambitious and courageous.  Goodie Mob and Outkast are essentially modern day Clinton Mother Ship  Captains--just as funky, just as creative, just as freaky (check the album  jacket).  "World Party" is just that, a world party that is  pan-global funk with ignant flow and rhymes, but it still keeps that  down-home realness (Track 5 features a flossin' Goodie Mobster trying to  wine-'n-dine a shorty at the Waffle House).  The beats are pretty simple,  but they really kick.  The flow is, as always, greasy-grimey good  (especially Cujo's).  Other artists might rest on the same style, but it's  nice to see Goodie Mob take some chances.
