 The Roots have the distinction as hip-hop's best live act, and there really isn't a close second.  On "Things Fall Apart," the Roots have finally produced a complete album that can touch the magic of their  live performances.  The production is straightforward yet ambituous (which  is odd for the Roots).  The rhymes, as always, are pure and well-meaning.   Furthermore, the album features the massive single with E. Badu and cameos  from the present and future star Mos Def.  One of the best albums from  1999.
