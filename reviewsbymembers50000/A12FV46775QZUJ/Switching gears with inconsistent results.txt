 Tricky has reshaped his music again...manifesting into a twisted NYC version of Bristol trip-hop--stressing more on the hop than the trip.  Juxtapose is courageous but not ambitious nor brilliant.  Those accustomed  to Marthine will be fantastically disappointed as she is not on this  release.  Instead, we have guest-producers and guest MCs who add dubious  value.  "Contradictive" shines as the albums best track, but  tracks "She Said" and "I Like the Girls" are  dumbfoundingly silly or stupid (particularly lyrically).  Tricky appears to  be reaching and clawing for meaningful lyrics--which started to show on  Angels with Dirty Faces--how much more can he pine about his record deal?   When compared to his earlier works, Juxtapose falls horribly flat and  uninspired.
