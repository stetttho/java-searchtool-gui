 Some viewers think that this is a British take on the "Pulp Fiction" aesthetic, but it is much more than that.  But there are quite a few parallels.  The lead foursome are extremely likable, and the supporting cast of characters are incredibly entertaining.  The writing is  hip, hilarious, and truly intelligent.  The storyline is fairly complex and  well-crafted.  The camera work (in several scenes) is really engaging.   Gets better with repeated viewings.  With this price, they're giving it  away--"it' a deal, it's a steal, it's a sale of the century"
