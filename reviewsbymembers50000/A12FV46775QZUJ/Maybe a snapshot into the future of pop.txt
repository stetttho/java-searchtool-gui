 On paper this sounds really promising--DJ Die (jungle phenom), Roni Size (junglist with shrewd pop/jazz sensibilities), and Leonie Laws (a brooding, forthright singer in vain of Shirley Manson of Garbage).  In fact that is  what "Ultra-Obscene" (which it is not really that obscene) sounds  like--crossing jungle with the vocal stylings and lyrics of Garbage.   Leonie has the perfect pop/alt cadence to sing over jungle, and her style  is a welcome contrast to the typical diva-esque crooning over atmospheric  drum 'n bass.  Most of the time, it works wonderfully.  However, the  longlasting influence may from the catchiness of Size's and Die's stark and  rich beats programming, that may seap into the mainstream music conscious.
