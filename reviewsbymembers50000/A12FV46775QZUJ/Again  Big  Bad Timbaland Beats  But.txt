 When "Supadupa..." dropped, its effect was sweeping and powerful.  The world was brought a tough yet vulnerable singer/mc and a drop-step, staccato style of futuristic beats and loops.  Missy is a  welcome blast of fresh air, because she was honest, multi-talented,  inventive, and she did not look like the b-girl/singer template.  She  proved that a female hip-hop/pop star did not need to be slim and fine nor  absurdly rugged and thuggish.  In addition, her videos were about the most  visually engaging works of the decade.  However, there are two things  troubling about this album.  1.) With the "Da Real World", we  have nice, bouncy, catchy beats...but we have lyrics that are often  senseless.  Missy rhymes quite abit about "money, clothes",  ...etc.  Word to Missy--"We know you're rich, now!  Why are asking  fellas to buy you things?  You're can more than do for yourself."   Crass materialism undermines hip-hop's power and focus, and, on this album,  we get ridiculous, materialistic drivel in buckets.  2.) Missy's skills  complement different types of artists.  On this album, she partners up with  Redman, Da Brat, Eminem, et. al.  In fact, there are few songs where she  does not perform a duet--which begs the question, can she not stand on her  own?  Missy is a talent, but this album comes woefully short of the impact  and grace of the debut.
