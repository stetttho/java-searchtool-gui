 db, whom I respect and admire crazily, has released a collection of alternative drum 'n bass tracks.  His selection does not represent anything catchy or dancefloor-friendly for that matter, but it does display some new  and sometimes interesting directions.  If you have taste for the  avant-garde or different, then you'll be intrigued by some of what you  hear.  If your mind is pinned to the two-step/deep bass synth of club  jungle, then you'll be sorely disappointed.
