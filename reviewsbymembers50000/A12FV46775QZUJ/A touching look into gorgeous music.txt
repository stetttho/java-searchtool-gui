 Buena Vista (the modern day adaptation) occured by happenstance (as the film shows)...and thank god.  Even in Cuba, this genre of music was all but forgotten.  It is pure, ornate, romantic, heartful, ernest, and downright  beautiful.  We also get to meet the wonderful people behind the music and  see them live out their dreams and aspirations.  This journey is as  heart-wrenching as it is uplifting...a must see.
