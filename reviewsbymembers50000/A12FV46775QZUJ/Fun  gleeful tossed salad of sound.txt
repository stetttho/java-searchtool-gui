 Typically, when bands get ambitious and try to blend diverse genres into one sound, they fail.  Ozomatli walk the Latin path, the hip-hop path, the ska path, the jazz path, and even the psychedelic path...fortunately they  do it all well.  Ozomatli succeeds because they do not try to do it all in  each track.  One song will feature rhymes from Charlie Tuna of Jurassic 5;  another song will flow into bouncy-happy meringue; while another will drop  a doleful crooning ballad.  It all seems to mix together without being  disjointed.  In the end, it is one of the best feel-good albums of 1999.
