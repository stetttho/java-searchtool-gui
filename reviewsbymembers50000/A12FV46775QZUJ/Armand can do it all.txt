 2 Future 4 U is not really too future for you...it's actually fairly standard electronic/dance fare.  Tracks bounce from straight ahead techno to house to hip-hoppy big bounce.  Not all tracks come off like magic, but  Armand is probably one of the most competent DJs in the world...so he gets  much love
