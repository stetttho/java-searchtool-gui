 Another exceptional installment from the DJ Kicks collection...Rockers Hi-Fi is probably one of the least diverse of the DJ Kicks, sticking mainly to dub-reggae.  But if that is your bag, then this is an outstanding album.   Vocal contributions by Farda P are always welcome and kick the album  "uppa proppa like" to a higher level of trip hop massive.
