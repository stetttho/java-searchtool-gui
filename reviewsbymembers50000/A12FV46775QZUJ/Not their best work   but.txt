 Stereolab is special, and their sound can command attention or can be excellent background music.  Cobra is even more subtle and more simplistic than Dots and Loops, but it lacks the sheer kitchy catchiness of Emperor.   Still, this is a fine mood music album that does succeed in ambience where  it may fail in freshness.
