 An excellent hard mix of drum 'n bass...it does not offer the entire spectrum of drum 'n bass, but keeps the bpms and adrenaline high.  The mixing is top notch and smooth (as one would expect from one the world's  best jungle duos).  "Trauma", "Clear Skyz", and  "Pressure" stand out.  It is a tragedy regading Kemistry's  death...she will be missed.
