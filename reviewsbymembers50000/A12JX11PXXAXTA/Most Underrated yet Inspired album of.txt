 Navy Blues is a classic Canadian album fusing many styles together.  This album almost depresses me because it has unrealized potential, especially in Britian.  Fortuantely, for people who have heard Navy Blues, we are a privileged bunch. The first single "Money City Maniacs" is a powerful song with a chorus that is catchier than the common cold and harder to cure. One listen and you will be hooked on Sloans sound. Another definite stadout track is the Beatles esque "C'mon, C'mon, were gonna get it started" which would have easily been a huge hit back in the sixties, yet Sloan is able to revive that sound and make it fresh. The second single "She says what she means" which also begins the album has an infectuous rock sound to it.   There are no stale tracks on Navy Blues.  Some albums are only good for one or two songs, other albums are good all the way through because they are conceptual.  Navy Blues can serve both voids.  Make an investment on Navy Blues, and pump the stereo loud, and be proud you are one of the few who are priveliged enough to experience the most inspired band in Canada and beyond.
