 Animals is arguably the smartest album ever created.  Animals was released in a crucial time in music...the breaking through of punk.  The Sex Pistols were just becoming noticed, and punk was seen as a revolution of music. ....  Animals is the "punk rock" album for Pink Floyd.  Sure, each song is very lengthy, apart from the beautiful love ballad "Pigs on the Wing" which begins and ends the album, but the content of Roger Waters lyrics bear extreme socialist views and critique of society.  The album is obviously a parody of George Orwell's classic novel "Animal Farm".   I wont go into the philosophical meaning of the novel or album, just read and listen to them, but the songs themselves stand as truly powerful, emotional, and most importantly: real. Dogs is a 17 minute frenzied masterpiece, blending David Gilmours guitar trickery and Waters direct lyrics, such as "And after a while, you can work on points for style, like the club tie, the firm handshake, a certain look in the eyes and an easy smile"  The critique gets more direct still on Pigs (3 different ones) when Waters says "Hey you Whitehouse,ha ha, charade you are...trying to keep our feelings off the street" which was a shot at censorship activist Mary Whitehouse. With the powerful lyrics that Waters conveys, its easy to see why Animals is one of, if not the most clever album ever; lyrically speaking.  Anyone who has not listened to Animals cannot call themselves informed.  This album intelligently combines the euphoric sound that is the Floyd, with lyrics that are not only listenable, but serve as a lesson in life.
