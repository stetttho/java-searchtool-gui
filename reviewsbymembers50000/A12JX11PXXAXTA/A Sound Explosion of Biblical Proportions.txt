 To put it frankly, "Second Coming" will send you to outer edges of the universe and back.  You will find yourself caught in a cosmic swirl of sound, raw emotions, and beauty, and best yet, the journey will last over 70 minutes! "Breaking Into Heaven" is an 11 and a half minute epic which starts the journey. It begins with an array of jungle sounds and tribal drumming, then we hear John Squires blistering guitar, as it enters deep inside the soul to soothe the wounds. There is no experience quite like it.  The journey than takes a turn through "Driving South" where Squires guitar is once again loud and raw.  Ten Story Love Song, Tightrope, and Your Star Will Shine are beautiful acoustic bases songs, and Ian Browns vocals are as good as ever.  "Tears" has a "Stairway to heaven" structure, and "Love Spreads" is a solid contender for single of the year. Fans of the earlier album, which is brilliant, will appreciate "Breaking into heaven", and the manic charged danceable "Begging You".  Essentially Squire was the dominant force on the album, but Brown and co. also produce stellar performances.   The title in itself is bolder than anything Oasis has ever done, and remember the Roses came first!  Conclusively, the recipe for "Second Coming" is a pinch of sarcasm, a load of sonic distorted guitar, and a hint of lovely lyrics. Put in a blender and serve loud.  Top it off with some nice headphones.  Mmmm....delicious
