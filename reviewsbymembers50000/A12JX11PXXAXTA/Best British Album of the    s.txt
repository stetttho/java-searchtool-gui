 What more can be said about Blur's third effort? Thier previous efforts (Leisure, Modern Life is Rubbish) helped to strengthen thier name, especially with such singles as Chemical World and Theres No Other Way.  However, its the infectuous eighties new wave inspired single "Girls and Boys" that gave Blur thier claim to fame. Parklife blends a myriad of musical and poetical influences and then releases a monumental, emotional symphony out of the speakers.  "To the End" is quite possibly the best love song ever written and composed "You and I collapsed in love..." is a brilliant piece of prose.  At times emotions fill the room (End of a Century, This is a Low, Badhead) and other times raw energy spews out of the speakers (Bank Holiday, Lot 105, Jubilee). Lyrically speaking, Parklife could very well replace any poetry youve read.  Tracy Jacks is a confused individual who decides to leave home because, in Damons words "He knew in his heart he was over".  Theres the evocative "And on the malinhead, Blackpool looks blue and red, and the queen...shes gone round the bend, jumped off lands end" from "This is a Low" and the at times humorous portrayel of everyday life in Britian (Parklife, Bank Holiday).  Couple these lyrics with the genious of Graham Coxens guitar and his swift chord changes and you have a masterpiece. Unfortunately many people see Blur only for "Song 2" which is a tragedy. Parklife is the precise definition of Blur before being bastardized by the North American music media and is a terrific album from start to finish.
