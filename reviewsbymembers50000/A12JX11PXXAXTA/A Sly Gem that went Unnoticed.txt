 I have often found myself bored and cynical with new music because 95% of it is generic. Once in a while a special album comes along and completely changes my faith. Radioheads "Ok Computer", Blurs "Parklife", the self titled Stone Roses and recently Kent "Isola". The magic of this album comes from its ability to sooth the wounds inside. Its the kind of rare occurence that comes around once in a while, just when you thought things could not get any worse. It completely restores faith in new music, and keeps us wanting more.  Isola has almost too much good material, ranging from, dare I say it, mainstream radio tendencies (If you were here, Bianca) which are infectuous songs that should deserve plenty of attention, but never did in North America. "Before it all Ends" is an ecclectic masterpiece that wholeheartedly consumes the listener into a black hole of emotion.   One phrase to sum up Isola: A large monumental sound. The finale "747" breaks into a 5 minute frenzy of guitar feedback and heartpounding drums...yet Kent has the ablity to make it all so gentle. Each song has unrealized potential. There is a tension present, the listener can sense a cresendo of sound building, building, and exploding shards of sonic guitars, lyrics, and then the next song begins nice and quiet again. Now parallel that to a roller coaster. There are the giant rises, free falls, and when the ride is finished we all want more. The only disadvantage Kent has is the lack of exposure to the masses. Perhaps it is better this way because something this rare and special should belong in the archives of great albums...not as a forgotten commodity as something remembered in Billboard with Mariah Carey et al.
