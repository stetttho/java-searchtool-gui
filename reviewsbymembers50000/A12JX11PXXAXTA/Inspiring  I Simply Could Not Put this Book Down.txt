 One summer day I found myself to be extremely bored, so I ventured to my local bookstore hoping to find something worth reading. Suddenly, a book caught my eye, that being "Prison Writings" The grey cover blended in with the shelves, yet the book stood out on its own. I immediately picked it up. It took me about 4 hours to read. I began to think long and hard, it only took four hours to give me a completely different perspective on life, thanks to the inspiring accounts of Leonard Peltier. Peltier has experienced horror, disappointment, racism, and stripped of his rights, yet this book has an uncanny sensitivity to it, he is not bitter. Rather, he accounts his shortcomings extensively with a tone of hope throughout the book. Peltier goes into great detail about the fateful June 26 1975 on his Pine Ridge reservation. He was led to escape by following an eagle, showing the spirtuality of the Natives that is often supressed. He also discusses the coercion of the FBI which eventually led to his arrest, and instead of being bitter, he shares his pain with the families of the killed FBI agents. This token of character demonstrates how courageous Peltier is, and why he is a hero to many. Unfortunately former President Clinton refused to pardon Peltier, which is yet another disappointment. Yet he still has hope and shows great appreciation to his fellow supporters. Simply put: "Prison Writings" is a detailed and enlightening account of the life of Leonard Peltier. Furthermore, it reveals his indestructible character and love for his people. Instead of writing a book to complain (which too many people do) he stays bold, strong, courageous, and hopeful of the future of himself and his people, therby making him a hero and his book an inspiring and unique read.
