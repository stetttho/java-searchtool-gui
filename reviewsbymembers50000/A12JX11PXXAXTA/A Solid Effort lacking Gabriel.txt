 A Trick of the Tail is Genesis' first effort without Peter Gabriel.  Many hardcore fans, myself included, saw this as the end of Genesis.  Despite those testimonies, this album went on to sell more than all of Gabriels work combined.    Genesis had been looking for someone to fill Gabriels void, so Phil ended up taking over the duties.  His voice is very reminiscent of Gabriel, this was an obvious ploy to not alienate the fans.     The album opens heroically with "Dancing on a Volcano", which has all of the elements of a good progressive rock song, followed by the gentle "Entangled".  Other standouts include "Ripples" and "Robbery, Assault, and Battery" which some would say Phil did to Genesis.     Still, the album has Gabriel influence written all over it with such lyrics as "the sack across my back, the sound of sobbing on my shoulders, i opened up the sack,and all that I had was a pool of tears" from "Squonk" and "Sail, sail away, ripples never come back" from "Ripples".   Perhaps its correct to say Genesis went from a premier progressive rock act to a pop group when Collins took over the ship, but this album is a very credible "fake" and still contains the best elements of early Genesis.
