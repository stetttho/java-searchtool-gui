 The majority of Floyd fans tend to overlook this album, and for good reason. During this period in their careers (1969) the effects of Syd Barrett departing the group and spinning inevitably into madness due to his LSD excesses were on Floyd's mind.       Ummagumma is an odds and ends album, nothing but pointless noise that goes nowhere fast.  Each member contributed a muscial piece to disc 1, starting with Richard Wrights 3 part "Sysyphus" which meanders aimlessly.  Add to that Masons "The Grand Viziers Garden Party" and one quickly learns that this is not a party, but rather a funeral.        Granted, Waters "Grantchester Meadows" is a mellow little guitar based song with ecclectic lyrics such as "In the lazy water meadow, I lay me down, all around me golden sunflakes settle on the ground". Nice.  However this is quickly fogotten once "Several Smalll Species...." is heard, which cleverly, yet annoyingly mixes animal sounds, particularily those of the small furry type.      The Floyd themselves knew this album was a tragedy, so they opted to include a live disc so purchasing the album wouldnt be a complete waste.  "Astronomy Domine" has a nice freak out section, not to mention the screams of "Careful with that Axe Eugene".  That aside, the live disc does not do full justice to this album.    The Floyd are a timeless rock act with plenty of great material from all thier eras, but this album clearly shows the lack of imagination and direction of the band at that time.
