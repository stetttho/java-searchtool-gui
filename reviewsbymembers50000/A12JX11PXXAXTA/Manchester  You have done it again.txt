 Teacher:"Attention Class, i have here a prism that separates light. Can anybody tell my why?...Yes jonny?" Student: We shouldnt attempt to analyze it, why can we not just enjoy its beauty?" Teacher: Because in the real world we use logic...hey! dont put your headphones on in my class!! What is this....the doves, lost souls, thats it, detention after class. The Doves first offering in "Lost Souls" has earned its bragging rights and if fully deserving of belonging in the annals of brilliant Manchester music with the likes of Stone Roses, Oasis, and the Smiths. Inspired by the Beastie Boys, the former members of Sub Sub picked up their guitars and masterfully crafted 12 songs worthy of praise.  "Firesuite" gently introduces the album by blending guitar and synth. effects to create a credible Pink Floyd, dark side era sound.  "Here it Comes" and "Catch the sun" are happy singalongs that will have your toes tapping all day, and "sea song" is a seemingly mystical journey into the unknown depths of the deep. It is one of lifes greatest experiences to find a new group that invokes so much emotion and energy into an offering. I compare this album with a prism. Upon first appearence, its beautiful and appealing. Then upon further discovery and curiousity you notice it refracts light and separates it into a spectrum of color. A physicist who thinks rationally would attempt to describe the patterns, but an emotional thinker would just appreciate it for its everlasting mysteriousness and beauty. The key to "Lost Souls" is to relax, preferably with headphones, and drift along with the album as it takes you on a multicoloured voyage.  Dont analyze the seemingly simple lyrics, such as "catch the sun, before its gone" but rather enjoy the emotions that arise. Make the sacrifice for this offering, it will be worth your while to escape from reality.
