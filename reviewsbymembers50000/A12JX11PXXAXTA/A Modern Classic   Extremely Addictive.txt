 What more can be said about this self titled review?  This album is absolutely perfect from the beginning to the end.  There is absolutely no filler and each song can stand on its own. The album opens heroically with "I Wanna Be Adored" and only hints at what is to come.  "She Bangs the Drums" is pure bliss from start to finish, not to mention the infectuous "Waterfall" with a guitar riff that would put AC/DC to shame. Theres the psychedelic "Don't Stop" which slowly crawls from out of your speakers, not to mention "This is the One" which is a great sing along. More importantly than the songs themselves is the feel of the entire album as a whole. Its the perfect sound to uplift your spirits.  Reni's drumming is fast paced and very danceable, not to mention John Squire's guitar work, which is most prominent and worthy of praise on "I am the Resurrection", in which he goes on a 5 minute tangent of guitar trickery and effects.  The self titled stands out on its own because of its fresh melodic approach and is worth investing in because its very catchy, yet it doesnt repeat itself.   Simply put: it was released in 1989, yet its still as fresh and relevent today as it was then.  This album will never get old and tired.
