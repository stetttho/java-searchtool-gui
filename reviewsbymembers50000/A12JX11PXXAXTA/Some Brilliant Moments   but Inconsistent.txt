 Mansuns "Little Kix" sets itself apart from their previous efforts because it focuses in on a more romantic theme.  Songs like "Soundtrack for 2 Lovers" and "Love is...." are lyrically good but at times may seem too sappy for the average listener.  Longtime Mansun fans will appreciate this album because it does have some highlights such as the brilliant first single "I can only disappoint you" which is slightly reminiscent of "New Years Day" by U2.  The first track "Butterfly...A New Beginning" has a slow build up and contains some great lyrics such as "Correcting all my faults with prescription medicine" and "So I go to work and smile, and Im happy with myself", which are more sarcastic than anything Radiohead has ever done.  The second single "Electric Man" is an uplifting ballad and "We are the Boys" has a great chorus that would serve as a great pub song.   All in all "Little Kix" is a good album, but its just not something I would recommend to a first time Mansun listener.  So if you have heard or own other Mansun material...then definitely invest in this. If you are new to Mansun...invest in "Attack of the Grey Lantern" or "Six" first.  Both are tremendous musial accomplishments.  Its hard for "Little Kix" to succeed their previous efforts...but "Little Kix" is still one of the better releases of the year.
