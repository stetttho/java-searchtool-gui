 "And out come the Wolves" is one of the most powerful albums of all time. It possesses raw energy and positivity, each song carries a message to take to heart.  "Maxwell Murder" opens up the album..or should I say kick starts the album. It has a furious bass solo and a relentless beat to it.  "Roots Radicals" is a classic punk rock anthem with the classic lyric "Give em the boot, the roots radicals...give em the boot, ya know Im a radical" and the infectuous first single "Time Bomb" which accidently caught on in the mainstream.  "And Out come the Wolves" accomplished so much with so little that Madonna attempted to sign Rancid onto her label...but staying true to themselves, they opted to stay with Epitaph. This made them heroes within the punk community.  But enough about useless facts..the album speaks louder than that. It covers topics ranging from homeless/socialist issues in "As Wicked" and racial barriers as found in "Avenues and Alleyways" which has the positive message "Hes a different colour, but we're the same kid...ill treat him like my brother and he will treat me like his" or the powerful "The inner cities screaming black and blue..the power and the passion of a million youth" With 19 songs, there is almost too much material.  Rancid is an intelligent group with open minds..something lacking nowadays in music. They dare to experiment at times, and it always turns out great.  One listen to "And Out come the Wolves" (punk fan or not) will inspire you to think for yourself.  Anyone who seriously claims they are musically informed should own this album.  It is THAT good.
