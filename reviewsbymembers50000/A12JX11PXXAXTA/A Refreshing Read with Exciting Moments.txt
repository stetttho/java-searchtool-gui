 This book is an absolute must to read, and serves as a perfect introduction into the life of Che. From the introduction which he claims that he is a changed man from this journey, to all the adventures and experiences which ultimately shaped his perceptions on the world. Furthermore, the Motorcycle Diaries bears an atlas characteristic and provides a better understanding of South America.   There are contrasting moments, such as stealing bottles of wine and hiding them under a tree and somehow getting caught, to directly seeing exploited workers in mines with poor health.  That seems to be the pattern of the book, containing happy and at times outright hilarious moments, to grim realities of poverty, disease, and exploitation.   I choose to omit some key adventures because they will serve more effective when read, but I will say that the strength of the Motorcycle Diaries lies in the rare ability to inspire. It instills a sense of humanity in the reader and a better appreciation towards life. It also has the power to motivate, whether in the form of travel, or social action because it is a real documentation of a real journey that had a profound effect on a real and respected individual.
