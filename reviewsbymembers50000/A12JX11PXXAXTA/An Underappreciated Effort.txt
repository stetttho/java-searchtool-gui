 Leisure sets itself apart in the Blur catalogue because it possesses a "Madchester" feel, reminiscent of the Stone Roses perhaps. The hit single "Theres no other way" definitely showed potential in the group, and recieved some commercial success.  "She's so High" kicks off the album in fine fashion because of its emotion.  The key word to sum Leisure is variety. There are the mellower jams (Shes So High, Repition, Wear Me Down), the slower quiet songs (Birthday, Sing) and the straight forward rock tunes (Theres No other Way, Bang, Bad Day).   Blur is a progressive band which continually redefines themselves. In stages, Leisure has the distinctive early 90's sound, Modern Life is Rubbish, Parklife, and Great Escape are arguably the definition of Britpop.  Their self titled, and 13 are experimental releases which push the envelope of pop music further than Radiohead ever will or can.  That said, Leisure is the foundation for the best british band of the nineties.
