 My days consistently follow a drab pattern. I get up with some trouble, lethargically get dressed, and pedal my bike to school, whilst battling the winter elements. I complain under my breath, I am tired of the monotany of life. As Jello himself says "its a life sentence" from his days with the Dead Kennedys. Fortuantely, today I had something to look forward to for a change..."Become the Media", a collective of Jellos speeches over the past while, and it could not have come at a better time. The important message portrayed is the need for people to unite and stand up to the oppresive forces (mass media, WTO, GATT...). Furthermore, Jellos unique vision reeks of humour which contributes to an overall positive feel to the speeches. He consistently supports his claims with concrete evidence and examples.  Jello heroically says "youve missed the presidents state of the union address for this?!" prior to delivering a powerful speech regarding the formation and goals of the WTO (k.o the w.t.o). Each speech is crafted in such a manner that it is easy to understand the pertinent issues, whether you are a 15 year old doing a school project on politics, a university student, or a retired steelworker.  If anything, Become the Media is a perfect alternative to anybody who is tired of hearing what CNN has to say about trade, or other mass media outlet. Now I wake up each day knowing that I can learn something new, and grow through these experiences. I energetically put on the stereo while getting dressed, and pedal to school with a greater appreciation for the beauty of winter, and the craving for social change.
