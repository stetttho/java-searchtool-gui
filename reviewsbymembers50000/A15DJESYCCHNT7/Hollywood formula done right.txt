 Cinderella Man, based on a the life of James Braddock, is a melodramatic, boxing picture starring Russell Crowe as the down-on-his-luck Irish boxer, Renee Zellweger as his wife, and Paul Giamatti as his feisty corner man.   If you've ever seen Seabiscuit or Rocky or any of the hundreds of other Hollywood films about the underdog persevering against all odds, you know the predictable, tried-and-true story of Cinderella Man. So why should you see it? For its meticulously re-created depression-era sets and costumes, its lead actors' fine performances, and for Ron Howard's earnest, populist storytelling. As long as you're not expecting the novel or unpredictable, Cinderella Man is sure to enchant you for its 2 hour running time. Of course, the more you think critically about this film the less you'll like how it avoids race-politics or broadly renders Braddock's rival, Max Baer, as a misogynistic, kill-happy, villain.   But what impressed me most with Cinderella Man, warts and all, was how its pacing and storytelling pulled me in -- it's edited with wonderful rhythm, and Howard isn't afraid to take his characters to the deep bottom before he brings them to the top.  This movie, in the way it adheres to predictable formula, is a near-perfect Hollywood movie; the kind of movie that wins Oscars and makes the studio heads smile.
