 "Coldheart Canyon" is nothing less than a bittersweet satire on the hidden hedonism during the Golden Age of Hollywood; an indicting portrait of the destructive vanity and artistic barrenness of modern day Hollywood; and, most importantly, it is a startling, erotic, metaphysical ghost story, with passages that rival the most profligate work in Mr. Barker's canon--bringing to mind the excesses of Fellini's "Satyricon"-- conincided with touching, thought provoking ponderings on the meaning of life.  And still it remains laugh-out-loud funny at times, and never fails to entertain.    "Coldheart Canyon" is one of Barker's most acclomplished works, continuing to solidify him, as Quentin Tarantino pointed out on the book's back cover, as the world's foremost imaginer.  Come along for the ride if you like fiction that pushes the envelope of both craft and content--Barker is literature's undiscovered gem and the horror genre's misbegotten master.  Like the characters in his books he lies on the threshold of uncertainty, a lost soul of sorts in a world that has no need for souls.  To acknowledge Clive Barker is human, to read him divine.  (Postcript: I wrote this review a few years ago when I was obviously too-enamored by Clive Barker and his works to write anything objective about him or his books.  Today I would give this book between 3 and 4 stars, since it is written without any restraint -- though its profligate imaginings offer some delight.)
