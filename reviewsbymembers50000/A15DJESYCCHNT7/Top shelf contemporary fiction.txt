 I hadn't intended to comment on Park's masterful new fantasy novel, the first part of an intended trilogy, since everyone else here has expressed all that needs expressing, but A Princess of Roumania deserves nothing but effusive praise, and one more 5-star review isn't going to hurt.    Publisher Tor has done a fine job with this novel, releasing it in a beautiful hardcover, with a beautiful piece of evocative artwork adorning the cover.   But what counts is Park's elegant prose, striking imagery, and three-dimensional characters.  This is traditional fantasy done right, shot through with a mature depiction of good and evil (really, who is purely good and evil?).  Buy this book!
