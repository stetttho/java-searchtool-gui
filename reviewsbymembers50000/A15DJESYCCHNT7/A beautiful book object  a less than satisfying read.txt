 I don't read screenplays.  So reading Neil Gaiman's screenplay of the forthcoming Dave McKean-directed, Jim Henson Co.-produced MirrorMask left me wanting something more - that something being either the Gaiman novella based on the film (which will be out this fall) or the movie itself (which is without a release date).  I wasn't prepared for the lack of emotion evoked by the text, which, I believe, has less to do with Gaiman's writing than with the medium of screenplays - or, should I say, my aversion to screenplays.  With that said, it's clear that Gaiman's text is an effective blueprint to what I believe will be a beautiful and haunting film.  And in this book, that blueprint is brought to life by Dave McKean's accompanying storyboards, which serve as both utilitarian and atmospheric visual guides, making one wish that Gaiman and McKean collaborated on a full-blown MirrorMask comic book.    But, quite frankly, this book is more than a screenplay.  It's a beautifully bound book object, with 32 color stills that hint at the final product.  It's these stills, taken along with Gaiman's text, that make me a believer in this film.  Not to mention, in the appendices that appear at the book's end, the Gaiman/McKean creative process is revealed in a series of reproduced e-mail correspondences.    I hope my stolid response to the screenplay is a fault of my own and rectified after the movie's release.  But for now, from this book reader's perspective, MirrorMask: The Illustrated Screenplay works better as an object of art than as a moving piece of storytelling.
