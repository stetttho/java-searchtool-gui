 Once again Clive Barker makes a film that no other filmmaker could have.  It is a film that is a delight to Barker aficianados and a bizarre curiosity to those unfamiliar with Clive.  The Director's Cut is ultimate  and should be seen no other way.  Unfortunately the studio butchered the  theatrical version so most people have seen the debaccled Lord of  Illusions.  A great film for any genre, and more intelligent than most  mainstream films.  Barker is truly a renaissance man for today.
