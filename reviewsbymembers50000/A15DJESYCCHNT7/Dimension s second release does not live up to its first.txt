 This is the second release in the Jet Li collection by Dimension Home Video and where its first release Fist of Legend suceeded The Enforcer fails.  First off, Jet Li is magnificent in the few fight scenes he is in,  and the movie My Father Is A Hero (The Enforcer) is one of Jet's better all  around films.  However Dimension seems to have sped up Jet in his final  fight scene in this release and the music and revamped sound effects do not  always coincide.  I would have given this film a four stars if not for this  shortcoming.  Fist of Legend was beautifully done in this aspect to bad The  Enforcer didn't follow suit.  Hopefully Twin Warriors (Dimension's next  release aka Tai Chi Master) will learn from its first progenitor rather  than this one.  This still does not encumber the beauty of Jet's kinetic  and irresistable screen presence.
