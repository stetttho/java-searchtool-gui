 Clive Barker, once again, moves beyond the mainstream, with this elegant and beautifully written book, that less intelligent fans might find a little too profound.  The story is written in dream prose, in which we are  taken into another world (like all his previous books).  Except this time,  the world is our own, inhabited by beautiful creatures, the Barbarrosas,  who transcend flesh, and seem to contain all of Barker's wit and beauty.   The antithesis of these creatures are the Geary's, who fear and hate the  Barbarossas.  It seems that the Barbarossas represent all that Barker is as  a writer and person, and that the Geary's represent the world's dogmas and  its banal beourgois living. What Barker does in all his fiction, is subvert  the normal, to take his readers to places we have never been before.  Some  minds can handle the ride, others cannot, and just continually bash this  apotheosized fiction.  The fractious insults are insolent and unfulfilled,  with lack of support for opinion.  So read this book and create your own  view, and maybe, if you can, let Barker take you on a trip that no other  author before or after could ever comprehend.  For Barker fans, as Dorthea  says,"Flesh is a trap, and majic sets us free", Barker is that  majic, let him set us free!
