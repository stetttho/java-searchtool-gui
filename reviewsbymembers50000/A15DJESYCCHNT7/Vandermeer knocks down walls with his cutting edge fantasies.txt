 Jeff Vandermeer, best known for his interconnected Ambergis stories (published in "City of Saints and Madman"), shows here, in his first short story collection encompassing the first 15 years of his writing life, that genre and literary borders are illusory.  When confronting "Secret Life," forget all you know about the rules of fantasy and story construction, and embrace the spontaneity of these highly imaginative fantasies.   One thing "Secret Life" is not is boring!  It is bold and groundbreaking.  It is a brief glimpse into the future of fantasy fiction.  And it is one of this year's hallmark books, inside or out of genre.  These imaginatively fecund stories breath, live, and crawl around the brain like living organisms.  Give Jeff Vandermeer's "Secret Life" a chance to open your mind to the possibilities of fiction.
