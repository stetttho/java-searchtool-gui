 First-time novelist K.J. Bishop's The Etched City achieves what all great fantasy stories set out to do: grab the reader with storytelling that transcends reality with the tools of the fantastic, while examining the grandest metaphysical themes - good versus evil, the existence of God, free will, etc.  And boy, does Ms. Bishop achieve this heightened state.  The episodic narrative, following the professional killer Gwynn and professional healer Raule, rings like a fever dream, as Bishop's prose perfectly aligns itself with the decadent and ornate city of Ashamoil - a dilapidated landscape, fully peopled with riffraff of all spiritual and economic sorts.  The cover blurb compares The Etched City to China Mieville's creation of New Crobuzon in Perdido Street Station and to Stephen King's The Dark Tower sequence.  But, while the comparisons are accurate to a degree, Bishop's novel deserves to stand on its own, un-needing of comparisons - especially when the comparisons are lesser works than the book at hand.  In fact, Bishop's novel is nothing like King's Dark Tower universe.  Certainly the desert landscape and Western motifs are present in The Etched City, but Bishop's preoccupations are more mature than King's (she relishes metaphysics as opposed to meta-fiction), and her story is more swift and maturely edited than anything Mieville has yet produced.  The Etched City, with its expert storytelling and seamless melding of metaphysics into the story fabric, ranks as one of the best fantasy novels of this millennium.  K.J. Bishop is not an author to watch, but an author to cherish.
