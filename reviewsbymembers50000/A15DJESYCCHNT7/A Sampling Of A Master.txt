 A book that lets readers experience bits and pieces of an underrated, misunderstood master.  Merely teasers or appetizers, that wet the palette, and succumb the mouth to salivation, in insatiable desire for more.  Read  this, but have a full Barker novel near by.  Or else face the consequences  of wanting more, just like a life long Barker fan who waits for more from  him everyday.  An enchanting read! with a brilliant and personal  introduction by Clive, worthy to be essential!
