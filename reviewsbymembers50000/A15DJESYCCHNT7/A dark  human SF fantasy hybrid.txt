 I have never read Paul Witcover's first novel, the criminally out-of-print Waking Beauty (1997), but his recently published, brilliant second novel, Tumbling After (2005), has been way overdue.  One can only hope Mr. Witcover starts churning out work at a faster rate.  Or maybe, considering the perfection in the measured prose and economical storytelling of Tumbling After, we should forgive Witcover his languid writing pace and, in fact, be thankful for the time and attention he gives his stories .  Because, in its own way, Tumbling After is a perfect coming-of-age, SF/fantasy novel by an author who seems to have achieved everything he's set out to.  The fat has been trimmed, leaving a sharp, dangerous narrative that is quite an emotional ride for the reader.    Still, it may not be a perfect book for every reader. Even for me, the story could have used a bit of occasional levity.  But by the last page I could not help but deeply admire Witcover's obsessive vision of twins, parallel worlds, and odds.  And, though some may get turned off by Witcover's SF elements, it's the small touches of humanity in his characters that will get them through, and the palpable pain that exudes from these pages: the twist of a nipple, the butting of a head on a nose.  The fear of being alone.
