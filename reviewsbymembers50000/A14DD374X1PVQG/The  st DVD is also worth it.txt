 I haven't read all 531 reviews here as of this writing, but most everyone seems to focus on the 2nd DVD with the Hi-Def content. I actually bought the Extreme DVD for the high def content, but then decided the set was worth it for the 1st DVD alone.  The 1st DVD disc has two things that totally thrilled me. An interactive mode which completely details all the special effects on screen and lets you break-away at several key-points to hear about sound, special effects and production notes from many of the people involved in the film. To me this is much more compelling than a Director's narrative.  The other thing that totally blew me away on the 1st DVD is the Dolby Headphone Soundtrack. I've heard many headphone oriented surround technologies, but nothing like this. The sound over headphones is truely awesome. If I din't know I was watching a movie I would absolutely think the dogs barking in one particular scene were outside my condo. I actually prefer it to listening to the soundtrack over my thousand dollar speaker system. One other note the picture quality of the 1st DVD seems signifigantly better than the quality of the origional DVD release of T2. I often found it hard to beleive I was watching a DVD. I didn't consider myself a huge T2 fan before I bought this DVD, but it has defintely made me a bigger one. The high-def content is nice, but it doesn't make the set in my opinion.
