 I found this one of the highest rated books on C a couple of years ago, so I bought it. I wanted an introduction to C before moving on to C++. I had already used "Practical C Programming" but became frustrated with it after its horrible explanation of pointers. Parts of this book are a little difficult as he uses some high-school level math(grin), and there are some pretty advanced functions with regards to sorting and linked lists, but the book gave me exactly what I needed, an intellegent, concise, and precise introduction to C. Following each section are numerous exercises to test what you learned. Think of this book as a great starting point, if you have moderate intelligence...
