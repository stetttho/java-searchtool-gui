 This is the most insightful book on psychoanalytic theory I have ever read. There is a modern tragedy occurring in psychotherapeutic offices throughout the land. Many patients are being treated as sick and diseased human beings who are for all practical purposes irretrievably abnormal. The thesis of this work is that psychotherapy can only be successful when the patient is treated as an equal. This is a very profound statement.  Many patients enter treatment with the unconscious belief that they are flawed, that their perceptions are grossly distorted, and in fact the therapists are happy to confirm this by enforcing their rigid theories of the patients unconscious on the patient. The therapist claims access to a completely undistorted view of reality that the patient is lacking (thus "flawed").  Dorpat astutely recognizes the importance of Weiss proposal that "psychopathology stems from unconscious pathogenic beliefs of the dangers if the patient were to pursue certain important goals."  This is an amazing work that should be of central importance to anyone involved in any way with psychotherapy (students, teachers, therapists, patients, etc.).  The cover of the book touched me only after I had read it. A person on the cover is depicted as being choked by a hateful, angry person, and this is exactly what happens all too often in psychotherapy (though unconsciously).
