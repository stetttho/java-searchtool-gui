 After I first bought this printer I thought it was incredible, maybe perfect. But after I've had it for a while I'm more sensitive to its flaws vs. a photo lab, and so am updating my review. First of all, this printer produces incredible output... for an inkjet. I thought I had found something that would make the local photo lab obsolete. At the time I did not know I could just take my digtal pictures to the local photo lab for 1hr processing, just like traditional film. Now that I've discovered this and have been able to compare like pictures on both the printer and from the lab, I can say that the output of this printer is easily inferior to that of a lab. In some pictures you really can't tell the difference, but I often see a perceptible halftome screen (think hunderds of barly visible dark lines all the way across the print). Certain shades are still a bit grainy, color gamut is a bit weak, and there is way too much detail in shadows. Even when set to the dark setting in the driver, the printouts are too bright. In pictures that have dark areas, there is a somewhat sudden drop off from high shadow detail to sudden pure black(which in the case of the 820 is just not dark enough). Also I now realize that this printer has a nasty habit of really bringing out the noise in pictures that have a moderate amount(it's worst with Photo Paper Pro). Prints from the lab manage to hide this noise altogether.  I must re-emphasize that this printer does an incredible job, but I think if you get this printer and print some photos and then see the same photos side-by-side from a photo lab, you will find it lacking. On the other hand, I'm sure a lot of people will find these print-outs more than adequate.
