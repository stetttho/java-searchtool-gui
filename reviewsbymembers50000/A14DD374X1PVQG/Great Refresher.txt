 I've been away from college for 4 years and did not want to spend a lot of money and time learning the Math I needed to get into Calculus. When I went to the bookstore, what impressed me about this book was the number of solved problems and the additional supplementary(unworked) problems. Also it looked very concise. I got bogged down on some parts because I just didn't get some of the things the author was trying to say, but after I stuck at it and worked through some of the solved problems I never stayed stuck. If you want to get through Algebra fast I do highly recommend this book.
