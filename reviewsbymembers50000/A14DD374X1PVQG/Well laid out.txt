 One feature I really liked about this book was the "Now work on Problem #..." items, which give you a specific exercise to work on in that section to make sure you understand the concept just covered. Also, the author has highlighted certain exercise problems for a suggested practice test. These are great if you already know some of the material you can just breeze through these until you get stuck on something. The paperback solutions manual was also excellent, I used it a lot since I was teaching myself.
