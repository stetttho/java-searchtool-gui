 The characters in this movie at first seem a bit flat, a bit sterotypical, but as the movie wore on I found the characters saying things and doing things and reacting in ways I did not expect. The movie wasnt so  predictable as I expected it to be at the start. Hopkins and Gooding do a  great job, they seem to get better as the movie goes on. The other  characters, the professor, the warden, etc. however are pretty flat, and  very predictable. Overall I think the production is typical Hollywood fare,  one thing that annoyed me is how nice hopkins hair looked after being in  jail for over a year, I guess they had a salon in there? And the movie does  seem to be lacking a sense of realism, but the screenplay, the dialogue is  excellent, I imagine the book must be pretty good read.
