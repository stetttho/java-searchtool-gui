 First of all I don't own this book. I just skimmed through it today at a brick and mortar store. I was very pleased to see some one had written down many of life's lessons that I've been learning the hard way. I make $35k a year and feel like a slave. And that I am, a slave to my past spending habits. Fortunately I am only 29.  Despite the fact that I've already learned the hard way many of the lessons in this book, I still really enjoyed it as it confirmed many of the observations I've made about where my spending habits came from and the criticisms/cynicisms that I've formed of the advertising industry and our consumer culture in general. He uses great imagery, a rare and invaluable talent. Yes, we are very much like cows being milked for all we're worth by greedy executives. However we are not really cows, so we have a choice of whether to be milked or not.   I only regret that the author did not realize these insights 10 years ago (before I had entered the job market). But such is life! There is a lot in here that is central to the pursuit of hapiness, which I gather many people, like me, have backwards. I am defintely one of the people whom he identifies in the book whose possesions own the person instead of the other way around.  Perhaps it is a little too revealing as I put it back on the shelf after skimming it, knowing that it would still be there whenever I decide I want to part with some cash to give it a permanent space on my own personal bookshelf. (I say that toungue in cheek)
