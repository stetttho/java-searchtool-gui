 I bought this book in 1999. I'm not sure why, I think the title "Prisoners of Childhood" caught my eye. Somewhere in the back of my head I felt that's what I was.  This book should be required reading for any psychoanalyst or social worker. The premise of this book is that adult psychosis are borne of childhood abuses. A child's true self is often "beaten down" and draws away from the world through either overt(physical) or covert(emotional) abuse.  A particularly salient quote from the forward to this (the original) edition:  "For the majority of sensitive people, the true self remains deeply and thoroughly hidden. [...] Such people are enamored of an idealized, conforming, false self. They will shun their hidden and lost true self, unless depression makes them aware of its loss or psychosis confronts them harshly with that true self."  That is basically the thrust of the book. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand human motivation on the macro- or micro-scale. A large part of that motivation is simply avoidance of childhood reality. This problem is as ubiquitous and ever-present as the air we breathe.  As a side note, this book has been revised, the new edition entitled "The Drama of the Gifted Child" is a significant update. Note that "gifted" doesn't refer to especially bright children. The notion of gifted refers to anyone who was able to survive childhood abuse.
