 This book gives you 600 ways to work out. Only have dumbells? No problem. Prefer Nautilus? No problem. Just want to stay in shape? No problem. This book is full of tons of exercises for all kinds of equipment and all kinds of people. Many exercises require no weights at all. I've had this book for 10 years and refer to it time and time again. It is probably starting to show its age(the publication, not my specific copy, mind you), but is still has a lot going for it. There are programs here for all levels of weight training, from the white-collar workout(quick and easy) to the Competitive Bodybuilding workout; plus recommended workouts for dozens of specific sports. BTW, since the pictures only show the begin and end of each exercise(and impoper form can lead to injury)I recommend hooking up with someone knowledgable about weight training and having them check your form.
