 This is a bleak, sober and dramatic graphic novel that presents the life and outlook of the current Palestinian people.  I am not a particular fan of this form of literature, so I am less sure as to how to accept the book's style.  This is not a book for a quick read unless one is fairly unemotional.  The author is seeking to extract a strong reaction and he is hardly subtle about it. Those who strongly favor the Israeli views will stay away from this book.  Those who have a pro-Palestinian position will readily purchase it.  My concern is for those of us who can sympathize with both views of the non-militant factions.   The author/illustrator's presentation is too depressing and heavy handed.  I am not arguing with his facts, although, his work is apparently based on less than a 60 day visit to the Palestine area.  I think that his presentation would have benefited from a more extensive stay that could have allowed for more reflection.  The book is like a movie with the hero facing death every five minutes.  It doesn't allow the audience to relax and independently develop opinions.   According to what I recall about social science research in persuasion, heavy handed messages tend to be dismissed by the neutral listener.  That is my problem with the book.  I think the message is very important, and the author well intended, but who will he persuade that is not already in agreement with him?  Contrast the book's style with ,for example, the movie "Schindler's List," since I think that a graphic novel is more like a film than literature.  The film, "Schindler", subject matter was certainly as grave a topic as ever known.  The movie was emotional, but it respected the audience's ability to think and not dictate what the presenter wants them to know.  This is precisely where "Palestine" fails.  It is emotional, but ultimately will reach only the choir.  I should also mention that this is not a book for children except mature, older teens.
