 This review will not likely be read by anyone for years or if ever, unless the book receives a new publication, but let's set the record straight, did JFK solely write this book? Who knows and who cares anymore. At least there isn't the plagiarizing charge that accompanies the 21st century's current popular historians. Kennedy put his name on the cover and left himself open for criticism or acclaim.  The book is drably written and without many of the lively anecdotes typical of current nonfiction. The book, though, in analyzing England & Europe's political and economic condition provides a perspective to the often asked question of "Why didn't the world act to stop Hitler before he opened hostilities?" Kennedy nearly prophesizes the later U.S. involvement in the war. Unfortunately, the post war perspective of whether earlier action against Hitler should have been initiated is colored by historians' accepting of Churchill's later self serving reviews of the pre-war years. Kennedy's book gives some perspective to Churchill's role of those pre-war years (e.g., Churchill at first argued to increase armament to keep up with the French, not Germany), and the likelihood of whether more serious action would have been possible at the time (not likely by any single nation). There were things in this book that I had not earlier encountered in my numerous readings of WWII.
