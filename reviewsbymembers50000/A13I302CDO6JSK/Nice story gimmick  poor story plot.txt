 A good deal of this relatively short book held my interest for the scenery and mood presented by the author. When looking at a couple of his other books, I see that presenting a realistic atmosphere of World War II Europe is this writer's gimmick. He is quite good at it, and there are certainly worse schemes in vogue by various popular writers.  I rate this book low, but not because it is so slow moving. I have enjoyed other books with a deliberate pace. My problem with the book is that the plot is not presented until about half way through the book. Even then, the climax registered as barely a ripple in the water. When I finished the book, I wondered where was the rest, and what was the point of telling the story. I understand from other reviewers that the writer has a sequel to possibly complete the story. The book would have been better if the two volumes had been combined. I doubt that I will invest in the second book.
