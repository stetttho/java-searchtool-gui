 As has been true with Wambaugh's other non-fiction books, the story is captivating and intense. The Wambaugh fan is treated to more of the author's earthy prose. I've read nearly every one of his books, but his phraseology continues to surprise and amuse me. The book's narration slows slightly in the second half when he presents the trial scenes. The author compensates by presenting the trial proceedings through what characters are seeing, thus making the presentation of evidence and procedures much more palatable. This is not Wambaugh's best work of non-fiction, but instead of hitting a home run, he landed on third with this book. I heartily recommend both the book and the audio recording.
