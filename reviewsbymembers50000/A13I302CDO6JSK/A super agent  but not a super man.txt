 Just as Sean Connery is the only real Bond, Ian Fleming remains the only real Bond author.  For various reasons, I have not been as enthusiastic with all of the Fleming Bond novels, but I was very pleased to have just read this initial Bond book.  The differences between the movies and the books are as different as the actors who have played the British secret agent.  The book version of 007 gives us a much more human character.  His confidence some times shakes, and he is left with much self doubt.  Instead of a witticism at the sight of an antagonist?s violent death, he becomes ill.  He is harmed, and he cries.  This is a ?man?s? book that I did not hesitate to offer to my wife to read.   This book did not become a traditional movie.  Instead the owner of the book rights (not the author) turned the story into a spy farce.  There are important aspects of the book, however, that will be noticed in the true Bond movies.  The story is different from Fleming?s other stories, but the reader will not be disappointed.  If nothing else, you will learn how to play the game of Baccarat, and how to make the famous Bond martini.
