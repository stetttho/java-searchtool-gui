 As can be understood from the Joseph Wambaugh book "Fire Lover," this book is essentially a journal of the pyromaniac and murderer, John Orr.  It includes a arsonist act of a large hardware store that killed a toddler and his grandmother.  As the former book discusses, this was the actual event of Los Angeles fire that left a boy, grandmother, and others dead.  The author, John Orr, is the culprit.  I read the Wambaugh book, but I have not read the convicted killer's book.  I have no intention of giving him the satisfaction of buying the book.  I hope that he reads this review.  I would like for him to know that while I am not a proponent of the death penalty, I do believe that he is one who would deserve it.
