 Although Kiko is my favorite of this group's many albums, "Good Morning Aztlan" is very much welcomed. I recently introduced this group's music (the Kiko album) to a college age friend, and she was immediately hooked. What is most interesting to me is how the band can incorporate so many styles of music including Mexican folklorico, blues, rock, country, etc. This would be too much for most bands and their fans, but Los Lobos pulls it off without becoming repetitive. If you know someone who is not familiar with this band, then give them a treat with this album or the earlier collection of the band's best. Also, I recommend the music from Los Super Seven for a similar sound, but more focused on a Latin flavor.
