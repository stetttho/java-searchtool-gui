 A 1988 Japanese novel translated into English in 1999. The story follows a newly paroled man who in a fit of passion killed his wife, and mistakenly killed the mother of his wife's lover. The character is sympathetic despite his action. I was troubled by the attitude of the various characters accepting the justification for the killing, but the story's end addresses this issue as expertly as can be hoped.  The story keeps a meditative pace, but always stays interesting as it explores the intricacies of a long-term prisoner now paroled into a world vastly different from what he left. The reader gradually learns of the circumstances of the parolee's crime and his inner feelings about his actions including what those who are now responsible for helping him expect of him. The story's end is not too unexpected, but in keeping with a philosophy of fatalism. It gives an interesting view, if it is accurate, into the Japanese penal and criminal justice system. I don't easily give books the highest possible rating, but I wouldn't be surprised if others rate this novel higher than do I.
