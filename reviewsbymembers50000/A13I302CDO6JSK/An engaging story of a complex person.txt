 Marshall Frady's book is an invaluable addition to the historical, sociological, and psychological understanding of this country's race relations.  In particular, he does not limit the story to what happened decades earlier, but relates the historical events to more recent history.  Thankfully, the book treats Dr. King as a human being with faults (e.g., his insecurities, self-doubts, womanizing), and not as a saint (as sometimes portrayed in MLK day celebrations) or as a commodity (as marketed by his family).  The value of discussing Dr. King honestly is that his vision for society is not limited to the saints, but can be more practically considered by us regular folks with our shortcomings.
