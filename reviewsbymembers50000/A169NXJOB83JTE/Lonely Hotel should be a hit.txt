 The song Lonely Hotel alone is worth the price of this CD.  It is a jukebox favorite and something of an insider's hit in areas where Hoppey frequently plays.  Hoppey fans often forget that it isn't actually a chart  hit.  It could be.  Great song, great lyrics, great voice.  If you are  looking to discover a great new artist, all of Will Hoppey's CDs are worth  a listen.
