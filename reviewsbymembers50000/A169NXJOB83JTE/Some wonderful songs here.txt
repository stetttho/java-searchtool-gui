 The song The Doors of Heaven is on my top 10 list.  Maybe my top 5 list.  It deserves to be widely heard and is worth the price of admission in itself.  In the spirit of John Lennon's Imagine, The Doors of Heaven asks  the listener to imagine a world without self-absorbtion and its more  detrimental side effects like allowing people to go hungry or the abuse of  children.  Not as preachy as my description sounds, just a very nice song.   Moon Song has some wonderful poetry in its lyrics.  Arlo Guthrie on a  reflective day.
