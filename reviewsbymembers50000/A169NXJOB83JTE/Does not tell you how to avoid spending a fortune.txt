 Before spending money on this book, if you have not seen it in a brick and mortar store, you should know that it is essentially an article typeset with a large enough font to be book length.  This would not be a problem if it were full of useful information.  In fact, about 1/4 of the book is excerpted from the author's other book Over 66 Tips and Tricks to Supercharge Your Tradeshow Promotions.  That title is a better buy.  It is also basically an article stretched out to book length, but it does offer some useful tips and is worth a read.  (My only complaint about that book is one self-serving section suggesting that the CEO give copies of the book to everyone in the company).  The main problem with this book is it does not live up to its title.  It is not written with the small business person on a shoe-string budget in mind.  It devotes whole chapters to choosing the right person from your corporation to design your booth.  If you have a small mom-and-pop operation you probably already know who will be designing your booth-- one of your three employees, and they will all be at the conference.  There are some good suggestions for companies on tight budgets, but not as many as you might think based on the title.  There are few specifics on how to be eye catching or on money saving ideas. Most of it is impressing upon the reader that you *should* be eye catching.  That, you probably already knew.  The other main piece of advice is that you should be targeting your display to those most likely to buy.
