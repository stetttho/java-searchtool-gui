 My copy of Weird People is dog-eared and marked.  It is a collection of facts about human life.  Odd information about the human body, biographies of unique individuals, strangely accurate premonitions, weird coincidences,  the differences between women and men and tales of eccentric, famous,  lucky, unlucky or otherwise noteworthy individuals.
