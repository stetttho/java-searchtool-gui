 Will Hoppey's voice and playing would be worth hearing even if he did not have such well-written, thought-provoking, sometimes haunting material to work with.  Fortunately, he's got both.  If you have not yet discovered  this singer-songwriter do yourself a favor and listen to this all acoustic  CD.
