 ...people do get published using market guides like this one.  I am a published author of seven books (my last book is in its third printing now) and I have used this book and writer's market to get my queries in front of the right editors for my topic.  Writer's Market has more listings, Jeff Herman's has more detail.  If you can't afford a $...subscription to Literary Marketplace on line, this and Writer's Market are the books you need.  I personally use both because each has its own strengths and weaknesses.
