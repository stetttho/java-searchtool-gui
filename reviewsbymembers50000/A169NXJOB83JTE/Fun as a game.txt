 This is a fun bit of software, and is a nice way to augment your Russian studies in an entertaining way, but I don't see how anyone could learn Russian using this product alone.  The first CD is akin to a memory game which teaches some random, thematically linked vocabulary.  Just when you think you're becomming a master, you move on to CD 2.   The second CD has an entirely different feel than the first, and this is where the "instant immersion" comes in.  Suddenly, animated characters are speaking at you in speedy Russian sentences.  Help in English disappears and, even though neither disc gives any instruction in the cyrillic alphabet, you are suddenly expected to be able to read.  Was there a CD 1A that I missed? I plan to go back to CD 2 as I learn more Russian.  I think its games will be a fun way to review-- once I learn from some other means...
