 This book talks about the ups and downs of starting a business, and it may be a good overview of the positives and negatives of running a business for someone who has never gone into business for himself.  There are, however, more valuable books out there with more concrete advice.  It is more realistic than the "Go Into Business and Get Rich Like I Did" type of books, but there is little in it that seems new.  It is not as entertaining as the advance reviews led me to believe it would be.  (I was expecting a Dave Barry, Bill Bryson, Steve Martin style from all the comments on the entertaining style.)  This is not a must have book for the budding entrepreneur.
