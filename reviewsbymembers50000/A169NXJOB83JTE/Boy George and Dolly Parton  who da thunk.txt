 It's a shame this song hasn't made it to U.S. radio.  Anyone got a radio station that still plays songs because they're good-- not just because the demographic studies say this song sells the most soap?-- Dolly Parton and Boy George both have great voices, and they blend excellently.  Forget 80s nostalgia.  It's just good.  Reggae beat, catchy pop melody, and two great voices.  Take a chance on it.
