 This is a decent introduction, although there are better audio learning programs available.  The main flaw is that the announcers are rushed and seem to be shouting at you.  (You can't understand, I'll speak louder).  The rushing results in an even greater flaw, the pauses are not long enough for the listener to repeat the words without speaking over the next word he or she is supposed to be listening to. It is, however, a much less expensive introduction than, say, Pimsleur and could be worthwhile for that reason.
