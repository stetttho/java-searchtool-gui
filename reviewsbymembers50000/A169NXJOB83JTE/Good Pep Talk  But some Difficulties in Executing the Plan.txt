 This book is a great pep talk, gets you fired up, and makes you believe becoming a millionaire is darned easy and nearly inevitible.  I read it, and I did find something of value in it, but I have to say I did not become a millionaire in a month, as the protagonist of the story did.    The most useful advice is to seek out mentors and cultivate a network of supporters.   The advice on cultivating multiple streams of income is probably sound, however, an entrepreneur can only devote his or her attention to so many projects.  Most, unlike the protagonist in the story portion of the book, do not have an entire team willing to work for free to take care of the details of producing the multiple income streams-- so take care that your "multiple streams" don't turn into too many projects that divide your focus.  Fortunately for the character in the book, each money-making idea was a hit.  It would be just as likely that going into real estate, the toy business, internet marketing and seminar sales all at once would result in exhaustion and a serious drain of mental and financial resources and at least one of the businesses would have to be abandoned.  It is worth a read, however, for motivation.  Millionaire status is not guaranteed.
