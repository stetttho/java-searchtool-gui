 Definetly one of my favorite books of this kind.  The anecdotes are written in an entertaining, breezy style.  It is packed with informaiton.  Every time I open it, I find something new.  It's the kind of book you can return to frequently because it has so much content, you can't remember it  all.  When you go back, it's fresh again.  With an index, it is also a  valuable reference book.  Recommended.
