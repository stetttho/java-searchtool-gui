 A lot of the recipes were good but had a lot of ingredients and alot of stuff I would never freeze any how. If you are looking for freezer book I would use the Ball Book of canning, freezing and dehydration. Mostly I freeze what ever is left over in garden and don't spend tons of time making stuff for my freezer but if that is what you are looking for this will do.
