 Beautiful book full of socks from around the world. Different yarns-excellent directions. Great book to curl up with your yarn stash and start knitting. These projects will be passed down from generation to generation and everyone will marvel at them, truly a history lesson as well. Great book as all of hers are - thanks  =:)
