 A good book but lacking in color and pictures. I like alot of what is it supposed to look like book. Really though, the recipes and ideas are very good and gives you alot of other ideas from the garden also. Preferably i use the Ball Book of Canning, Freezing, and Dehydration and that is wonderful. Basic but very good.
