 This was so much fun to make small cones for ice cream and so beautifully decorated that everything came out perfect. I made all kinds of fillings from creams to puddings and filled them up. They are beautiful and very nordic in design. You can even just make cookies and also very pretty, easy to use, nothing to clean, and impressive to show.
