 This is the best book on grilling I have seen in a long time-excellent recipes including those for all kinds of mixtures for flavorings. If you own a Weber grill you are in for a treat and even if you don't it is a great book to own. I have tried most of these and all are excellent. My Weber grill out beat all my relatives grills hands down. The only thing I wish it had is a spiral binding so it would lay flat.
