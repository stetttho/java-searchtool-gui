 This album was a welcome surprise after the decent (but unexceptional)  SEMI-DETACHED. However, Therapy? have really veered off into a new  direction again. The style of this album seems looser, funner, less  structured, but also a little less consistent than much of their earlier  work.      While this album is different, it is also their strongest since  TROUBLEGUM (if you're reading this and don't own that album, buy it now! It  is THE definitive post-modern metal album of the 90's). While this album  lacks the hooks and punch that made TROUBLEGUM both catchy and heavy at the  same time, and the stylistic diveristy that made INFERNAL LOVE interesting,  it manages to kind of take a middle ground, and come across as a deeper  album. "Jail Jar Jail" is a great punchy rocker. "Six Mile  Water" is an effective ballad. "Sister" is also a great  mid-tempo rocker. Any fans of bands such as Soundgarden or Stone Temple  Pilots should like this album, although it could drive away many of those  that loved TROUBLEGUM (as is the case with every Therapy? album, it's  totally different than those before it).      Therapy? fans: this is a  great return to form for a insanely underappreciated rock band. For new  fans however, TROUBLEGUM is really the album that should be bought first,  as it is more tuneful and accessible.
