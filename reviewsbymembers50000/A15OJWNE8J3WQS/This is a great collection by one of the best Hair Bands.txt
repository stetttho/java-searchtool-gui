 I really love this album! Slaughter has always seemed to me one of the  best of the 80's/early 90's hair groups (although looking back, a lot of  them seem to have aged pretty well). Anyways, Slaughter has always had a  great signature sound with Mark Slaughter's voice and Tim Kelly's guitar,  and it's surprising how strong this collection is. The obvious hits are  here: "Up All Night", "Fly To The Angels", "Days  Gone By", but what is surprising is how good many of the album tracks  were good by this band. To be honest, a lot of bands from this period  filled their albums with some crappy filler (Firehouse comes to mind), but  Slaughter really seemed to stay consistent. "You are the One" and  "Real Love" are two of my favorite songs ever, and this CD has  always been in my car stereo since I got it more than a year ago. This  album is worth every penny, and it's great to see Slaughter still around,  and releasing good material (Back to Reality is a fantastic album).         If you like Slaughter, you have to own this. If you're a fan of hair rock,  this is one of the ones you have to buy.
