 CRUSH, quite simply, is a new direction for Bon Jovi. They've kind of  headed off into a zone inbetween SLIPPERY WHEN WET and NEW JERSEY, and  THESE DAYS and KEEP THE FAITH. I like this album less than those first two,  but a lot more than their later albums. "It's my Life" is a great  comeback single, and starts the album greatly but unfortunately it's the  highlight of the album. "Say It Isn't So" is a bit of a new  direction, but a great song, and I really think this one could become a  hit. It kind of finds a place inbetween contemporary styles and 80's hair  metal. The album also closes with a good party rocker "One Wild  Night". In between these tracks are nine pretty good songs,with the  only real clunker being "Mystery Train". If Bon Jovi could only  have taken out a couple ballads and put in a few more rockers, this album  could really have been perfect. As it stands, it's a must buy for Bon Jovi  fans, and definitely the best album that's charting in Billboard's Top 200  right now. I'm actually amazed it's still in the top 200. Def Leppard's  last album was great, but sank like a stone, and I was expecting the same  with this one. But the summer's over and Bon Jovi's still around, which  means popular music might still have a chance. To Bon Jovi haters out  there: Watch out, they're coming back...and they have an album that even  you might like.
