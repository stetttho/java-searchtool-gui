 This is Dream Theater's second best album after FALLING INTO INFINITY.  While IMAGES AND WORDS features "Pull Me Under" and "Take  the Time" two of the band's best songs, AWAKE is much more consistent  and tuneful as a whole, with "Lie", "Caught in a Web",  and "Mirror".       This album, much more than IMAGES AND WORDS,  is accessible to a crowd outside of those that care more about the bands  technical prowess than the quality of the songs. In general, Dream Theater  has more soul and better written songs than almost all of their peers (with  Queensryche being the only possible exception), but this music does take a  lot more patience than more conventional rock bands like Metallica or  Megadeth. However, if you want a little more meaning in your rock music,  give these guys a try, it's worth it.
