 I cannot understand why Poison didn't do an entire new CD, instead of  putting 5 new songs in with a bunch of live retreads that you can get on  SWALLOW THIS LIVE. The new songs are great, let me tell you, and they show  a new level of maturity, which, I feel, has moved them to a level above  novelty (something I always considered Poison to be). The new songs really  make a case for the future, and "Power to the People" manages to  go rock/rap and succeed (although I really don't see the band going farther  down this path). It's close to me, because you have to deal with the live  stuff, but I think the CD's worth it for the new stuff (if you have a CDR,  like me, I just burned it onto my own Poison greatest hits CD). "Last  Song" is a great ballad, which manages to be heartfelt and about  something a little deeper than your basic, "I love you" or  "you left me" stuff. Now I'm waiting for a new Poison CD...
