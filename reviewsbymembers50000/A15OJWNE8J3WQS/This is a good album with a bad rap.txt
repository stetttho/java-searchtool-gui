 Ok, now I've seen a lot of complaints about this album being "too  soft". Well, I own all of Enuff Z'Nuff's albums, and while this isn't  one of my favorites, I actually think it might be their most accessible.  This, quite simply, is a solid album all the way through. Despite a goofy  intro, "Wheels" is a great mid-paced rocker as well. But there  are so many great songs on this album: "Down Hill", "You and  I", "On my Way Back Home", "So Sad to See  You"...Even "Clown on the Town" which is a country song, is  tight and tuneful. I must admit however that this album is much softer than  STRENGTH or ANIMALS WITH HUMAN INTELLIGENCE, comparable to Firehouse's new  album, CATAGORY 5. If you judge music based solely on how good it is,  rather than how heavy, I guarentee you will like this album if you give it  a chance. When I first bought this album I wasn't very impressed, but the  more I've listened to it, the more it's really grown on me. I think it's a  (slightly) better album than TWEAKED, and stronger overall than the  self-titled album. Give it a try, it's a good album.
