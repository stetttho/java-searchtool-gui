 This has always been my favorite album by King's X, and I also think it's  their most accesible, and the first one new fans should buy. This is King's  X strongest and most consistent record, and "Not Just for the  Dead" is their finest song in my opinion. "Black Flag",  "Lost In Germany", and "The Big Picture" are the other  highlights of this album.     For those that don't know, King's X is truly  one of today's best hard rock groups, and although sometimes catagorized  with 80's hair groups like Warrant or Whitesnake, King's X are a  progressive group, whose music represents more of a melodic rock style,  they are compared often to what a hard rock version of the Beatles would  sound like (the most similar band I can think of is Enuff Z'Nuff, and if  you're a King's X fan and don't have any EZN albums, it's time to buy a  couple). Anyways, King's X is a smart, tight, melodic hard rock group that  has been criminally underappreciated, and for those looking to get into  this great band, KING's X is the album to buy.
