 This is my absoulute favorite album of all time by my favorite band. Faith  No More never got the respect they deserved, and especially not with this  album. Believe it or not, coming out in 1992, this album was way ahead of  its time. Listening to this album now, it seems even more timely. Looking  at the Korn's, Limp Bizkit's and Kid Rock's now, Faith No More's diverse  rock/rap/funk/craziness almost seems a prediction of the current musical  trend. Give this one a spin and you can see the influence it had on some of  the new rock bands. However, no band, old or new, can match the stylistic  diversity or creativity of Faith No More. This is the kind of album that  never gets old. It can approach hardcore on songs like  "Malpractice" or "Caffeine", and then throw in songs as  inexplicable as "RV" or "Be Aggressive" a song with a  school-girl sung chorus. This music is dynamic to the extent where  thcomparisons to other bands are impossible: There's just no one else out  there who could make an album like this.       Buy this album. You will not  regret it.
