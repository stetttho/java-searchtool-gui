 Therapy? have always been one of my favorite bands, and I've always been disparaged at how little commercial success they've recieved in the US. This retrospective serves as a strong reminder of the success this band has deserved. While I have some problems with the track selection, as "Disintergrators" from NURSE, "Turn", "Femtex", and "Trigger Inside" from TROUBLEGUM, "A Moment of Clarity", "Loose", and "Bad Mother" from INFERNAL LOVE; "Lonely, Cryin, Only", and "Don't Expect Roses" from SEMI-DETACHED; and "Sister" and "Jar Jar Jail" from SUICIDE PACT: YOU FIRST are all absent. This is the kind of collection that could have been a great 2-disc set, as Therapy? has put out a great deal of wonderful material. In addition, the incentives for the dedicated fan to buy this are rather weak. The two new tracks, "Bad Karma", and "Fat Camp" are so-so at best, with the former sounding like a very early pre-NURSE outtake, and the second a slow plodding rocker.     Anyways, none of my gripes can counter the fact that any collection of Therapy? song's is going to be rock solid, and all the most important ones are here: "Screamager", "Die Laughing", "Teethgrinder", and "Stories". For any casual fan taking a look at the crazy world of Therapy? this is a must buy. For the dedicated, however, the extra songs aren't strong enough to warrant the purchase.
