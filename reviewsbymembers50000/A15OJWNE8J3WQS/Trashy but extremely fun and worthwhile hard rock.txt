 This album belongs in the collection of any 80's hard rock fan (chiefly  any that like BON JOVI, CINDERELLA, WHITE LION, or any of their peers).  While I like this album a great deal, I've always thought of it as a  collection of several great singles rather than a wholly consistent album.       Still, those singles are great: "18 and Life", "I  Remember You", and "Youth Gone Wild" defined 80's hard rock.  If you are a fan of this kind of music, I can't imagine not having a song  like "18 and Life" in your collection.     I should add, however,  that this album is far from consistent, and all the highlights can really  be found on Skid Row's FORTY SEASON'S greatest hits album. While this album  does have Skid Row's big hits, it's also their weakest overall (SLAVE TO  THE GRIND, and especially their amazing swan song SUBHUMAN RACE are  essential albums). Anyways, it's safe to say that if you're a fan of 80's  hard rock, you'll enjoy this album, and there are songs here that could  bring a smile to even the most jaded JAY-Z loving face.
