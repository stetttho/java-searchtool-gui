 I know it might sound crazy, but I really feel that this is ALICE COOPER'S  best work. I love Alice, and all of his work, but this album is so  entertaningly cheesy and experimental that it just bowled me over when I  finally got it a couple of months ago. The idea of production by Desmond  Child (Bon Jovi), made me wary of what he'd make Alice sound like, but what  he's managed to do is add the same hooky sing-along sensability that he did  for Bon Jovi and Aerosmith. I know that might sound a little wrong for  Alice Cooper, but give this album a chance. The big hit,  "Poison", is a great, campy rocker, and virtually the entire  album is wall-to-wall hooks galore. This album basically reflects Alice  Cooper moving to a style somewhere between Motley Crue and Bon Jovi. The  songs: "Bed of Nails", "Only my Heart Talking",  "Hell is living without you" (a song co-written and backed by Bon  Jovi), and "House of Fire" are all amazingly catchy, goofy songs.       This album is pure trash (like the title), but trash that is supremely  fun and entertaining. As great as all his early stuff is, this is the kind  of album that, wall-to-wall, features songs that you will not be able to  get out of your head after you listen to them. Trust me. This one may be  more for 80's rock fans than ALICE COOPER purists, but anyone with an open  mind will find a astoundingly catchy and fun album if they're willing to  listen to it.
