 Motley Crue never was, and have never been a consistent band. Their older  albums were so-so (GIRLS GIRLS GIRLS is the exception), and their newer  albums are nothing special. In general, most of Motley Crue's worthwhile  material can be found on their greatest hits album.      So what happened  here? I have no idea, but whether by sheer musicianship, or complete luck,  Motley Crue made a true classic here that eclipses all of their other work,  and is, in my opinion, THE hair metal album to beat. Every song on this  album is great, with the best being "Dr Feelgood", "Same Ol  Situation", "She Goes Down", "Rattlesnake Shake",  and one of the 80's best power ballads (beaten by Motley Crue's own  "Home Sweet Home") "Without You".       Therefore, what  I'm saying is that ANY fan of hair metal needs to own this album, as it is  the prime example of why that era rocked. The only thing that's sad about  this album is Motley Crue never came close to matching it.
