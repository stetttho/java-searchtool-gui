 All of Michael Moore's work (TV Nation, The Big One, Canadian Bacon, Roger & Me, and his book, Downsize This) are amazing works by today's premiere comedic cynic. Moore cuts through to the truth on big business and THE AWFUL TRUTH, his new show on BRAVO is a continuation on this standard.     I've seen the entire first season of THE AWFUL TRUTH (I taped them all), but I'm also buying this DVD, because this stuff is hilarious.      However, I would have to rate THE AWFUL TRUTH below TV NATION, as that show was longer, had higher production values, and was a little more biting in some of its satire. I really hope they put that show on DVD!      But, for any Michael Moore fan, you must buy this DVD! The Awful Truth is a great show, and it just finished its 2nd season, which hopefully will also make it to DVD. For now, just buy this one. If you haven't seen the show, but know Michael Moore's work (especially if you like TV NATION), you will definitely enjoy this. For [the money], the whole season (almost 300 minutes) is worth it.
