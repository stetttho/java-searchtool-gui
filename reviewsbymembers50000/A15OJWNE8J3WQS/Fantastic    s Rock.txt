 I really like Danger Danger. This album has a great deal of energy, and a  song like "Bang Bang" reminds me of Bon Jovi at their best. This  is fun, goofy, entertaining rock music comparable to bands like Trixter or  Cinderella, but much superior in my opinion. All of these guys albums are  solid, but this is probably the safest one to start with.
