 I'll start out by saying that THE SIXTH SENSE was one of the most effectively creepy and affecting movies of its year. Bruce Willis gave a surprisingly capable performance, and Haley Joel Osment did an excellent job of handling a very difficult role.    The success of this movie did seem a slight bit overwhelming though. To me this is a good but not great movie. My first problem with this movie was (don't read on if you haven't seen the movie), is that aside from the clever gimmick of the ending (which reflects back if you watch the movie again), this is a strong but standard thriller film. It's well written, but not particularly creative, and the end gimmick, as compared to say, THE USUAL SUSPECTS, is really kind of pointless if you really think about (more than anything, it shows the craft of a smart screenwriter). And finally, this movie suffered from a lack of buzz compared to THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, as both came out at similar times. THE SIXTH SENSE, came out without a great deal of hype, soon after the aggressively marketed BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. As a result, THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT (which I feel is much creepier and disturbing) suffered from a backlash, while this movie came out at the perfect time to recieve the opposite.     Anyways, I do like this movie a great deal. And, it's definitely a movie that should be seen more than once. But "One of the best films ever made?" Please. This is an entertaining and worthwhile film, but it is a bit overrated.
