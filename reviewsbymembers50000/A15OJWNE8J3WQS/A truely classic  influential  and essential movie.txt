 This movie has always been one of my absolute favorites, and the new DVD version (which I just bought 2 days ago) is so loaded with extras as to be a necessary purchase by any SPINAL TAP fan. The mockumentary style was first perfected with Rob Reiner's amazing satire of a declining hard rock band, and this movie manages to serve both as a comedy, and an eerily authentic seeming documentary. The performances are all spectacular, although I'll always see Christopher Guest's performance as Nigel Tufnel, the lead guitarist, as the most inspired. That most of the dialogue was inprovised is amazing. That this movie is available with such a wealth of extras is amazing as well. For all fans of comedy, rock, or just plain fantastic cinema, buy this movie!!!
