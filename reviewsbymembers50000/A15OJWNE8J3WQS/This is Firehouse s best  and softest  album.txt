 Ok, I've been a decent Firehouse fan for awhile, but this album really put  them over the top to me. First, I have to warn anyone reading this that  Firehouse has gone much softer with this one. Much of the album approaches  country/rock tempos. It's worth it though. "Can's Stop the Pain",  "Bringing me Down" "The day..." are all fantastic  songs, and although different than old Firehouse, this album doesn't have  as much filler as their old albums did (that was always my biggest problem  with this band, 4 or 5 great songs per album, and a bunch of filler). If  you don't discriminate based on heaviness, and appreciate good music. You  will love this album. I listen to mostly hard rock, and one of my friends  hates ALL of my music, but she stole this CD after she heard it! Just buy  it, ok?
