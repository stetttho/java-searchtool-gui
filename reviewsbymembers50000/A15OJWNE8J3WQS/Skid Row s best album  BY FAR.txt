 This album went almost totally unnoticed and unappreciated when it was  released, which was not surprising considering the period. However, Skid  Row's swansong is a much more mature and focused record than anything else  they have ever producing. Moving past the hair metal posings of their debut  record, and the inconsistency of their second, this album puts the band on  a pedestal comparable (as surprising as this may sound), to Guns N Roses.  Yes, that may sound strange, but songs like "My Enemy",  "Firesign" and "Into Another" are that good. I was a  decent Skid Row fan until this album came out, but this one made me a huge  fan. All fans of great Hard Rock/Metal out there: Here's a great one you  would never expect!
