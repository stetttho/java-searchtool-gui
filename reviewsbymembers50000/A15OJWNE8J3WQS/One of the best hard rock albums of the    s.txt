 If you're into 80's hair rock, you can't go wrong with this one. This is  one of the few albums of the era (and even Bon Jovi's only), that is  consistent all the way through. All ten songs here are keepers, including  the hits: "Wanted Dead or Alive", "Livin on a Prayer",  and "You Give Love a Bad Name", and the strong album tracks  "I'd Die for You" (my fave), "Never Say Goodbye", and  "Without Love". If you have the extra money to throw around, you  even get a music video for "wanted" on here.      While CRUSH,  the new BJ album is a good one, part of its current success is a testament  to how strong this bands 80's output was. There's a reason why this album  sold over 10 millions copies people!
