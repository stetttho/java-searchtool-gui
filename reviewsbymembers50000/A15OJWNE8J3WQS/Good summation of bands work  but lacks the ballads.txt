 This is a fairly strong retrospective of an extremely talented and  aggressive rock band, that unfortunately goes a little too hard in  promoting them as aggressive, and unfortunately misses out on some of the  bands strongest slower work, such as "Hold on to my Heart",  "Forever Free", and "Breathe", 3 of the strongest rock  ballads you ever could find. I remember when THE HEADLESS CHILDREN came  out, and "Forever Free" came out and blew me away. I was sure it  would be a huge hit. I guess I forgot about what a nasty rep can do to a  band.     Anyways, despite these omissions, this compilation hits most of  the high points, including "F--- Like a beast", "Mean  Man", "Love Machine", "Blind in Texas", and  especially "Wild Child" my favorite WASP song.     For those that  don't know WASP, this is probably the best place to start. If you don't  know, this band sort of resembles Motley Crue with the aggression and  volume turned way up. For true metal fans you can't go wrong with this  stuff. Buy this one first, but be sure to get THE CRIMSON IDOL (their  amazingly sedate concept album), THE HEADLESS CHILDREN, and especially the  underrated STILL NOT BLACK ENOUGH (which has no tracks on this compilation  unfortunately). WASP rules!
