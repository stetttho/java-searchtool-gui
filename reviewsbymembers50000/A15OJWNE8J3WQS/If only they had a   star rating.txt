 THE AVENGERS is, hands down, one of the worst films that I've ever seen (and I've seen quite a few bad ones). I went to see it in the theatres with modest expectations, and proceeded to enjoy exactly 3 minutes of it (the cool opening titles). After that, I sat in astonished silence watching this obviously grossly expensive piece of trash. The fact that one of history's most dignified actors, Sean Connery, manages to give his single bad performance to date, is only one of the negatives on display here. THE AVENGERS occupies that strange void where it's badness can't even be laughed at. This movie is pure trash, and there are very few movies that I heatedly dislike. If you're reading this review and actually plan on buying this movie, I recommend you save your money. I'll never understand how such talented actors and such a large budget can create such disposable junk. Avoid this movie at all costs. Consider yourself warned.
