 This, quite simply, eclipses any of Megadeth's previous work (including  their pretty good new album, RISK). The band got a mixture of flack from  old fans, and praise from critics on this album, and for once I'm going to  side with the critics. As a collection of songs, as heavy metal that's  supposed to give you energy, to make you want to rock out, Megadeth has  really served up a classic here. Some fans detest this, but this album is  truly like Metallica's BLACK album, but better. Now, I love Metallica, and  in general like them more than Megadeth (I have ALL the albums by both  bands), but this one changed my perspective (and I was let down a little by  RISK).      Anyways, this is more of a departure from the bands more  progressive elements (where YOUTHANASIA really began the move towards a  more accessible sound). However, while Megadeth has gone more commercial  here, the result is an album that had great success on radio for a reason.  "Trust" is Megadeth's best song, period. It's a bit like a  catchier "Enter Sandmand". "Almost Honest", "A  Secret Place", "Use The Man", this entire album is  consistently strong, with the addition of one element that seriously  elevates Megadeth's music-hooks!       For fans of heavy metal  (particularly fans of Metallica's BLACK album), this is a must-have. This  is the place to start a Megadeth collection, as their most accessible  album. The old stuff, from the PEACE SELLS...BUT WHO'S BUYING period is  great, but CRYPTIC WRITINGS, like any truly great album, managed to change  my perspective (for the better) of this band forever. My only fear is that  they'll never live up to this album again.
