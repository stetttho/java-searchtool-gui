 I've always thought of WARRANT as one of the better 80's hair bands, and DIRTY ROTTEN... is their second best album, after the far superior CHERRY PIE. While this album isn't particularly original, the hit ballads "Heaven" and "Sometimes she Cries" are fantastic, and "Down Boys" is a perfectly fun cheesy rocker.      My only problem with this album might be attitude. This album in general lacks the trashy fun of CHERRY PIE, or albums such as SKID ROW's debut, or MOTLEY CRUES, DR. FEELGOOD. CINDERELLA and GREAT WHITE might be the most similar comparisons, although this album does have some simularities to much of WHITE LION'S work (although it lacks the complexity).     Anyways, for a solid 80's rock albun, this is a good choice. But I recommend casual fans to start with CHERRY PIE, or their GREATEST HITS (which I feel is the best way to go). And, for god's sake, stay away from the awful quasi-alterntave junk of their more recent releases (it all goes downhill after DOG EAT DOG).
