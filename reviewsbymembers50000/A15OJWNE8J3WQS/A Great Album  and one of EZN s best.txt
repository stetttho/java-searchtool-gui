 Enuff Z'Nuff has always been one of my favorite groups since their self-titled first album, and between that album and this one, they gone back and forth between heavieness (Animals with Human Intelligence, Paraphenelia), lighter more beatlesque sounds (Seven, Peachfuzz), and darker, more contemplative music (Tweaked and Strengh). Through it all, I've always found all of it extremely interesting, and although I know many fans of the band that didn't like SEVEN or TWEAKED I enjoyed both those albums immensely. 10 falls on the lighter side of the bands register, although its much darker than SEVEN, and more polished than TWEAKED. This is actually the most commercial album the band has made since their debut, and in many ways that's a good thing. "There Goes My Heart", the opening track for the album, is a pure pop song, kinda along the vein of Cheap Trick's "I want you to Want Me". The song is fantastic, and starts off the album well, being the most viable single. From there the album goes into the fantastic melodic rocker "Fly Away" and the  darker "The Beast". This album, like every Enuff album, is remarkably consistent. The strongest song, in my opinion, without question, is the powerful angry ballad "Wake Up". The band was reported as calling the song their "Stairway to Heaven" and its easy to make the association. This is a slowly building, emotional epic, and quite possibly the best song of the bands career. 10 is an extremely strong Enuff Z'Nuff album, which may not be as heavy as Paraphenalia (which was amazing), but its both lighter and more emotional, and worth every cent for any Enuff Z'Nuff fan.
