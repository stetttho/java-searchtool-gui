 I have to start by saying that I'm not a huge Warrant fan. While I own their first two albums, DFSR and CHERRY PIE, I think of Warrant as a solid but unexceptional hair band. After reading some good reviews here, I thought I'd take the chance and buy this album. Suffice to say, this one completely blew me away! Warrant, I didn't think you had it in you! First of all, its amazing how much more mature and heavy this album is, while still retaining enough fixture to their old sound, that shouldn't offend fans of their earlier work. "Hole in My Wall", "Bonfire" and "Quicksand" are great rockers, "April 2031" is an incredibably complex epic song, and the best on the album. "The Bitter Pill" is a great ballad. In my opinion, this is Warrant's best album, as its heavy and sophiticated enough for those who'd never normally listen to hair metal, yet it retains enough of the CHERRY PIE era bloozy grit to be relevant to fans of the old work. If you're a WARRANT fan, or just a fan of Hard Rock in general, try picking this one up, you may just find yourself pleasantly surprised.
