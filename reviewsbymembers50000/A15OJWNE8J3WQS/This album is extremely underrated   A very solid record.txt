 This album is unfairly harped upon in many of the reviews here as a weak FIREHOUSE effort. In fact, while this album is softer than HOLD YOUR FIRE, probably the bands heaviest effort, the album as a whole is more similar to their first two albums than CATAGORY 5 is.     The result is an album that strikes the middle ground. "Love is a Dangerous Thing" is a strong mid-paced rocker, somewhat in the lines of a softer "Reach for the Sky". "Here for You" and "I live my Life for You" are two of the bands best ballads. Quite simply, if you love the bands output (specifically CATAGORY 5), you should love this album. If you find either of their first two albums not heavy enough, you probably won't like this one. But if you're willing to respect music on its own terms, you'll find this to be a satisfying album. I read the negative reviews here, and as a result, waited a long time before finally buying it. The result? I was very pleasantly surprised. Buy it, and you will be too.
