 I actually would probably give this album 4 1/2 stars instead of 5 because  it has a couple of week tracks. Other than that, I love Firehouse.  "All She Wrote", "Don't Treat Me Bad", and "Love  of A Lifetime" are worth the price of the CD alone (and no other songs  really come close). However, as much as some people seem to disagree with  me, I really like some of Firehouse's newer work more. HOLD YOUR FIRE is a  superior album in my opinion, and CATAGORY 5 is their best, and the first  one I'd buy as a casual listener (besides a hits compilation if that's all  you're really going for).        If I had to compare Firehouse to other  groups in this genre, I'd put BON JOVI, and DANGER DANGER ahead (if you  like Firehosue you've got to look into both of those groups), but all of  their work eclipses the likes of GREAT WHITE or WHITESNAKE.  If you're into  any of these groups mentioned, or any of the others in the genre, this,  HOLD YOUR FIRE, and CATAGORY 5, are the albums to get...and if you like  these guys, check out ENUFF Z NUFF, truly the best melodic rock group out  there.        If you didn't get the idea earlier, this album's worth it for  any fan of hair metal. Buy it.
