 FEAR NO EVIL is Slaughter's strongest release to date. The album rocks hard, and is probably their heaviest effort yet. What makes this album (and a lot of Slaughter's work) so special is the bands amazing knack at combining hard rock with loads and loads of catchy hooks. The band is extremely pop-savvy, which may not sound like a complement for a hard rock band, but in this case, the melodies add to the music, rather than blunting its power. The opener, "Live Like there's No Tomorrow" is one of the bands heaviest songs, and also one of their best. "Get Used To It" is one of my favorite Slaughter songs, and in the same league (if not superior) with "Up All Night" and "Eye to Eye". "Hard Times" is another fantastic rock song in the classic Slaughter style, with heavy riffs and a great chorus. "It'll Be Alright" is definitely my fave song on the album, and possibly Slaughter's best song yet. A departure for the band, the song is a poppy but amazingly epic ballad, that recalls the best of the Beatles(!) or bands such as Enuff Znuff. The song has the typical Slaughter progression that bursts into a lively chorus, but here is an example where a band transcends even its own ambitions. FEAR NO EVIL is a vastly underrated and extremely enjoyable rock album, and one that fans of anything that rocks should get behind, and ignore the bands hair-metal associations of the past.
