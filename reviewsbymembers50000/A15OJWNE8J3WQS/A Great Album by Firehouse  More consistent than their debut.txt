 I like this album a great deal, and find it to be an overall stronger and  more mature collection than FIREHOUSE, their debut album. Although this one  doesn't have as many of the big hits (Love of a Lifetime, Don't Treat me  Bad, and All She Wrote), it does have the great Top 10 ballad "When I  look into your eyes" (These guys have always had a great touch with  the ballads). Anyways, besides that hit, you'll also find several other  great songs, including the rocking opener "Reach for the Sky",  and my favorite song on the album, the "Sleeping with You", a  goofy, rocking ode to getting some action. If you're a Firehouse fan, this  is a definite must-own. As for new fans, you might want to go with the  debut first, as it has most of the big hits, but FIREHOUSE, HOLD YOUR FIRE,  and their new album CATAGORY 5 are the definite purchases for any Firehouse  fan.
