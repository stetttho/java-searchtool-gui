 "Say it isn't So" has the potential to be a huge BON JOVI hit,  as it manages to kind of merge a MATCHBOX TWENTY style sound with the old  arena rock BON JOVI style. Now I know that might not sound that appealing,  don't get my wrong, because I hate MATCHBOX TWENTY. This song, however,  manages to take a happy medium, as a medium-paced chugging rocker, that's  in the sing-along tradition of all their early hits. This is the kind of  song that makes you realize what bands like MATCHBOX TWENTY or THREE DOORS  DOWN would sound like if they had BON JOVI's talent.
