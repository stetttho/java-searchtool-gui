 I'm sorry, but I just have never really liked Great White. I love 80's  hair metal, and even enjoy disposable bands like Trixter, but this is one  album I could never get into. Besides the cover of Ian Hunter's "Once  Bitten Twice Shy", which is great, this album just doesn't work for  me. "The Angel Song" is a prime example of why so many critics  hated the power ballad back in the 80's. Buy BON JOVI, buy POISON, buy  DANGER DANGER, or FIREHOUSE, but I recommend staying away from GREAT WHITE.
