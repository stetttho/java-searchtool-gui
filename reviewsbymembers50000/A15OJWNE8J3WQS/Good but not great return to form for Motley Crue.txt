 Let me start out by saying that this is MOTLEY CRUE's best album since DR  FEELGOOD (which eclipses any of their albums in terms of quality). NEW  TATOO definitely shows a return to the good old days of 80's style metal by  the band, which is both a good and a bad thing. It's good because this band  put out some of the 80's best rock songs ("Dr Feelgood", and  "Same Ol Situation" being my faves), and their is material here  remnsicent of those old hits ("Hell on High Wheels" and "1st  Band on the Moon" are pretty effective, old school rockers). However,  good that this album is, it feels a bit like a tired dilution of their  earlier work. The production job by Mike Clink (of Guns N Roses) really  pushed Vince Neil's vocals back in the mix, and ends up taking a lot of  power out of the album (it just doesn't have the crisp, heavy production of  DR FEELGOOD). The ballads, including the title song, are decent but  unexceptional, and the whole album doesn't match many of their peers new  albums (Def Leppard's, Bon Jovi's, and Poison's new releases are all  stronger and fresher sounding than this one). I love MOTLEY CRUE, and I  like this album, and its worth the purchase to fans, but for casual  listeners, I recommend starting either with DR FEELGOOD, GIRLS, GIRLS,  GIRLS, or the GREATEST HITS.
