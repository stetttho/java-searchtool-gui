 All those Rap/Rock bands out there haven't figured it out. It was Faith No  More's seemless cross-genre blend they've been trying to emulate, and the  more I listen to FNM, the more I realize how amazing this band is.       This is FNM's most accessible album, and the one for first time listeners  to buy. ANGEL DUST is FNM's true classic, but this is also one amazing  album, with "Epic", "Falling to Pieces", "The Real  Thing", and "Zombie Eaters" being the highlights. Faith No  More is my absolute favorite band, and as popular as this album was, it  still didn't get the attention it deserved. If you have to sell a kidney to  buy this album, it's worth it.
