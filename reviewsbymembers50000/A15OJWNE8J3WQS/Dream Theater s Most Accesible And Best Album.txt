 This is Dream Theater's best album, one that non-DT fans could like, but  also one that big DT fans might spurn. This truly is a move towards AOR by  Dream Theater-and in a lot of ways I consider that a good thing. Songs like  "You Not Me", "Burning My Soul", and "Hollow  Years" are some of their strongest songs yet, and they are tighter and  more accessible than any of the bands previous work.     Why I like this  album so much however, is because the album allows itself to have it both  ways. There are still the 10 minute epics like "Lines in the  Sand" and "Peruvian Skies", but they are blended into a  consistent whole that makes this album one for more than just those  enamored with DT's technical, rather than songwriting abilities. This is an  album that the non-musician can enjoy for the music, rather than simply the  complex and unusual time signatures (which are still here in many places).  Quite simply, this is the definite album for a new Dream Theater album to  buy, and one that should be judged more objectively by those out there that  want only technical proficiency on their DT albums, rather than soul.
