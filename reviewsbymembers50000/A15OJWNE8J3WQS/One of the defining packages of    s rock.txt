 If you are truly looking to rock out 80's style, there are few better  places to go than Def Leppard. This collection covers all the hits, as well  as one new song "When Love and Hate Collide", that's actually a  pretty decent ballad. Although most of the pre-Pyromania stuff gets  overlooked, and "Make Love Like a Man" isn't around, for a  non-stop trip back to a time when music still rocked, look no further.
