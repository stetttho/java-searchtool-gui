 This is an excellent insatllment in the ongoing story and adventure of Harry Potter. There is a lot of mystery in this book as well as a lot of character development. Harry is definitely a teenage boy and his emotions are surfacing now more than ever. It is a lot darker and more serious than the other books, but it has just as much magic and humor and fun adventure if not more.  You cannot read this book without having read those that came before it. And you cannot miss this one if you've read the first four. In fact, after completing this book, I went back and reread the first four. They are all so magical.  Thank you, Ms. Rowling.
