 This CD has the song Oh Yeah! that is most commonly recognized from Ferris Bueller's Day Off. But, you cannot judge this CD by that song alone. Compared to the rest of the CD, 'Oh Yeah!' is a horribly boring track.  The music is timeless. Each track is different, different style, different language. There are great rhythms, some latin, some electronic, some heavy metal. Far from boring. Great music to accompany just about any activity.
