 I've sought out a few texts on the topic of pragmatics. This book does a nice job of keeping the reader engaged. To be honest, pragmatics is not really my strength so I have to say that I may not be a good jusge of the content. However, bearing that weakness in mind, I am appreciative of this writing as it has helped me to understand more clearly the study of pragmatics, a topic which I have difficulty grasping.
