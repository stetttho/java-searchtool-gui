 Okay, I'm not sure but I may be one of the select few people on this earth who owns nearly every CD involving Moulin Rouge.  In a moment of obsession and spontaneity (okay it was more like a month of it), I collected as much music from the movie as I could and was happy to come along this little gem.  The song 'Come What May' is touching to me (sap, sap, mush, mush). I really like it. If you have the first soundtrack, you've got one version already. The Josh G Abrams Mix is pretty awesome, it's the one they play in the music video (on the DVD). Next to the original film version (which is found on the second soundtrack), it's my favorite.  As for the other two tracks, the Lady Marmalade mix is rather thumpy and annoying. I don't think I've listened to it all the way through. But, if you're into that thumpy, bumpy house music techno, you'll dig it. The Elephant Medley is okay. I haven't actually attempted a Karoake night with it, but when it comes on it's a little game to see if I can remember the words.  All in all, a good CD. Have fun.
