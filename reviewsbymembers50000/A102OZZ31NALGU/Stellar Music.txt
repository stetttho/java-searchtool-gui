 I can't believe I haven't reviewed this CD until now. I saw the movie several months after it came out while living in Finland. I had to wait several more months until I came back to the United States before being able to order it. It was a long and painful wait. If you do not own it, click 'Purchase' right now. Stop reading. Buy it. Why are you still reading? Go! Now! Before this soundtrack, I had never heard of Edward Shearmur. I will not soon forget. This music is incredible. He did an amazing job of capturing the intriguing character of Prot and the mystery of the story. The music is quite moving and very innovative. He uses a lot of different sounds and produces many different feelings, and sometimes if you close youre eyes you even feel like you're moving.  Oh, words just do not do it justice.   Go! Now! Buy it. You'll love it.
