 I first played this game with my family while we were cooped up in a cabin up north. I have never laughed so hard at a game. Ever since, I've been trying to find my own copy of the game...and haven't found until now. I heard they had stopped making it. Fortunately, here it is!  The game is pretty simple. Each person picks a card with a question on it. The questions can be serious, simple, funny, gross, offensive, endearing and much more. (The one that haunts me still is "Who here is most likely to have a closet full of clothes from the 70's?") Each person votes for one person for each of the questions. You then choose whether you got most, some or none of the votes for each question. The person with the most points wins. (Just being a little tyke in the late 70's I'm still confused as to why I got all of the votes for the 70's question.) I have played this game with close friends and even with people I have just met. Either way it's a whole lot of fun. Some of the questions can be taken offensive. You can skip them or go for them. It's a game. Have fun with it!
