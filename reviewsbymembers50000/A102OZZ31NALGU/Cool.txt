 Harry Gregson-William came up with a pretty sweet score for the movie. Spy Game was another movie where I decided to get the soundtrack for the score ten minutes in. Sometimes the little techno buzz gets repetitious but I enjoy it, it's pretty funky and more exciting than your average score. There are also a lot of parts that are very moving, sometimes more moving than the film itself. The remix track is pretty cool, too. Bank on the music from the movie, though. It's worth it.
