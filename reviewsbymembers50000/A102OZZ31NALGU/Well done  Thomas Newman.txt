 I must confess, I've not seen the movie. I plan to....but I purchased this CD based solely on the impeccable merits of Thomas Newman's composing. If you are a fan of his work in the slightest, you will enjoy his work here. Filled with the unpredictable melodies and rhythms that sets his work apart, this soundtrack is more than background music for a movie. It is great music to listen to and enjoy, relaxing or getting work done. I confess that I still think American Beauty is his best work. But the music for Finding Nemo is no less excellent than any of his work.  The Robbie Williams track at the end is okay. I prefer 'Beyond the Sea' performed by someone with a more full and smooth voice. If you're looking for more of Robbie in that kind of style, I would recommend 'Swing When You're Winning'.
