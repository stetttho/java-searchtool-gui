 If you enjoyed the movie you'll enjoy this soundtrack. Each track vividly reminds you of the movie scene in which it was played. And even if you didn't like the movie, there are some fun tunes on here. There are several classics such as 'Love Is In the Air' by John Paul Young, 'Perhaps, Perhaps, Perhaps' by Doris Day, 'Os Quindins De Ya Ya' by Stanley Black as well as a sweet cover of 'Time After Time'.  It's all good for listening to, relaxing to, but most of, for dancing to!
