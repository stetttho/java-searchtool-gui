 Okay, I bought this CD instead of the score. It's okay. It isn't as good as the score and doesn't get listened to nearly as often, but it's not bad. The mix is a little weird Peggy Lee, The Who, and Bobby Darin don't exactly blend well. I wouldn't recommend letting it play the whole way through. However, the individual songs are quite good and I am pleased to have them a part of my personal music collection.
