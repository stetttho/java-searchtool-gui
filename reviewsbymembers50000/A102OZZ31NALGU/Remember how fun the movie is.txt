 The soundtrack is even more fun. The songs are good ones, the kind you like to sing along to, including the puppy dog song from the beginning of the movie....the one where I said to the person next to me "I've got to get the soundtrack." I'm getting annoyed, though, with all of the soundtracks that have the Cranberries 'Dreams'. It's a good song, but I'll bet I have it ten times over in my CD collection.  Nevertheless, get the soundtrack. It's fun, good music for doing whatever your doing.  Have a good day!
