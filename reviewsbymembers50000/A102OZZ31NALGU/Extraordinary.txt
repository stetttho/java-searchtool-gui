 After listening to this music, Thomas Newman soon became my all-time favorite composer. He uses a different style and so many different sounds and rhythms than other composers. When you listen, you do not feel like you're watching a movie in your head or missing part of some message. This music stands alone. It is powerful and moving. It's emotional and fun.  Your music collection is incomplete without this score.
