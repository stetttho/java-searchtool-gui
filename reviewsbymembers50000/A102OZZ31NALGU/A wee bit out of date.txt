 This was a required text for a course I took in bilingualism. I had high hopes for the book but was unfortunately disappointed at its narrow scope. And, it is horribly out of date. The first chapter, even in its newest edition, refers to Russia as USSR. There are a lot of theories of bilingualism discussed, mostly explained well enough to get the idea. But sometimes, it seems as though the author gets caught up in the explaining and forgets to get to the point. On a positive note, there are numerous examples of bilingual speech presented, many from the author's own experience. The case studies in the latter half of the book are quite interesting as well. All in all, I would say if you're getting started in the study of bilingualism, this is an okay book to get your feet wet. Howeve, I wouldn't depend solely on this work.
