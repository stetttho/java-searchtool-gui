 I grew up listening to Kenny Loggins and this was one of the tapes of his I completely wore out as a kid! It's positive, uplifting and cheerful music...makes you want to dance and sing along. Vox Humana (the song) has some great sounds. Let There Be Love is my all time favorite from this album, in fact this is why I bought the CD...the tape I had is completely shredded at that point in the tape. Forever is a classic and all the others are just as fun as the rest. If you're looking for something fun and classically eighties, give this a shot. You won't regret it.
