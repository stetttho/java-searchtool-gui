 I'm using this text for college level introductory course in Syntax. The book is a really good source for the basics of X-Bar theory. A few of the concepts lack clear examples, but overall it does a great job of explaining things. In fact, it's clarity (for the most part) helps me sort out what my professor is blathering about. I refer to the book more than my class notes for help in analysing data.  I think this is a great book for both students and also those with an interest in linguistics and would like to pursue Syntax in more depth.
