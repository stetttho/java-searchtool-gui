 Billy Barber is an extremely talented keyboardist and a gifted composer. Each piece on the Lighthouse album is unique and enjoyable. This is a CD I was fortunate to have while growing up. I love listening to it today just as much as when I was younger. The music is fun, intelligent, uplifting and very spirited.
