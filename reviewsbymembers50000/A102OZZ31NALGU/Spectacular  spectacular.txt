 ...No words in the vernacular can describe this great event, you'll be dumb with wonderment. The price is fixed at [$$$], you must agree that's excellent. And on top of your fee, you'll be involved artistically (dancing on your bed and singing in the car). So exciting, I couldn't help but stop and cheer. So delighting, it will run for fifty years (permanent spot in my CD player).  Elephants, Arabians, Indians and courtesans, Acrobats, and juggling bears, exotic girls, fire eaters! Musclemen, contortionists, intrigue danger and romance. Electric lights, machinery. Oh the electricity.  If you love the film, you'll adore the soundtrack. Get the collecter's edition. You won't regret it.
