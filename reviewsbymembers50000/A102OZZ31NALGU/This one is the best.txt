 I've read all of the installemts so far (including Year 5) and Year 3 is by far the best. I can't say much about what makes this one the best, I don't want to give it away! I highly recommend that you get this book and discover each and every event, big and small, as the story unfolds. This story holds some very exciting secrets....so much so that it's hard to keep your eyes from jumping ahead on the page. Don't forget to read the books that precede this one. There is more to enjoy by reading the first books. Follow this one up with books 4 and 5. The story continues in great style.
