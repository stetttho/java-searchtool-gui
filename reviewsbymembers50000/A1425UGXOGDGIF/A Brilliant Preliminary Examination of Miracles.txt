 The acclaimed logic of C.S. Lewis displayed in _Miracles: A Preliminary Study_ reveals much more than the author's genius.  Intended to examine the great crux of Christianity, miracles, Lewis also contributes a relevant and thorough view of God and nature. Lewis first proposes two basic attitudes towards the natural world: (1) Naturalism - a worldview that suggests a closed natural system.  "Any reality beyond what can be perceived by the five senses lacks plausability" (Duriez, 2000).  (2) Supernaturalism - a worldview that views the universe as a dependent creation of God.  "Time, space, and geometry are all God's creation, and these only exist now because he chose to make them out of nothing" (Duriez, 2000).   Ultimately, Lewis concludes, "if naturalism is true, miracles are impossible.  If supernaturalism is true, miracles are possible and, indeed, to be expected" (Duriez, 2000).   Much of Lewis' background in his study of miracles originated in the attention he gave to _Theism and Humanism_, the Gifford Lectures for 1914. Readers should understand that Lewis wrote _Miracles_ as a preliminary examination based on his own incomplete research and thoughts on God and nature.  Therefore, the book should never be criticized for its loose ends.  It stands as one of the most thoughtful and thorough treatises of the concept.
