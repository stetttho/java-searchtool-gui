 Peck "makes no distinction between the mind and the spirit, and therefore no distinction between the process of achieving spiritual growth and achieving mental growth.  They are one and the same" (p. 11). Peck's contribution is both thoroughly practical and thoroughly academic.  Filled with case studies and personal antidotes that bring clarity to our understanding of basic concepts such as dependency, discipline, love, growth, and grace, the book is a noble and worthy attempt in the integration of psychology and religion.
