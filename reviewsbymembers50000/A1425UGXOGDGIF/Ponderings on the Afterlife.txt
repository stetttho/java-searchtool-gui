 Lewis loved to use fiction to explore his own ponderings of theological issues, including the afterlife.  The book is in no way a portrayal of a dogmatic view of the afterlife by Lewis but is an incredible exploration thereof.  Lewis tends to salvation and damnation very sensitively (Durez, 1990).  He also uses the story as an opportunity to "highlight practical matters of the Christian faith such as family problems, selfishness, disagreement, greed, and the persistence of bad habits.  Fantasy proves a powerful medium for examining such matters, remembered long after a sermon is forgotten" (Durez, 1990).   The favorite book of Lewis himself!!!
