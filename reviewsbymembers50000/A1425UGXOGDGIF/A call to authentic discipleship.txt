 Willard wisely reexamines discipleship in light of the modern polarization of the Church and offers a profound perspective on what it means to follow Christ in our day.  This book is relevant, articulate, and nonreactive.  It will speak to those searching for new ways to understand faith and those reevaluating denominational dogma; it will speak to those who desire to follow Christ and those who are confused about religion altogether.  A rare intellectual masterpiece for our time, I find this book a must read for all those currently struggling with interdenominational dialogue, the essence of Christian discipleship, and the prospects of fresh faith.
