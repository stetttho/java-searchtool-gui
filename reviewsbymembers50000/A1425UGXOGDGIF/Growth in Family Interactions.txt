 In the context of an absorbing story of one family's therapy, Augustus Napier, with his cotherapist, teacher, and the founder of the symbolic-experiential model of family therapy, Carl Whitaker, articulately presents many of the most provocative and cutting-edge concepts in family psychology making the book a user's guide for anyone in a family or interested in better understanding the phenomenal interactions and implications thereof.  Whitaker's model, exemplified throughout the therapy, "is a multi-generational approach that addresses both individual and family relational patterns in the process of therapy.  Oriented toward personal growth (rather than stability) and family connectedness, the therapist assumes a pivotal role in helping family members dislodge rigid and repetitive ways of interacting and substituting more spontaneous and flexible ways of accepting and dealing with their impulses" (Goldenberg & Goldenberg, 2000).   The premise of the symbolic-experiental model is that "it is experience, not education, that changes families" (Keith and Whitaker, 1982). The engaging account of the Brice's therapy, alongside other personal antidotes and systematic explanations by Napier and Whitaker, provides a greater understanding of one's self (esp. learning how to experience oneself in a new way) and the implications of a systemic approach to all human interaction.
