 Just as popular author and psychiatrist, M. Scott Peck, M.D., (The Road Less Traveled, etc.) contends, Cloud and Townsend resoundingly conclude that "All growth is spiritual growth" (p. 9).   The authors face the classic dilemma of theological and psychological integration: "It seemed to me that there was the spiritual life, where we learned about God and grew in our relationship to him, and then there was the emotional and relational life, where we learned how to solve real-life problems" (p. 19).  Cloud and Townsend answered the challenge head-on by seeking the Bible as their sole authority in all of life and behavior and now teach wholeheartedly "the Bible as the source for teaching about growth and healing" (p. 10). The book, therefore, examines three areas of growth: (1) Knowing God more deeply [what we traditionally have called 'spiritual growth']; (2) Knowing yourself more deeply [emotional growth]; (3) And knowing others more deeply [relational growth].
