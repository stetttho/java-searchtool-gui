 C.S. Lewis himself regarded Til We Have Faces at times to be his best book (Durez, 1990).  The myth is exploding with symbolism and metaphors, wherein Lewis explores his own ponderings on love, religion, salvation, suffering, and reason.  I have read the book twice and found tremendous substance in the overarching theme: A gulf transfixed between good and evil in Creation, a concept reviewed many times over on the popular Lewis site, Intro. to the Wardrobe (check it out!).
