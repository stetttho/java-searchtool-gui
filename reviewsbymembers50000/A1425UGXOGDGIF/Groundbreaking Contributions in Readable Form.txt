 Damasio's physiological analysis of emotion, reason, and consciousness contributes groundbreaking knowledge to the study of being and self, (as the Philadelphia Inquirer puts it) "tap-dancing on the edge between philosophy and science."   Damasio's contributions have been recognized and taught as the foremost understanding of the subject in the field by such psychology textbooks as Biological Psychology (7th edition) by James Kalat, one of the most commonly utilized sources for teaching physiological psychology in academia.   Damasio studies the case of Phineas Gage among other knowledge in the field to assemble neurochemical explanations for brain-body interactions, as well as presenting a thorough study of "the neural underpinnings of reason," challenging "the traditional views on the nature of rationality" (p. xi).   A stunning work!
