 A good friend (1) Makes time; (2) Keeps a secret; (3) Cares deeply; (4) Provides space; (5) Speaks the truth; (6) Forgives faults; (7) Remains faithful; (8) Laughs Easily; (9) Celebrates a success; (10) Says a prayer. The Parrotts pack a wealth of theological and psychological truth into what is definitely more than a 'pretty little, hardcover, giftbook'.  Though small and concise, the book is thorough and clear, and thoroughly enjoyable.  It is full of classic quotes and personal antidotes, as well as the undergirding knowledge of the field of personal and relational growth.  Easy to read in one sitting, the book's concepts will remain classic for the duration.
