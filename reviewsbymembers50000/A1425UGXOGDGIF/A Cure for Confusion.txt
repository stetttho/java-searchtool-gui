 Known for being one of the great hermeneutical works of our time, Knowing Scripture encompasses all that modern conservative biblical interpretation demands in a pragmatic, clear approach to studying the Bible for oneself. Written for the layman and the theologian, Sproul presents the Bible as God's Word for all men in all times, to be understood in the context of its original meaning and historical setting.  R.C. Sproul is articulate in defining the concept of "lay renewal" in the search for the truth behind "an enigma capable of vastly different interpretations (p. 11)." "Is there any way out of this confusion? Can serious readers find any principles to guide them through the conflicting viewpoints they hear from all sides? These are some of the questions that this book is designed to deal with (p. 12)."
