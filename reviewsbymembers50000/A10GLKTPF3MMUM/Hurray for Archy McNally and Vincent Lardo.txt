 As expressed by other reviewers, I was devastated too by the death of Lawrence Sanders.  I figured that would be the end of the detective books I have come to love.  If you are a member of Alcoholics Anonymous, do not read these books.  Gratuitous imbibing was part and parcel of Sander's genre and thankfully Vincent Lardo has tempered down all the boozing a little!  Even Archy is trying to cut down on his English Ovals!  I am very glad that Mr. Lardo has taken up this effort for those of us who enjoyed this light, tongue very well placed in cheek, series.  This is light reading and the intention is too entertain completely which it does.  Again, many thanks, Mr. Lardo.
