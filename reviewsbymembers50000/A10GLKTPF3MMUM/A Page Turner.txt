 I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  The characters were quite interesting and  the author depicted small town life in Middle America amazingly well.  Some  devices included by the author were quite effective.  Certain phrases stuck  in the characters' minds and were repeated through out the book.   "Where the Heart is" was one of these phrases.  These phrases  become mantras for the characters and guide their direction on their  journey. This story embodies the notion of "living from the  heart".  Novalee Nation, the main character, lives from her heart as  she has little else.  The "family" that she cobbles together  including a black photographer by the name of Moses Whitecotton, a  descendant of slaves, is heart warming. Novalee puts a fine family together  and shows us that human beings can flourish when our traditional family of  origin is not up to par or is not available to us.
