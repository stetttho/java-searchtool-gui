 Francis Bacon said that some books are to be tasted, some chewed, and others swallowed and digested.  This book is not a taster.  It is a digester.....assimilate the lifeblood of the author's methodology for seeing in your mind's eye that which you want your life to be all about.  I am no artist, but I am creative in other ways.  The author is an art therapist.  I could have been put off by the artsy approach since I did poorly in art in school as a child.  Putting all that aside and starting to assemble the collage of my life and weave the patches of the quilt of my life is what this book is about.  I was so impressed that I got my hands on some of the authors other books too. My collage is not finished yet, but then, neither is my life :-)
