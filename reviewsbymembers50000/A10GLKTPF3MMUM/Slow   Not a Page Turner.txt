 I agree with all the other reviewers!  However, let me make one observation.  All the other reviewers that rated the book highly appear to be women.  This book is an "adventure"/journey/sojourn of a woman and I found it very, ahhh, "Oprahesque".......people who like Oprah's picks will like this book.  I read the predecessor to this book, know the characters from that book, and enjoyed this story less.  Don't give up here on my review because Kingsolver had some choice nuggets in this book that I will discuss farther down.  I found the book very slow going, not a page turner at all.  The characters are quirky if not downright eccentric.  The plot is really really out there.  Mom and daughter watch man fall into Hoover Dam???  Then go on Oprah??  Whoda thunk?  Then an Indian lawyer spots them on TV and decides to go after Mom?  Sheeesh! What I do like is the author's insights into human nature and keen observations on the human condition.  She puts these into tiny "nuggets" of expression and sprinkles them lightly throughout.  I just wish they were sprinkled a little more generously I guess. Here's an example:  I thought the Author's description of Jax, Taylor's boyfriend, and their relationship was great.  Jax really is crazy about Taylor but Taylor is lukewarm at best about her feelings for Jax.  Unfortunately, this is a minor thread in the story.  Jax says: " Sex will get you through times with no money better than money will get you through times with no sex".   Also, Taylor's mom, after joining the Cherokee Nation and attending her first Indian Stomp Dance reflects on feeling completely included in something for the first time in a long time in her life.  Those insights into the human condition are what I love in Kingsolver's writing.  I guess I want more of those nuggets of her observation. The nuggets were few and far between.
