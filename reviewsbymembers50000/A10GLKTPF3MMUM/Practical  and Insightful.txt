 Orrin Judd's review above is pure rubbish.  This book was great.  Yes, Orrin, you are out of step with the other reviewers and life on this planet too!  Anyone who writes or aspires to needs this book. True, Anne Lamott's experiences, which she writes about, may not be of interest to all people.  However, for me, I always liked to write at school as a student and on the job too.  I always wondered about writers because although I enjoy it, I marvel at those who do it so well. In another of Anne Lamott's books, "Operating Instructions", she writes about her pregnancy and the birth of her son.  I am a male, and found that book fascinating.  I find her writing about her personal experiences gives me insight into the human condition and that book gave me insights into motherhood, as this book gave me insights into being a writer.  Thanks Anne. The title of "Bird by Bird", by the way, refers to an anecdote that the author put in the book about her brother.  Her brother almost fatally procrastinated for a school report about Birds. Anne's father sat down with him, and guided the nascent writer to merely take on this enormous project, "bird by bird".  The insight of starting somewhere, and getting some tasks accomplished, is very apropos to many projects in our lives that seem overwhelming.  Thus, this anecdote, is not only apropos to writing, but to life in general. The book's chapters are divided into topics like First Drafts, Plot, Characters, Dialogue, Getting Started etc.  I found the manner in which Anne parsed/segmented/broke down the writer's tasks into these smaller components helpful.
