 The number of characters introduced in the first two chapters numbers around 20!  Way too many to learn about!  I had to make myself a listing so I could keep track of who is who just to get into the book.  There's a fire at the Painted Ladies, those colorful Victorian homes in San Francisco that have become an icon for the city on the bay. Police, firemen, and just regular people are introduced at the fire, then we move into the political arena District Attorney's office, Mayor, etc. very, very quickly.  Sort of confusing but hang in there.
