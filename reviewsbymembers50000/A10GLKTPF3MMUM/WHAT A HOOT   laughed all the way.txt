 I love John Candy and Dan Ackroyd in this film.  Be willing to suspend any requirement you may have for reality and let your imagination run with the plot.  THIS IS A VERY HONEST PORTRAYAL (IF STEREOTYPICAL) OF CHICAGO RESIDENTS WHO LEAVE CHICAGO TO GO NORTH TO WISCONSIN FOR VACATION (I've lived in Chicago). The film is not aging well, but, alas, John Candy is no longer with us so we have to content ourselves with what we have of John Candy and be grateful for the medium that has preserved his talent for us to still enjoy.  The movie is reminiscent of the "Vacation" movies with Chevy Chase.  I actually "guffawed", a huge belly laugh, at some of the stunts in this movie, especially the scene where John Candy is driving a car pulling a speed boat on a trailer.  I agree with all of the positive reviewers here and just had to put my two cents in too.  A scene at the beginning of the movie where John Candy's character talks his wife out of her bra while the kids are outside playing and another crack about using the washing machine as a substitute for sex, should have probably earned this movie a PG-13 rating instead of a straight PG.  I noticed some negative reviews here from folks who showed the flick to too young viewers.  BE SURE TO WATCH THE MOVIE THROUGH TO THE END.  THERE IS A GREAT DANCE SCENE AT THE END WHILE THE CREDITS ARE RUNNING~~
