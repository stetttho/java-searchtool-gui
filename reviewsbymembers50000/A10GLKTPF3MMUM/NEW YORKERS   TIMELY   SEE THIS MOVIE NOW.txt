 I am writing this review years after first seeing this movie. Why?  Look at Amazon's Theatrical Information for this movie which lists all the locales in New York State that the film was shot. Many locales are listed in Upstate New York.      There is currently a controversy raging in New York because the Attorney General, Elliott Spitzer, referred to New York State, especially upstate, as "Appalachian" in its economic character.   Mr. Spitzer is running for Governor of NEW YORK, and his comment resonates with many but offends others, thus, the controversy.    This movie, made years ago, validates Spitzer's comment and beautifully, but sadly, depicts the "Appalachian" character of upstate New York.   See this movie and you will get Academy Award Winning/Nominated level acting, gorgeous but sad cinematography, and validation of what is going on in NEW YORK today, years after this movie was first made.  The movie ages like a fine wine, just like Paul Newman too.
