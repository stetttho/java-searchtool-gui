 I enjoyed this book.  The author has a voice that is quite descriptive without being long-winded.  What I found enthralling, was her manner of interplay and interaction among her characters.  She captures the subtle  nuance of complex human emotion & motive without using lengthy  conversation among the characters.    Rather, the author reveals her  characters' minds and hearts and shows us into their lives, often through  brief description of non-verbal communication or a discussion of the  characters' thoughts.  I found this device compelling. In one description  of Alice Bynum's mixed emotions about her souring maid job for financially  overextended white folks, the author reveals a mixture of emotions where  the negative emotions of peevishness dominate the ideal positives of human  compassion and empathy.  I felt the character's chagrin at this shortfall  of attaining the ideal mind set.   The author painted complex emotional  pictures in my mind without using extensive descriptive passages. In a  few sentences, Breena Clarke can summarize a character's complex emotions.   Johhnie Mae, the oldest daughter of Alice and Willie Bynum, is confused as  she enters puberty at the same time her mother is expecting a new baby.   The author summarizes Johnnie Mae's heart when Johnnie Mae wonders how the  new baby will effect the balance of power in her family: " Again  there was a shift, a realignment of the tectonic plates of the family  ground.  The earth beneath them was shifting and they would be moved by  it........" All in all, a very interesting read.  The author has a  powerful voice.
