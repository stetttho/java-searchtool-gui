 I agree with the one other reviewer of this book on the PSALMS and take no issue with that review.  However, I wish to review from another angle......that of the beginner to the study of scripture.  This book is not a book for beginners.  It is very academic.  When I purchased this book, because it is short, less than 100 pages, I assumed it would be sort of a "primer" introduction to the study of the Psalms.  That it is NOT!  My Bible study class is studying the Psalms at my church and I am sure most people in the class studying the Psalms for the first time would be quite put off by this book.  One thing that I find quite troublesome, even for an academic treatment is this:  Brueggemann cites name of other authors in the text and then does not place a citation for that author reference in the bibliography.  The practice of doing this is drilled into any high school student writing their first term paper and Brueggemann is lax in this regard as is the publisher who allowed that oversight and lack of rigor by Brueggemann, an academic author who should know better.
