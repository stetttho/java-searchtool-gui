 I got this book to help a 13 year old read aloud.  She is struggling with her reading and rarely reads voluntarily so there's heavy expectations here.  I loved the book with its small town poignancy and the characterization of Grandma.  I lived in Chicago for 7 years and did not get "down state" as often as I would have liked.  The expressions and antics of Grandma were very evocative of small town Midwest USA.  The story takes place South of Urbana Champaign IL, although the exact town where Grandma lives is never mentioned, three or four surrounding towns and other landmarks like Salt Creek pinpoint the locale in the Argenta, Farmer City, Bement, Tuscola area of Illinois. Mention is made "of walking outside the county across Route 36".  This is rural middle America at its quirky best. Although this is a childrens' book, children may not appreciate the poignancy of the ending as Joey and Grandma wave goodbye at the end probably for the last time as he goes off to World War II.   Now the experiment!  Will the 13 year old get away from MTV land long enough to sit down and read aloud?
