 Each character in this novel is wounded in some way.  Caney, the proprietor of the diner in which the story takes place, is a Vietnam vet running the diner from his wheelchair.  But, emotional wounds loom large as Billie Letts weaves the tale and each character is revealed to us.  Caney is physically wounded but emotionally wounded too.  MollyO is wounded by the death of her husband and loss of her runaway daughter, Brenda.  Vena is a drifter working through the loss of her beloved sister, Helen. Bui has immigrated to the U.S. from Vietnam and looses his purity and innocence as he is shot by a racist never do well, Sam. "Life", a regular at the diner who is there for all three meals, has suffered the death of his wife Reba, with whom he enjoyed an active love life chronicled in a notebook written by his wife. Life spends most of his time mooning for MollyO.  MollyO is obsessed with her daughter, Brenda, who has been drifting trying to become a country western music star.   All of these souls converge on the Honk and Holler Diner Opening Soon.  One mistake Caney made is have the neon sign out front made up while he was drinking and he added the two words "Opening Soon" in neon when he really just wanted a temporary wooden sign reading "Opening Soon".  Now, the diner is open 12 years and the neon sign stills reads "Opening Soon".  This mistake, immortalized in neon, is akin to the choices and mistakes the characters make in their lives.  Somehow, all those things stay with them as the Honk and Holler Diner serves as stage, meeting room, psychiatrist's couch, haven, and healing ground. In a way, the Honk and Holler does open up soon.  MollyO and Caney are in the diner themselves and the other characters enter the fabric of the diner and Billie Letts' magic begins.    Just as entertaining as "Where the Heart Is" even though this book was not made into a movie.
