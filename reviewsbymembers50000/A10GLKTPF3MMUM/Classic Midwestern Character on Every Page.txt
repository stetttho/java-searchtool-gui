 Bob Greene captures the spirit of community and shared purpose endemic to the Midwestern United States.  Mr. Greene is from Ohio and worked as a columnist at the Chicago Tribune.  I too was raised in Michigan and Ohio, lived and worked in Chicago and travelled throughout the MidWest.  I have lived in Boston for 20 years now and miss the sense of community of the Midwest captured in this book.  (see also the book - "Bowling Alone" by Robert Putnam).  Mr. Greene was fortunate to interview so many veterans of World War II.  Many World War II veterans are passing away each day now and soon none will be around to interview.  The nostalgia I felt while reading this book was not just nostalgia for a simpler time, for a World War cannot be a simpler time; but, for a time when sacrifice was shared among many and our communities watched over us.  ajdjr73@earthlink.net
