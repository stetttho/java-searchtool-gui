 Not to mention that the author wrote this book WHILE she was in medical school. She became enamored, if that's a good word, maybe fascinated, curious, are better words, when she took the Gross Anatomy class. She had to open up the face of the cadaver she was studying and her life has never been the same once she started to learn about the brain. She provides some historic perspective about what was previously thought about the brain and now what is known and what still needs to be known. She also relates the biochemistry of the brain to personality and mental illness.
