 I agree with all the reviews written before mine.  I would encourage anyone who visits these reviews, to post on the Customer Message Board below to start a discussion.  I have emailed some of you through the "invite amazon friend" feature on this web site to come back to this site and post in the customer discussion board. I believe this is an excellent book for a Book Club Discussion group.  If some of us dont have the advantage of an "in-person" book club that we belong to, certainly, the discussion section for this book below here, can serve a similar purpose.  This book seems to be resonating with many people and I believe it is the type of book that people WILL want to discuss with others who have read it.  I have relatives in the Lafayette area of Indiana and am very familiar with the environs of Indiana where at least a portion of this book is set.  Julia describes it well, the farmland, the corn, the humidity in the summer.  Its all so accurate.    The descriptions of her entry into the high school scene, were all too real for me.  Many have written in their reviews here that they couldnt put the book down.  I've had to go the other way.  I've had to put it down, because, for me, reading it has been somewhat painful and brought up memories in my own life. But, as I neared the end of the book, it really did become a page turner for sure, for me too.    So, again, please, read the book, and come back and discuss it on the discussion panel below.  It will be fun!
