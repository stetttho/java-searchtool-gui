 The subtitle "Story of a Marriage" is misleading.  This is the story of the FIRST YEAR of a marriage, and what a disatrous first year it was.  Very beautiful descriptions of the mountain country of North and  South Carolina. Well depicted insights into human nature and human emotion.   Aesthetically beautiful and evocative descriptions of mother nature using  language of the people where the story is set. I found the series of  misfortunes that befall the newlyweds a little too much.  Especially where  they give their money and property away, not just once, but twice.  The  descriptions of slaughtering hogs and dressing turkeys and chickens were a  little more information than I need.  Julie, the narrator, scrubs a lot of  floors too.  Julie's descriptions of lovemaking with her new husband were  pleasant, not lurid, with humor too, especially when their bed collapses in  earshot of their old man landlord.  I found it confusing that Hank, the  husband, was so capable a person when first introduced and became so inept  as the story progressed.  This seemed somewhat incongruous.  He had little  resilience to come back from the troubles that visited.
