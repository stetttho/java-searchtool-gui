 Jesus Christ was certainly a devout Jew along with his mother Mary and Father Joseph.  As such, they prayed the PSALMS at all Jewish Holidays and other prayer times practiced by devout Jews.  When Jesus prayed the Psalms as a  Man on Earth, He was praying prayers that many of us have never even considered praying today.  If you want to pray the PRAYERS that Jesus Christ himself prayed, get this book.  In the back of the book there is an appendix that provides schedules for praying the Psalms.  You can put yourself on a weekly, biweekly (every two weeks), or monthly schedule and PRAY ALL of them.  If you're reading this review you know that the PSALMS come from the OLD TESTAMENT of the Bible.  T.M. Moore's book presents all of those PSALMS with a brief INTRODUCTORY NOTE and an ADDITIONAL NEW TESTAMENT reference that echoes the Word of God via the New Testament from the Old Testament Psalmist.  When praying the PSALMS in this book, it is helpful to have the NEW Testament Cross Reference included for further meditation and adding an additional dimension to my/your prayer of the Psalms.
