 Graveyard Dust is the third of a series which this accomplished author has written about New Orleans in the 1830's.  She is a fine writer who deserves much wider recognition and publicity.  Her research is obviously thorough  and her ability to capture character, place, time and story are  outstanding.  I have been reading her science and historical fiction since  the eighties and I must say that I have never been disappointed.   Even  though this book is the third in the series, the way Ms. Hambly develops  the characters and the exposition is complete, fresh and never boring.  You  could certainly start with this book and then go back to read the  others. If I had to find one flaw (the reason for the 4 stars instead of  5), I would say that the pace of the book is slower than my NY tastes.   However, it is a perfect mirror of the South as far as I can tell -- and it  held my interest the entire way. Since I am white, I would like to add  that I was encouraged to read reviews here by African Americans who liked  this book.  I felt it was sensitive and accurate and their endorsement  confirmed that for me.   The best thing I can say is that I am always  looking out for new work by Barbara Hambly -- she is a reader's delight.
