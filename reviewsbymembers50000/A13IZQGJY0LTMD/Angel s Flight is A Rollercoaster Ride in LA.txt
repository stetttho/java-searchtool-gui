 Another Harry Bosch novel involves us in this unusual detective who manages to perserve his essential goodness despite everything the author, Michael Connelly, can throw at him.  In this novel it includes a bored  wife, bad cops, horrible crimes and even greater temptations.  Bosch rises  above all and we rush to finsh, turning pages with frantic energy.   Dialogue is sharp and the pace is great.  Very satisfying.
