 This book presents in an organized manner, the major points of the philosophy of Objectivism.   As a companion to the works of Ayn Rand, it is invaluable.  I enjoyed reading it, and the best compliment I could give  it is that I'm truly sorry that I didn't read it the moment it was  published.   The beginning was especially challenging because the subject  is so fundamental that every word and term needs to be explained exactly  against our culture's habitual use of inexact language. For two concepts  which are my personal focus, imagination and value, I would have liked to  see a fuller treatement (especially missing was the use of the concept  value in art). One sentence I disagreed with: that the artist comes  closest to God.  This is an fanciful statement which is likely to be  misinterpreted by both enemies and friends.   But these complaints are  trivial when placed against the achievement which is Peikoff's rational and  thorough presentation of Objectivism.  This book has rightly gained the  status of a text book and is worth reading for anyone who takes ideas  seriously.
