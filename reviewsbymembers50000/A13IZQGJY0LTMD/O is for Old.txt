 I've been an alphabet fan since the very  beginning, but the series is starting to run stale.  Kinnsey's oddball ways are clashing with her middle class mania for cleanliness and order.  None of the other characters are  the least bit memorable and we don't even get a decent flashback of her  life with her ex.  The climax is a disappointment and that about says it  for the book.  If you haven't read the rest of the series, don't start with  this one.
