 This book was published in 1958.  It sells consistently year after year.  I have read it many, many times and always find something new. If you are curious about the slavish devotion or hysterical anger that this book seems  to inspire, the only answer is to READ IT FOR YOURSELF. Many inventions  of our current world did not exist in the 1940's, when Rand began to write  this book.  That makes some people think of the novel as stilted (they  can't imagine life without TVs and cell phones for everyone).   We so  seldom see heros in our lives, that many people are offended by the concept  of a person striving to be his or her best and succeeding.  It seems to be  a cultural imperative that heros must have feet of clay. Well, some of  Ayn Rand's heros make mistakes.  And, they pay for them! The marvelous  thing about Atlas Shrugged is these heros know how to acknowledge mistakes  and move forward with their lives.   Owr culture is steeped in Original  Sin.  It is the concept of Original Sin that Ayn Rand is rejecting.  If you  cannot consider that a human being is born in complete innocence, then  don't bother to read Atlas Shrugged.  However, if you have ever wondered  why sin or its absence sometimes seems to be a consequence of your own  actions, under your own control, and sometime not, this book is the answer  you've been seeking. Many people seem to be afraid of this book.  For me,  this book has been a life-long friend, always challenging me to think for  myself and draw my own conclusions.
