 Radiant realism glows with good sense, well written prose, great examples. The paintings are delightful and the author's instructions are clear and easy to follow. This book is not for beginners since it assumes that you  know how to draw.  Also, it does not cover all the genres, like landscape  and portraits.  However, if you are anything but a raw beginner, you should  be able to figure out how to adapt Ross's techniques for your own genre and  purposes.  The book is very clearly and neatly put together. I must have  nearly every art book on the shelf, but this one is the one I'm refering to  actively to create landscapes and other work. Even though the author  doesn't cover those genre, her priciples come shining through.  Enjoy!
