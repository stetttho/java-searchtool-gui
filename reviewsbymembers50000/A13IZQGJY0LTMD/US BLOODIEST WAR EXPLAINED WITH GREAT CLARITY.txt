 More American soldiers died in this war THAN IN ALL OF OUR OTHER WARS COMBINED!  The total is over 600,000!.  This does not include civilian casualties.   This is the most important war in US history, and  McPherson's book is a very valuable contribution to its record.  This book  explores the causes, battles and conclusion. It is a highly readable story,  told with such finesse that you almost feel that you don't know how it will  come out.  I especially like the way McPherson points out areas of deep  controversy and analyses them.  Also very interesting are the changing  attitudes beginning with a war to perserve the Union and ending with the  13th Amendment.   The amazing thing about this book is that after 130  years, the issues are still relevant, the material fresh, and the  importance of this to our own lives, vital.
