 I've been a fan of Ayn Rand since 1966.  What a delight and surprise to find this new book with so much clarified in the art of her own writing and thinking. This is a real how-to book for the aspiring writer.  I  recommend it highly.  Even if you don't agree with Rand's philosphy, you  will learn how to construct plot.  And remember, plot sells!
