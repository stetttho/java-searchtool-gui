 Of all the QFT textbooks I have surveyed, this is by far the most  accessable and readable. It has an ideal balance between clear well-written  text and carefully paced equations, without the usual "after some  manipulation..." or "combining with the previous results and  rearranging..." or the fearful "it can be seen that..."  which usually conceal chasms in reasoning that require an hour or so's  hackwork to establish. It is nicely self-contained, having short  digressions to derive some mathematical or topological results without  sending the reader to consult other sources for clarification. I still have  the first edition for which my only minor quibble would be the rather  frequent typo's in the formulae, but at least picking them out kept me  alert. These may have been cleaned up in the later edition.
