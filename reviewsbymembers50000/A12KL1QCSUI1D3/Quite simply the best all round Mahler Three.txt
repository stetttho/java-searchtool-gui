 Although the No.1 in this set is not all that competitive since it has to be compared to the definitive Walter New York Phil. version as well as Solti LSO etc., the Mahler THREE is absolutely superb. The recording dates from RCA's 'golden era' when their sound engineers captured a quality, especially in Boston, that has rarely been equalled before, or more surprisingly, since. The Boston orchestra play with a weight, virtuosity and exuberance that is overwhelming and Leinsdorf's interpretation has a subtlety and expressiveness lacking in more modern versions. One significant criticism, however, is that Leinsdorf takes the finale at too quick a tempo throughout. No matter how often one tries to get used to it. the speed is simply just a bit too fast.
