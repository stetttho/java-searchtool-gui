 I have had the original hardback single volume edition of this book for  many years now and it is a treasured item. It still stands, now more than  ever, as a towering achievement. The extraordinary depth and immense scope  represent a labour of scholarship that has rarely been equalled in an  academic work  on the history of science. The story of each element is  covered in fascinating detail with every character, process and location,  however tangentially involved, vividly presented in immaculate prose and an  abundance of (b&w) photographs. The illustrations are culled from every  conceivable kind of museum, archive, gallery and private collection in all  corners of the globe and must alone have taken many years to compile. They  are presented in perfect complementarity to the text, never irrelevant or  superfluous nor unnecessarily large in the 'page-padding' style of many  contemporary coffee table type books. This book is totally absorbing and  comprehensively instructive and I only wish that authors in other fields of  science could sometimes achieve even a fraction of this quality.
