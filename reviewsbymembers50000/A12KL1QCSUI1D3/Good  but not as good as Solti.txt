 This is a worthy performance in the Boult tradition. Slightly plodding but with lots of telling detail that is very well recorded. Quite comparable with the George Hurst version on Naxos but nowhere near the stature of Solti's incandescent performance on Decca. If anyone thinks that Solti's is perhaps a little overdramatic, they should listen to Elgars own recording which shows how accurate and close to the composer's intentions Solti was.
