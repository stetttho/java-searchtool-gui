 This is a seriously old-fashioned and out of date book. It was published around 1972 and EVEN THEN was knocked out of contention by the massively superior Misner, Thorne & Wheeler treatise and by Hawking and Ellis' "Large Scale Structure of S.T." - both published at the same time. Weinberg is by nature a quantum theorist and is here writing outside his home territory and it shows. The laborious tensorial notation is unintuitive, dense and reminiscent of fifties textbooks. The  treatment is stale and uninspiring (Eddington's "Mathematical Theory of R." written in 1922 has more sparkle!). Add to this Robert M. Wald's classic 1985 GR book (Univ. Chicago Press) and Weinberg's treatment simply isn't in the running. Do not rush into buying on other recommendations without comparing it with Misner etc., Hawking etc. and Wald.
