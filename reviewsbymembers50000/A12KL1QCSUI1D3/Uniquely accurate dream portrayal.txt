 Of course this is a dream ! What is more, it is the most accurate depiction of the dream experience I have ever encountered. All the vividly characteristic qualities of dreams are woven into the narrative. Of course it doesn't have that page turning "what happens next" quality because dreams are just not like that. What it does have is disjointed and illogical sequences that maddeningly almost make sense by association or mimicry of familiar knowledge. It also has that strange quality of characters being at the same time perfectly familiar and yet also of slightly uncertain identity. And then there are the frustrations. The narrator Ryder is constantly striving to prepare for a concert and clarify his itinerary and yet the whole book is an endless series of distractions, diversions, obstacles, delays, interruptions and frustrations that conspire to prevent him making any progress. If my description sounds nightmarish I ought to correct that impression by affirming that this is a very amusing and frequently hilarious book. Again it captures the comic absurdity of the vast majority of dreams and only lapses slightly into dullness in some prolonged passages concerning the characters Brodsky and Miss Collins. All in all, an essential, unforgettable and unique masterpiece.
