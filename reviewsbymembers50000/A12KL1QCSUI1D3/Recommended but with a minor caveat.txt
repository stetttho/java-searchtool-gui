 I agree with the enthusiasm shown by other reviewers (see also the 2nd. edition) for this book's treatment of interpretive issues at the foundations of quantum theory. However, chapter 9 unfortunately titled "How to teach Relativity" shows that Bell's expertise in quantum theory did not extend to special relativity, which he seriously misunderstood. Drawing on an old mistaken paper by Dewan & Beran from 1959, a thought experiment is described where two spaceships are joined by a thread and accelerate identically. Like the earlier authors, Bell wrongly believed the thread would break, showing the Lorentz contraction (again wrongly) to be a "real" effect, rather than an apparent one manifested only in another relatively moving inertial frame. Despite the fact that, as is mentioned in the book, all his CERN colleagues contradicted him, he nevertheless included this old "chestnut" with a false interpretation that can only do harm to the general understanding of STR. It is precisely this misunderstanding that has caused so much confusion over the rotating disc problem (Ehrenfest paradox), which has generated many meaningless papers over the years - and still does !
