 I cannot agree with the other reviewers on this. Back in the days when there were hardly any general texts on topology this may have been good. Nowadays there are at least a dozen such that are far better than this. The printing fonts and layout are spidery and primitive and not easy on the eye. The style is rather formal and dry for a subject as rich as this and little effort is put into illustrating the material with background, diagrams or examples. As I said before there is no shortage of better texts amongst which Hocking & Young is worth special mention.
