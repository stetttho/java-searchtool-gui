 There are three or four really great recordings of Walton's first and this version doesn't come off well in any comparison. The best is Previn's RCA recording with the LSO and no other attempt before or since has captured the seething tension of the 1st mov., the ferocity of the 2nd., repose and exaltation of the 3rd. & 4th. anything like as vividly. At least in Britain the Previn RCA version is available almost as cheaply as the Naxos, which therefore has no price advantage. Other versions it is also well worth having is the first ever under Hamilton Harty (originally released as 3 movements before the finale was composed) and the excellent Malcolm Sargent EMI version. The old Adrian Boult and more recent Leonard Slatkin versions are also very good.
