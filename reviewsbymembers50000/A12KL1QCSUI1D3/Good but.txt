 I agree this is a very clear and easily readable text but a graduate text  it is not. One would need to know most of this material before starting  graduate level. Lots of stuff is left out and I think a rather better book  that is equally clear and readable etc. but much more comprehensive with  more worked examples and historical motivation is Malik et.al. in  McGraw-Hill "Fundamentals of A.A.".
