 This is a superb book. The level is a broad introduction to Number Theory quite unlike any other. Every other N.T. book I know is either of the elementary type that covers all the usual stuff on primes, continued fractions, congruences, diophantine equations, quadratic reciprocity, etc. and then stops without introducing any of the machinery of the modern (ie. the last century and more), algebraic and geometric theory; OR, it is an advanced textbook that assumes a sophisticated and comprehensive knowledge of analysis and Galois theory etc.  This remarkable book has substantial sections on the geometry of numbers, elliptic curves, p-adic analysis and much else as well as the 'elementary' stuff and provides a large amount of fascinating historical motivation. The whole book is very clear, well presented and thoroughly pleasurable to read. How all this is achieved in about 550 pages is that the earlier  elementary parts are economically presented without too much of the recreational number novelties that tend to pad out some other books, and also a less rigorous approch is taken to (the more difficult) theorems that uses looser, schematic proofs or emphasises explanation of the meaning and relevance rather than exhaustive rigor. This book breaches the vital gap between basic and advanced NT  that is conspicuously unfilled elsewhere. More books of this type are desperately needed, although one could hardly expect many to be as good as this.
