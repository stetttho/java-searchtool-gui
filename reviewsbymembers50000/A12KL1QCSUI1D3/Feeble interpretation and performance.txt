 Almost all of Tintner's Bruckner cycle has been grossly overrated but this one is a real turkey. Slack performance by the N.Z. orchestra combined with ponderous and unfocussed conducting make this the most uninvolving and uninspired version in the catalogue. Almost any other alternative is preferable. Klemperer, Eugen Jochum, Kleinert, Haitink, Stein, Wand, Steinberg, George Ludwig Jochum, Barenboim, Swarovsky etc. (and even Karajan) are all superior. Get three or four versions, (most of those I mention are available cheaply), and see if you don't agree!
