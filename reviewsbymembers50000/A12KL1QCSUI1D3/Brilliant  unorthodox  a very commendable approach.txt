 I wish there had been books like this when I was at (high)school! It is  one of those rare books that bridge the yawning gap between the popular  personalised history books that are so inspiring to the young mind, (eg.  E.T.Bell's "Men of Mathematics", Kasner & Newman's  "Mathematics & the Imagination" or Kak & Ulam's  "Logic and(?) Mathematics") and the terse, somewhat desiccated  university text books. This can leave the undergraduate not fully  appreciating the motivation for exhaustive rigor and also losing any  perspective of where the abstract theorems and lemmas are ultimately  distilled from. This book links the historical characters, controversies  and challenges with the modern techniques that gradually emerged to deal  with the pathological behaviour of sets, series and functions. It would be  a mistake to confuse this book, as some of your reviewers have done, with  the many first-year undergraduate texts that are available. It could be  regarded as a sophisticated high school book that gives a real flavour of   how the classical problems are treated in modern rigorous style, or  alternatively as a colourful motivational aid to early undergraduate  analysis courses. I hope that the publishers encourage similar ventures in  other branches of the subject, for instance algebra, differential &  integral equations, probability and perhaps even quantum theory.
