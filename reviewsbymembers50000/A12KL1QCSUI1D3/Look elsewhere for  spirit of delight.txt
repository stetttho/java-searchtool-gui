 This only barely scrapes a 3-star rating. Overall the performance is sluggish and not very inspired. There is not much 'spirit of delight' here - more a 'spirit of comfortable pleasantness'. The larghetto isn't too bad except that the climaxes are slightly clumsily handled, overemphasis undermining the effect. Compare with Solti's reading where more subtle shaping generates a real frisson. What really lets the performance down, however, are the outer movements where the music is made to drag its feet somewhat and the finale plods so wearily that it is more reminiscent of Gray's Elegy than Shelley's poem. Possibly worth considering as a third or fourth supplementary (not alternative ), but the top recommendation is still Solti with Gibson and the earlier Boult recordings as follow-ups.
