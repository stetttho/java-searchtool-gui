 A detailed historical analysis of the Einstein-Bohr debate covering all the contemporary and subsequent contributors and concentrating mainly on the EPR controversy, Bell's theorem and the experimental tests to date. Convincingly overturns the still prevailing myth that Bohr 'won' the argument by refuting Einstein's scepticism. This falsehood was propagated by Bohr's numerous and overenthusiastic disciples and unfortunately has been perpetuated ever since in virtually all the standard QM textbooks. In fact, as Wick's extensive quotations and commentary show, it was Einstein's arguments that were presented with great clarity and rigour, whereas Bohr was unable to confront them directly and invariably relied on metaphysical and psychological waffle to cloud the issue. It is quite clear from the numerous extracts from Bohr's responses that not only could none of his contemporaries understand what he was talking about but that he didn't either! One weakness is Wick's rather confusing explanation of the probabilities involved in Bell's theorem which have been much better presented elsewhere (eg. in Mermin's book or in Penrose - 'The Emperor's New Mind'), but this is more than compensated by the excellent lengthy appendix by William Faris that gives the clearest analysis of Bell's theorem I have seen so far.
