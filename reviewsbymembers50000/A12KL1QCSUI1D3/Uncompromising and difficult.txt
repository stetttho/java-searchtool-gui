 Make no mistae about it, this is a very difficult book. It is pitched at a highly advanced level and assumes a good deal of ring and field theory and makes no concessions by way of pausing to briefly summarise what is assumed at any point. Parts of the book also progress very quickly and consist of streams of definitions with next to no examples followed by a chunk of theorems that depend on the terms introduced to such an extent that the material has to be re-read many times to glean any understanding.  Although in terms of the amount of material covered this is a comprehensive text, it is far too concise for student use. It might have some limited appeal as an advanced postgraduate reference book, but for anyone not already well up to speed in algebraic number theory this will be heavy going indeed.
