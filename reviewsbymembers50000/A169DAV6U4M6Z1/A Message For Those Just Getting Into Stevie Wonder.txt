 Don't listen to what some others have said about this album. They must be the same people who brand "Songs In the Key of Life" as 'bloated' and 'self-indulgent.' FFF is an amazing album. Is it as good as Innervisions? No, of course it isn't -- Innervisions is one of the best albums ever made. Yet FFF was the next album Stevie recorded, and if you listen just a little more closely you'll clearly hear echoes of that seminal album. You might ask yourself why this album gets so much less attention than the others. This is my theory, based on my own experience: this album is more low-key, and those who are just getting into Stevie Wonder will be too distracted with Innervisions and Talking Book to really stop and _listen_ this this album. But once you've worn out his other albums, you'll pop on this one and after a few times through you'll realize just how incredible it is. It's amazing. THEY WON'T GO WHEN I GO is the most haunting song he ever recorded. PLEASE DON'T GO hints very strongly at GOLDEN LADY on Innervisions while maintaining its own idenitity. BIRD OF BEAUTY will stick in your head as long as any Stevie Wonder song. There's so many positive things to say about this album, and yet even real Stevie Wonder fans I know disparage it. One friend of mine said that I'd probably like it least of all the Stevie Wonder albums I had (which were [and are] only the '70's streak: from Music Of My Mind to Hotter Than July, sans Secret Life Of Plants.) Since I've started to really give this album a chance, I've been meaning to have a talk with this friend of mine: he obviously hasn't discovered the BRILLIANCE of this album. If you like Stevie Wonder, then you simply have to buy this album. Now. Give it two or three good listens and I guarantee that it'll capture you, too.
