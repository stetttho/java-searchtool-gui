 When Stevie Wonder was on top of his game, no one could touch him. One of the most remarkable things about this album (and many of his other great albums) is that Stevie plays all or almost all the instruments on every song. Think about it. Drums, bass, vocals, keyboards, background vocals -- it's ALL STEVIE. Absolutely incredible. INNVERVISIONS is a portrait of genius at work. LIVING FOR THE CITY, for instance, is all Stevie. He did it all. Wow. I can't overstate this point. INNERVISIONS is one of those rare albums where every single song is incredible. Really -- they're all some of my favorite songs of all time. Personally, my favorite (at least today) is MISSTRA KNOW-IT-ALL -- listen to how Stevie's laid-back drum playing anticipated (and, of course, inspired!) electronic beats. JESUS CHILDREN has a serious groove. VISIONS is like sunlight through a diamond: clear and beautiful and sometimes a little eerie. Obviously HIGHER GROUND is incredible -- all the songs are. This album is a must-have for ANY, I repeat ANY music lover. You will not be disappointed.
