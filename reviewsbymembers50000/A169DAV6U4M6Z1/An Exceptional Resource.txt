 I came across Grant's "The Syrian Desert" while researching a novel. I was after good hard information about camel caravans crossing from the Mediterranean to the Persian Gulf in the early seventeenth century. I found everything and more in this wonderful book. Anyone who's fascinated with the desert and what it must have been like -- and is still like, in many respects -- to live there will get a lot out of this book. Grant brings the reader step by step through the daily routine of a camel caravan: from careful calculations of how far they might travel in a day to the logistics of paying off local Bedouin tribesmen (often you'd be given a "rafeek," who acted as a human passport); from how to bake 'Arab bread' to a transcription of a contract between a bashi, or caravan leader, and a European traveler seeking passage to Bashra; from a day-by-day description of the Great Desert Route to the purported reasons why riverain Arabs were to be avoided at all costs. The amount of useful information I gathered from this book is staggering; I have yet to go through it all. Reading certain sections, I could practically feel the sun beating on my brow, taste the sweat on my lips, smell the sun-backed sand under my boots, and hear the complaints of the plodding camels. Truly a wonderful resource.
