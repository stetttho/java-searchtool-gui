 I am not, by any stetch of the imagination, a 'Goth,' nor am I someone who listens to Goth music. Strange, you might say, that I'm reviewing this -- and that, if you click on my name above, you'll see that I also reviewed two of the This Mortal Coil albums. Clearly I do listen to Goth music from time to time. I suppose I'm guilty as charged. However, while I admit that This Mortal Coil is clearly Goth music, I will not admit the same for Dead Can Dance. They are closer to World Music. I will admit only that Dead Can Dance tends to be moody and dark. Does that make them Goth? In my opinion, this is the first truly solid Dead Can Dance album; this is where Lisa Gerrard and Brendan Perry found themselves. I enjoy Spleen & Ideal, the album preceding this one, yet it was not quite timeless. This album, however, is. Within the Realm of the Dying Sun could be released today. It could have been released in the sixties. Or the eighties. It doesn't matter. Nothing about this music places it in any specific period or style. It truly is a remarkable achievement, and even though I listen to later albums more frequently, I believe this to be Dead Can Dance's best, their masterpiece, if you will. It begins quietly, leading in to Brendan Perry's vocals. There the album lingers for a while, floating through relatively gentle songs that climax with Xavier. Then the wind rises. We hear snare drums cracking, bells chiming -- and then Lisa Gerrard's eerie, powerful, language-defying voice cuts straight through to the listener's heart. There we remain until the album's close, wondering at how far we've come since the first track. To be perfectly honest, I far prefer Lisa Gerrard over Brendan Perry. Yet I believe this to be Dead Can Dance's best album even though Lisa Gerrard does not come onstage until halfway through. It is a journey they take us on, with a clear, defined starting point and destination. And we're happy to go.
