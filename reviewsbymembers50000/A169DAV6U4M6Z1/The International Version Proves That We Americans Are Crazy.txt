 I loved the edited version of this film. Really loved it. But compared with the uncut Leon, The Professional is terrible. I can't overemphasize how much those cut 24 minutes add to the story. Leon is one of my favorite movies. At its heart is an archetypal story. (Don't read the following line if you don't want a mini-spoiler.) The film is about a man who is dead when alive and then dies once he learns to live. The basic story has been told many times before, but that doesn't detract from the power of this film. Natalie Portman, in her first and arguably best performance, displays an emotional range that is stunning (and at times disconcerting) to see in a 12-year-old girl. She has the power to make you _believe_. There are few actors out there who can so effortlessly convince the viewer that what they are seeing is real. And this from a 12-year-old! The American version excised the heart of the relationship between the two main characters, Leon (Jean Reno) and Mathilda (Portman). It cut out Mathilda's displays of nascent sexuality even though _nothing happens_. Leon is far too good a man to lay a finger on Mathilda in that way, yet American test audiences complained, so the film was cut. In the process they also axed several important scenes, such as Leon explaining what led him to become an assassin, which in the American version was hinted but then never developed. The International Version also shows us why and how Mathilda would be gutsy enough to actually go after the man who murdered her family. The 24 minutes that were cut from this film were essential to the story in so many ways. The remarkable thing is that I loved the _other_ version! If you loved, liked, or even just enjoyed The Professional, then I strongly suggest you see Leon -- it is worlds better.
