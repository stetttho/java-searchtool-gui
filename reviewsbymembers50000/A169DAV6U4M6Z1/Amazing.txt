 One remarkable thing about this album is that very little of it screams out to the listener, 'This was released in 1984!' 'It'll End In Tears' has an almost universal character to it -- utterly amazing. 'Song of the Siren' and 'Another Day' have to be two of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard (and I don't say that lightly). BUT -- what's up with 'Not Me'? Every time I come around to that track, I end up giving a start and reaching for my remote control as quickly as I possibly can -- what a mood-breaker! If they cut that song out entirely, this album would be nearly perfect from beginning to end.
