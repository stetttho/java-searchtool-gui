 I'm not going to give you a run-through of the plot. Plenty of other reviewers will do that, I'm sure, and before long the movie will be out and we'll all be very familiar with its narrative arc anyway. Instead, I want to give you my initial impressions of the book, as a reader and a writer and a long-time Star Wars fan. The first thing I noticed was that, on many levels, Attack Of the Clones is superior to the Phantom Menace novel. I'm not a fan of Terry Brooks (who wrote Epi 1), nor am I a fan of R.A. Salvatore (who wrote Epi 2), but at least R.A. Salvatore uses emphatic language and the occasional interesting description or turn of phrase. You'll soon notice the use of sentence fragments, for instance, when you read Attack Of the Clones. It gives the narrative a slight edge every now and then. The second thing I noticed, however, was that the book was rushed: both in writing it and in getting it on the shelves. There's a surprising number of typos, even for a first edition. There's one point in the first fifty pages where Salvatore uses the phrase "slowly and deliberately" almost a half-dozen times in the span of three pages. But I give the book lots of slack, because it was obviously produced under a tighter deadline than most other books. The third thing I noticed is that Attack Of the Clones is obviously written with the intention of selling it to children. This is well and good, I have no problem with it, but it does make for some less-than-subtle descriptions. Sometimes the narrative reminds me of a bulldozer. All in all, however, I enjoyed the read, the way one enjoys popcorn: light and fluffy. I read so much 'serious' writing that I genuinely enjoy the occasional foray into what might be dismissively termed 'kiddie stuff.' If you're unwilling to cut some slack as a reader, then you're better off not buying this book. But if you're looking for some fun and easy hours of reading, I think you'll enjoy it.
