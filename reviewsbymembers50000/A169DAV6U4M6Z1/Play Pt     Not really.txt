 For his follow-up to the tremendously successful "Play," Moby gives us "18" new tunes -- some familiar-sounding, others not so much. ...Songs like "In this World," "One of These Mornings," or "I'm Not Worried At All" follow what might be called the Play formula: take an old archived soul/blues/gospel sample and put it over beats, violins, and whatever else sounds good. Other tunes on 18 follow a similar formula, but are more extensive in their sampling: "Sunday," for instance, is ultimately more of a traditional song as opposed to one where Moby has the same lyrics loop indefinitely. (Although the refrain does repeat itself dozens of times, of course.) Then there's the anomolies. "We Are All Made of Stars" would not have fit on Play at all. "The Great Escape" sounds like This Mortal Coil (it would've fit perfectly on "Blood," TMC's third and final album). "Extreme Ways" also differs from Play's tone. "Harbour," with Sinead O'Connor, would have seemed out of place on Play. "Jam For the Ladies" has an old-school hip-hop feel to it. Granted, there are styles in Play that aren't in 18--no dance hall-style techno, for instance, but there's more new styles than abandoned styles in evidence on 18. The songs I mentioned are enough to make 18 more than just Play Pt. 2. It's true, however, that anyone familiar with Play will feel at home listening to 18. But that has as much to do with Moby's orchestral aesthetic as his choice of songs. He tends to use his synth violins, for example, in ostensibly the same way (= the same voicings) in lots of songs--both on Play and on 18. I call this simply "the Moby sound." There's nothing intrinsically wrong with having an identifiable style, so I don't fault him on that count. Is 18 groundbreaking? Hardly. But if you liked Play, will you like 18? Definitely.
