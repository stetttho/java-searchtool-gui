 I see no need to repeat what other reviewers have already said so clearly. Instead I will relate my own experience with this wonderful book. I am not 'religious,' per se. I do not adhere to any specific faith. However, religion fascinates me. I am a writer of fiction, and my fiction has leaned steadily closer to questions of faith and the concept of the Infinite. Exploring these issues has led me to the study of religion. I believe that my lack of affiliation with any specific faith makes it easier for me to approach the religious experience as a whole. I am of the school of thought which holds that truth, wisdom, and yes, even God, can be found in different places. God wears more than one mask. Or, if you prefer, God is beyond our direct knowing, and so different people in different lands find a different God, and yet all of them are, in a way, right. Many will say that such a belief is too simple-minded, and perhaps they are right. As I said, I am not 'religious.' For those of you who are like myself -- who do not practice religion yet believe in Something Greater -- I doubt there is a better a book with which to begin your journey-of-discovery than The World's Religions. It is a clear, concise, and even-handed introduction to Hinduism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism, Islam, Judaism, Christianity, and what Smith calls 'The Primal Religions.' And for those of you who adhere to a particular faith, this book offers a different kind of introduction, yet one no less significant. For "what do they know of England, who only England know?"
