 I must concur with the last reviewer. Filigree & Shadow is *not* the best TMC album. In fact, it's the worst. While there's no denying that it's the most cohesive of the three albums, Filigree & Shadow suffers from being much too self-aware. The other two are freer -- and, consequently, much better. In other words, with the other two albums, there's room to breathe, while this one feels pretty stuffy at times. If you don't own any TMC albums, then start where it started, with the first: It'll End In Tears. If you like that, move on to Blood. Only then, if you like both those albums, does Filigree & Shadow become a must-buy. Let me make myself clear: I would never part with my copy of this album, but it's not as good as the other two. A  disclaimer: The first part of this album is excellent, some of the best material they ever did... But that's only the first part. And in all honesty, the slowness of the rest takes something away from the brilliance of the beginning. Really, if you're new to TMC, start your collection somewhere else.
