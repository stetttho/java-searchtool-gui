 Finally, the album I always knew J5 could make -- the album that finally makes good on the promise of their self-titled 1995 EP. Whereas Quality Control, J5's first full-length album, was more hit-and-miss ("World Of Entertainment" simply doesn't show the band at its best), Power In Numbers is smooth in a similar way to their stunning although productionally sub-par EP. Even the tracks that don't start out so strong, turn out blowing your mind -- I worried at the beginning of "Break," only to have my  hair blown back after the first break down. "One of Them" is the darkest, most gangsta-sounding track J5 has ever produced, but in the midst of this incredibly album, it doesn't detract at all; in fact, it offers a certain perspective on the rest of the songs. And of course, Cut Chemist and DJ Nu Mark don't disappoint with their instrumental closer "Acetate Prophets." While not as immediately impressive as their Quality Control outing "Swing Set," it acts as the perfect close to a truly great album.
