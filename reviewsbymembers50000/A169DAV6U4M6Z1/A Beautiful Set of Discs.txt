 I bought this box-set primarily for the DVD of "Toward the Within" (which is Disc IV of the set). I hesitated on the purchase, because it cost so much and I already have all the worthwhile Dead Can Dance CDs (those being everthing except their self-titled debut album). Looking at the songlist, I thought, "Sure, there's some unreleased stuff on here, but is it really worth it?" After having listened to the collection several times, I'm honestly surprised just how much I love this box set. While the DVD's the real treat, the whole thing's excellent. They picked just the right songs, compiled them in just the right order. Beyond the music, even, the box-set itself is a handsome thing: interesting liner notes, some nice pictures, the whole deal. This is the real thing, what a box-set retrospective should be. Now, I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who's new to Dead Can Dance. To them I'd suggest picking up the original albums--"Within the Realm of the Dying Sun" or "Aion" or "A Passage In Time." Start there, and if you're like me, you'll suddenly find that there's nothing more to buy. That's when this box-set will be perfect for you.
