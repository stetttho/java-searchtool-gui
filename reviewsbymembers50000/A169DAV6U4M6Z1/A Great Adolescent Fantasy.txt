 This series might be right up your alley. After all, lots of people like it. I admit that I was charmed by this book when I first read it -- but I was a kid at the time, and moreover I'd never read a fantasy book before. Not even Tolkein. Nothing. While reading EotW, I fell in love with the genre, and I've been involved with it ever since. However, this book (and the series it opens) is a tremendously adolescent, simplistic fantasy. I know, I know -- most Jordan fans will scoff at me for calling it 'simplistic.' They would ask, 'How can a book with so many proper nouns be simplistic?' Well, because the world in which it unfolds is so simple (if bloated) that you can actually wrap your mind around its so-called 'complexities'  without a great deal of trouble. Can you say that about real history? No, of course not. In reality, nothing is ever as easy, as cut-and-dried, as it is in this series. This makes Wheel of Time unrealistic and, yes, simplistic. Another thing that bothers me is that the characters are entirely incapable of having a mature sexual relationship. The men blush far too frequently, and every woman has an 'icy stare' and 'plants her hands on her hips' or 'sniffs pointedly' at every opportunity. Reading other, more mature fantasies makes this series look literally like child's play. Again, though, you might well love this series. But I urge you to check out Guy Gavriel Kay or George RR Martin. Try Martin first, actually (unless you love poetry, in which case you might immediately appreciate Kay). Read 'Game of Thrones' and you'll see what a serious, mature fantasy can do. Then move on to Kay, and you'll find language so beautiful it'll blow your hair back -- and make you realize that Jordan is for the kids.
