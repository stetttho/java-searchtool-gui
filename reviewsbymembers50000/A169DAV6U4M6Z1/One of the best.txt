 If you want a peek into the future of (good) rap, then for [goodness] sake, purchase a copy of 'Amongst the Madness.' Don't wait. Do it now. When your copy comes in, listen to it, then play it for all your friends. This album displays such a broad range of talent, it's almost staggering. Personally, 'We Got' is my favorite tune, and I appreciate 'My Way' and the title track. A few of the tunes annoy -- for one, I don't see the appeal of 'Sex, Lies & Videotape' -- but that's inevitable when dealing with such a mosaic of performers. Put simply, 'Amongst the Madness' is one of the best rap CDs I've ever heard. As Penultimate says on the album: 'Leading hip-hip back from the land of the hipster...' It's about time.
