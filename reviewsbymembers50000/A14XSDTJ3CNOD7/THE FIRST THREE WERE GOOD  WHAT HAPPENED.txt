 Korn's first three albums were great. They rocked and they meant something. Troubled people found comfort in their music, as did people trying to work through something and people that liked the catharsis of the thing. I fell more into the third camp, using Korn to take out my frustrations and deal with feelings that never quite came up in the regular course of my life.  All that being said, however, Korn has now fallen out of my favor. Their third album, "Issues," sold out to popularity. The band knocked something together as quickly as they could so that they could capitalize on the TRL crowd before they defected. At least that album had a couple of standouts, though ("Let's Get This Party Started," "Trash," "Wake Up," "Falling Away From Me"). This album does not. It feels half hearted at best. It inspires little emotion in the listener. It does not rock quite so hard as one would like it to. Whereas at one time Korn inspired the rap-rockers, they now sound indistinguishable from them.  If you're going to buy this disc you better like the big hit single ("Here To Stay") a whole lot. You see, there are exactly three likeable and interesting things on this CD: 1) The song "Here To Stay", 2) The remix of the song "Here To Stay" that is included as a hidden track, 3) The performance video for "Here To Stay" that is included in the multimedia portion of the disc. I must say that "Here To Stay" is a very good song. Not one of my favorites from them, but a very good song. It is not, however, worth the price of admission. Sorry.
