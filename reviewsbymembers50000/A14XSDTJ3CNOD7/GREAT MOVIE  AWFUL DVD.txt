 This was easily one of the best films of 2001, if not the best. It is beautiful to look at, filled with great performances, and contains excellent music. It is also one of the most compelling puzzle-movies that I have ever seen. SO WHY DID I GIVE IT 2 STARS? ANSWER:  THE DVD IS ABSOLUTELY AWFUL! Why, I'm sure you ask? Well, as a puzzle-movie, you come out of the film wishing to go back through it and check different scenes for clues. You are deeply compelled to know how everything fits together and to investigate your own theories.  This is made nearly impossible by the fact that the disc DOES NOT HAVE CHAPTER SELECTION. I asked someone, "What is the absolute most basic feature of DVDs that you expect to see on every single disc?" They didn't say chapter selection. They didn't even think of it. It is so integral to the very concept of a DVD that we all take it for granted. Well don't take it for granted here. You'll be very disappointed. I have been unable to go back over the movie and enjoy the puzzle of it, and am therefor very unhappy with my purchase. I would strongly discourage you from buying this DVD. It will add nothing to your experience, and may actually take a little something away. Also, just so you know, there aren't any other features, either. It's not like they ran out of room on the disc and couldn't fit in chapter selection. It is a completely bare disc.
