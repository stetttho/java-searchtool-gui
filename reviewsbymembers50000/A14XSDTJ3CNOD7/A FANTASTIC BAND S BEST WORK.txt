 "The" Catherine Wheel is a truly great band, with each of their CD's entirely different from the last. "Adam and Eve" is the pinnacle of their achievement so far, and I would suggest that anyone uninitiated in the ways of The Catherine Wheel should make it their first purchase from the band (I'm assuming that anyone already introduced to them already has the disc, or else shame on you). It's an explosive set of self-sufficient songs, unlike their earlier albums which focused more on the overall arc of the disc, and each and every song on the album is a winner. My favorites include "Goodbye," "Phantom of the American Mother," "Delicious," "Ma Solituda," and "Satelite." The songs varry from soft poetics to harder rock, from seven minute epics to guitar driven pseudo-pop. It's probably the third best album of the nineties (after Radiohead's "OK Computer" and Lisa Loeb's "Tails"  in my variety-informed opinion). The disc is a must have, accesibile and fun for any type of music fan. A real winner.
