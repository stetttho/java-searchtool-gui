 Buster Keaton's stone-faced persona works to its greatest effect in "Sherlock Jr," his best film (just barely topping "The General") and one of the top comedies of all time. More than just tremendously funny, "Sherlock Jr" is heartfelt and sweet. Everything comes out of a scheme to make Buster appear to be a criminal in front of his love, while he is all the while attempting to imprese her with a present on a meager salery. Poor Buster is sent away dejected, with a competitor for his love's affection taking credit for his gift and his love thinking him a bad person. Buster attempts to rectify the situation by using his skills as an amateur detective to find the real criminal. This soon fails and he is forced to return to his job as a film projectionist, showing a mystery/detective story and daydreaming, the spot where one of the most perfect comedy scenes in film history takes place. Of course it all turns out well in the end-- who thought it wouldn't?--but the way that it gets there is funny and memorable, and shouldn't be missed by any movie fan. Even those who usually do not enjoy silent films will like Buster Keaton's "Sherlock Jr." I know this because my eight-year-old brother loves the movie, and he is patently againt black and white movies, much less silent films. If he likes it, so will everyone. "Our Hospitality" is also a lot of fun, but it is not on the same level as "Sherlock Jr." Buy this for "Sherlock Jr" and think of the other feature as a pleasant bonus.
