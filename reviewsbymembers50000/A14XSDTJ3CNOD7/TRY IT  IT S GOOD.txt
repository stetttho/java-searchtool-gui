 I won't tell you which season I prefer, or who my favorite characters are. What I will tell you is that after you watch Buffy for a prolonged period of time, all of that kind of stuff starts to melt away. The characters become real people and the episodes become the contexts in which these people exist. If you allow yourself to spend time within this context, you will quickly grow to care about it and take comfort in it. If you do not, you will mock the title and miss a little something special for your ignorance. Clearly I would encourage spending the time, or else several of the five stars that I have given this item wouldn't be there. Watch "Bad Girls" for a strong introduction to the world of Buffy and to the seasonal storyline. Watch "The Wish" only after you care enough about the characters to really get something out of it (or you'll be cheating yourself). And watch "Doppelgangland" only after you watch "The Wish" because it's a sequel.  Other than that, my suggestion is to wade in and not to close your mind so thouroughly that you miss what you're taking part in.
