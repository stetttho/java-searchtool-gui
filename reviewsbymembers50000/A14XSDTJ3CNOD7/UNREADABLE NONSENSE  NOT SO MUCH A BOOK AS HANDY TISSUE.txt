 "Robinson Crusoe" is tedious and foolish. It's silly and pointless. It's an adventure that generates less interest in the reader than would a technical manual on how best to stack microchips in industrial settings. This qualifies as a classic in only that it is a fossil. Rather than reading this novel I would advise you to dunk your head under water and leave it there for whatever period of time you had considered using for the reading of the book. This act will be more satisfying. My basic problem with the novel is its lack of excitement, though there are also moralistic problems that one can't help but be troubled by. Robinson is a phrophet come to show us the way. He is the shephard and we should all be glad of his instructive presense. If "Robinson Crusoe" leaves you believing any of that nonsense or forming new ideas based on the text, see a doctor and/or confess your sins very quickly. Do not allow yourself to be intructed by foolishness spouted in a book entirely devoid of quality. Yes, I am bitter. Time was wasted reading this book that could have been better spent trimming my lawn with scissors or warming bagels with a magnifying glass on a cloudy day. I wish that "Robinson Crusoe" would have at least cured me of my obsessive need to finish every book that I start, but it did not even do me that service. It is bad. Leave it well enough alone.
