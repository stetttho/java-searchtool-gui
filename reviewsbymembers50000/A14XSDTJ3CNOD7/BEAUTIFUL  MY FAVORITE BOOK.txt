 "Lolita" is an unforgettable, flawlessly written novel. The language is artful in ways that few other novels have achieved. It is far too good to have any negatives associated with its reputation, and it would be particularly silly for people to avoid it based on a blind aversion to classic literature. "Lolita" reads like the most perfect modern love story, yet it is a romantic love of an older man for a child. This is creepy and wrong, and the first person narrator knows it, but can't help himself. The book leaves moral paradoxes and sorrow in its wake, not to mention a general feeling of having just participated in something very special. The themes of the novel are never as simplistic as the set-up would suggest, and the characters have far more dimension than one would expect from the types that Nabokov creates. Everyone must read this book, if only to have an informed opinion of it. Hopefully, better reasons than that will develop as the narrative takes its hold.
