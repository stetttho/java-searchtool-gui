 P.J. Harvey does a nice job at a variety of things. She rocks hardcore, but knows when to quiet down. I repect both her guitar work and her vocals. The songs are tight and well written, not to mention genuinly interesting, the rarest of all things in current radio. Her duet with Thom York from Radiohead, "This Mess We're In," is a standout, as are "Good Fortune," "You Said Something," "We Float," and "Kamikaze." If you saw her perform "You Said Something" on Letterman and liked it a lot, expect more of the same, but don't be surprised by something different. Polly Jean is a rocker at heart, but she isn't one note by any stretch of the imagination.
