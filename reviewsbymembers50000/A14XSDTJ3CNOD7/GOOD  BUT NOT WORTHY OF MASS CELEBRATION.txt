 Bridget Jones is fun, light, sometimes silly, sometimes over-blown, off track as much as it is on, repetitive in ways that one who hasn't read it couldn't possibly understand, but also loveable enough that you just can't help but smile at the end of it and feel satisfied with what you've read. It's not a great book and it's not a bad book. It's not a great character and it's not a bad character. It's just cute, weird, and stylized in a way that isn't quite obscene. Those who hate the book are heartless and those who absolutely love it are overly forgiving.  My suggestion would be to take it for what it is, forget it when it's over, and move on with life. But try it. It's definitely worth a read. Also, the Renee Zellweger movie is a good deal superior, so it may even be worth watching that first so that you don't let the book spoil it for you.
