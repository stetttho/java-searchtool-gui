 Unlike "Requiem For a Dream," this score does not work on its own nearly as well as it works in the movie. It is undeniably great music, but I find myself ignoring the CD in favor of the DVD of the film every single time.  I could recommend it as quality music, but I can't recommend it fully when the film itself is a much better avenue by which to appreciate the score. There are other film scores that stand alone much better than does this one.
