 I really love this show, and I wish that it would have stayed on much longer. Claire Danes was brilliant in every episode, showing promise as an actress that she has yet to deliver on elsewhere. A.J. Langer was memorable, as was everybody else. Each and every episode stands on its own as a 45 minute movie, particularly the first few which set the tone so well. Not until "Freaks and Geeks" did any other show understand what it was like to be young and get it so perfecftly right in their depiction (though "Freaks and Geeks" didn't do nearly as well as "My So Called Life"). The shows are entertaining, comical, heart-string-tugging, and sometimes profound in their implications.There have been few shows on television that even aspired to the this level, much less reached it. "My So Called Life" is historic and unmatched. I must admit that much of my motivation in recommending this DVD so highly is purely personal. I bought my copy long ago, just after it came out, and I've been anxiously awaiting further DVD's in the series. To this point I've been disappointed, but I think that if enough people buy this DVD, then perhaps the company will figure out what a hot property they have and release more episodes. Please don't wait for te release of a full boxed set, because if you do there probably won't be one. Follow your heart and buy this. You know you want it. Come on.
