 As far as pure volume of words goes, this thesaurus is kind of weak. I have had many occasions when I was looking for a particular word and could not find it in this book. The book is, however, sturdy, convenient, and just full enough that I'd have to suggest it. If you do a lot of thesaurus work, then perhaps this volume isn't for you, but if you're on the run a lot and need only a fast, convenient source of similarly defined words than this is more than enough thesaurus to do the job.
