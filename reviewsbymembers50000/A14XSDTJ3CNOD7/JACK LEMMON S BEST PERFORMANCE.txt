 Jack Lemmon has given many, many brilliant performance, but his subtle work in "Glengarry Glen Ross" is his best. He is sad, touching, loveable, frightened, desperate, and tragic. He is the centerpeice of a film that would have worked on the strength of the scriipt alone. Despite the fact that it consists only of real estate workers sitting and talking shop, the film is thrilling and easy enough to understand on an emotional level. It's my favorite movie from a Mammet script, partly because he leaves the gimicks alone and allows the actors to develop interesting and unique characters rather than to just say the words for the sake of the audience hearing them.   It's a great film and worth getting just to see Jack Lemmon. That's all the motivation that anyone should need.
