 This DVD set was my first introduction to the series. I rented the discs one by one, causing me to notice an interesting phenomenon. I would rent a disc, watch a couple of episodes, and then think, "this is alright, but no big deal. Maybe I won't rent the next disc." Then the third episode would come up and blow me away. Every third episode is great ("The Foot," "The Room," "Life's Too Short"). I don't know if this is a good thing, but at least it spreads the wealth a bit. Try one of the three episodes mentioned above, and if that doesn't do it for you, don't bother with the series. It can be uneven and overly quirky. Some of the subplots get annoying (like Rachel Griffiths and her crazy brother). On the whole, however, I was glad that I watched it, so I wouldn't discourage the purchase altogether, though I would suggest caution. As to the features, they are hugely overrated. I saw review after review in magazines and papers praising this set for its features in relation to other TV on DVD. I, however, was disappointed. There is a cast interview feauturette that basically amounts to an advertisement for the next season, and there's a featurette on the opening credits, which, though interesting, should not be the topic of the only feature of substance. If the features are the only thing encouraging you to buy this item, then don't buy it.  Compared to most other TV, it's a five star item. Compared to quality movies, or more substantial TV (like Buffy), it is a three star item. I have chosen to hold it to the greater standard.
