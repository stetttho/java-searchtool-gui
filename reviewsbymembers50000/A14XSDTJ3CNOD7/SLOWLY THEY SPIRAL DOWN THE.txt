 Radiohead's "Kid A" was a difficult CD, but even from the first listen it showed promise, and there were always standout songs ("Optimistic," "National Anthem," "Idioteque") to keep a person engaged as they grew into the sound of the startlingly original disc. With "Amnesiac there is no such promise and very few standout songs to save the day. "I Might Be Wrong" is so clearly the best song on the disc that it is kind of disturbing--what, was there nothing else? The "Pyramid Song" lags behind at a nice distance, but is still an interesting and satisfying piece of music. It's there that it gets hairy. There are 11 songs, and  11-2=9 questionable works of limited artistic merit. As an example, there is "Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors" likely the worst song ever conceived of or recorded;it is noisemaking at its most senseless. Also, we have an inferior version on Kid A's "Morning Bell," "Life In A Glasshouse" (an out of focus revisiting of the "National Anthem" style horn section), and "Knives Out," all of which seem awfully half-hearted. Thom York often sounds bored and unengaged on the disc, and the musical style of the rest of the band could best be described as apathetic. If this is the way of the musical future for Radiohead, one of the best bands of the 90's, then I must solemnly advise them to swim back up the drain.
