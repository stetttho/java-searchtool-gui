 I am a big fan or Roger Rabbit. It's silly. It's fun. Bob Hoskins is entertaining. I was surprised to watch it again and discover just how well the combination of the animation and the live action photography has held up. It's not completely seamless, but it's not really meant to be. It looks good -- vibrarant -- and it's really neat to watch cartoons manipulate live action props. I had always wondered how that was accomplished. That's what the DVD is for. It will answer that question and any others you may have. It also shows you extensive footage of the live action characters reacting to nothing, reacting to stand-in puppets, and reacting to electronic devices that do some of the animators' work for them. The supplemental material is interesting and well organized. The first disc is essentially for kids and passing fans. It has a full screen version so that little kids won't cry upon seeing black lines. The second disc is for more interested adult spectators. It has the widescreen version and the commentary.  I would recommend the DVD for its extras as much as for its actual film content. There is even a fun set-up where you must search for some of the special features. Silly as this sounds, it ended up being kind of fun, partly because they had the good sense to make it an actual search, fraught with disappointing leads that bring you nowhere. And, by the way, open the vault -- it's weird. You'll know what I mean when you get the DVD.
