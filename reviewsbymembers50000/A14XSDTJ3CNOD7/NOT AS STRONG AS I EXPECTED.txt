 I was a huge fan of the movie, and particularly the music in it. The problem with this disc is that they break up the beautiful and unique score with less beautiful and less unique songs. Look at the track listing and you'll see several examples, including Hawaiian music, a rock song, and a vocal by Jon Brion, who's better served by pure instrumentation. Rather than getting the soundtrack, I would recommend getting the movie and enjoying the score in its true context.
