 "The Sweet Hereafter," a miraculous adaptation of an oddly structured but brilliant book by Russel Banks, is one of the most lovely, unforgettable movies of the 90's. Egoyan incorporates the music of the Tragically Hip (performed both by them, and hauntingly by the film's star Sarah Polley), barren winter imagery, deeply layered characters, and a non-linear story line all to great effect. Probably the most effective scenes in the movie are the times when the landscape is still and the characters just sit. There is the haunting feedback of a discarded guitar, the silent play between Ian Holm and Sarah Polley in their few scenes together, the moment in which the doomed school bus at the story's center hovers tenuously on the ice...Everything has the effect of passing the viewer into a world at once bleak and hopeful, beautiful and disturbing. The ideas behind the film go deeper than just grief and loss, often so deep that they cannot be fully articulated even far down in the viewers soul. It just sits there like a weight on the heart for weeks after viewing and never lets the viewer escape its haunting grip. Sarah Polley and Ian Holm give standout performances, Atom Egoyan confirms the genious sugested at in "Exotica," and the score is a must-have for any music fan. I couldn't recommend the film any more strongly. It is the best film of the 90's.
