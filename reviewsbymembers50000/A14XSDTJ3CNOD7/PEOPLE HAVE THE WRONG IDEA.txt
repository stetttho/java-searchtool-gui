 I didn't know that I was going to like this CD when I bought it, but through some convergence of good luck I bought it anyway. Like many people I had developed the incorrect opinion that Lisa Loeb was nothing more than fluffy pop and could be clumped together more with N'SYNC and The Backstreet Boys than with singer/songwriters like Aimee Mann or Liz Phair. I was wrong, and I whole-heartedly admit that now. Lisa Loeb is an alt-rock magician of the highest order. Yes, her songs are infectious and loveable, but they're also tricky and strange. In one song you'll find a hard electric guitar riff (like "Alone") and in another you'll find a soft acoustic guitar (like "Sandalwood"). Some of the tracks on this disc are wild rock songs ("Snow Day," "Taffy," and, most noteably, "Garden of Delights"). Others are dreamy, slow, artful constructions ("Hurricane" or "Lisa Listen"). Of course her lyrics are brilliant also (for instance "I may not be a quaalude living in a speed zone, but I can be restful" from "When All the Stars Were Falling"). It's just a good CD, a really, really good CD, and it will surprise a lot of people if those people will just give it a shot. Rent a copy from the local library, borrow one from a friend, get a few of the songs online, just do something. I don't care what. By the time you've actually heard everything that Lisa Loeb had going on here on her "Tails" disc you'll just end up buying it like any other sane person.
