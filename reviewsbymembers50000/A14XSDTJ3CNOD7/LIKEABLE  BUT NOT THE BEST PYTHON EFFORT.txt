 This movie has some misteps in it, but nothing too bad. Overall it's a funny, entertaining movie with a lot of classic scenes. I enjoy the scene in which a professor at a boy's school uses himself and his wife as an example for a sexual education class. He scolds members of the class for snickering as he makes love in front of them, occasionally asking questions of the class and making comments on the act. Mostly, though, there are two things to recommend this movie by: 1) Terry Gilliam's short film which accompanies the movie and finds its way into the body of the narative. It reminded me of Gilliam's "Brazil" and has one of the most comically brilliant endings of any piece of film-making that I have ever seen. 2) There is also an almost ten minute long singing, dancing, old-style Hollywood dance number in which a Catholic father explains to his LARGE family that "every sperm is sacred." The number is genius, as is the way that the parade of dancing children continues into the background of the next scene. See the movie. You'll be entertained, but not as much so as by some of Monty Python's other work.
