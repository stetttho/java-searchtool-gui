 I am convinced that people who say that they like Madonna's newer stuff are only saying so out of habit. It would appear that actually responding to the song "Music" would be quite impossible, being that it is awful. I would, in fact, list the song as the worst piece of music released in the entire callender year in which it came out. There was little competition, partly owing to the fact that J-Lo was in hibernation. Avoid this song and live a long and pain-free life.
