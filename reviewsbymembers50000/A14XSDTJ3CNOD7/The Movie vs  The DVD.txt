 The movie rises above the DVD in this package. I don't like the addition of a new song, but the original version is included, so it's tough to complain too loudly. I think the games are too inane even for children, but, then again, who buys a Disney disc for a couple of five minute games? On the second disc, I think that the way the features are split up into different sections of Africa is a little overly cute, but when you do find the features, they're pretty good, and don't come off sounding like advertisments for the company like on some of the other Disney discs.  If you like the movie, which you should, this disc will more than satisfy you, if only for the clarity and quality of the picture and sound on the movie itself. A great buy.
