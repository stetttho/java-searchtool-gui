 I had avoided Stephen King's "Dark Tower" series for a long time, and now feel quite dumb for having made the effort. I had worked under the false assumption that since Stephen King was best known for writing straight horror that was all that he could write, and  "The Dark Tower" sure didn't sound like straight horror. As it turned out Stephen King is good at absolutely everything, including epic, cross-generational, large scale, near-religious, apocolyptic drama. "The Dark Tower" series is some of his very best work, filled with any variety of adventure and suspense, not to mention some of the fullest characters that he has ever writen. "The Drawing of the Three" is the standout of the series so far, not to suggest that the others are slouches. Get these books. You will not be disappointed, even if you typically dislike King.
