 Aimee Mann's battle to get this CD released on her own terms and with her own vision intact is well known. What isn't quite as commonly mentioned is the degree to which the battle for her art honed Aimee Mann's skill as a singer/songwriter. She is now better than she had ever been, and better than I ever thought that she could become. Her songs on this disc are more mature than her previous work, containing much less blind condemnation of others and much more realization of the complexities of the issues that she discusses. The songs are also more interesting musically, as evidenced by "Nothing Is Good Enough" having appeared on the "Magnolia" soundtrack as an standout instrumental (though the lyrics present on "Bachelor #2" add a whole other dimension). "Red Vines" is the best song that she has done, followed by "Calling It Quits," "Satelite," and "Nothing Is Good Enough," all of which appear on this disc. She's blown the roof off of personal, guitar-driven soft rock. Here's to more independent spirit in music. Look what it has done for Aimee Mann.
