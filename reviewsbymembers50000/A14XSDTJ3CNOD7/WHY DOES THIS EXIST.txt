 Oddly enough, this game seemed like a great big advertisement for itself. Why it would advertise for itself, I don't know, but that's what it was doing. I'm amazed that people, even small children, would be so receptive to self-love on this level, but, then again, I've been amazed before. I'm sorry for those who think that this game is the height of entertainment. I assure you that there is more out there.
