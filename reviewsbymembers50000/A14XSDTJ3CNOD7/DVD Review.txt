 We'll all agree that the movie is quite good, with an excellent score, beautiful animation, and a loveably dark story. The question is whether this DVD treatment of the film is adequate. My answer: sort of. This is essentially the same DVD package that Disney has put together for its other recent animated releases (Snow White, Beauty and the Beast). There are a lot of pictures in the same too cute gallery set up, the same type of making of information that you got in the previous DVDs, the same inane games that I can't imagine even young kids enjoy, and the obligatory short film (excellent, but I would have preferred to see some originality injected into the package). Everything on the second disc comes off sounding like an advertisement for Disney that they've tricked you into paying for.  However, the picture quality on the DVD is astounding, as is the sound, so at the end of the day, the first disc provides exactly what any reasonable movie lover is looking for. You're buying a great movie in its full glory, but you're also buying an extensive advertisment for Disney. Make your own choice, but, overall, I'd recommend the purchase.
