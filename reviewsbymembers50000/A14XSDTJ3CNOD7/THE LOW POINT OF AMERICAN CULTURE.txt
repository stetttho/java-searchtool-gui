 "Who let the dogs out?" you may ask. Sadly, just about everyone for a really, really long time. They let them out on the radio, on television, at sporting events, and even in their own homes. They wouldn't stop letting the dogs out no matter how much their consciences complained. Please don't let the dogs out anymore. Please. I'll give you a cute little doggy biscuit and pat you on the head. Thank you for you cooperation.
