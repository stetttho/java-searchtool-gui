 The soft start and electric brake are nice features. The folding stand is stable and reasonbly solid. The 3812 uses a T slot for the miter gauge which is helpful in crosscutting wide stock- the miter gauge stays in the table instead of trying to fall to the ground and it's a feature the Bosch 4000 and DeWalt don't have. And it costs less too.
