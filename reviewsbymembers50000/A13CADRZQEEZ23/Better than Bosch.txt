 The Milwaukee 6266 is made in Germany (well made)...... an AEG (also an Atlas-Copco company) dressed in Milwaukee red. Far easier blade changes than the Bosch and I think its a smoother saw. No problems with sightlines for me as some reviewers have mentioned- just as good as previously owned Bosch and PC jigsaws. If your in the market for a jigsaw, don't overlook this one. A step above the Bosch, imho. Highly recommended.
