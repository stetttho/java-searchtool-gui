 Improved over the Mag 77- more power (15 amps vs 13 of the Mag 77, the redesigned blade guard is less likely to hang up on bevel cuts,  and the shoe is far less likely to flex than that of the Mag 77. The Direct Connect works great; plug your extension cord directly into the saw. The built in rafter hook is a slick idea. Saw looked new ............ no way to tell it was a recon other than a sticker and the box it came in. Great saw at an excellent price.
