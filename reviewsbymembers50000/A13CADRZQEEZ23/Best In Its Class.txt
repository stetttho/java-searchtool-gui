 Plenty of power- doesn't bog down. Long lived ....... in shops I've worked in PC was the sander of choice.Belt tracks very well. The variable speed is handy and is a separate wheel control as it should be. At this price and the full warranty it's a no brainer. You could pay more and get a lot less sander.
