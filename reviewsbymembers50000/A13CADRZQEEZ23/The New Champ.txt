 For quite some the Bosch Bulldog has been considered by many the best rotary hammer in it's class. Not any more. A local tool show had an impromtu side by side test between the Bosch and Hitachi reps- the Hitachi won handily drilling faster each time. I'm pleased with mine, powerful yet lightweight.
