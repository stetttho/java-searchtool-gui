 Smooth is the word here ...... soft starts, and no bogging down with the electronic motor control. Dead on right out of the box. Nice cutting capacities ......... will do the vast majority of what a SCMS will do for a lot less money. Easy to carry despite its size- handle is in just the right spot. Highly recommended.
