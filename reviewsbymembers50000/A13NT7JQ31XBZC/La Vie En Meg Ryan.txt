 This movie is, I believe to be, Meg Ryan's best movie to date. She and Kevin Kline have such amazing chemistry in this film that it makes other similar movies like "You got Mail" and "When Harry Met Sally" pale in comparisson. Bold statment, eh? I mean every word of it too. Meg Ryan once again plays the quirky control freak aside a flighty frenchman (Kline) with alterior motives. This movie truely taps into certain stereotypes but also reveals some sincere attributes that both American and French cultures don't make apparent. It does have the typical "opposites attract" theme that is ever so popular with comedic romance films, but it works in this case. French Kiss has been categorized as a "chick flick" but take it from me guys... it's a pretty nice movie. Don't be affraid to check this movie out.
