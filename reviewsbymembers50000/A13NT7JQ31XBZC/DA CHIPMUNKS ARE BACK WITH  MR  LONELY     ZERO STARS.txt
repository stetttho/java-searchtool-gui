 This is a the saddest f---ing "hip-hop" album I have ever hard! I was in a carpool with someone who had this CD in and "lonely" came on.... HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!!! HOLY SH-T!!! I NEVER NEW THAT THE CHIPMUNKS WENT ALL GHETTO FABULOUS NOW!!! WTF! I CAN'T KEEP UP WITH YOU RETARDED HIP-POP BOZO'S! First of all: Akon can't sing or rap to save his life and his lyrics are gayer than Ellen Degeneres. People that like this s--t should be put in front of a firing range FOR BAD TASTE!! Come on people! Get a f---ing clue! HIP-HOP WILL ONLY SURVIVE ONCE WE KILL ALL THIS "CRUNK" BULLS--T!
