 This show stinks!  Watching "American Dad" is like drinking a luke warm, watered down, generic version of Coca-Cola. It has the same theme of characters, but is nothing close to the humor of "Family guy". Face it people, this show ain't no "Family Guy"! Just as "Family Guy" was beginning to distinguish itself apart from "The Simpsons", Seth Macfarlane decided to throw this "wrench" into the works. Shame on you!
