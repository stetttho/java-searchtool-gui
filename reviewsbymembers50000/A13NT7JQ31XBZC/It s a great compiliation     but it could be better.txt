 Frigid's appeal is definatley in his live performance. He is just as fierce as he is glamourous. His own tracks on this album are fabulous and deserve all credit due, BUT I believe that this album could have been blended together alot smoother. I dunno, maybe I'm not understanding the mission of this album... Are we trying to make an "electro dance" album or is it supposed to be somewhat sparse like a rock album. I'm a bit confused. I've probably confused you, the viewer, too. Let me explain myself...  I think that part of the appeal of being a good DJ is not only having great taste in music but most importantly being able to keep an even flow when mixing and blending tracks together. Non-stop music that keeps the groove going. Ya know? Anyways, this album is way too cut-in-paste for a compilation album by a DJ of Frigid's caliber. Granted the selection of tracks are cleverly choosen and arranged, but there is no continous "flow". That would have made this album flawless in my opinion. I would definatley reccomend this album to anyone who is into music like Tiga, Keoki or Miss Kittin. Just remember that this album isn't what it seems to be.
