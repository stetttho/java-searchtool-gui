 This movie is amazing simply because it exists. In any other country this movie would be banned and anyone involved with the making of it would be executed. The reason why some people hate this movie, I believe, is because they don't want to  accept that this is actually happening. All the statements and images in this movie are 100% true. There isn't any actors or reinacted scenes. It's all raw information. People don't like hearing this. It's like telling a person that their mother is a theif and a murderer. PEOPLE THAT HATE THIS MOVIE ARE IN DENIAL, PLAIN AND SIMPLE. We as American's are very priviledged because we can go to bed safe with the fact we can practice any religion and beliefs without being hauled off in the middle of the night by the "police". This movie is far from being anti-America. It actually has motivated me to become a better American and to not just sit back hope that things fix themselves. That is what's so great about living here in the U.S... WE CAN QUESTION AUTHORITY. Being patriotic isn't lightening fireworks, eating BBQ and putting stupid little bumper stickers on our cars. Patriotism means loving your country and wanting the best for it. The fact of the matter is that we are at war with a country that is dirt poor to begin with. We had no real reason to invade it. There are alterior motives going on and lives are being taken for frivolous reasons. People don't want to accept it. My brother is a Veteran MP with the Air Force. He was in Iraq. He saw things first hand. Some of the experiences he has had during his year there are just plain sickening. Open your eyes people. I love this country but our nation needs some major improvements. Once we remove the "We the Pristine American" veil from our eyes then we can really make changes in our world.
