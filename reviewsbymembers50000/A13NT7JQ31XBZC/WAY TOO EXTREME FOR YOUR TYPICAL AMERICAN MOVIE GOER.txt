 I admit when I watched this movie I was absolutley disturbed! It enraged me and made me feel violated. But then I went over this movie in my head for days and weeks... analyzing certain moments and effects... discussed it with others... tried to imagine alternatives... FOR WEEKS!!! and it dawned on me... THIS IS A PRETTY GOOD F---ING MOVIE! If this movie can move someone to the point of this much emotion it has done a remarkable job. JUST LOOK AT THE OUTRAGED RESPONES IN THIS COLUMN. This movie was intended to shed light on something that some people only hear about in stories. Its not intended to be erotic! Unfortunatley some sickos might see it that way. But thats not the mission of this film. This movie peels away from all that HOLLYWOOD NONESENSE and over-endulgence and gives you the gritty f---ing truth. You can't romantisize this kind of subject matter, people. This is a terribly realistic movie! It deals with very tragic themes and adult situations! If you watch this movie be aware! THE WARNING OF THIS MOVIE'S CONTENT IS CLEARLEY STATED ON IT'S COVER! The special effects are astounding! THE EDITING OF THIS MOVIE WAS INTENTIONAL TO THOSE OF YOU WHO DON'T SEEM TO UNDERSTAND. Remember the "Blair Witch Project"? Okay... well that's the idea. It's supposed to be unfiltered and candid, almost nausiating. It suits the subject matter. Notice the minimal use of editing? Every scene is filmed in one edit. Its supposed to be raw and unsettling. No frills, just pure emotions. It's an amazing film.  I admit, this isn't a movie that I would care to own or watch repeatedly... but I can't deny it's force and its amazing direction.
