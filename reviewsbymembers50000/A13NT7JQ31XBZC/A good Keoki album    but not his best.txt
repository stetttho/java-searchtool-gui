 I bought this after a friend reccommended it. I was impressed with the first disc of this double disc album but the second comes up short. I understand the idea of this album, though. Keoki tries to blend several different genres of sounds and music together BUT I think that when it comes to electronica/ dance music some songs are un-mixable if you understand what I saying. The first disc of this album starts of with a fabulous mix of new wave and electro-clash songs and ends with sexy acid house sounds flawlessly. The second disc very scattered. Keoki throws in some amazing songs like the remix of "7 nation army", and "Assymetric"...  and who knew that you could turn Marilyn Monroe's "Diamonds Are A Girls Best Friend" into a decent club mix?! But then there are these odd songs that just throw the flow of the album off. Executive slacks' Rock & Roll is a great song but does not belong in this kind of an album. Anyways. It's definatley a good party album for those of you who like electronica but have friends that don't like it. I personaly think it needs some minor improvements.
