 This has to be one of the worst movies I've seen this year. Aren't movies supposed to entertain and enlighten the viewer? This movie has no likable characters, a weak plot and no morals from beginning to end. These characters have no dignity and are terribly unrealistic. I have never known a mother to do anything like this. A true mother's love for her children is stronger than lust. This movie is like watching a really bad Jerry Springer episode. Mom is screwing her daughter's lover who also happens to be envolved with somebody else. Lets wait and see who throws the first blow. It's just plain unbelievable and sick.
