 I give Bjork credit were she has credit due because the woman will never sucumb to the "pop culture" epidemic which has plagued  most of America. Bjork has always been 3 steps ahead of the game and has always crossed boundries artistically. So it really pains me to say that Medulla is Bjork's worst album to date. Giving it a fair trial, I  listened to it almost everyday for a week since it's release thinking that it would grow on me... no such luck. Medulla is far too experimental and has no structure. Granted the simplicity of the album and the vocal stylings are semi-interesting but this album as a whole left me aprehensive and annoyed. Of the 14 tracks, I will sincerely say that "Triumph of the Heart", "Oceania", and "Mouth's Cradle" are the only worthwhile songs in the whole album. The rest is garbage. One awful track that sticks out in my mind is "ancestors" which sounds alot like the inside of an ill-equipped mental institution. The rest of the tracks are novice and mellowdramatic filler that is passed off as artistic musical and acapla interludes. It's very dissapointing experience. All of Bjork's previous albums have been, if not excellent, good. Bjork is known for her highly stylized and symphonic music, an engaging voice and poetic lyrics that are tender yet anthemic. Medulla, unfortunatley, is an unremarkable and self-indulgent copy cat hybrid of Selma Songs and Vespertine. I think I'll just put the "Medulla-Mishap" away for now and listen to her greatest hits album until she comes out with her next album.
