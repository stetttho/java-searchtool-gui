 This is a crazy movie! Love Object is about a boring office drone  named Kenneth that finds the type of love that no other film has yet tapped into. Everything is all lovey dovey for the moment but later, when the "honeymoon" ends, Kenneth finds himself being mentaly and physicaly controlled by his evil love doll. Granted, the movie becomes a little predictable towards the end but it is definatley original and entertaining. I watched this movie with my mother and we were both in uncontrolable laughter throughout the whole film. If you are into dark and bizzare horror comedies, PLEASE check this movie out. It is really unique!
