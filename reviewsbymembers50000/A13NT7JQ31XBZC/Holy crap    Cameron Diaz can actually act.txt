 Okay. There was Vanilla Sky, Gangs of New York, and Being John Malkovich... but in my opinion, Cameron Diaz hasn't really put out that strong of an acting role in her career till now. Maybe this character was a little close to her heart? Maybe it was the director's savvy? I really enjoyed her in this film. "Maggie" seemed real to me. Cameron's portrayal of this character didn't seem doctored, or far fetched. The only thing that I found to be a little silly was the aloofness that Toni Colette's character demonstrated during the absence of Maggie. I have younger siblings and if they went missing for so many days/months with no contact, I would assume the worst. Murder? Abduction? Rape? True: Maggie was the careless and free spirited type BUT she was still living at home with her parents and did have an intimate relationship with her older sister. This movie did little to pardon this logical notion. Maybe it's in the book? I should hope so. All else aside... this movie has some great acting, touching moments, and some sexy ladies.
