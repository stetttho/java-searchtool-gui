 What I love about these kind of movies is that all your nosey, rude, oversexed, and overly developed upper class "teens" get slashed up good! This is a classic teen slasher flick! Stupid characters in a stupid story line that get all hacked up in the end. I LOVE IT!!! THIS MOVIE IS WORTH WATCHING ONLY TO SEE PARIS HILTON GET WHACKED! Had I been the director I would have made her death scene LONGER and MORE BRUTAL! True, it's not real and she probably got paid bank for this mediocre role (everyone knows that that bimbo doesn't need any extra income...) but it's fun to watch! The only thing that would have made this movie any better would have been killing off Chad Michael Murray by throwing his untalented ass into a boiling vat of wax! Oh well... maybe in the sequel? :)
