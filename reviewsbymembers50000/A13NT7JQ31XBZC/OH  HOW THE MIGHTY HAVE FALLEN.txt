 This album is shameful. I WAS a huge Madonna fan... since the get-go days of lucky star and everybody. I have watched Madonna morph into the mega star that she is today. She has paved the way for singers like Britney and Christina. All her albums have been, in my opinion, either fantastic or fair. But "American Life" is steaming pile of self centered dogma with inane lyrics with weak melodies. This album truely demonstrates her dry spell of creativity. Was she purposely trying to date herself?  What the hell was she thinking!? MADONNA HAS GONE SOFT.  OPEN NOTE TO MADONNA: Please do us all a favor and drop the mellow-dramatic kabbalah S#!T AND GIVE YOU'RE FANS WHAT THEY WANT. Good Pop-Dance music. Okay Okay... you're a very spiritual and senstive soul. You're a mommy now, married, yadda yadda yadda... We get the picture! But this so called spiritual journey that you're going on is really spoiling you're music. CHER IS MORE RELEVANT THAN YOU ARE NOWADAYS!  Eventually Madonna fans will get bored and Madonna will become  another old fart in Las Vegas singing her older tunes like Celine Dion. Thank God for The Emaculate Collection!
