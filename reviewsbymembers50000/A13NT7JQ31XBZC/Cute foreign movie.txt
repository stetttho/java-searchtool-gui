 This movie was very charming but the ending feels hurried and a little bit unsatisfying. The young boy in this movie is cute cute cute! Great character! Yet, I still feel that this movie could have had a much more touching and heartfelt ending. I love these kind of foreign films, though. It's hard to find American movies that portray the whimsy life without becoming over the top. Valentin is a cute film but I would reccommend something else. Check out The Color of Heaven or Cinema Paradiso.
