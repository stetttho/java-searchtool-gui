 The re-releases of the the un-releases is like audio LSD. COS have blended a medley of sounds and genres on one album that are very different but flow suprisingly well together. My only descerning criticism of this album is the really annoying yelps and screams that seem to sparatically jump up through the album. All shreeks aside, it has become a fast favorite in my music collection. I'd  reccommend this album to people who enjoy new wave and electro-clash style music. :)
