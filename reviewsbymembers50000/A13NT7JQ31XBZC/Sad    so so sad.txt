 Remixed and Revisted is a sad attempt to boost Madonna's fading credibility. The woman has lost sight of her target audience and nobody cares about her anymore now that she's gone all soft. It shows in her album sales. The only saving grace of this album is the remix of "Into the Groove" with Missy Elliot... but I would reccommend downloading that specific song on mp3 before wasting your money and buying the whole album. Where's Dita when you need her?
