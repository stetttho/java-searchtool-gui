 These are wonderful cartoons that I grew up with as a child and I'm only 25. It's amazing how cartoons nowadays have become so self indulgent and garish. It seems that the majority of these newer animated series have lost perspective of it's target audience and have been putting out mellowdramatic garbage since the  mid-nineties. I think children of this generation would appreciate something lighthearted and refreshing like a collection of Fleischer cartoons. There is one little flaw to this specific collection, though. In the middle of the first DVD it continues to play the same episode  repeatedly... and from what I've read here in these previous  reviews it's not only my DVD. Granted, it's not that big of a deal. All you have to do is return to the menu and select the next episode to play. Glitches and all, I think it's worth having these great cartoons on DVD.
