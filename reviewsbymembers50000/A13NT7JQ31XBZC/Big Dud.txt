 Okay. So this movie has its moments. Very magical characters in a whimsical setting... BUT when you put all that fluff aside, the Dad in this movie isn't anything more than a big pompous windbag. The father in this movie just reminded me of all those people that I've bumped into that brag about the same unbelievable things that they have or have done... yet everyone knows that they are just like me and you... boring slobs. For example, when the father blantantly steels his son's thunder at HIS OWN WEDDING! It just makes me cringe. He was no hero. Just an daft old man with a wild imagination.
