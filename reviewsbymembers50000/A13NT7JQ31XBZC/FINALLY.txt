 This is what it's all about people! This is what the "true blue" Madonna fans have been waiting for! Thank you, Madonna! Maddie has finally crawled out of the hole that she dug herself into! This album stands on it's own! Madonna has once again regained the attention of her original audience with this "dance" driven delight! "Confessions" is not your conventional "pop" album and it definatley isn't a straight up "dance" album either. There are a few songs (I Love New York) that are pretty "vapid" but ironically remain very very catchy. This album grows on you. I admit that I was very bitter after the atrocity that was "American Life" and was very skeptical of Madonna's future musical endeavors. But thank the Gods of Disco Heaven!!! Madge still has it in her!
