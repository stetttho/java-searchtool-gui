 This is probably THE FUNNIEST PUPPET MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN!!!  At first viewing,  its really hard to stomach due to its explicit nature... but this movie will soon become one of your top ten picks. Trust me. This movie is sooo bad, its good! Meet the Feeble's is about the horrible demize of a musical variety show, and it's actors. All the characters are played by these really cheap looking puppets in poor lighting. If someone decided to make a cocktail with the elements of Requiem for a Dream and The Muppet Show, you would have this movie! If you are into "dark and twisted" comedies like Death to Smoochy, Pink Flamingos, or Dead Alive, this is the movie for you! It's hilarious but obviously not for everyone.  (...)
