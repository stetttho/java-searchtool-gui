 This C.D has an amazing sense of whimsy and magic. What suprised me about this C.D was when I heard it playing over the intercom at a local coffee shop... I could have sworn it was new music from Emilana Torrini! Anja sounds just like her! Anyways... I just had to give Emilana her props cause she is totally underrated. As for Flunk, they have my full attention. After purchasing and listening to the C.D there is no comparissons. Gorgeous lyrics and haunting melodies. This C.D is a must have if you are into groups like Goldfrapp or (once again) Emilana Torrini. Get it! ;)
