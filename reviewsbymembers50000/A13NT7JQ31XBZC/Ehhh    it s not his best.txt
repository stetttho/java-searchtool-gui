 This album isn't Keoki's strongest material but please give him another  chance! The first time I saw Keoki live was in Portland Oregon around the same time this album came out. The show was just plain awful. Whomever decided to host the party also had the stupid idea of passing out glow sticks to all these stupid little "rave kids". Keoki went up and got pelted with glowsticks in the middle of his set and it totally killed his flow. The rest of his set was totally lame. So unfortunatley that was not a good experience. It ruined the whole Superstar Keoki persona for me...  up untill recently. Keoki is better than ever now. I saw him at Seattle's Club Medusa and have regained all faith in the man. Keoki is amazing! Please check out his "Kill the DJ" album. You will not be dissapointed.
