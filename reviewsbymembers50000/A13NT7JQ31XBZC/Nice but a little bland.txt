 This album is beautifully executed but it's still a little too bland for my taste. I guess I was expecting something more along the lines of Miguel Migs. I know, bad comparisson... but still. I would recommend this album to those of you who are really into "chill out" style music and are looking for something with some Latin flavor. It sets a very seductive mood.
