 WOW! Picture yourself in a posh gentleman's club in downtown London, where the dancers are gorgeous, talented and frisky?  Or a hot underground night club in New york City where all the patrons are frocked in "Glam-Rock" threads and throwing back cocktails? This is definatley what you would hear in the background! Goldfrapp has done it again! They just get better and better with time... just like a fine wine. Hot lyrics to go with sultry music. This album definatley sets a bewitching mood. Glamorous, exotic, and electro-chic; "Supernature" outdoes anything that Goldfrapp has put out so far!  Hottest Tracks!  Oh La La, Lovely 2 C U, Number 1, Slide in, Ride A White Horse, You Never Know, and Beautiful (Available on the Number 1 Single).
