 There is no need to hit the skip or shuffle button on your player when listening to this perfect "lounge" album. Usually most c.d's have that one annoying song that just knocks the flow of an album out of rhythm. You know what I mean. "Brazilian Girls" has that unyielding groove that most legendary albums obtain. This album is very unique, almost too unique to compare it to other groups. I have yet to hear another band that can make bossa nova sound "edgy" without totally slaughtering it's integrity. It does have some Portishead like qualities, it's just not a fair comparisson. Brazilain Girls' sound is like if Ian Pooley and Esquivel had a child, weened by Poe, who grows up listening to Cafe Tacuba and Sublime in France. !!! I know... it's a crazy discription but the most apropriate in my opinion. Anyways, check it out. You won't be disappointed.
