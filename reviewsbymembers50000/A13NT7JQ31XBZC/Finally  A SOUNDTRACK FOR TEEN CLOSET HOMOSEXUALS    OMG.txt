 Like, this album is totally awesome! Before I was very much in denial of my gay tendencies but after seeing High School Musical and hearing it's soundtrack, I am a full fledged homosexual!!! Thank you Disney channel! I'm here! I'm queer! I'm sure that the majority of my fellow HSM fan's can relate!!! OMG! This soundtrack was the gateway to my "homofication"! Zac is so hot! Yay!  Toodles!
