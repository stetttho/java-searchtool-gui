 LOA are just plain amazing. Other musical acts have tried to imitate their sound but have failed miserably. I purchased "Our Little Secret" when it first came out but have rediscovered it recently and I'm still thrilled by it to this day. This album touches upon all sounds of music from hard house, rock, happy-hardcore, industrial... but the LOA way.
