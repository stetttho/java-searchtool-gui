 Reading the reviews here and on the DVD jacket of this movie are really bizzare to me. This movie was so boring that I couldn't finish it. Don't get me wrong... I love dramas. Especially indie dramas. But this one was just seemed very uninspired. Maybe I'll try renting it again... maybe watch in a different frame of mind?  Nahhh.
