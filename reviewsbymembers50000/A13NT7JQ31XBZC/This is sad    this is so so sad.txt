 What in the world was this movie about!? I'm still confused! Bad actors, stupid story and plot, and not to mention AWFUL LIGHTING! The movie title is "ALONE IN THE DARK"... not once was it actually dark nor was there a moment of loneliness in this film! AND WHAT WAS UP WITH THAT AWKWARD SEX SCENE?!? I get hotter watching insects boink on the discovery channel! This movie's theme is like a hybrid of Starship Troopers/ Aliens/ Resident Evil all horribly mangled together to form this atrocity! Not once was there something original or remarkable in this film. IT'S PATHETIC! Slater is definatley trying to remain in the public eye cause this is movie is the bottom of the barrel! Do yourself a favor and DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE! It so sad to see someone like Slater who used to be so cool stoop so low. HARD RAIN WAS A BETTER THAN THIS, and that movie SUCKED ASS!   Christian Slater movies to re-watch after this dissapointment: 1. Pump Up The Volume 2. Heathers 3. Interview With A Vampire 4. True Romance
