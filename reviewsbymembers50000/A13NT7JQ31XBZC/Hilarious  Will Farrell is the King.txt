 In my book, Will Farrell can do no wrong. Even in his worst movies, Will delivers. People who dog this movie have too "dry" of a sense of humor and should stick to watching crap like "Frasier". I would say that this is one of Will Farrell's best movies by far. So if you love the guy and all his wacky characters, you will adore "Kicking and Screaming".
