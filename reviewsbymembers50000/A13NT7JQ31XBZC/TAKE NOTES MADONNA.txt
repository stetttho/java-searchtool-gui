 Just when I thought that Dance/Pop music had become hopeless with blithering ho-bags like Britney Spears and Jennifer Lopez stinking up our discoteques, "Neon Nights" comes to the rescue! THIS ALBUM IS AMAZING! Dannii's sound is like a fabulous hybrid of 80's Madonna with 90's Cathy Dennis for the 21st century. This C.D totally takes me back to the classic dance-music years of Jody Watley, Samantha Fox, Paula Abdul, La Bouche, Amber, I can go on... IT'S JUST AMAZING!!! Dannii's sound does have alot of similarity to her sister Kylie's music, but it's plain to see and hear that this woman is doing it MUCH better.  THIS IS WHAT DANCE MUSIC SHOULD BE LIKE PEOPLE!!! Madonna should take notes from this woman and get re-inspired. Seriously folks, it's that good.  Since I purchased this album I have turned numerous people on to Dannii's music. She is the reigning Dance/Pop Diva in my opinion. DANCE MUSIC IS ALIVE AGAIN!
