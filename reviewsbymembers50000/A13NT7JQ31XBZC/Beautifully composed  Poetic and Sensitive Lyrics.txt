 When first listening to this album, being new to Mandalay, I was too distracted by the singing style of the lead singer Nichola Hitchcock. Her voice has a very "opera" style flutter to it, and frankly it was a little too different for me. I still think that she overdoes it a little on certain songs, which makes it hard to understand the lyrics. "Like Her", for example, is a gorgeous song but the lyrics get muddled in the over-vocalization. I think alot of singers tend to do this thinking that they are personalizing a song which I think often times belittles the actual track more often than not. YET, the more I listened to this album the more entranced by it I was. Yes... It grew on me.  All the songs on this album are beautifully crafted and the lyrics are delicate yet passionate. Saul Freeman is nothing short of a genius. The compostions and layering are wonderfully complex and graceful. Listening to to "Solace" is like a modern, romantic lullaby for adults. My favorite songs are definatley "Deep love" and "Beautiful". I recommend this album to anyone who is into groups like, Frou Frou or Flunk.
