 I can't believe that director Todd Solondz killed off "Welcome to the Dollhouse's" Dawn Weiner for this crappy film! Don't get me wrong... Ellen Barkin and Jennifer Jason Leigh put out amazing performances but this movie is just plain scrambled! The story of a 13 year old girl which delusions of having a baby is actually really riveting and unique topic BUT it quickly becomes irrelevant once Solondz tries to blend dark humor, similiar of "Welcome to the Dollhouse", to a movie that clearly should be directed as a concrete drama. The constant physical changes of the main character, though interesting, are not appropriate for this movie. As a result the viewer feels a disconnetion to the main characters psyche, and redirects the attention to the characters superficial mannerisms. I think that if your going to go for "cheese" go all the way! John Waters knows this all too well. It just sullens the magnificent performances of the actors if you try to apply contrasting concepts into a film. And once again! To think that Dawn Weiner was mutilated to create this film! Why?! Why?! Why?!  R.I.P - Dawn Weiner. You will be missed.
