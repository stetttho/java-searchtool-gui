 John Carpenter must have wanted to shoot himself in the head after seeing this debacle! This film is not only boring, but just plain corny to boot! The revamping of a classic horror film does not mean that it must be an absolute copycat of the original. Sure, this remake adds and subtracts certain themes and characters but it still remains an unrefreshing and unoriginal mockery of the first film. The previous film should have been a very loose guide for the directors and writers for this film version. Take Dracula for example: This is a specific character and theme but it has been retold in a rainbow of unique scenarios. The Fog, taps into typical movie cliches and takes way too long to reveal it's weak  plot. We need to demand something more from our modern horror movies. We have become way too content with these film schematics.
