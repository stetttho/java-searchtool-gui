 Just when I thought Trey and Matt had lost all comedic sensibility, they come out with Team America the funniest f---ing film of 2004. Lets face it people. South Park is lame! And it has been for the past 2 seasons. But I digress... Team America is non-stop raunchy fun. Not only is this movie funny but it's a little true to nature. I can admit it... we're all a bunch of big, fat, arrogant American bastards that love to blow s--t up! F--k yeah! This movie is like looking into a fun house mirror... it's a distorted image BUT IT'S SADLY STILL YOUR REFLECTION! Trey and Matt go all out to make this movie the creme of kitsch and it works! The funniest scene is the puppet sex scene. GET THE UNCENSORED VERSION! IT'S ALOT FUNNIER! Team America is about the "World Police" and their relentless pursuit of WMD's. Along the way they hire an actor to infilterate the terrorists hiding place and find out who is conducting the terrorist acts. Thats when the s--t hits the fan. Stereotypes run rampant in this film and there is tons of hilarious puppet carnage! If you enjoy movies like Meet the Feebles or South Park The Movie, you'll love Team America.
