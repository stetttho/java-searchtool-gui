 Let me just start by telling you that this movie is hilarious! It is outrageous and wacky... yet not too far from the truth! I worked at a pizza parlour for 5 years, and I had my share of customers that got my "secret topping" for being rude. So keep that in mind before you get too snippy with your host.  The thing that really bothers me is the half-assed photoshop design on the cover of this movie! Yuck! A drunk monkey can do better! These designers just hack off an actor's face and slap it on another persons body... la dee da...  then hardly make the effort to blend it in! It looks HELLA CREEPY! Who are you trying to fool? This has become a plague amongst "movie cover designs". Just off the top of my head I can can give you some other hideous examples... Partner(s), Lord of War, The Fifth Season of The Andy Griffith Show... THESE EYE SORES NEED TO STOP!!! There are thousands of talented graphic artists and designers that are starving for some work. Why not spend of few extra dollers and get it done right?
