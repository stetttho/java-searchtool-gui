 Wow! So let me just say that this CD has once again redeemed Oakenfold as a Trance/House guru in my eyes. Creamfields is sheer musical splendor. "Bunkka" was a sad attempt to cross-over into "POP MUSIC HELL" and it truely turned me off. But I decided to forgive Paul for his musical flub and check this album out. I'm glad I did. To all of you "use-to-be" Oakenfold fans with the bitter "Bunkka" after taste... buy this album! It's a wonderful 2 coarse meal of Oakenfold's specialties.
