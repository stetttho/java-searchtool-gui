 Jennifer Lopez is even more pathetic than ever. When the woman came out with her debut album I was suprised that it was so well received cause the woman can't sing worth a damn and the content of the music is totally redundant. Granted, she did bring something exciting to the table being latina, attractive, and a great dancer... whooptie-frickin-do. WHY WASN'T THIS WOMAN A ONE HIT WONDER? I mean Bruce Willis makes better music than this hood-rat. Anyways. Listening to this album is like listening to any other J.Lo album out there. TOTALLY BORING AND UNORIGINAL. There is no "Rebirth" here. Jennifer Lopez realized what a media-whore she really was and what a frivilous lifestyle she was leading. People got tired of all the "Bennifer" Bulls--t. She's a desperate co-dependant, with a fleeting biological clock! People saw through the thin glamourous vail and saw her for what she really was... HOLLYWOOD TRASH. So what do her publicists come up with? REBIRTH! Whatever. The idea of her going through a change in lifestyle is laughable. Don't buy into this crap. JENNIFER LOPEZ ISN'T MADONNA... and don't get me started on Madonna, the Queen of Has-Beens!
