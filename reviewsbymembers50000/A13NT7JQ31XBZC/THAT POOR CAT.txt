 Wow. I just saw this movie for the first time today and I really enjoyed it. I can now see where a lot of these newer romatic comedies get their inspiration from this film. This movie is very photogenic. Hepburn looks gorgeous from start to finish. The story is very simple and a little predictable but its a very fun film... AND THAT POOR CAT! That little guy did alot of crazy stunts in this movie. Hope he got paid well. Ha ha ha. ;)
