 This movie's only saving grace is Nicole's strong acting ability, gorgeous scenamatopgraphy, and the beautiful musical score... otherwise it is the most unrealistic, and unsettling movie I have ever seen from Kidman. This movie is pretty much about a very gullable and emotionally unstable widow, who is about to remarry when a 10 year old boy tells her that he is the reincarnation of her late husband. The movie drags on tideously with little suspense and ends with a very predictable ending. This movie is embarassing. It has no logic or reason, no likable characters, and the little boy in this movie is about as charming as a wet gym sock. Why a grown woman would allow herself to fall in love with a child like that is beyond me. It really makes no sense. It makes me question whether there are any adults that stupid in this world.  I don't advocate child abuse but If I were Nicole Kidman's character in this movie, I would have beat that evil little boy to a bloody pulp in the end. That would have made the movie a little more satisfying in my opinion.
