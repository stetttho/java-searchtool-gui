 This movie is great! Yes... it's very silly, but it's supposed to be! I guess some hoity-toity reviewers are too smug to enjoy a lighthearted comedy like this. It's a shame. Why be serious all the time? Real life is so serious anyways. Thats why people enjoy  these kind of movies. Oh well. Anyways... I found myself giggling about this movie, just thinking about certain scenes, all day the very next day. This movie has some decent special effects, funny dialogues, and some crazy characters. All in all, this movie is definatley worth checking out. :)
