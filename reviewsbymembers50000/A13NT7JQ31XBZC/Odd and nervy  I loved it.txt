 I'LL KEEP THIS REVIEW SHORT AND SIMPLE. Bartleby has become one of my most favorite indie films to date. It's so bizzare and different, it truely stands out from any movie I've ever seen. I used to work in an office like this and its painfully realistic in my opininon. Granted, the characters in this movie are exaggerated for entertainment purposes but I can totally recall past co-workers in this film. This movie is bound to become a cult classic. If you enjoy dark and oddball comedies, this movie has your name all over it.
