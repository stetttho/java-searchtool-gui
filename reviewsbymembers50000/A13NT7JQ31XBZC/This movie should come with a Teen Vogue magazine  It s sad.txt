 This movie isn't even worthy of 1 star, it's complete sappy garbage. This film has no realistic or sensible characters AND NO PLOT what so ever. I'm convinced that a bunch of 16 year old girls got together and wrote the screenplay for this film... seriously, all this movie needed was a bunch of pretty ponies and a cameo by Ashley Simpson and Orlando Bloom. It's so played out!  The whole "Save me Mr. Sexy Fireman and take me away to your magical floating castle in the sky" fantasy is shat out in the form of this film for all those airhead teen girls and horny soccer mom's to flick off to. I'd rent something with Hilary Duff if I wanted to subject myself to that kind of mellowdramatic tripe. Yuck! I was seriously expecting to see these guys running around shirtless in the firestation lockeroom. Someone in editing probably came to their senses and cut that out thank God! What a shame for Joaquin Phoenix! This is definatley one movie that I would want to bump off my resume if I were him. We should expect better. If you have even half a brain, an once of dignity, or ANY decent cinematic taste, avoid this movie as if it were the plague.
