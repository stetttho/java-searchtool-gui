 My high school career was never as colorful as in this movie but it has some very striking similarities! The fact of the matter is that most high school girls are set in a competitive background so the cattiness just naturally follows. Boys are very physical when showing their emotions. We get pissed, we exchange insults, and most often than not, we come to blows. Girls, on the other hand, are much more slick when taking their rivals down. Sure... a girl can beat the crap out of another girl just a well as a guy would, but it doesn't flatter the "feminine mystique" does it? And why risk getting your face all scratched up when psychological scars are much more permanent? Some girls work this way and to be quite honest, it's a little scary. True: This movie has it's cliches BUT isn't high school life a big cliche when you think about it? The clique's, the hierarchy of students, the mellow drama... yuck! 'Mean Girls' is an exaggerated synopsis of modern high school life. It's dark, it's amusing, and it's garish. The good, the bad, and the ugly. The only negative thing that I found in this movie was the predicatable happy ending. This never happens in real high school life but still remains satisfying in high school movies. Examples: Never been kissed, Lucas, and anything with Molly Ringwald. Cute story, proficient acting, funny one-liners, and a great soundtrack. What more can you ask for?  ...oh yeah! Hot young girls.
