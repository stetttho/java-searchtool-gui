 This is one of the most OVERRATED movies I have ever seen. It baffles me that it got so many good reviews, awards, and nominations! IT'S CRAP! SOON WE'LL BE SEEING ACADEMY AWARD NOMINATONS FOR JERRY SPRINGER EPISODES! Come on, people! This movie gives the viewer no hope or reassurance that ACTUAL  TRUE LOVE exists. The characters in this movie are a big hoard of oversexed jerks that cheat on each other with no remorse. Granted, the actors in this movie give their all, but the whole story of this movie is just plain depressing and repulsive. This is basically a movie about infidelity. Not one person in this movie is likeable other than Natalie Portman's character, which is the only reason why I give this movie ANY extra stars. The only reason to watch this movie is to see how sexy Natatlie Portman is in this movie. The girl looks AMAZING all throughout this whole film. If you want to rent a movie that has a similar subject but actually gives you interesting and deep characters, check out "The Shape of Things". Really good film about love and heartbreak. DON'T GIVE INTO THE HYPE OF "CLOSER".
