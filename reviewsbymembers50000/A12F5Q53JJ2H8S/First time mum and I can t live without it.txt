 The Baby Bjorn is extremely well designed and it has been one of the most useful things we registered for. My daughter is cranky in her stroller and in the infant car seat but she loves being toted around in the Baby Bjorn. I take her for a walk every evening and she just loves looking around and the rocking motion. She even naps in it if I'm shopping and she's no longer interested in the sights! I am sooo glad we paid the $90 for it. It's been a life saver!  I can imagine that once the baby is over 15 lbs, he/she may have to graduate to a backpack or something else but till they are too heavy, this is THE way to carry a baby!
