 My daughter is almost six months old and still needs to be swaddled to sleep through the night. The only blanket that will do the trick is the AMB. It really is AMAZING! We thought the baby didn't like being swaddled when she was a few weeks old and stopped swaddling. Then I heard about the AMB and tried it - what a difference! She still occasionally resists until she's all wrapped up and then, she's asleep before I know it!   The fabric is stretchy and light so babies don't overheat. But be careful not to overdress baby when swaddling with the AMB. They can get quite hot and uncomfortable with all those layers.  The best part? It's idiot-proof! You don't have to know how to swaddle to use this. Just stick the baby's legs in the pouch, wrap the arm flaps around her arms and wrap the baby with the long end. It's so simple. And much harder to break free than the wraps that use velcro.  Definitely get more than one...they come is lots of great colors.
