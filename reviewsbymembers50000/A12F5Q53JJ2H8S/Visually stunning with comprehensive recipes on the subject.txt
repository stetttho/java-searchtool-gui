 I actually bought this book at Williams-Sonoma and overpaid because I could not wait to order it online! The recipes are simple and written with the care and attention to detail of a professional chef who understands the home cook. The chapters are divided by method of cooking eggs: boiled, poached, fried, etc. Each delves into the specific techniques and then provides wonderful recipes that elaborate on the technique and help you improvise on the delectable simplicity of the eggs.   Michel Roux is a legend in the food world in Europe and has written some wonderful books.   And last but not least, the book is beautiful - the layout is stunning with gorgeous photography! This is a must have for any cookbook lover's library.  One of the best "single-subject" cookbooks I have seen.
