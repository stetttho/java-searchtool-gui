 I am hooked on audio books. I have a long commute to and from work everyday and I can't wait to get in the car so I can get back to my audio book of the week. I was so excited at the prospect of listening to Tim Robbins narrating The Great Gatsby, a book I have wanted to read for a long time. I am a third of the way through and am terribly disappointed. This is the first audio book that I am struggling with. I am a huge fan of Tim's on-screen work but he is "performing" here and it's distracting. The variations in his voice are irritating as well...I am constantly adjusting the volume. There are other narrations of this classic out there - buy one of those.
