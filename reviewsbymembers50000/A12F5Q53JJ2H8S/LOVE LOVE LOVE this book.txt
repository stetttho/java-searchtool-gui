 My 14 month old daughter just couldn't get past chewing books and tossing them around the room. This is the first book that has really caught her attention. She absolutely LOVES it. We read it again and again and she loves the different textures on each page. We have now bought almost all of Sandra Boynton's books but this one remains a favorite.
