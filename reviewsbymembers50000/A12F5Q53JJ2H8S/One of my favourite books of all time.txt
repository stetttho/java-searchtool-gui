 I had to read this for a world literature class in college and loved it so much, I bought ALL of Mahfouz's books! He is amazing and this book is a great story. I grew up in the Middle East and this book read like some of the Arabic soap operas on TV! Mahfouz is a wonderful story teller and his books provide rich cultural insight into the lives of men and women in Egypt.
