 This book is amazing. Tharoor narrates the story through journal entries and interviews with various people. We come to understand the circumstances of a riot through the eyes of extremely different people - each with their own perspectives. Each giving a version of the "truth" and each with a valid argument. Very meaningful after Sept. 11 - helps to understand the position of Muslims in India. Tharoor is brilliant!
