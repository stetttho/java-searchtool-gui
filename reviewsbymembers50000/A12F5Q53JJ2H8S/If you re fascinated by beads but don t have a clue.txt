 I am fascinated by the art of beading and jewellery design. Everytime I walk into a bead store I just want to go nuts - but I didn't really have all the tools and jargon necessary to really make a good start. This book is just what you need to take to the store to guide you through the shopping experience and the creation process once you get home. As the previous reviewer said, it's Beading 101.  I know I will continue to refer to this book for years to come. The photographs are great and the layout and organization of the book are excellent. Highly recommended!
