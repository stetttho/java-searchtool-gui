 Jeffrey Alford and Naomi Duguid live lives most of us only dream about. They travel the world, experience cultures deeply and eat some amazing food. And they are incredibly talented writers, photographers and amateur cultural anthropologists. So, this book is not just an amazing collection of delectable recipes from the Indian Subcontinent but is a rare and beautiful collection of their essays and observations during their travels.  The recipes in this book are perfectly doable - the lists of ingredients can be daunting if you've never cooked food from this region of the world. But a quick trip to an Asian grocery or any large grocery chain like Trader Joe's, Whole Foods or HEB's Central Markets (in Texas) will garner almost all of the ingredients you will need. And even if you will never actually try any of the recipes - the photographs are stunning and make your mouth water!  Another gem from these two amazing people. Bottom line: gorgeous coffee table book if you aren't an adventurous cook; a wonderful treasure trove of recipes from the Subcontinent that will love making your way through if you do love to cook.
