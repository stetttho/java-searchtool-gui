 I was born in India and have a plethora of cookbooks dedicated to Indian cookery - my favourites are ones by Madhur Jaffrey. But this book by Raghavan Iyer is really very good. The photos are beautiful and make everything look just like it did on the table when I was growing up. Iyer's comments are interesting and helpful and the recipes are written with ingredients readily available in the U.S. I highly recommend this book to both people that are fmailiar with Indian cooking and to those that are experimenting.
