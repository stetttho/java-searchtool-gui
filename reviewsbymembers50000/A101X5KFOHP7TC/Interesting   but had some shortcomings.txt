 The book, Dark Matter: The Privet Life of Sir. Isaac Newton was a very interesting book.  I read through the first 250 odd pages with excitement and enjoyment. However, once the book reached page 300, it felt like the author realized he had to finish it and then quickly tied up all the lose ends almost to neatly.  My other main problem with the book is something, which I encounter with the vast majority of modern fiction, and that is sex.  There seems to be this idea that a book must have at least one scene during which people must engage in the act, now I understand that on occasion this is important to the plot or the character development, however, must we actually be subjected to a detailed analysis of the actions preformed? This book would have been better, and the characters as well developed had we not been 'privileged' to their sexual activities.  Still on the whole, it was an enjoyable book, with strong characters, and an interesting plot.
