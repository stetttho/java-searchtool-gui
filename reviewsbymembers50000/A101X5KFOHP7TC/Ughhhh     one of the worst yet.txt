 When we were assigned this book for my English class, my first thought was one of interested.  I, like many, have always heard of the "Great Canadian Author Margaret Atwood", and I eagerly began to read the book.  As I waded my way through awkward prose, and over symbolic plot devises, I came to realize that if this was a `great Canadian author' I shudder to think what the not so great are like.  I found it rather odd that the only form of rebellion the `enslaved' women took was swearing, thinking and committing sexual activities, and dreaming about beauty products.  To think that in a book with such strong feministic undertones that these would be the only dreams, thoughts, and activities of women who are denied such things as reading, and the pursuit of knowledge, seems almost as flawed as the prose she uses to declare them. I was greatly disappointed at Margaret Atwood's writing, and wonder why the truly great Canadian authors, such as say Robertson Davies, are not made a larger part of the education system.  In short this was one of the largest disappointments I have come across in my lifetime, and look with fear towards the next of her books I will be forced to read.
