 This was a book with a lot going for it. Good characters, strong plot, interesting situations, easy to read, fast paced, and entertaining.  Why then only 4 stars? Well, Neville seemed to be slightly too entertained with putting historical personages into her books.  By the time Napoleon made his appearance I simply rolled my eyes and breathed a slight sigh.  Apart from the over use of historical people, the book had other faults, at times it dragged a bit and sometimes it was a bit obvious, but these can easily be ignored because the books positives far outweigh its negatives. Neville has the promise to become a great writer of the 'thriller' genre, however, she still has a ways to go, the Magic Circle is not to be recommended and I have yet to get my hands on A Calculated Risk, but this one, The Eight, was an excellent read.  It makes one think, and get interested in Mathematics, which, coming from me is say a great deal indeed.  I did take some humor in the fact that most of the main character's history comes from the Neville's on life (including her name Catherine verses the author's Katherine, I prefer it with a 'C' personally).  Please don't mistake my tone for one of simple satisfaction, I strongly recommend this book, and I thoroughly enjoyed (almost) every moment in it.
