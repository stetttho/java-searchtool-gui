 I had given up fantasy novels a long time ago, after reading The Lord of the Rings I found most other fantasy novels cheap, cheesy, and clichd. Not a good combination. This book selected at random from a store in Cambridge, Mass.  Where I was visiting family.  It was to be my escape for the noise and hubbub. And it was, for the three hours it took me to devour this delightful novel.  Think The Never Ending Story meets The Third Man meets Tarantino and all this in one book about books!  For, almost, once I have no complaints about characters, plot devises, or writing, save perhaps that the book was a tad to short and the fourth is taking a tad to long before publication.  I would recommend these books to practically anyone.  It helps to have read certain book prior to reading this one or any of the next, for instance Jane Eyre, Great Expectations, and as many others as you can think of, since these books are packed with literary references, but do not get discouraged if you do not get them, lord knows I do not get them all.  Even with out getting the lit. references one may still thoroughly enjoy them for what they are, great works of modern fiction.
