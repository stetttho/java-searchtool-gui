 What more can one possibly ask for? Two separate haunted areas, forbidden love, murder, torture, a picture worthy of Dorian Grey, a wing of the house worthy of Rebecca, and a mystery upon mystery.  The best way to describe this book is to have you think of every gothic novel's plot you have ever read, heard of, or imagined, and then remember this, it is all in there.  Every single gothic plot or image is in this novel.  The main character is an interesting and enjoyable character, though she and her lover do spend far too much time weeping, and one really does mean to say FAR too much.  She is the exact opposite from Catherine in Nothanger Abby, except in the idea of letting their imaginations get the better of them. Still this book is the epiphany of gothic literature, and any true Jane Austen fan must read it if they truly want to enjoy Northanger Abby
