 This is a one-of-a-kind book I first read it in grand 6.  i was in a book store and i read the first page and thought it was dull, but as I was walking around my mind was constently returning to the book, so I read the first chapter, and the second, and the theird,forth and haft of the 5th and after that I was so hooked i had to get it.  since then I have read it 10 more times!! Every time when I finish it I burst into tears.  I LOVE this book and so will you
