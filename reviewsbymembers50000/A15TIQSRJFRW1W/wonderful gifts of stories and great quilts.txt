 First, I am a major fan of Earlene's books and a quilter and this book is the perfect marriage of the two.  I loved the quilt patterns but really loved the stories that added insight into stories we've already read.  I cannot for the life of me figure out what books Liz was reading to find such off the wall connections to Earlene's characters, especially the Scott Peterson to Gabe reference but these people are very realistic and like real people have flaws.  I personally don't want to read about perfect people, I want to read about people who learn and grow.  I loved the story of the blue turtle especially because it shows you a little bit of Gabe's soul.  I've had a crush on Gabe since the first book and he just isn't anything like Scott Peterson.  If you love the Benni Harper books or quilts, this is just a great addition.  I gave several out as gifts.  You can't go wrong with anything written by Earlene Fowler.
