 Mary Stewart's Ivy Tree got me hooked on reading and I've read every book she's written.  The villain in this book is so memorable I have always remembered his name.  This book like all of her books marries romance and mystery but in a way no modern books do, it is romance, not sex.  All of her books give you information on either classic works or other historic backgrounds, like the Spanish Riding School, that I got big points from my Humanities teachers from things I learned from Mary Stewart, I never told them how I knew the information.  This is one of her best, the people are memorable and the horse is miraculous.  Just a treat all round.  Read all her mysteries you can't go wrong
