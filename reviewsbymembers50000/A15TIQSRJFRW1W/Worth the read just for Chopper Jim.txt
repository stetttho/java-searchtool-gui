 I was devasated when Jack died but the interplay between Kate and Chopper Jim has been something to watch and this book is all about what is or is not budding between them.  Kate has recovered enough to actively play Jim and she does so throughout the novel.  The mystery is good, there are several trails that could lead to the answer but you've got a pretty good idea where it might eventually lead.  The new character of the old cop is really terrific and lots of fun to watch, he's sort of Jim many years hence.  I miss the park people in this book but again, this book is Jim and Kate and a side of Kate we haven't seen that much of.  Can't wait for the next step to see where it does lead.
