 You can always count on these books being a good story with great recipes to boot.  I've been reading her series since the beginning and had the pleasure of meeting her at a signing.  She is as nice as you would hope and her books never let you down.  I  particularly enjoy series that have evolving characters and this one always has.  There are more intertwined threads in this tale that in most and it keeps you wondering exactly what is happening throughout but the resolution is good and there is enough peril to keep you on the edge throughout.  Another winner in a great series.
