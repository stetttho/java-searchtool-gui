 Earlene Fowler's Books stand out because of the relationships of her characters.  This book gives you so many insights into her regular cast of characters that this alone is worth the read, but this book really surprised me.  I had several things figured out pretty closely and then she threw me completely.  By the end I found myself tearing up on the plane as I read the end of the book.    Hud, Gabe, everyone else show us new facets of their characters and the new characters are the keys to a lot of this.  One character I really hope to see more of in up coming books.  The mystery is a good one, it held a surprise I didn't see coming but as always, the real gift of these books is the time spent with characters who have become like friends over the years.  This was a great addition to a wonderful series.  I won't go over the plot here because other reviews will and I don't want to know that much before I read it, just if it was a good read, this is a very good read.
