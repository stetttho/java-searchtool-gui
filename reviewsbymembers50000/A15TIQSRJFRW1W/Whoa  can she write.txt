 I love the Benni mysteries but this was a really terrific book.  For some reason as I read this one I was really taken by her ability to write.  There were just a lot of passages that I'd read and think how terrific they were.  The story is compelling, the characters, as always so very human.  I never thought I'd want to encourage anything that would take away from my getting a Benni book but I really want to know what happens next to these people.  Again, I don't understand telling the story in a review because that's why we buy books, but it is a story of self discovery as well as of unpacking a husband's past that the wife was unaware of.  That past includes a family  she thought was dead.  As you can imagine things don't run smoothly with the family.  I will be glad to recommend this book to any of my friends who love a good book.  The editorial review said this might be her breakout book and I hope that is true.  She deserves a lot more attention than she gets.  If you love Earlene Fowler's Benni books you'll love this.  They are in no way the same but the quality is just as high.  In the end I was surprised by some of the revelations and pleased by others.  There's sadness and love and struggles, all the things life is all about.  Just a great read.
