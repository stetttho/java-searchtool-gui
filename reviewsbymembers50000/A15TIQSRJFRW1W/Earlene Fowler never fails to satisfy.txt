 I have followed this series from the very beginning and the characters just get deeper and more like real friends.  I look forward to each book for a new visit with old friends.  This book throws Benni together with several old acquaintances and a group of new people who are great fun.  But the real fun is the continuing back and forth with Hud.  The setting is a Dude ranch that is an attempt to save a family cattle ranch by the younger generation.  Old bones are found by the ranch dog and an investigation into who they are and why they are there and if there was a crime insues.  In with that is the tensions among the ranch folks, the guests, Benni's family who are helping and of course, Hud.  The addition of Hud's grandfather is a wonderful one and getting to know the new characters and catching up with the old ones is what her readers look for.  Add possible arson, a crazy goose and lots of color and you've got a great, fun book.
