 I bought this with low expectations but thought a mystery and Vampires, could be fun.  I couldn't put this book down.  You have to suspend disbelief a whole lot but once you do and buy into the  set up, you are hooked.  I read this during a convention and got to the point where I resented having to attend functions and stop  reading.  I am looking forward to the next one and really can't wait. In a very strange set up you have believable characters that you come to care about and a good mystery.  It may sound silly but it's a lot of fun and well written.  If you like Vampires, or mysteries or both, give it a try.
