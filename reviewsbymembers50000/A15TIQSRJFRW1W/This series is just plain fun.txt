 I read the first book on a lark, then read all her Shakespeare books and waited breathlessly for each new Dead book.  I know I'll enjoy every page.  In this book fans of her Shakespeare series get a nice gift, especially since I've heard she isn't going to write any more in this series.  The story is good, although you begin to suspect who the trouble makers are early, you still enjoy finding out if you were right and why.  Each character grows in each book and you find yourself liking them more and more.  I won't go into the plot here as everyone else has and I really don't like that as I want to find that out myself.  I just want to know if it's worth the bother.  In this case if you've read the others, you'll love this one too.  If you haven't do yourself a favor and start at the beginning.  Just learning more about "Bubba" is worth the time.  A real joy to read.
