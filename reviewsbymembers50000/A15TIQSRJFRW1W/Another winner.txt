 Before I got this book, which by the way was difficult to find at first, I read the editorial review and was surprised that it wasn't altogether favorable.  The reader's review was much better although I don't know how they got the book prior to publication.  I now agree with the reader.  This deals with racial issues in a  Southern state and handles it very well showing the difficulties on both sides of the issue and that good people can take different sides and still be basically good people.  There are a lot of emotions ruling everyone in this book and they are handled well.  Her normal cast are there and their trials and tribulations add to the books appeal.  The mystery is a good one and I didn't know who done it until pretty much the end because it could have been too many people and most I didn't want to have done it.  The people and their reactions were believable and ones you could empathize with.  I've eaten in the Waffle House she mentioned at the very beginning and she had it nailed.  I love this series and the author is terrific.  I just wish for more.  I good book, a good mystery, good characters that you care about; what more could you want, well...more.
