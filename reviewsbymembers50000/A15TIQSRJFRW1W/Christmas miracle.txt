 Okay, each Christmas you try to think of what to buy people who don't need more stuff.  But what can everyone always use?  Food!  I first bought this book for this reason and am buying the update again to find food finds for gifts.  I have looked for lost childhood foods often as Christmas gifts from the perfect popcorn ball that is most like my great aunt LeGreta's to Lefse.  In this book you can find old favorites and new taste tempters.  I know I'm getting real old fashioned ribbon candy as one gift but what else is out there to try?  I always end up getting food for myself too, after all, it's my childhood too.  This is a great resource for the hard to buy for.
