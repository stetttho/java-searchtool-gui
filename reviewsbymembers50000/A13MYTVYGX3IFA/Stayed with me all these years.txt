 I'm not sure how to rate this movie.  My school asked us all to watch it and only if our parents objected were we not compelled.  I watched it and it was months before I had another good night's sleep.  At the time, and perhaps today, this was the scariest movie I had ever seen.  More than the normal gorefest, this seemed like something that could happen at any minute. I have not seen the movie since 1983 but it has stayed with me.  The memory of what happened to all of these people.  Jason Robards in particular.  It's important to see.  To see the fragility of man and to strengthen ones resolve that this never happen.  No one is a winner in this kind of situation. Not good for young children.
