 Kylie Minogue did an interesting thing in putting together this book.  She allowed fans to see the good, the bad and the ugly. This was a very brave move on her part.  Many artists wouldn't have let you see EVERYTHING and I  am not talking about nudes here.  My only regret as an American fan is  knowing that there is SO much more out there and I want it, too! That  said, there are some beautiful pictures, tributes and commentaries. Well  worth it.
