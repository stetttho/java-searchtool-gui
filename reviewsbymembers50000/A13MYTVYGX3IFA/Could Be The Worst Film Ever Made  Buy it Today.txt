 Yes, Xanadu is a terrible film. However, it has one of the best soundtracks ever.  Olivia Newton-John, ELO, Gene Kelly and The Tubes, who would have that thought that this was the equation for a near perfect  lp. The best thing about the DVD is that you can skip through the story  and move right along to the musical numbers.  They are silly to be sure,  but what fun.  The best part of the whole thing is "Whenever Your Away  from Me" a musical throwback with Olivia and Gene Kelly that more than  makes up for the rest of the film.  Watching Gene Kelly dance at an age  when most don't even want to walk around is a testament to his talent.  Olivia has said that she still considers the making of the film, which even  she acknowledges is less than stellar, a career highlight.  How many people  get to sing and dance with Gene Kelly? Granted, I was 10 when this film  came out and would have gone to see Olivia stand in front of a wall at that  time, but I still enjoy the film. Film 2, Music 10. Enjoy!
