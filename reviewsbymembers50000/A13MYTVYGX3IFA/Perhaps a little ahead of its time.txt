 This is pure pop at its best. Cathy Dennis moves away from the dance beats of her previous efforts with this sublime fusion of 60's and 90's pop.  It's just that it may have been released too early, 1995.  It would have  been more perfectly timed with the Bacharach renaissance of the late 90's  and the Austin Powers era. Dennis' voice is perfectly suited here. While  it sounded rather thin against the over-the-top production of her dancier  days it melds perfectly with the production here.   There are a few  misses but the album is extremely catchy and is a perfect windows down/top  down driving album. Enjoy!
