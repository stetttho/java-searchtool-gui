 I bought this CD while on vacation in London - which is completely appropriate as the collection is a throwback to Carnaby Street London of the 1960's.  The arrangements are lush and swingy and by itself, In the Lounge with Andy Williams, could provide the soundtrack to either of the Austin Powers movies. Highlights include Music to Watch Girls By, Wives and Lovers, Can't Get Used to Leaving You.  Mind you, these are my favorites as I listen to the CD right now - every song is a gem...Yeah Baby!END
