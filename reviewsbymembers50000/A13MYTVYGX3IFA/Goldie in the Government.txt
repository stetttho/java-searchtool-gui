 Goldie Hawn is highly likeable as a dim DC waitress who comes to the aid of a visiting royal and get's caught up in gonvernment plans for a strategic military base. The first third whereby Sunny Davis becomes an American hero and media darling is fantastic.  One liners abound and a good time is had by all.  The parade in Sunny's hometown, brought to you by Schmitter's Hardware, is so dead on.  The film looses a bit of steam in it's mid-section (See the Safari Party) and get's a bit preachy and All-American in the end but the set-up and Hawn are terrific.  Buck Henry's script is funny. Certainly no masterpiece but sometimes cute is just enough.
