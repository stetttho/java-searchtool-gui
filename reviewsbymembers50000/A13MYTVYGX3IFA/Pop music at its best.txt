 Robbie Williams does it again with this perfect collection of pop songs.  Always a step ahead with his production, Robbie has crafted a fine album with not a dull moment to be found.  Working again with Guy Chambers, who even Robbie refers to as Robbie, Sing When Your Winning combines everything that was great about his two previous albums and ups everything a notch. Top melodies and production.  This may sound like they have put together a gloss filled album, but listen this music still rocks in all the right places. The opening, "Let Love Be Your Energy", is a real corker and its a beautiful ride from there on in.  Highlights include, "Supreme" with its strings lifted from "I Will Survive", "Singing For The Lonely" is amazingly catchy, and "Kids" is a terrific duet with Kylie Minogue (catch her Light Years album, too!). Robbie knows what he's doing and if the US could just figure that out, the world would be a much better place.  Move over Ricky Martin, a true popstar is waiting in the wings!
