 I am a HUGE Olivia fan but this album represents the one lull in my fandom. Just before, Olivia had recorded some amazing tracks with David Foster for the Two of A Kind Soundtrack and she should've hooked up with him for this.  She then followed this with her AMAZING album, The Rumour.  This was the wrong thing to stick in between. She sounds great, she looks even better, but the songs are overly sensational to the point of being forced.  If you buy, there are some fine songs (Emotional Tangle, Soul Kiss) but overall it's not a very "Olivia" album.  Buy it if your a fan to complete your collection. For a crtically acclaimed and absolutely amazing album, buy The Rumour from 1988.
