 First, the movie.  Not the best work from this group and Pretty Woman is fairly hard to top for sheer romanticism. However, Runaway Bride is watchable and it is fun to see Julia Roberts and Richard Gere together  again.  They do have chemistry and she lights the screen. The best part  of the DVD is the running commentary by director, Garry Marshall.  If you  match this up with his commentary of Pretty Woman, you have a perfect  double-feature.  He is funny, endearing and many of the stories he tells  are better than the film itself.  Enjoy.
