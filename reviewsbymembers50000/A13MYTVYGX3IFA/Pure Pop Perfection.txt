 This debut single from Ronan Keatings first American solo LP is just about as perfect a song as can be.  Great hook, great production, and Ronan's distinctive and, yes, great voice.  Unless they have dramitically changed the CD for the US release, this song is definitely the standout track on a rather sleepy album.  This is a must have.  Great B-side, When You Say Nothing At All, as featured in Notting Hill with Julia Roberts.
