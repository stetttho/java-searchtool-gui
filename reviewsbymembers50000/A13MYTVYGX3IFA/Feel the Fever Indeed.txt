 Kylie Minogue returns stateside and "Fever" features some of the best pop-dance tunes of her career. The global hit "Can't Get You Out of My Head" is only the beginning with fun being the order of the day and it never stops. Taking its lead from the single the rest of the album is full of topline production and a host of single-ready tunes. Standout tracks include "In Your Eyes," already a number one single in Kylie's native Australia, "Come Into My World" and "Love At First Sight". Also noteworthy is the very interesting "Burning Up" which fluctuates between near-ballad moments and "burning" dancefloor highs.  In recent years, Kylie has rediscovered her fun side and has found her point of differentiation from the other pop diva's.  The most fun you'll have in 2002...Go KYLIE!
