 When Kylie Minogue found her way back to pop after a small turn into something slightly harder it was Light Years beyond anything she had ever done.  She did it again! Fever is a more modern and more cohesive collection than last years Light Years and it is fantastic throughout.  Influences range from 80s electro-pop and dance through the 90s scene to develop something entirely now.  The first single, "Can't Get You Out of My Head" is proof of that.  The song spent 4 weeks atop the British chart and kept Michael Jackson's abysmal come-back single from the top.  This is no fluke - the song is great and as catchy as hell. Standouts include "Love At First Sight" with it's Modjo like guitars (I love this one), "Fragile" a striking mid-tempo track with a beautiful vocal, "In Your Eyes" pure bliss with a reference to last years chart topping, "Spinning Around" and "Burning Up", which is like nothing else with it's quiet verses and "burning" chorus. The one miss is that there is no ballad and, while it's not necessary, if you've heard "Put Yourself in My Place" or "Dangerous Game" from her 94 album, you'd want one, too! BUT, it's Fun and Fantastic...Feel the Fever!
