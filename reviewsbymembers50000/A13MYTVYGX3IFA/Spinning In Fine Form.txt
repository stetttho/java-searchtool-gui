 Kylie Minogue finds a new direction in returning to her pop-dance roots.  Absolutely stunning and self assured, this is the kind of song that fans have grown to love.  A great preview of her next album due in September  that based on internet leaks promises to be even more infectious and  amazing! The remixes on CD1 are only OK - therefore the 4 stars. Beware:  The video on this CD is SEXY!
