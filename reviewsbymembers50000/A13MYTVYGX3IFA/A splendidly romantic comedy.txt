 Notting Hill is a splendidly romantic comedy that fails in neither its romanticism nor its comedy.   While it may appear that we have seen the lead actors tread these same waters, their performances are brilliant.   There is a scene near the end (in the bookshop owned by Hugh Grant's  character)where Julia displays amazing emotional depth. I felt what she  felt, you could see it on her face. I saw this film in the theatres, twice  on an airplane flight and twice on pay-per-view. I am buying the DVD as I  must have this modern day classic in my collection. Absolutley lovely.
