 Seems Like Old Time is still one of my all time favorite films.  This film is almost too funny for its own good.  A terrific throwback to the sophisticated comedies of the 30's and 40's updated for the 80's.  It's too  bad that they just don't make these kinds of comedies anymore.  Goldie is  in top form, Charles Grodin is so dry and wonderful and Chevy Chase  should've never moved beyond this type of film.  He and Hawn made magic  before in Foul Play and it was great to see them together again. Buy it! Oh  and keep any eye out for Aurora, the Parks' housekeeper and her infamous  Chicken Pepperoni, no one can get enough of it.
