 In the late eighties and earlie nineties, Stock Aitken Waterman were hugely successful producers of the most perfect pop-music gems.  Their roster of artists included Bananarama, Rick Astley, Dead or Alive, Kylie  Minogue and Jason Donovan.  This was a major phenomenon that was greatly  overlooked in the United States. This collection is the most  comprehensive collection of Jason's work with SAW.  It's better than the  greatest hits, too, as it includes all but one of his b-sides, which, up  until now, were only available on out-of-print singles. After leaving the  stable of artists at SAW, Jason's pop music career took a major nosedive  and he has not released anything new since 1993 (although he has appeared  on a couple of UK cast recordings). But it doesn't matter as this is the  only album of his that you will ever need.   His post SAW work is bland  and tepid without the fun and freedom of the music represented  here. Years from now Stock Aitken Waterman will be heralded for their  fun-filled perfect pop music and people will remember Jason Donovan. He and  Kylie ruled the British charts from '89 - '91. Highlights include  "Too Many Broken Hearts", "Wrap My Arms Around You",  "Especially For You", and "I'm Doing Fine."
