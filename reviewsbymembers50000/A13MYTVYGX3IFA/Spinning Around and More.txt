 In addition to Kylie's return to pop with Spinning Around, there are two bonus tracks that are equally exciting.  Sounding nothing at all like Spinning Around or even indications of the new album, Cover Me With Kisses  and Paper Dolls are great songs in their own right. Cover Me With Kisses  is a catchy sixties pastiche with very irreverent lyrics spoofing a  Hollywood movie. FUN! Paper Dolls is lovely, breezy acoustic number and  quite different from anything she's done before. Look for the stunning  new album due in September.
