 The most overlooked album during its release and the most overlooked of Olivia Newton-John's career.  Critics praised The Rumour, but listeners stayed away.  Why?  This is a near perfect album and is my favorite  Olivia release.  It still holds up today.  Olivia's voice has never sounded  better and the song selection is mature and appropriate.  I say this  because her previous album tried desperately to be sexy and too MTV.  Highlights include the title tune, Let's Talk About Tomorrow and Walk  Through Fire.  Get it.
