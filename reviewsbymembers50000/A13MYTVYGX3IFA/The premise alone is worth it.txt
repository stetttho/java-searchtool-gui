 A vertically challenged German spy is sent to California to meet up with a Japanese spy at the onset of WWII and that's just the set up... A Japanese tour bus breaks down in front of the very hotel where the Munchkin cast for the Wizard of Oz is staying.  Aboslutely brilliant.  There's a subplot involving the assasination of a European king who's is protected by a US G-Man, Chevy Chase, who is flirting with the still cute and sexy Carrie Fisher.  Plenty to enjoy in this absolutely awful but hysterical film..."The Pearl in is in the River"!
