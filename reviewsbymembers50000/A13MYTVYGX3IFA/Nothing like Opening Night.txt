 The Producers opens with "Opening Night" a rehash of Max Bialystock's latest Broadway disaster.  Mel Brooks musical re-working of his own film, The Producers, is the furthest thing from that - it's a TRIUMPH! I grew up watching the films of Mel Brooks.  In my family, they are classics.  I have been foaming at the mouth waiting for this production and have my tickets for the show. The whole thing feels like the Broadway of old but also totally fresh and new.  It is probably the most "Broadway" production to hit Broadway in years.  The new music is top notch and "Springtime for Hitler" has always been the most politically incorrect, most brilliant  and most hysterical song EVER!  Nathan Lane and Matthew Broderick are perfection.  GET IT!!
