 This was to be the start of something big. It was Kylie's first album after leaving the Stock Aitken Waterman hit factory and it is almost the album that it should have been. It definitely displays a new side to  Kylie and perfectly showcases her voice, which over the years has grown  stronger and more confident. The production is top notch, but some of the  tunes are rather lackluster like Surrender and If I Was Your Lover.  The  songs are fine but it would have been nice to have a couple of dancier  numbers in keeping with the Kylie that we fans have grown to  love. Highlights, that more than make up for the duds, are Confide In Me,  Put Yourself in My Place and Dangerous Game.  Of the dancier tunes, Where  Has the Love Gone goes on for about 1 minute too long but has a great piano  and Time Will Pass You By is a good one for lifting the spirits.
