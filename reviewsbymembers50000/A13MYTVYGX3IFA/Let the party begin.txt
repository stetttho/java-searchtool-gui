 Critics have been rather harsh on this rather terrific album.  They have said, "more of the same," "La vida retread."  Thank GOD! Ricky Martin's self-titled English debut was a lackluster pop album weighed down in syrupy ballads and mid-tempo muck.  The standout track being, "La Vida Loca."  Had "Sound Loaded" been released at that time, critics would be singing its praises. It is much more the album that "Ricky Martin" should have been. Highlights include, "She Bangs" and "Loaded", which is a real corker.  There are ballads here, too, and they fit perfectly into this tune-filled romp!
