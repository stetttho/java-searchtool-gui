 Gary Barlow has had a hard time of it.  His American record company ruined his previous release by not allowing him do his thing and paired him with  some of the most talented musicians in the US.  The resulting album was a  tepid  mix of ballads and mid-tempo songs. Thank you to the people who  produce Celine Dion. (The title track 'Open Road' was a masterpiece)    Also, he has had to fight comparison with former bandmate Robbie  Williams.  I enjoy Robbie, too, but he has nothing on Gary in the singing  department. This album is 100% Barlow. His voice and musicianship are in  fine form, but the album is weighed down in love ballads, beautiful though  they are.  It would have been nice to have a couple of good dance-pop tunes  a la his remake of "Relight My Fire" from his Take That days.  Although, "Stronger" comes very close. That said, it is a  lovely breezy album and perfectly showcases his voice and songwriting  ability.  Standout tracks include "Arms Around Me," "All  That I've Given Away," "Before You Turn Away" and  "Wondering."
