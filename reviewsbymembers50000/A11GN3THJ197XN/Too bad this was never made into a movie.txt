 A screenplay of Proust's In Search of Lost Time sounds like a hopeless project.  In the most recent translation, Proust's novel ran to over 4,000 pages.  Reducing this to a screenplay would seem to require cuts of such magnitude that nothing of the novel would be left.  Indeed, those movies that have been made of the novel usually are of a small part, like the Swann in Love section of Swann's Way.  Pinter, however, managed to pull off the impossible.  He concentrated on key events in the novel, and even more on key images.  It is hard to say whether this would have worked with someone totally unfamilar with the material.  However, presenting Proust's novel in any literal fashion would be impossible, and probably contrary to what he attempted to accomplish in his novel.  Pinter's screenplay, for anyone who has read the novel, is a tremendous success.  Unfortunately, it was never made into a movie.
