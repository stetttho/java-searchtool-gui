 The Who are somewhat notorious for repackaging their prior albums.  At one point, they had released almost as many "Best Of" packages as they had original albums.  Moreover, Tommy has been released in two different studio versions (not counting the Broadway production) and is included in the Isle of Wight concert.  Finally, Live at Leeds has been released twice before, the original in 1970 or 71 and the expanded in 1995.  The cynical could see this as another attempt to make money out of past exploits.   They would be wrong. Live at Leeds is one of the best concerts by one of the best live rock bands of all time.  It is understandable that the Who in 1970 did not want to follow Tommy up with a live album that included most of Tommy, but it's too bad that they didn't at least originally release a double album with the 1995 configuration.  I find myself wishing I could have gotten my hands on this 30 years ago. Even if you have the 1995 version of Live at Leeds, you have to get this one; the performance of Tommy is superior in sound to the Isle of Wight concert and far superior to the big band version that the Who did in the late 80's.  Although Townsend has always been modest about his guitar playing, he is brillant throughout the concert.  Daltrey's singing is amazing, as is the strength of his voice -- he does 90% of the singing of a two-hour plus concert with no weakness at the end.  It's hard to talk about this CD without falling into a stream of superlatives.  The bottom line is that if you like rock, you have to buy this.
