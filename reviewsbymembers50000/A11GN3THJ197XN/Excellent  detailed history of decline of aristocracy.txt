 David Cannadine is probably the leading historian of the British aristocracy and landed gentry.  The readers of this book will fall into two classes (1) serious historians of the period, and (2) readers of English fiction from Trollope to Waugh who would like to know more about the aristocracy. The latter may find parts of this book heavy going.  Cannadine is concerned with the history of a class, and individuals are discussed to illustrate his points.  Additionally, a working knowledge of British political history of the period covered (1870-post WWII) is presumed. Having said that, I found the book well written and thoroughly researched.  Cannadine's work is too complex to be reduced to a short summary, but basically the aristocracy found itself beset on all side from around 1880 onward.  A prolonged agricultural depression lowered their incomes, and created political pressure to break up the big estates.  The increase in the franchise and the end of pocket boroughs undercut their power in the House of Commons. This in turn led to the aristocracy being abandoned even by the Tory party, which realized where the votes were.  Ever increasing estate taxes (especially during and after World War II) approached confiscatory levels, requiring families to sell off their land.  And many aristocrats found themselves completely unable to cope with those changes.  Those who could cope did so largely by breaking the mold of the landed aristocracy of tradition. Anyone looking for a "Brideshead Revisted" view of the aristocracy will be disappointed.  But anyone who wants to know the pressures on the real-life equivalents of the characters of Waugh or Trollope will be greatly informed by this book.
