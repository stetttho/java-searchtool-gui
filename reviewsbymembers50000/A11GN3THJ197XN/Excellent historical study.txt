 "How War Came" covers the period roughly from Europe to the beginning of World War II.  Of course, the key actor in this period was Hitler; it was his will, more than any other factor, that caused the war to start. Of course, no one at the time knew that at the time, and this book accounts the diplomatic efforts made by the Britain, France and others to avoid the War.  This provides a useful perspective on the history of the time, which tends to focus exclusively on Hitler.  Watt has thoroughly researched this period, and provides information that even those who are well-read in the events leading up to the war will learn much from this book.
