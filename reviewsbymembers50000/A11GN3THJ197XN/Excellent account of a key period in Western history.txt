 Had the Greeks failed to defeat the Persians in in their invasion of Greece, western history would have been very different.  The great flowering of Greek civilization would not have taken place, and without it, it is hard to conceive how our world would look now.  Green, one of the best classcial scholars, has done a superb job of covering a war that has been covered in myths. At times, he must engage in speculation to cover gaps or improbabilities in the historical record, but he always does so judiciously, and with regard for other points of view.  This book is interesting not just as military history, bur for an account of how western civilization developed.
