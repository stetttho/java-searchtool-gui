 David Chandler provides a thorough review of Napoleon's 60 battles.  He demonstrates that Napoleon, while not an innovator in tactics, was nonetheless a master of innovations developed by others and was capable of great innovation.  The subject, of course, is extremely broad, and as long as this book is, it could have been much longer.  Chandler omits a great deal of biographical detail about Napoleon to concentrate on his development as a military leader.  Indeed, if you find this book too long to read or expensive to buy, I suggest getting a copy from the library and just reading the chapter that gives an overview for how Napoleon went about conducting his campaigns. I do not agree with those who say that Chandler exhibits a British bias.  He clearly sees Napoleon as the greatest military leader of his time, and perhaps of all time.  In other writings, he has soundly rejected comparisons made by other historians between Hitler and Napoleon.  Moreover, he makes clear that, at least in the early years of his leadership, Napoleon was not to blame for the wars that engulfed Europe. Finally, despite the length of the book, I found it to be extremely readable, and not hard to finish at all.
