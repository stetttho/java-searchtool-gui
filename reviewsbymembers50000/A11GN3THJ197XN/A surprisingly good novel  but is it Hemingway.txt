 Garden of Eden was published approximately 20 years after Hemingway's death.  Carlos Baker, author of one of the most thorough Hemingway biography, described the manuscript as being lengthy and not very good.  Thus, many were surprised when Garden of Eden was published in a shortened version, and was quite good. The novel explores themes of sexuality not touched on in Hemingway's other works, but present in his life.  The writing, while not his absolute best, compares quite favorably to Old Man and the Sea, and Across the River and Into the Trees.  It is far superior to Islands in the Stream, Hemingway's other major posthumous work.  It is impossible to know how much of the strength of this book is due to the editing or comes from the original manuscript.  Nevertheless, it deserved to be published and should be read by anyone who admires Hemingway's work.
