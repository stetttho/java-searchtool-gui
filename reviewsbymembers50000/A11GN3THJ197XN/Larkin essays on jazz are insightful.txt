 For many years, Philip Larkin wrote reviews and essays on Jazz.  He fell in love with the music as a young man.  This love might seem odd, because Jazz is a distinctly American form of music (and Larkin almost never travelled abroad and never to America) and it is also dominated by African-Americans (Larkin has unkind things to say about minorities in his Collected Letters).  Nevertheless, Larkin found in the music of Armstrong, Ellington, Basie, and others a joy that was missing from much of the rest of his life.  One warning for serious Jazz fans -- for Larkin, the downfall of Jazz began with Charlie Parker.  He had no interest in Parker, Mingus, Miles Davis, or almost anyone who recorded after the later 40's.  In fact, he lumped Charlie Parker with Ezra Pound and Pablo Picasso as person with reputations as great artists, but whom he felt had a terrible effect on their art.  In some ways, this book tells you as much about Larkin as Jazz.  Nevertheless, the enthusiasm he had for Jazz, and his skill as an essayist make this an enjoyable book.
