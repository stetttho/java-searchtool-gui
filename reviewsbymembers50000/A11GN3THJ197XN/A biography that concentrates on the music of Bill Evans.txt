 This biography, by a writer who is himself a professional pianist, concentrates on Bill Evans' music.  He discusses each of Evans' many recordings, and goes into some detail about the technical aspects of how he improvised so brillantly.  Evans's life, however, is covered with pretty much the bare minimum of details.  Thus, his drug addiction is discussed only when absolutely necessary, as is the suicide of a long-time lover.  Having read many other biographies that wallow in such details, I don't believe the reader misses very much.  Anyone interested in Bill Evans is interested in him because of his music, not his problems.  This book is an invaluable guide to that music.
