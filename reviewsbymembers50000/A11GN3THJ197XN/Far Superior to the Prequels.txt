 The authors of the three Dune prequels (House Atreides, House Harkonnen, and House Corrino) have repudiated The Dune Encyclopedia and it is very unlikely to be reprinted because parts are inconsistent with the prequels.  Having read both, I believe that The Dune Encyclopedia is closer to Frank Herbert's vision than the prequels.  For example, in the prequels the planet Ix, source of technology for the Empire, is ruled by one of the Great Houses.  In Frank Herbert's books no mention is made of Ix being affiliated with the nobility, and The Dune Encyclopedia follows Frank Herbert in making it an exception to the general system.  This book also fills an important place because Frank Herbert enjoyed introducing concepts such as the Orange Bible or the Bulterian Jihad without much explanation.  The conclusions reached here seem plausible given the structure of the Dune books written by Frank Herbert.  If you can find this book at a used book sale, buy it.
