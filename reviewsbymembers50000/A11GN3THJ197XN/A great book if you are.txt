 There should be an age warning on this book:  "Not for mature audiences."  It is part of the Lensman series, probably the first extended space operas.  I thought it was wonderful when I first read it, and would have given it five stars.  However, I was about 13 at the time, Amazon didn't exist, and people were saying that there would never be a need for computers in the home.  Most adult readers will find the prose, and particularly the dialogue, painful to read. The characters are less developed than in contemporary comic books.  Still, if you know a young teenager who likes science fiction, you could make him happy by giving him this book.  I'm not so sure that would work if the teenager is a girl; this series..., very much relects the prejudices and stereotypes of the times in which they were written.
