 The Look of Love differs from Krall's prior recording in that every song is backed by large string arrangements.  Like many of the other reviewers, I miss the more intimate and concentrated impact of her trio.  Still, she has one of the finest voices today, and her phrasing only gets better.  I would probably buy a CD of her singing the phone book.  However, she is an excellent jazz pianist as well as a singer, and the latter is lost in the string arrangements.  Of course, many jazz musicians have recorded with strings, including Charlier Parker.  My hope is that this is only a temporary diversion. As for the merits of the album, the string arrangements are quite well done and the songs well selected.  Particular highlights are the title track, and Cry Me A River.  I would certainly recommend purchase of this CD; if you want a jazzier recording, you should get her tribute album to Nat King Cole.
