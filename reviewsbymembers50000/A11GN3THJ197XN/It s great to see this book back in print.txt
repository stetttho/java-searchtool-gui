 The Horse's Mouth is the concluding volume in Joyce Cary's first trilogy.  It is the story of Gully Jimson, a gifted artist but a selfish and erratic man.  However, his sense of humor, even at his own misfortunes, make him an interesting character.  Although this is the third volume in a trilogy, you need not have read the first two to enjoy this one.  When you have read the trilogy, however, you will appreciate Cary's ability to create characters who view the world in distinct ways.  As a painter, Jimson has a strong visual sense, and so this book has much more detailed descriptions of what he sees than is provided by the narrators of the first two books in the trilogy. Jimson is a thoroughly believable artist, who is in many ways a scoundrel but who also possesses a genuine creative gift.  He reminds us of the great gap that often exists between the artists who create and the staid academics who later analyze their works.  The book is a minor classic, and The New York Review of Books should be congratulated at restoring it to print, as it has with a number of other important, but out of print, novels.  If you read this book, you will certainly want to go back and read the others in the trilogy, Herself Surprised and To Be a Pilgrim.
