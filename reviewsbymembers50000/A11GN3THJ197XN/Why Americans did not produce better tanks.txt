 Since the US was the world's largest producer of cars and trucks, and during the Second World War also made excellent aircraft, it has never been clear to me why the Sherman Tank, the main battle tank for the US during the Second World War, was so inferior to the German Panthers and Tiger IIs. The author explains that the US military learned the wrong lessons from the Battle of France; they concluded that tank vs. tank battles were rare, and that tanks were mainly to be used against infantry and other soft targets. The Sherman was designed to be, at least for a tank, mechanically reliable, light enough to cross most bridges designed for car and truck traffic, and cheap. Huge numbers of them were manufactured. To deal with enemy tanks, tank destroyers, which were antitank guns mounted on a tank-like chassis, but lacking much armor, were developed. The shortcomings of this approach was not made clear until 1944, when the US for the first time came up against large number of first rate German tanks. American tank crews soon found that they could only destroy German tanks by getting very close; before they could do this, the German tank, with a larger gun and heavier armor, would often destroy the American tank. A good fictional discussion of the problem can be found in the novel "761," which is about an African-American tank group during the war. This book is excellent for anyone interested in armored combat during the Second World War.
