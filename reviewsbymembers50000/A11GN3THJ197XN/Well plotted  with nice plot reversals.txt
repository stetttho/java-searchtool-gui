 This is the seventh and latest in Lee Child's Jack Reacher series.  Reacher is a former military cop who reached the rank of major before before let go in the downsizing of the '90s.  He has a total indifference to possessions, and travels around the country staying in cheap hotels.   The Reacher novels are successful because Child is usually good at plot twists and reversals.  Although Reacher's background is in police work, much more emphasis is put on his combat skills, which seem to equal Delta Force.  Persuader begins quickly with a kidnapping and shootout.  Reacher quickly finds himself infiltrating a smuggler's household where he will be killed if discovered.  Child pushes the limits of plausibility at times -- Reacher seems to be without fear and sticks around when a more sensible person would run -- but stays within the limits enough that I could enjoy the book.   Persuader plays to Child's strengths in that the plot keeps moving quickly enough and throws the reader off guard that the momentum covers up any small errors.  If you are looking for a thriller with plenty of action, this book does the job nicely.
