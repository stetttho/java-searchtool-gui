 Dr. Hanson, a leading classical scholar, provides an excellent examination of how warfare among the Greek city-states was conducted.  He places particular emphasis on how the individual soldier fought.  On the one hand, combat in the front line must have been awful; on the other hand, because the armies were made up of men who had known each other for years, unit cohesion must have been very high.  While thoroughly researched, Hanson does not fall back on academic jargon, and his points are easily understood by the nonspecialist.  As he demonstrates, the method of warfare, while often fatal to the soldiers, left property and noncombatants unharmed.  Unfortunately, later in the wars between Athens and Sparta a more complete, and thus destructive manner of warfare developed.  This is an excellent book for anyone interested either in classical Greece or the history of warfare.
