 The Turning Point is one of the best movies about ballet.  That is not particularly high praise because there have been very few such movies -- The Red Shoes is the only other well known one that comes to mind.  The dancing in this movie is excellent -- featuring Baryshnkov at his prime.  Leslie Brown, while an excellent ballerina, is not particularly strong as an actress.  The story is also overly melodramatic.  Watch it for the dance, not for the plot.
