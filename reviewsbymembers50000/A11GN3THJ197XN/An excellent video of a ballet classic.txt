 It is generally agreed by ballet critics that video and film cannot capture the impact of a ballet performance, and are best used to record performances so that later dancers can see how it was done.  However, these critics have the advantage of living in those few cities with well established ballet companies.  Sleeping Beauty is a long ballet, with many roles, and thus is beyond the resources of all but the largest companies.  This video is of an excellent performance by the Royal Ballet.  The dancing, costuming, and sets are all excellent.  The camera work also does a good job of making up for not being there in person.
