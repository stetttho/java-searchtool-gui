 This book is an examination of the role of the English country house in poetry of the 17th Century.  The primary poets examined are Jonson, Herrick and Marvell.  These poets were writing during a time of great social change in England, one manifestation of which was the construction of new and large houses in country by the newly rich.  McClung traces the development of this genre of poetry from Roman models, and shows the important role it played in English poetry.  The poets praise those houses that represent the classic English virtues, while those that represent what was at the time innovative architecture are usually condemned.  McLung illustrates his analysis with photographs of some of the best known of the great country houses of the time.  This is an example of academic criticism at its best.
