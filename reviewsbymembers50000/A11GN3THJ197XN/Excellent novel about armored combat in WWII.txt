 G.F. Borden is very familiar with the technical issues of World War II tanks, including the Italian tank that is at the center of the book.  However, he never allows his considerable knowledge to detract from the horror of war.  Here, he describes the efforts of a tank crew far behind enemy lines to get their captured Italian tank back to safety.  His main character, an American who has been fighting fascism since the Spanish Civil War, has no illusions about war.  You need not be obsessed with World War II to enjoy this book; it is well-plotted, and the characters are quite believable.
