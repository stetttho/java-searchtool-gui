 All novels require a suspension of disbelief, but this one was too much for me.  It uses the hoary device of Freudian analysis as a means of structuring the story.  The great traumatic secret that this analysis eventually uncovers is so over the top as to be funny rather than horrifying; one would like to know what Flannery O'Connor would have thought of it.  As much as others love this book, for me almost everything in it rang false.
