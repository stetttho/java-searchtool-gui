 Those who enjoyed Look Homeward Angel will find this novel somewhat disappointing.  Continuing Eugene Gant's story with his trip to Harvard, and life in New York, the book lacks the vivid characters of the earlier novel.  While the book contains some wonderful, Whitman-like passages, the only real character is Eugene Gant; everyone else seems to exist only to show how brillant Gant (Wolfe) is.  Moreover, some of the book seems to border on anti-semitism.  Nevertheless, anyone interested in Wolfe will want to read this book.
