 Remember all the World War II movies where a handful of American or British soldiers mow down scores of German soldiers because the Allies are smarter?  Ellis' argument here is that the Allies won the war not by being smarter that than the Germans but by outproducing them in war material by a huge margin.  Ellis produces a substantial amount of evidence to support his claims. For example, the famous Luftwaffe bombing of London in 1940 cannot compare to the tremendous number of bombs dropped by the Allies on Berlin.  Part of the reason for discrepancy in production is that the Allies, as stable democracies, were quicker to put their economies on a war footing.  Unfortunately, the innovations they used to increase production beyond levels previously believed possible did not extend to military tactics. The result were higher casualties and a longer war than might have othewise been the case.
