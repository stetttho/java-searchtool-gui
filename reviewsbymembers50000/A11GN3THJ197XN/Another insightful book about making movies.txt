 William Goldman's sequel to Adventures in the Screen Writing Trade is almost as much fun as the original.  He does have his quirks -- for example, he seems obsessed with his height versus that of some Hollywood stars.  Nevertheless, his ability to tell a good story about his experiences in Hollywood would make him the perfect dinner companion.  He also provides useful information about what works and doesn't work in screenplays.  Unlike others in the business, he is unpretentious.  He does not take on the mantle of the "great artist."  However, he has done some great work on major movies.  If you enjoy movies at all, you will enjoy this book.  Aspiring screenwriters will be somewhat disappointed because, although the book does discuss Goldman's methods, it is not a how-to type of book.  It is a very good book for the rest of us.
