 Kenneth Roberts was a successful historical novelist in the 1930s and 40s, but faded in popularity after his death to the point that it was difficult to find his books outside of libraries.  In fact, he had many strengths as a writer.  In particular, he took seriously his obligations to accurately portray the historical period about which he was writing.  For example, in this book his account of life in the Continental Army consists of mostly of marching great distances with little food.  I imagine the soldiers of the time would agree.  Roberts is also interesting for turning to less popular subjects of the time; a major character here is Benedict Arnold, who appears quite favorably.  Roberts also does a good job of showing how much squabbling went on among the Continental Congress, a welcome relief to the current portrayal of all leaders back then as giants who have never been equaled.  You need not be deeply interested in the American Revolution to enjoy this book.
