 Breakout is the latest in the Parker series of noir thrillers. Written by Donald Westlake (under the appropriate penname of Richard Stark) is great fun to read about although you would never want to meet him in real life.  Parker comes close to being a sociopath.  He has completely no conscience; when in Breakout he decides to help a long term associate get his girl friend out of prison, it is because he decides that it is in his long-term interest; it does not matter to him that his associate (I can't call him a friend because Parker has no friends) helped break Parker out of jail earlier in the book.  He has no problem about killing someone who is an obstacle to his plans.  However, he is completely rational; he would never kill someone for no reason, nor does he seem to derive any pleasure from killing any more than he derives any guilt.   It's interesting to speculate why we enjoy such a character.  Probably it because we all like to imagine indulging our wishes without any care of what society would think, or any obedience of moral rules.  This what Parker does.   Breakout, as pointed out by several other reviewers, is close to a book in one of Westlake's other series.  Parker's presence, however, makes it distinctive.  Here, he must break out of a jail, and then into a jewelry store.  He has far more than his normal share of bad luck, but through his intelligence, and ruthlessness, remains free for another book in the series.
