 Niall Ferguson got headlines for what would have otherwise been a book for specialists of World War I when he included arguments that Britain should not have entered the war.  He acknowledged that this would have certainly meant the fall of France and the acquisition by Germany of territory in the East at the expense of Russia.  His argument created a great stir in Britain, which (like France) suffered enormously high casualties in World War I, much worse than in the World War II.  Ferguson's book is a thoroughly argued, revisionist approach to the War.  He disputes everything from the importance patriotism and war fever played in the early rush of enlistments to whether the Allies were economically more efficient than the Central Powers.  Do not buy this book expecting an easy read.  Ferguson supports his arguments by large amounts of statistical studies that are daunting even to a reader familiar with the controversies surrounding the war.  In the end, one is left with the belief that it could not have been a good thing for Germany to have eliminated France and Russia as world powers, which would have allowed it to build up its Navy in competition with Britain.  Of course, there is one benefit that would have come from Germany winning World War I; with the German political structure intact and victorious, it seems certain that Adolph Hitler would have lived his days out in obscurity. In short, this book is only for someone deeply interested in the economic and social history of World War I.
