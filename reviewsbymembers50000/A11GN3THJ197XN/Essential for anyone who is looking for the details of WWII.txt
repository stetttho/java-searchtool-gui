 This book is aptly titled; it consists almost entirely of tables listing every statistical detail about World War II.  Want to know what Bulgaria's order of battle was?  Need to know how many aircraft carriers Japan build during the war?  The range of Soviet tactical bombers?  It's all here.  On the other hand, there is little narrative, and the book assumes a detailed knowledge of World War II.  However, you will not find so much information collected in one place anywhere else.  Definitely not for everyone, but very valuable for anyone who wants to know (sometimes obscure) facts about the War.  The one weakness of the book, as has been pointed out, is the absence of citation to primary authorities.
