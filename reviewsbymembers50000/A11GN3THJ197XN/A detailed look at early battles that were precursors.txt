 "We Were Soldiers Once ... and Young" is a story of two of the first battles fought by US soldiers in Viet Nam.  Although the soldiers fought well, the military failed to appreciate that the Viet Cong also fought well, and that this was not going to be a walkover.  By concentrating on two actions, the authors examine details that would be lost in a larger survey.  One of the most chilling is the lieutenant who tells his friends that he is going to win the Medal of Honor.  Of course, what he achieves is to get himself and much of his platoon killed in short order.  This book is an accurate guide to the tactics used in the early parts of the Viet Nam war.  Finally, it shows how the Army expected the war to be won, and thus is a precursor for what would happen for years to come.  An essential book to understanding how the war was fought.
