 Prick Up Your Ears is a biography of Joe Orton, who achieved a measure of fame in Britain and the US for his plays such as "What the Butler Saw."  Orton, who was gay, got much of his literary education from his lover.  The lover, who went from being the dominant person in the relationship to the lesser when Orton became famous, eventually developed such a rage against Orton that he murdered him and then killed himself.  Orton's plays are often funny, but not deep.  They depend on the breaking of social and sexual conventions.  Now that those conventions have largely been broken anyhow, Orton's plays seem less shocking than they were at the time.  Orton liked to be thought of as another Harold Pinter, but somewhat to his horror he found that his admirers included conventional middlebrow playwrights of the day.  In fact, Orton's plays do have more in common with the works of these more conventional writer than with Pinter.  Perhaps Orton's greatest comic invention were his letters to the editor of various British publications, always written under a false name and always espousing an absurdely conservative point of view.  Orton, whether he admitted it or not, needed these conservatives for his plays to work. Lahr's biography is well researched, and is likely to remain the definitive biography of Orton.  Lahr himself has a fluid writing style, and the intelligence to know what to put in and what to leave out.  Thus, he avoids swamping the reader with meaningless details as do many American biographers.
