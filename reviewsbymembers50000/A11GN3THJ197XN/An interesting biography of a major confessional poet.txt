 The biographer here had an unusual advantage: Anne Sexton's daughter gave her access to taped sessions Sexton's psychiatrist had made of his sessions with Sexton.  This disclosure of what are normally privileged sessions raised eyebrows, but I did not find the disclosure obtained from these tapes that revealing.  It was obvious to anyone who came into contact with her that Sexton was a very disturbed person, and her doctor does not seem to have come to a definitive diagnosis.  It may well be that she suffered from some physical defect of the brain that could not be diagnosed during her lifetime. What is clear is that Sexton made life difficult for those closest to her, such as her husband and her children.  Wildly unstable, she demanded more than anyone could give, and gave back little in return.  On the other hand, she was one of the major poets of her time, and talented writers can get away with being miserable people.  A weakness of this book is that it not very strong on Sexton's poetry, which is the only reason people are interested in her.  Still, it is well researched, and is likely to remain useful to those interested in Sexton for years to come.
