 Most readers spent much of their childhood reading mystery stories written for children, in which children or teenagers caught spies or bank robbers by carefully noting their comings and goings and making brillant deductions. Michael Frayn has taken this formula and turned it on its head in Spies.  Set during World War II, Spies is the story of what happens the narrator and his best (and only) friend begin observing the friend's mother based on the friend's idiotic notion that she is a German spy.  Just like their counterparts in the Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew (there must be British equivalents), they start going through her things, and observing her comings and goings.  Unfortunately, while she is of course not a spy, she is up to something, and the boys' investigation uncovers secrets that the adults are trying to keep quiet.   The story is told in flashback, with the narrator as an old man looking back at his youth.  However, he tries to report things as he remembers them.  This allows the narrator to realize things the narrator doesn't, such as the flaws in some of the characters.  It will also many readers to anticipate events before they occur.  Nevertheless, there are a number of twists to the plot that will surprise the most.  Some will find the ending, in which we learn of things hinted at in the main story, but so peripheral to the plot as not to enage our attention, too clever and unnecessary.  As I like suprises, I enjoyed the final summing up.  Frayn, who has written on a wide range of subjects, has succeeded here.
