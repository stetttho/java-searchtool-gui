 Lytton Strachey, a member of the Bloomsbury group, altered the way biographies were written with this volume of four well-known Victorians.  At the time the book was published, it skewered the hypocrisies and self-assured nature of the Victorians.  Even today, when we are so far removed from the Victorian age that it seems quaint and even attractive, this book's attack on the deadening effect of much of that time still rings true.  And it is as readable now as it was then; Strachey was one of the wittiest men of his time, and this book is his most successful work.  Interestingly, he  became less iconoclastic as he grew older, and his later biography of Queen Victoria (not one of the four figures contained in Eminent Victorians) is rather respectful.  If you enjoy this book (and almost anyone would), you might want to try to see the movie released several years ago titled "Carrington."  It is based on a biography of Strachey by Milchael Holroyd, but is told from the point of view of a woman who fell hopelessly in love with Strachey; unfortunately for her, he was a confirmed homosexual, but she loved him anyway.  Emma Thompson plays the title roal and Jonathan Pryce is an excellent Strachey.
