 Kenneth Roberts is not widely read today, although in the 30's and 40's he was a bestseller.  It is unfortunate that he did not write straight history because the strongest part of his books is usually the narrative of what the soldiers actually went through -- the amount of marching and getting by on short rations greatly exceeds the time in combat.  The one historical weakness of both this book and Arundel is that Benedict Arnold comes across as too heroic.  As much time as Roberts spends on Arnold's frustrations and mistreatment by the Continental Congress, his portrayal of Arnold is of someone too good to betray his character.  I also agree with the reviewer who tired of Cap's comic adventures.  Still, Roberts has a strong narrative gift, and it is good to see his books back into print again.  The N.C. Wyeth cover is also nice.
