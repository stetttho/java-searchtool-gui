 The Road to Oxiana was popular when it was first issued, but gradually dropped out of sight, only to be revived when Bruce Chatwin and others rediscovered it.  Chatwin in particular was heavily influenced by this book.  It is the story of Robert Byron's efforts to see large brick burial towers located in Persia. Or at least that it was what Byron said he was looking for.  The book is more a depiction of his misadventures -- he was suspected of being a spy by most who met him, although there was no truth to this.  The style of this book is highly innovative; rather than presenting a straight narrative, it is (or appears to be) a collection of diary entries, newspaper stories, anecdotes, and cultural analysis. This makes the book sound themeless, but Byron's personality holds it together.  This book should be on a short list of the best travel books in the English language.
