 Stevenson's attempt to write a biography of Sylvia Plath was made more difficult because Plath's surviving husband Ted Hughes controlled the copyrights to Plath's work. (This may not be as difficult now because since Hughes's death, the copyrights presumably have been inherited by their children.)  Thus, at the time this book was written, the coorperation of Hughes, and his sister who seemed in charge of making sure that Stevenson got things right, was essential.  This led to charges that the biography was unbalanced in favor of Hughes. Some of the reviews were savage.  Moreover, as a later book by Janet Malcolm demonstrated, Stevenson had a difficult time dealing with the Hughes.   Nevertheless, Stevenson provides useful information for those who only know Plath from "Ariel" and "Bell Jar."  She shows the dual nature of Sylvia Plath -- on the one hand, the almost too-perfect young woman and on the other hand a deeply disturbed person with enormous rage.  Sylvia Plath is probably one of those persons of whom the the definitive biography can never be written.  However, Stevenson has made a very credible attempt.
