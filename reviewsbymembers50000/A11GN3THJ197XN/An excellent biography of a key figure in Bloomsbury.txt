 Lytton Strachey was one of the key figures in the Bloomsbury group, and one of Virginia Wolf's best friends.  He is best known today for his portraits of four famous Victorians in "Emminent Victorians."  At the time, the book was something of piece of generational warfare; the figures that Strachey dismantles were models of piety and determination held up to Strachey's generation when they were young as the sort of people to emulate. Strachey, who was one of the wittiest men of his time, shows that actually they were something of narrowminded fanatics.   Holroyd's biography is a superb portrait of Strachey and the circle he moved in.  Well-documented, it brings to life many people never well-known in America.  Strachey's personal life was extremely complicated; a woman named Carrington (she refused to use her first name which was Dora) fell desparately in love with him.  This was unfortunate for her because Strachey was a confirmed homosexual. When examined for possible conscription during the First World War, he was asked what he would due if he saw a German trying to rape his sister; his response was "I should try to come between them."  This made no difference to Carrington, whose love for him was so great that she committed suicide after his death.  Carrington, and other figures who became involved in Strachey's complicated life make this almost a group biography.  In fact, the biography was rereleased in connection with the movie "Carrington" (starred Emma Thompson in the title role and Jonathan Pryce as Strachey) and on the cover Carrington's name is in type as big as that used for Lytton Strachey. Holroyd's writing style is fluid, and his eye for a tellng anecdote make the biography eminently readable.  One does not have to be obsessed with Bloomsbury to enjoy this book.
