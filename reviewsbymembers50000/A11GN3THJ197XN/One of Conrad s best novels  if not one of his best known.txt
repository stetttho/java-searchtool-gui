 Victory is the story of a man named Heyst who leads an isolated life in the South Pacific.  However, he is drawn out of his isolation when he brings a woman to his island home.  A chance encounter between a dishonest German who dislikes Heyst and two criminals sets up the dramatic ending.  Conrad's style is as fluid as in his better known books, such as Lord Jim, and it is amazing that someone could write English so well who did not learn it until later in life and who always spoke it with a heavy Polish accent.  Victory is similar to Conrad's other works in that the plot flirts with melodrama, but always is rooted in realism.  Those who read the book will find the title apt.
