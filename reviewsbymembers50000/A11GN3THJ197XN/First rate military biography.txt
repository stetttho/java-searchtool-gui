 Field Marshall Montgomery has a poor reputation in the US. This is due to two related reasons: (1) the movie "Patton" for which General Bradley, who detested Montgomery (and didn't care that much for Patton either), was a technical adviser, and (2) Montgomery's ability to offend almost every American General who worked with him during the war. While Montgomery was truly obnoxious, he also was a complete professional when it came to fighting battles. He had been deeply affected by the great loss of life suffered by the British during World War I, and was determined to hold down casualties in World War II. His critics have argued that this caused him to miss opportunties, but the soldiers who served under him were grateful for his caution. Nigel Hamilton is a superb biographer, carefully explaining how Montgomery's theories of battle and not ignoring his personal flaws. This volume covers the end of the War, when Montgomery so angered Eisenhower towards the end of the Battle of the Bulge that the latter drafted a letter demanding Montgomery's removal. This was avoided only when Montgomery got wind of Eisenhower's anger, and abjectly apologized. The end of his life is sad, as he alienates his son and his remaining friends.
