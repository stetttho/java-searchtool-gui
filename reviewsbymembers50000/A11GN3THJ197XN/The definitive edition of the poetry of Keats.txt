 Jack Stillinger devoted much of his professional life to establishing the definitive texts of Keats's poems. This painstaking work has resulted in a number of changes to the poems.  As to the quality of the poetry itself, at his best Keats approaches Shakespeare, as in the Odes.  Stillinger is also an excellent teacher; I had his course on Keats 26 years ago, and it was fascinating.  While the other reviewers have done a very good job of describing the beauty of Keats's poetry, one point Stillinger made about Keats as a person is worth repeating:  Keats was the one English romantic poet that you would want to ask for advice about a personal problem you had.  All the rest, Blake, Wordsworth, Shelley (especially!), and Byron would have given you advice that, if followed, would have been wildly impractical.  Keats, as shown by his letters, was not pretentious and had a large degree of human decency and common sense.  While these characteristics are not one usually associated with romantic poets, I think that they contribute to the strength of his poetry.
