 Lee Child has written seven novels about Jack Reacher, a former military cop with formidable combat skills.  The strength of the Reacher novels is the plotting; Child is excellent at throwing red herrings and plot reversals in to keep the reader off-guard.  The results are usually effective thrillers, with plenty of action. Running Blind fails as a thriller.  All of the Reacher novels, indeed just about every thriller, have inconsistencies, coincidences, or illogical behavior by the characters.  In effective thrillers, the force of the plot pushes the action at such a pace that the reader doesn't care about these problems.  After all, no one readers a thriller for realism.  Here, Child's plot has women who were sexually harassed being killed under bizarre circumstances, with no obvious cause of death, and without the killer leaving a trace of how the crime was committed.  Enough clues are given that most readers will realize who the killer is and how the killer pulls it off half way through the book.  And the means used to pull it off would not be believed in a comic book.  The sheer impossibility was so great that once I realized what the answer was, I skipped to the end of the book to confirm my belief, and then gave up on it.  Child painted himself in a corner with this book that he had to rely on something that might have been used in the B movies of the thirties, but is ridiculous today.  I suggest skipping this book and going with the rest of the series.  Certainly, any one who has not read the other Reacher books should avoid this one -- they may be so put off by the absurd ending that they will not read the others and thus miss some great thrillers.
