 Holderlin is a German poet who is unfortunately not well in in the United States.  Richard Unger, however, provides an excellent study of this major figure in European literature.  Unger's own command of German is superb, and he is thoroughly familiar with both the poet's work and the period in which he wrote.  While not for the casual reader, this book is essential for the serious student of German literature.
