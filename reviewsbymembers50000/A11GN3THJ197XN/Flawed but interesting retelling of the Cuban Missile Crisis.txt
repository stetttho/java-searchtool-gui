 Thirteen Days goes back to the days when school children were taught to "duck and cover" if an atomic bomb exploded, and homeowners were encouraged to build fall-out shelters. It retells how close the US came to going to war with the Soviet Union because the latter place intermediate-range nuclear missles in Cuba without realizing the tremendous political impact that would have in the US. Bruce Culp is excellent as JFK, although there is not a strong physical resemblance. His acting skills more than make up for it. As for the accuracy of the movie, it veers from literal repetition of what people said during meetings -- because the meetings were taped and transcripts have been released -- to the near fictional by playing up Kenny O'Donnell's role in the crisis, which in reality was almost nonexistent. Since O'Donnell is played by Costner, he portrayed as the real brains of the White House. Both JFK and RFK are shown as eagerly seeking his advice and his reassurance that they are capable of doing their jobs. While O'Donnell was an important aide to Kennedy, one doubt that anyone as confident as JFK was so dependent on him. Another problem is that the movie portrays the military as war-crazy, and it seems that they, and not the Soviets, are the real villains. However, for me these faults were redeemed by Culp's performance and the inherent drama of the story.
