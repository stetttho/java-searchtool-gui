 World War I had a far greater impact on Britain than the US for the obvious reasons that they were in the war for over four years and suffered horrific casualties.  The literature produced by that war made a sharp break from what came before, which reflected the feeling in the country that the war had irrevocably changed life in Britain.  This is well illustrated in Siegfreid Sassoon's "The Complete Memoirs of George Sherston," a fictional version of his own experiences.  The first part covers Sherston's pre-war life, with his obsession with fox-hunting.  This is so well written that you will enjoy it even if you don't have the least interest in the subject.   The next section, "Memoirs of an Infantry Officer" covers his experiences in World War I, during he is highly decorated.  The horrors of the war, which many of Sassoon's class thought would be a great adventure, are accurately portrayed. Eventually he becomes disillusioned with the war, and writes a letter denouncing it that could have led to his court-martial.  A close friend (Robert Graves in real life) gets him classified as having a mental disorder and he is sent off to a hospital to recuperate.  This book is deeply moving and is one of a handful of books that changed the way that the English-speaking world views war.  Sassoon's writing style is plain on the surface, but its plainness makes the emotional impact all the greater.
