 Stewart's novel begins with a science fiction premised used by Stephen King in The Stand -- a virus quickly wipes out most of the world's population -- but from that point on, the two books (and others that have used this idea) are completely dissimilar.  Stewart has little interest in the plague itself, and it is covered in a short part of the book.  Rather, his interest is in how people react to being deprived of modern civilization.  For years, his characters try to keep things going by teaching their children to read, and keeping memories of the old world alive.  However, the drastically changed circumstances of their children's lives make this impossible, and the small group of survivors descend to a hunter-gatherer civilization.   Stewart also addresses the question of what would ordinary people do who find themselves deprived of the protections of the law, and thus having to make their own difficult choices.   Those who read this book expecting a typical science fiction novel will be disappointed.  Stewart uses science fiction themes to explore significant issues in much the same way that George Orwell did in 1984.  An excellent novel.
