 If you saw the Ken Burns series on Jazz and wanted to learn more, this book is a great place to start.  While it does not pretend to be exhaustive, it covers the history of Jazz from the beginning to the present, without neglecting contemporary artists in the way that Burns' series did.  The book also discusses musical issues in a way that the non-muscian can easily understand.  This won't be the last book that you will want to read about Jazz, but it should be the first.
