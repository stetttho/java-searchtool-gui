 G.F. Borden seems to be an expert on tanks in World War II, having earlier written "Easter Day" about a tank crew behind enemy lines trying to get themselves and their captured Italian tank to safety. Seven Six One is about an African-American tank battalion during World War II. Interestingly, none of the characters ever expressly say that the soldiers in this unit are black, but even if you don't know anything about the Seven Six One, it is quickly apparent. Borden is familiar with the shortcomings of the Sherman tank compared to German Panthers and Tiger IIs, and portrays the courage of the men who continue to fight in inferior machines. He also shows how well the Germans fought up until the end of the war, even though it was obvious to everyone that they were going to lose. This book does not glorify war, but it justly glorifies men who willingly chose combat as a way of demonstrating that they were as good Americans as anyone else.
