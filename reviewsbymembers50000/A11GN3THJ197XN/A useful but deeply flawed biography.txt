 Blotner did a prodigious amount of research for this biography.  Any later writer who wants to produce a biography of Faulkner will inevitably find himself or herself relying on much of Blotner's work.  The reader, however, will not be so grateful.  Blotner seems incapable of distinguishing between that which is important and that which is not.  It seems as though he has dumped almost everything he learned into this book. And he learned quite a lot.  Why we need, for example, to know the names  of everyone Faulkner came into contact with?  Finally, Blotner is not a gifted writer; his style is typical of the academic.  I can only hope someone writes a shorter, more readable biography of Faulkner someday.
