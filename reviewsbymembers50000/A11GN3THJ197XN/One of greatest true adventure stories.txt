 In search of adventure, Cherry-Garrard joined Captain Robert Scott's expedition to the South Pole, even though he was extremely nearsighted.  His book is primarily devoted to a trip that he and two other members of Scott's expedition to the South Pole made to retrieve penguin eggs that were only laid during the depths of the Antarctic winter. Given the lack of knowledge of the terrain, and the horrible weather the men faced, the trip seems crazy to a modern day reader. However, these men were strong believers in the Victorian/Edwardian cult of heroism and science. Of course, they were nearly killed several times, and Cherry-Garrard's companions died with Scott on his trip to the South Pole. Cherry-Garrard's prose style is underrated -- although not a trained writer, he succeeds in vividly reporting on the horrors and joys of his experiences.
