 Alexander the Great is not someone about whom it could be said that the definitive biography has been writtern.  The difficulty is not just that a biographer is dealing with a figure who lived thousands of years ago, and whose original biographies have been lost.  The larger problem is that our view of the world and life is quite different than it was in the time of Alexander and those who followed him.  To be a great military leader is no longer viewed as the highest possible achievement, and Alexander's ambition, which was Homeric in scope, no longer seems as admirable as it did in the past.  Thus, I think that Green sometimes takes an excessively unfavorable view of Alexander.  On the other hand, Green is one of the leading classcial scholars in the world, and he undoubtedly knows what he is doing better than someone like myself.  The strengths of this biography is that it is thoroughly researched, does not engage in speculation to fill in the gaps that exist, and is particularly strong on Alexander's battles.  One can question whether Alexander was the greatest general of all time -- after all, it was a very different thing to command an army in classical times where a general was expected to be in the forefront of the action, as opposed to the battles of Napoleon, where conduct like Alexander's would have gotten Napoleon killed in short order.  Nevertheless, Green's historical judgments seem sound.  If you find this book interesting, you will not want to stop here.  On the other hand, it is an excellent place to start, and is the best recent biography of Alexander.
