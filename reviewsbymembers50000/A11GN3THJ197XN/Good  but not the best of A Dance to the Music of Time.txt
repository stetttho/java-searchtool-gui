 This trilogy takes up the war years, and Nick Jenkins' experiences in the Army.  The Army is portrayed not as a fighting machine, but as a giant bureaucracy.  Of course, this is the experience that many of the millions of men who served in the Armed Forces for Britain and the US had.  The frustrations Jenkins experiences are similar to those described in Evelyn Waugh's Sword of Honor trilogy.  The emphasis on the bureaucratic aspects of war makes the success of Widmerpool -- in many ways the least military of men, and one who would be completely incompetent as a leader on a battlefield -- completely believable.  Powell proves as adept as ever as a creater of characters.  I would rate these three novels as quite good, but not as memorable as the earlier two trilogies.  Even for Powell, the novels seem rather weak on plot, and to be more a series of character sketches.  However, this weakness is overbalanced by the dry humor and the author's ability to create believable characters who are funny, and engaging.  While obviously not the place to start, this trilogy is essential for anyone who has read Powell.
