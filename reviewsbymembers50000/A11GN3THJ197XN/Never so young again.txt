 The title for this review is from a Larkin poem about the beginning of World War I, but it applies as well to anyone who can remember 1967.  This CD is of a live concert from that year when Simon & Garfunkel were stars but not (as the liner notes point out, superstars).  The set list is based on their first 3 albums and thus represents their folk background.  Long-time fans of the group will appreciate having live version of some of their  more obscure songs. The two are backed only by Paul Simon's guitar -- this CD is further evidence that Simon has never gotten sufficient respect for his skills as a guitarist.  The sound quality is extremely good, perhaps because of absence of amplified instruments. S & G show that their trademark harmonies are not merely a product of the studio (where I believe that they were double tracked so that most of the songs really had four voices on them), but could be performed live as well.   The liner notes point out that this was a special time, when the 60's still seemed boundless with possibilities, and before drugs, the increasing violence of political protest, and the increasing horrors of the Vietnam war had taken their toll.  Still, the extremely high quality of the music and the performance make this far more than an exercise in nostalgia.  It is certainly not a case of aging stars scraping the barrel to make a few more dollars out of their past.  It's a shame that this recording wasn't released decades ago; we should be glad to have it now.
