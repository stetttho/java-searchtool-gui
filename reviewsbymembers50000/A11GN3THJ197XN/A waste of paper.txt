 No one has ever accused Tom Clancy of being a great writer, but in the Bear and the Dragon he hardly appears to be trying.  The book is poorly edited, plot lines are dropped or added arbitrarily, and the dialogue is so bad that it has to be read to be believed.  In some of his earlier books, Clancy did show that he could construct a fast-moving plot, and turn out entertainment, if not art.  But at this point in his career, he can't even do that.  Of course, he continues to sell well based on his earlier work, but you have to wonder how long this will continue.
