 This biography is excellent in portraying Stalin's character and what live was like for those who had the fortune/misfortune to live in close proximity to him.  The author has added to the knowledge about Stalin both by his access to materials in Soviet archives, and his interviews with children of persons in Stalin's circle, or in a few cases, with individuals who worked with Stalin and were still alive.  The result is a more complete depiction of Stalin as a human being, instead of a villain out of a bad thriller.    The author is not a revisionist.  If he shows Stalin being kind on individual occasions, he also shows him having hundreds of thousands murdered, including many people who were personal friends.    I don't give the book five stars because the author assumes the reader knows about larger issues such as the conduct of World War II, the ideological battles among the Bolsheviks, and the consequences of Stalin's policies among the population.  Of course, if this had been done, the book would have been much, much longer.  In fairness, the author acknowledges that Stalin's drive for collectivization led to famines that killed millions, but this is disposed of in a few sentences.  In contrast, the effects of Stalin's paranoia on the Bolsheviks is given greater detail.  It's important to remember that many of the upper level officials that Stalin had killed or imprisoned were themselves responsible for summary execution of innocent people who were deemed wreckers or opponents of the regime.  Finally, the book is extremely well written -- not the work of a dry academic.  Anyone who finds this era fascinating should follow-up with additional books about Stalin and his lieutenants.
