 Naked Prey is the latest of John Sandford's Lucas Davenport series.  Davenport has a new job for the governor that sends him off to a remote area of Minnesota to investigate a suspected lynching of a black man and white woman.  One unfortunate result of the setting is that few of the regular series characters are in this book, and with one exception, those that appear do so briefly. Sandford breaks with the formula that has so often served him well in the past -- Davenport versus a killer (who may or may not be identified to the reader) with each making move and counter-move against one another.  Here, Davenport actually solves the initial crime early in the book.  However, the samll town near the crime scene has a lot of secrets that continue to propel the plot.  At times, the characters are driven by mistakes and misunderstandings as to what is actually happening -- which is close to the way things happen in real life.  Sandford also has a good feel for Midwestern characters and the way they talk.  The dialog is sharp throughout the book.   If you like the Prey series, you will want to read this book.  I don't rank it at the top of the series because of some plot holes that occur early in the book.  Without giving the plot away, the first killing occurs because the killer has learned the names of his victims from someone else who he has killed before the book has begun.  How he found this person, who should have been otherwise unknown to him, is not clear.  Also,this person gives him only some but not all of the names of the people he would be looking for -- again, no explanation.  However, Sandford keeps the plot moving quickly enough that this problem is quickly forgotten.  Too bad that it is a year before another Prey novel comes out.
