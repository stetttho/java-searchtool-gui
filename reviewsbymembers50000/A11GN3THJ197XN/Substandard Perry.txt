 Thomas Perry has written a number of excellent thriller; his last one, Pursuit, was well-plotted.  Unfortunately, Dead Aim features uninteresting characters, a dubious premise, and an unbelievable ending.  The main character, Robert Mallon, is a successful builder forced into an early retirement after a bitter divorce results in him having to sell his business.  The plot begins with Mallon saving a woman from committing suicide, only to have her later leave him and finish the job.  He eventually discovers that she killed a former boyfriend; she was given training in how to do this from a group of people who run a self-defense camp and who will help their trainees kill people for a fee.  Since the trainees kill their victims for a motive (this is not a camp attended by serial killers), one would expect that they would be questioned by the police at some point, and that sooner or later one would give away the scheme.  However, nothing like this ever happens. Not helping matters is that Mallon is a very bland character.  A female private detective he hires is more interesting but doesn't survive long enough to carry the book.  ....   Let's hope that Perry's next book is a return to form.
