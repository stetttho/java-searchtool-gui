 Though this book does not have the same power over me as On Revolution had, On Violence is still a very well written, witty and insightful look at the power structures most prevalent in the early 1970's. Arendt makes the  intelligent claim that those with power that are losing that power will hit  a point where they only see violence as a means to maintain the current  power distribution, but that violence will actually cause a loss of power.  The book can be read in a day (and should), but this book needs to be read  3 or 4 times to catch all of the subtle points Arendt throws in  unannounced. The main criticism I have of this book is its failure at  points to demonstrate the relavence of her arguments, which I find she does  incredibly well in her other books. Not a must buy, but if you have the  option, take it.
