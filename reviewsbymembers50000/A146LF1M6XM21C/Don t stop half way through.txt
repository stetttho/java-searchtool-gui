 About half of the way through the book, Neustadt seemed to be saying the same things over and over again. I almost stopped reading. However the incredible tidbits of advice in the first half encouraged me to continue.  It was certainly worth it. The last 5 or 6 chapters were written over the  period between the Kennedy assasination and the end of the Reagan  Administration, allowing Neustadt to ammend many of his ideas from the  first 8 chapters (originally published in 1960) making the book far more  lively. A wonderful read for those with a weak knowledge of the last 50  years. If you know a lot about the Korean War, Bay of Pigs, or Iran-Contra,  the book may be a little too much review. Otherwise it is fabulous.
