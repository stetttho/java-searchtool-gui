 Gabriel Kolko's book is a fun read, which if you know little about the Progressive Era will be very enlightening. The major critique I have of this book is its naive conclusion that business worked together as class,  that there was one opinion across the board. This is ridiculous. If you  enjoy this period read this book, but read Colin Gordon's book, New Deals  to be a little more complete.
