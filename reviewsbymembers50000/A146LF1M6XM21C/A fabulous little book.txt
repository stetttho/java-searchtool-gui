 This book is paradoxical in a couple of ways. First, for being a book whose text barely makes it past 90 pages, it has an incredible amount of content. His secret is to use slick, but understandable, proofs and surprisingly (at least for a graduate text) he shows almost every step. Secondly, it is interesting that a book entitled "Lectures on Block Theory" does not define a block until page 68. The reason is that Kulshammer must restate the "classical theory of finite dimensional algebras" into the language of points as invented by Puig. The book was a pleasure to read. It does not contain exercises, but if one is willing to sit down with pencil and paper and work through the proofs, one will gain more than enough understanding of the subject.  An important feature of this text is that it assumes that all algebras are over an algebraically closed field of characteristic p. I believe that the results contained also hold when this condition is weakened, but you will need to go to Thevenaz's book to see that. Overall, I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in learning rep'n theory from Puig's point of view. P.S. The index has been slightly misprinted, just a mere translation problem. Simply subtract 6 from the index number.
