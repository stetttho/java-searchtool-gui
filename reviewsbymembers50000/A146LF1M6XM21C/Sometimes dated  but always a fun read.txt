 Though this book was written close to 40 years ago, and though Rossiter knew nothing about the Kennedy assasination, Watergate, or Vietnam, this book makes bold predictions about the future of our country and our  presidency with surprising accuracy. The book is written sometimes in a  conversation-like tone that makes for easy reading, and the author (while  incredibly knowledgable) makes no effort to talk over the readers head. It  is a bit old though, and the type of analysis Rossiter uses (namely a  constitutionalists point of view) is out-dated. However, it is an  optimistic and inspiring book that every future president should read.
