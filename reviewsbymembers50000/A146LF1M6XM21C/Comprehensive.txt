 If you have a couple of months to spare and an interest not only in the Totalitarian regimes in the former Soviet Union and Germany, but also a desire to learn about antisemitism and imperialism then this is the book  for you. If you just want to know about Totalitarianism, get the volume  only containing that portion. This is an incredibly dense and comprehensive  history that takes both patience and time to wade through. The journey is  well worth it, though, as Hannah Arendt shows the incredibly destructive  nature of all that makes one human under a totalitarian rule. It isn't a  fun read, but definitely a rewarding one.
