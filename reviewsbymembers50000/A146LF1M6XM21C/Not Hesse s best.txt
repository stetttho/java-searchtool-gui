 I really enjoy Hermann Hesse's novels. In general they are written in such a way that I feel tranquill and happy by the end. The prose is gorgeous and the stories are broad. However, Peter Camenzind, while a fine first novel,  does not have the same impact as a Siddartha, Narcissus and Goldmund, or  Demian. At the end I felt disgustingly depressed. Hesse's intent is  assumably to attack this sort of feeling in the end, but the character just  doesn't convince one that he enjoys life anymore. If you like Hesse a lot,  read it. You might take more out of it than I did. Otherwise, this one is  better left on the shelf.
