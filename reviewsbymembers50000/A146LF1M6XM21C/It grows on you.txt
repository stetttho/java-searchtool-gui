 When I first heard this album, I thought, "Interesting, but they don't have the magic of the original." Every time I listen to it, though, I hear more and more things that make me smile, nod my head, or  mumble, "Yes!" If you listen to GNR solely for the epicness of  their music, this is not the CD for you. If, however, you also appreciate  the way that they make your body move, then you will come to love this  album.
