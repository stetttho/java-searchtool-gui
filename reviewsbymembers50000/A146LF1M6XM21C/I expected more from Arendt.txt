 Though Arendt is one of my favorite political theorists, this compilation left me dissapointed. Though her insights on Truth, Justice and Authority are well argued, she makes very few of the observations that made me love  her works. The best chapter in the book is the 7th, a defense of her work  Eichmann in Jeruselum (though she does not explicitly mention it) where she  discusses the nature of Truth and its role it the telling of history. As  usual of course, a knowledge of Greek and Latin is helpful with Arendt  (which I don't have) as the text is full of foreign words.
