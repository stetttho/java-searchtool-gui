 This is the type of book that sneaks up on you and before you know, you feel a great amount of inner peace. Then you think a little more and you suffer from a great amount of inner turmoil. Then you think even more and  you feel a great amount of inner peace,...etc. It is funny, sad and most of  all beautiful. I would recommend it to anyone.
