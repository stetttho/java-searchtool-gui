 If you are looking for an introductory book on group theory, I suggest Herstein or Dummit & Foote, but for an intermediate to advanced group theory student, you can't do much better. Marshall Hall is an excellent  mathematician who writes an excellent book, full of examples and expository  that makes for the book being a good read, and an astounding reference. As  for learning the material, even now I go back to sections of book I didn't  cover in the class I used it, to learn material for classes I am currently  in. It covers the basics of group theory (in fact, he gives several  versions of the definition of a group), free groups, compostion series,  solvable groups, nilpotent groups, p-groups, cohomology, and does and  incredible introduction into representation and character theory. This book  does the best a math book can do, it teaches well.
