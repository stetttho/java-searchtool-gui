 Though Robert Greiss (of the Monster group fame) has assured me that the proofs and theory in the book are all sound, a beginner would have a difficult time believing it. The proofs generally leave a great deal to be  proved, and worse to not point out these short comings so that a reader  could at least work them out on the side. I am sure that if one understands  representation theory then this is a marvelous reference, but for beginners  I prefer Curtis & Reiner's Methods of Representation Theory Volume 1,  or even the last section of Dummit and Foote's Abstract Algebra which is  the best explained intro to representation and character theory that I have  found.
