 I used this book as a means of writing my senior thesis on the clasification of the projective unimodular groups and the Mathieu groups as being simple. Most of the proofs were well constructed and easy to follow.  What this books lacks is a proof reading. Several of the proofs make no  sense in the form in which they are written. Also, his notation at times  becomes cluttered and not easy to follow. One can imagine how difficult  notation can be in general, but when it is full of typographical errors, it  can be almost impossible to wade through without the help of someone who  knows the material. This book is certainly not a waste of time to read and  is very good as a reference for theorems concerning finite groups, however  do not put all your eggs in one basket and base your education on this one  book.
