 Colin Gordon writes a fascinating history of the New Deal, which challenges the reading of Gabriel Kolko and Capture Theory. He argues that their was no monolithic business interest, but that the competitiveness of  individual firms made it virtually impossible to organize around and  control government regulation. Gordon's writing is excellent and his  examples capture the age. A must read for any scholar of the era, or anyone  who thinks they know all there is to know about the New Deal.
