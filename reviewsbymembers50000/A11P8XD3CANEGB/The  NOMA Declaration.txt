 One can tell how much I enjoy a book by how many pages I turn over. Usually a spontaneous literary tic on my part, it�s a sign that there�s something thought-provoking, something I want to follow up on, or merely a mile marker on the highway which shows where I had an �ah ha!� experience. Many pages were folded over in this relatively short and very easily readable book which nevertheless manages to convey some very deep concepts. This is the book where the late Harvard palaeontologist Stephen Jay Gould, an admitted agnostic of secular Jewish background, defines � re-defines, really � an approach to reconciling science and religion which he calls Non-overlapping Magisteria (NOMA). This is the �NOMA Declaration,� as it were. Reconciling science and religion is a passion of mine, and when I find something that helps me, I�m enthused. I�m even more enthused when it�s a book I can recommend to practically anybody to help them understand something I feel very strongly about: a) ultimately all knowledge is part of a greater truth, but while we are in this mortal existence we have certain limits placed upon our abilities to gain and understand the most transcendent truths; b) science and religion both address questions of knowledge, and they sometimes appear to conflict; c) the key isn�t in trying to express one type of knowledge in terms of the others � that leads to the square pegs and round holes of fundamentalist creationism and atheistic scientism � but in learning about the meaning of the questions that each �magisterium� (realm of inquiry, as Gould defines it) poses. And this book does that very, very well. Reading level required: Grade IX AP (it helps to have had at least introductory high school biology, and will be easier for those with 2nd year high school biology).
