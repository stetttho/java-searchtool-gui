 I was very impressed by the book. Simple but not simplistic, as I think another reviewer put it. Straightforward, insightful and inspirational. I first bought a copy for my son to take with him on his mission, then we bought 3 for relatives, then I bought 5 more for non-members. The non-LDS loved the book. Typical comments were things like "I didn't know Mormons were Christians" (duh! but, hey -- that's how you make progress) to "I'm Catholic, but I found it very inspirational, at least as good as the Pope's recent book." I can't think of anything anyone but a rabid anti-Mormon would disagree with in this book. The only people who might give it a pass are those who are already very familiar with Pres. Hinckley's talks and essays, but even there it's a good compendium. Easy to get, too -- even Canadian secular bookstores (like Chapters and Indigo) carry it. Marc A.
