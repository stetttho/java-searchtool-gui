 While Owen and Mosser are much better scholars than the usual batch of Biblicists, this is still not a neutrally informative book but an anti-Mormon screed. It takes evangelical Protestant assumptions, co-opts them as being "Christian" and sees how Latter-day Saints measure up. Kind of hard to measure up to something written by an enemy. BUT, if you're going to read an anti-Mormon book, this is a cut above the usual nonsense. Owen and Mosser are at least in dialogue with the LDS intellectual community, so avoid most of the bloopers other anti-Mormon polemics fall pray to.
