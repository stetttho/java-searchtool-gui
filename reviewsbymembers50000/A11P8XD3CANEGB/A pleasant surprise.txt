 I recently became acquainted with this book after borrowing it from a friend. I found it to be very comprehensive, addressing all but the most esoteric and sensationalist anti-Mormon questions. It's certainly appropriate for the sincere investigator. Level and quality of writing as well as thoroughness in reviewing available literature on the questions makes it ideal for a missionary with a bit more than the average interest in apologetics, or a member who wants a single reference book.
