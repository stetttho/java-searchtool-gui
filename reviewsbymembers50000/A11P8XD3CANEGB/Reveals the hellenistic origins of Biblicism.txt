 This is a book that can be overwhelming to many readers just because of the sheer onslaught of facts and references to ancient sources Bickmore brings to bear. Perhaps that's why not too many books like this have appeared before: it appears an incredible amount of work went into this;  also, it takes guts to examine the often unexamined roots of Biblicist  Christianity (specifically that cloying, anachronistic ultraconservative  American variant of evangelical Protestantism appears to be  Bickmore's"~ target). If you're the American "sola  scriptura" type, be forewarned: get good medical insurance first.  You'll blow a head gasket reading this.
