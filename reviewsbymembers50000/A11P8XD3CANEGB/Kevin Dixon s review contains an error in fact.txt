 Kevin Dixon claims David Bercot does not quote Clement of Rome, but the very quote Kevin Dixon thinks counteracts the doctrine of justification by faith (sola fides) IS in fact quoted by Bercot, who uses it to show that neither extreme of sola fides nor works alone was original Christian doctrine, but that the Church Fathers carefully balanced the two. Clement of Rome's quote is in the section "Does This Mean That Christians Earn Their Salvation By Works?" I don't mind reviewers reacting to a book from the point of view of their own particular sectarian background, but they should at least get their facts straight. Marc A.
