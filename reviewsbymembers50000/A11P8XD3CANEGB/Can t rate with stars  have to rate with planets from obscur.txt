 e parts of the galaxy.... ;-) This "omnibus" edition is rather a bit bulky to hold in the bath or on the beach or in one's sleeping bag, but it's worthy the sprained thumb muscles. I'm almost 50 so this was a blast from the past for me (and in any case, I had only read the original trilogy, not the fourth book in what was still stubbornly and as the entry in the Hitchhiker's Guide will tell you, is nevertheless still a trilogy because it was written by a software avatar named Douglas Adams while in Improbability Drive. I thought everyone knew that. And then to have the 5th (and absolutely new) book, "So Long and Thanks for All the Fish," and the cute short story about the young and adventuresome Zaphod, well, when I saw it, I had to get it...for my 20-year old son.  His response? "Gee, now I know where all those expressions come from. You know, 'life, the universe and everything,' '42,' 'I never could quite get the hang of Thursdays' and so on." I'd made a convert. I'd pass the virus (or is that a meme?) on to a new generation and had fulfilled my role as a father. But being a wily father, after giving it to my son for Christmas, I borrowed it back* and reread the original stories, which I first encountered in their radio format -- the BBC radio versions re-broadcast on the CBC**. What a delightful blast from the past. It still froodles, by Zarquon! *Always make your euro/loonie/yanquidollah stretch farther by giving books to people you'd like to read. A somewhat less obvious strategy than giving your wife the Motomaster cordless drill set from Canadian Tire for Christmas. **Canadian Broadcasting Corporation; listed in the Hitchhiker's Guide as the Canadian Broadcorping Castration, thanks to an error by a sub-editor at InfiniDim.
