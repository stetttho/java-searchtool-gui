 I found the book nothing but a rehash of material I've already seen in other polemical works that specialize in presuming to tell Latter-day Saints what they believe. They do not balance their sources -- all sources are given equal weight, which is a sign of polemics, not scholarship.  Many basic facts are wrong, sometimes sloppily so.  For instance, on page 172 they write, "Using these passages [I Cor 15:40-41] to validate the idea of three kingdoms making up heaven ignores the Jewish tradition Paul would have known. According to that tradition, paradise was the abode of God, the place of eternal joy for God's people. However, Jewish custom never viewed a first or second heaven as alternative eternal destinations. Rather, these referred to the atmospheric heaven (the sky) and the galactic heaven (the universe) .4" But footnote 4 reads, "4. Christian scholar Matthew Henry wrote in his commentary, 'It was certainly a very extraordinary honour done him: in some sense he was caught up into the third heaven, the heaven of the blessed, above the aerial heaven, in which the fowls fly, above the starry heaven, which is adorned with those glorious orbs: it was into the third heaven, where God most eminently manifests His glory.'" Matthew Henry, of course, is a well-known Protestant, not a "Jewish scholar."  The book is full of sloppy errors and mis-statements like this, as well as polemical language that is downright theatrical, at one point comparing Latter-day Saint soteriology with the bringing into being of people like Hitler. Only disaffected former members looking for rationalization for their decisions and biblicist proselytizers "witnessing" to the less-informed Latter-day Saints will find any benefit from this book. It is not a contribution to denominational scholarship. Marc A. Schindler Spruce Grove, Alberta, Canada - Gateway to the Boreal Parkland
