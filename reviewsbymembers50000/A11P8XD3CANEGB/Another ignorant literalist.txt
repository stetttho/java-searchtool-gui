 This is just another piece of ignorance written by an extreme literalist who is in way over his head. Needless to say, by "Christianity" he means the caricaturized version *he* calls Christianity. Anyone who uses his "answers" against someone who really knows their stuff will get absolutely and embarrassingly blind-sided. Marc A.
