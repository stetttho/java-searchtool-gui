 There are three things which impressed me the most about this book: 1) Its contents. It's well-organized and comprehensive, going over arguments both pro and con for the historicity of the Book of Mormon, and addressing them all; 2) Its open-mindedness. Givens does not hide the fact that he has a bias in favour of the Book of Mormon, but in spite of this manages to remain neutral, even disinterested; and 3) The fact that Oxford University Press picked it for publication says a lot about the level of scholarship of the book. In fact, I believe this is the first time a non-LDS press has picked a book of this nature for publication -- and such a prestigious press at that.
