 Yeah, I know. SimCity 3000 really hasn't changed from its predecessor SimCity 2000. But you have to look behind the package -- SimCity 3000 has a much stronger and detailed simulation engine. It calculates more variables  than its predecessor -- city aura, for example. And the removal of that  ugly and annoying newspaper in favor of the great new ticker and advisors.  Ordinances play a bigger role in the simulation, too. You can have much  bigger maps, and it is designed to interact with simcity.com. Pipes and  subway can be laid easier, and roads look better. My only gripe is the lack  of a terrain editor (but you can get an external program), and the lack of  a sign tool. But, that's minor, isn't it? If Maxis released its 3d version  of SimCity 3000, it'd be like running Microsoft Office 2000 on a 286. (I  mean all 7 apps at once). We should be thankful that Maxis used an  isometric view instead.
