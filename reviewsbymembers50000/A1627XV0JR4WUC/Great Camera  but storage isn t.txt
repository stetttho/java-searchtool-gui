 Great camera. Great pictures. But -- the storage is terrible! A floppy disk can hold only so many images... AND it'll hold only ONE megapixel image. There are better soloutions out there. CompactFlash cards can hold  64MB of images, at the least. Iomega Clik! for Digital Cameras drives can  hold 40MB of imagery. And, floppy disks are expensive. I highly reccomend  this for novices, but for serious photographers, stay away!
