 After reading this, I kept asking myself that very question. Mr. O'Reilly makes such good use of details, and facts that makes this story very realistic. Bill tells us exactly what goes on behind the scenes in a news  station and a police officer's mind. I couldn't put it down.  It's just  too real...I have to keep reminding myself that Bill made it all up. An  excellent read!   NOTE: There is some questionable content in this book.  If you're easily offended by that kind of content, don't read this book.  Just a warning.
