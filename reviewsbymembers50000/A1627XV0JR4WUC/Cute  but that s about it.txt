 Yeah, it's cute. It's fun to play with, too -- for the first 5 minutes. The calendar on it is completely disfunctional -- it will have no use to you. And, it's not really reliable. Mine broke the second day. Makes a cute add-on for a gift, but not as a functional piece of equipment.  Really  overpriced.
