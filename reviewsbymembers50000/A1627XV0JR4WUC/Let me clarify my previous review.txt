 OK, I've been getting tons of e-mails labeling me a complete idiot because I don't really like this camera.   I like the camera...I'm just really unhappy with the media it uses. When I said floppy disks were expensive, I  meant on a per-magabyte basis. For my example, I'll use the Iomega Clik!  disk (40 MB) A floppy disk usually costs about a dollar and a half (when  bought by itself). A Clik! disk costs $15 dollars by itself. You need to  buy 27 3 1/2 floppy disks to equal a Clik!. That's $25 more, thus making  the floppy disk less cost-efficient.  (To be fair, I'll counteract my own  case. I know people buy floppies in bulk, but you can do the same with the  Clik!'s, CompactFlashes, and SmartMedia cards. Also, there's the issue of  buying the $150 Clik! Drive, but after buying 6 disks, it pays for  itself.) This is another product that could ONLY sell in America, where  we put convienience over quality and [cost-]effeciency. This camera was  great a couple years ago, but now, as floppies are starting to die (but it  will still take a few years), the technology is getting stale. I know Kodak  and Olympus are selling some really great cameras from last year for  sub-$200 prices.  Of course, for the person new to digital imaging AND  computers, this (overpriced) camera may be the way to go...if you've tries  d a competitor's effort and have hated it.  REMEMBER: Digital Cameras are  a must ONLY for people who regularly need images on a computer. You can  always have a film developer put your 35mm film on disk, or scan your 35mm  pictures or negatives with a scanner.
