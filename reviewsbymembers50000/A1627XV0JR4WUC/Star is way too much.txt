 Solomon makes very weak and irrational points in his book. One begins to believe that he just wants to make a profit off of the phenomenon that is Dilbert. I mean, people usually aren't influenced by a cartoon, a cartoon in the comics section of the newspaper. It's not worth the money to buy  this book...even if it was free.  I can only imagine the sequel... 'The  trouble with Garfield...'. Get a life, Solomon.
