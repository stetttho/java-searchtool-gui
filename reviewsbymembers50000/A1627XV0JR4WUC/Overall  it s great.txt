 When I bought CrashGuard for about $10 at my local office supply store (I have CrashGuard 3), it seemed like a good deal. It works great -- it gives me a minute or so to save my documents before they crash for good. But...I  was suprised at what came with CrashGuard. A virus checker? A shortcut  verifier? A disk defragmenter? (And lots of other cool extras too!) My  computer works much better now...and not to mention the great free  subscription to Norton Web Services. LiveUpdate Pro detects programs like  Internet Explorer, Office, Windows, and even games like RollerCoaster  Tycoon and SimCity 3000! It finds updates for these programs and security  patches.  Of course, there is one gripe I have with it... CrashGuard seems  to crash itself more than all the other programs I have...itsn't that  ironic? But the cool extras (the FAST disk defragmenter, virus scanner,  registry scanner, etc...) make it a good buy. If only it wouldn't crash  itself.So,it gets an overall "4"...
