  That is the second book about health that is so good. The first one that I came across was Can We Live 150 Year? by M. Tombak. What I like in both books is the comprehensive approach to health and well being. The authors of both books do not treat any part of the body separate from the other parts. It is all interrelated. The authors do not talk about treating symptoms of an illness; they talk about finding out and eliminating the cause of the problem. Look at the shelves of our pharmacies today - most of the products there are devoted to eliminating, or masking the symptoms... (!). At the same time the authors of both books emphasize proper nutrition, detoxification, stress management, sleep restoration, and so on... I do not want to rewrite any of these books here, so just check it out yourself. In fact I strongly recommend getting both of them
