 After some trouble with earlier versions of this product, I've now deployed several of these in different locations.  It has worked well with consumer grade Netgear, Linksys, and D-Link products as well as a SonicWALL access point.  It has NOT worked with a Netgear FWG114P wireless router.  So, contrary to the description, it does not work with 'virtually' all wireless routers, so you need to check the D-Link website or just try it if it is not in the list.  When it works, it's great.
