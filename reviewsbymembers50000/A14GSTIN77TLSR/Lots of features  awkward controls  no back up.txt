 I was looking for a fully featured unit that would still provide a wakeup even with a headset plugged in.  It does this very well.  Sound is just OK and controls are still hard to find, but if you're good at memorizing the physical locations of the important buttons, you should be fine.  One surprise was the lack of a battery backup for power failures, but I guess it may draw too much power in certain configurations (like CD playing) to suppport this.  I liked the clock radio enough to just buy a small UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) but obviously this solution isn't for everyone.
