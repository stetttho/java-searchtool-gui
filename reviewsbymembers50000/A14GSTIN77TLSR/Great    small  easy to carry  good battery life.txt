 I use this mouse with a small laptop for extensive travel.  The size is perfect, and I have large hands, so even the small size is well designed.  It has a nice case, along with a recharging cable that is connected to a USB port.  The cable has standard connectors, so I am also able to charge my Blackberry while traveling.  Very smooth operation and simple to set up.
