 This little router provides easy setup, a low grade firewall with Stateful Packet Inspection (SPI), and easy setup of private IP assignments and a simple way to do port forwarding.  The ability to reserve an IP address for a particular computer is great if you want to set up port forwarding for services like remote access or network video cams.  In Linksys routers, you have to set up a static IP on the computer itself, which can be a real pain for a computer that operates on different networks, a typical use for laptops.  The system log is non-existent, however, which makes it tough to record network problems, which can be very useful when tracking DSL issues, etc.  There is a log, but it is really for security as it tracks access to web sites.  The D-Link DI-524 has a diagnostic log and is less expensive (although no SPI firewall).  Wireless range has been excellent in the units I have used.
