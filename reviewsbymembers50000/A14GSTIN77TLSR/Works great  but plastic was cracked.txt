 Bought this reconditioned unit for another residence after having purchaed and used another DC07, a great vacuum.  Unfortunately, the reconditioned unit is packed differently in such a way which can put stress on the plastic piece that sits in the front of the sweeper unit.  Sure enough, it showed up cracked.  Dyson will not send a replacement for this part, so back to Amazon it goes.  Now I wonder about the long-term durability of this product.  In the meantime, we are enjoying our other Dyson.
