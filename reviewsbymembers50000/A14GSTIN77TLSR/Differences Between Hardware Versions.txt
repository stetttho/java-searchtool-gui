 I have four of these products.  Two are V1 and two V2.  The radio power and sensitivity are better in V2.  However, with V2, I have had difficulties with the serial modem dial backup working, as well as VPN passthrough using another VPN host with the Netgear serving clients.  Netgear tech support has tried to be helpful, but after six weeks has not been able to solve the problems.  As soon as I revert to V1, things are fine.  The trouble is that V2 is the current version.
