 This is a nicely packaged unit which is relatively easy to program.  Unlike some remotes, it is shaped so that you can rest it on your leg while sitting, and it will stay, due to the shape of the bottom of the device.  It also can be placed on a flat surface and has just enough 'tilt' so it can be read easily.  The only issue is that I found the display a little dificult to read due to the limited contrast.  I found I had to use the backlight even in the daytime, but it still wasn't that legible.
