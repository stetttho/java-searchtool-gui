 Got the BEFSX41 to replace a 4-port router without firewall.  The BEFSX41 initially seemed to work fine, but then I updated the firmware as it had firmware over 9 months old new in the box.  The new firmware completely changes the look of the interface, which is fine, but now the box stops functioning every once in awhile.  I can't have the box that is the central point in the network do that, so I'm reverting back to the plain router and will buy a more robust firewall box.  I think they are pushing this box against its limit in order to keep the cost low, but it's just not worth the hassle.
