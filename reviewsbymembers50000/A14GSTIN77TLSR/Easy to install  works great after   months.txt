 I bought this 160 GB unit to augment the internal drive on my computer being used as a network server.  It was so fast, I used the Seagate as the main drive.  I changed the computer out eventually and kept the Seagate and connected it to the new computer without a hitch.  Hopefully it will be reliable, but so far so good.  I do think it's probably important to ensure there is adequate cooling area around the unit.  Excessive heat would likely shorten its life.
