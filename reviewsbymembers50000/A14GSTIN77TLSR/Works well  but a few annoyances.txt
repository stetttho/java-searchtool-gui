 I've been running the BEFSR41 for about a year and for the most part it's worked flawlessly.  However, the DHCP server appears faulty.  Occasionally, I get an IP Conflict when a new computer logs in.  In addition, when looking at the computers that have DHCP-assigned IP addresses (through the administration access), the reporting is almost completely erratic.  For example, almost never are all the computers shown, and refreshing the screen has no effect.  Linksys tech support has verified this is not working properly, but has no solution.  PPoE to log into SBC's DSL works great, and port forwarding is also passable, though you have to assign a static IP to the devive you want to route to (rather than the MAC address or device name), which is a bit of a pain.  Overall, for the price, it works pretty well.
