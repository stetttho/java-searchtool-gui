 Setup goes very well until you try to unplug the Ethernet cable (required to do the initial setup).  At this point, the instructions are unclear or non-existent.  This seems strange because it is a wireless print server.  You would expect almost everyone to use it in wireless mode.  Based on the response from tech support, I suspect they get a lot of calls during the setup for wireless.  Having to install the printserver driver on every PC that is connected to the network is a pain if you have visitors using the network.  It would be nice to at least have the driver available on the network.  Anyway, the 15 minute installation turned into two hours, but it does work well.
