 UPDATE:  I have now installed 10 of these routers for various people.  Normally, it works fine, but if there are issues such as a poor DSL line or certain kinds of radio interference (nearby 2.4 GHz cordless phone), the DI-524 reacts by rebooting to clear errors, I guess.  People who have Cable seem to have fewer problems.  In a couple of cases, the rebooting required me to change to a different router.  So, check the router log carefully in the first few days of operation to ensure you will not have an issue.  Prior review from June 2005:  I have purchased several of these units for friends because they seem to be rock-solid and very well priced.  I don't think a lot of people realize that to get the higher speed (beyond 802.11g 54 Mbps) advertised with higher priced routers that the terminal equipment has to match the router, which of course is almost never the case.  Besides, 54Mbps, even de-rated for real world conditions, is way beyond almost all consumer-grade broadband connections.  The combination of a 4-port wired router with a solid wireless access point at this price is hard to beat.  If you need to do port forwarding for games or remote access, this router is one of the easiest I have seen to set up.  Rather than requiring you to set up the target computer with a fixed IP address, the router allows you to easily assign the MAC address for that computer to a reseved IP assignment on the DHCP server.
