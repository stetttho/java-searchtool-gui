 I spend so much time in book stores looking through photography books that it is rare these days for a book to grab my attention. One flip through this book, and I had to stop for a moment, sit down, and study closely each one of these photos.   The quality of these prints reproduced from large 4 x 5 inch negatives is unbelievable. It is like the first time you saw HD television after watching regular TV all your life.  Cornish's images are moody, often capturing the warm glow of sunrises and late afternoons. Besides each photo, Cornish explains the thought process and planning that was involved. At the end of the book there is a thumbnail of each photograph along the with the film, camera, lens, filter, shutter speed, and aperature used to shoot the photo.   If you are tired of the same old photography books showing the same places you have seen a hundred times over, then this book will knock your socks off.
