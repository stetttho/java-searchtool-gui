 Manil Suri has written this book with a wonderful sense of humor. Each character has their own imperfections and self doubts which are brought into light by Suri's amusing descriptions. There are the feuding women, fed up husbands, socialites, want to be socialites, dreamers, and philosophers. And together they make a web of characters that will amuse you, sadden you, and enlighten you.   The foundation of the story is Vishnu, a homeless man who, as the title indicates, is dead. And in the aftermath, confusions and delusions abound resulting in chaos and further sorrow. It is a perfect summer read.
