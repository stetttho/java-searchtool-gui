 This is a story that will make you believe in God. And so Martel begins his book. Reading such a statement, I certainly had to see if the story is indeed worth such a life altering claim. Martel has cleverly and convincingly brought together a Zebra, a Hyena, an Orangutan, a Tiger, and a boy, on a life boat. Nature's takes over and man and beast are brought to the same common denominator. Who will adapt? Who will survive? How?   It must be said that this book has a deeper meaning I am still resolving. However, since the story kept getting more fantastic and weird, it was all I could do to just keep up with the plot. Martel makes some poignant remarks regarding the search for God and other reviewers have hinted the struggle on the life boat is merely an allegory.  Ultimately, I just enjoyed it because it was a fun and interesting story that was just so bizarre. I still can't believe Martel was able to pull this off.  I hear he is currently working on a novel about an elephant in a submarine.
