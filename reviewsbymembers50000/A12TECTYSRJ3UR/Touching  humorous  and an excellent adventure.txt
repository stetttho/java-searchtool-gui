 Markham's stories of hunting warthogs, stalking elephants, and being "moderately eaten by a lion" are some of the funniest and most vivid stories I have read. I put this book down with a profound regret for having lost so much of the world which she speaks of. My vocabulary is not adequate to describe the humanity and wit with which she has infused this book. So let me quote a few of the passages from this wonderful book so you may decide if you will enjoy her style of prose.  "I know animals more gallant thant the African warthog, but none more courageous...His eyes are small and lightless and capable of but one exression - suspicion. What he does not understand, he suspects, and what he suspects, he fights."  While visiting a dying man in a remote african outpost, she describes the conversation. "His voice was soft and controlled, and very tired. 'It's been four years since I left Nairobi, and there haven't been many letters.' He ran the tip of his tongue over his lips and attempted a smile. 'People forget,' he added. 'It's easy for a whole group of people to forget just one, but if you're very long in a place like this you remember everybody you ever met. You even worry about people you never liked; you get nostalgic about your enemies. It's all something to think about and it all helps.'"  And she goes on to describe his agony. "He will lie in his bed feeling the minutes and hours pass through his body like an endless ribbon of pain because time becomes pain then. Light and darkness become pain; all his senses exist only to receive it, to transmit to his mind again and again, with ceaseless repetition, the simple fact that now he is dying."  And here is her description of the hut the dying man lay in. "Here was poverty - poverty of women to help, poverty of hope, and even of life. For all I knew there might have been handfuls of gold buried in that hut, but if there was, it was the poorest comfort of all."
