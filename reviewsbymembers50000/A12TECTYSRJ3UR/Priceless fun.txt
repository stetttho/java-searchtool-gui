 I bought this on a whim from a local store. At the store, it was hard to tell how bright the frisbee really was. But once it gets dark, this thing glows BRIGHT! I got the red one.   The first time I used it was with some friends playing Ultimate Frisbee on a pitch black night. It flies like a regular frisbee and has good solid feel to it. It was pure fun. We played for hours.   The fun factor I got from this frisbee doubled when I found it also floated and was waterproof. So we had a blast with it while on a camping trip along a lake. For those of you with swimming pools, it should be a fun thing to play with at night.  Then one night at a friend's party someone came across a paintball gun. Naturally we started looking for things to shoot at. He had a huge field behind his house but no targets. So out came my trusty frisbee, which I always carry in my trunk for unexpected occasions such as these. It glowed bright while we spent the night pelting it with shots.  Since it is lit up by an LED, the battery will last for hours. Mine is still working after many hours of use. I highly recommend it. From what I understand the red LED will have a longer battery life than the other colors or the multicolored ones.
