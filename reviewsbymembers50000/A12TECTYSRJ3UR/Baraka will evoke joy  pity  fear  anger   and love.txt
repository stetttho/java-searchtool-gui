 Set to the music of ethnic chants and indigenous instruments from around the world, this film will compel you to see the world in a new light. You'll see beautiful vistas of terraced paddy fields, deserts, and city scapes. You'll see the dances of the aboriginees, african tribes, and amazon Indians. You'll see the faithful praying in places of worship that range from the Vatican to the shores of Ganges. In short you'll see how similar we all are beneath our different wardrobes and languages and faiths.    The score to the movie complements the scenes and intensifies the emotions one feels watching the movie. Particularly haunting are the scenes of burning oil fields in Kuwait set to the music of Scottish bagpipes, Tibetan water music, and Japanese drumming. The movie explores love, faith, joy, war, death, rebirth and circle of life by showing scenes from around the world for each of these topics. Each time I have watched this movie I find myself discovering more of its hidden meanings. I think each viewer will come out with his own feelings and interpretations. But even if one isn't inclined to be philosophical, the music and cinematography alone is worth getting the DVD.
