 This book is the best series of landscape photos I have seen. I almost thought I heard angels singing arias in the background while looking at these images. Such is their profound and moving beauty. Besides Steve McCurry's South Southeast, this is the only book I have seen where the publisher did not skimp on the paper and the printing. The colors and the sharpness are perfect. The book is divided into five sections based on the climate. The Arctic and the Rainforest were two of them. Some of the images are surreal (salt flats) while others were poetic (the curves in dunes). All of them made me stare in wonder, and I have made a resolution to see some of these places before they are lost to development.  The best part about this book for aspiring photographers is in the back. Here there is a thumbnail of each picture in the book with a note from Art Wolfe explaining the environment and the methods he used to photograph the scene. Included are details such as the camera, lens, film, shutter speed, and aperture settings that were used. I sat mesmerized staring at the photos and then reading the technical details on how he captured the image.  If you are an budding landscape photographer, this book is fuel for your aspiration. Or if you just plain love nature scenes, this book will make your love for nature deeper.
