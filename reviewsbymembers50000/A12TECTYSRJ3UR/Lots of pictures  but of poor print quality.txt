 There are many wonderful and insightful portraits in this collection. Sadly though, the publishers skimmed on the printing and left this book sadly wanting in quality. However, the photos show an impressive breadth of society. From a child monk in saffron leaning against a stoop in Angkor Wat to a machete weilding farmer in Philippines, McCurry lays before us the depth of humanity. For the low price of under [money], it is a good deal. But only three stars for the small postcard size pages and poor print quality.
