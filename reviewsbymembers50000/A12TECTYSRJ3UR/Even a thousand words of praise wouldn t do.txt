 While browsing through the bookstore today, I came across this treasure. I sat down expecting just another book of photos like you usually see in the Time Life books. But what I saw in those pages is not possible to accurately describe. Page after page of large 12"*16"? photos of incredible colors, hues, richness, and emotion. I realized after a while I wasn't merely looking at the pictures. I felt I had stepped into the photo, getting wet in the rain...being blasted by a dust storm...listening to temple prayers... I love photography books and have seen dozens of them. But none compares to the quality and detail of these photos. All the photos are the same enormous size, making it that much easier to be drawn in to the lands of South Southeast.
