 If you expect a candy coated fantasy story where everything comes out allright in the end - then run away. If you expect a book which will put everything into plain English and use correct grammar - then run away. If you expect a story that is morally and religiously proper, again, I plead you to run away. However, if you are inclined to read books which portray the reality and darker side of every society, then read this. I grew up in this land where Ms. Roy's book is set. What she speaks of is the truth, which apparently, many reviewers can't handle. Her style of writing is beautiful, unique, fragmented, and awesome. Time jumps back and forth, but any reader who's paying attention can easily keep track. I enjoyed this book partucularly due to Roy's inventive and creative style of writing and her sense of irony. At times the writing is so stunning, it'll make you wonder how a person learns to be so fluid and imaginative.
