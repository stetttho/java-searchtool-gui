 This book is dense. Make no mistake about it. It is a tough jungle of thick, and often, obscure words. But pay the price of patience, and your imagination is in for a wild treat. You will meet snake charmers and pickle barons, you will be bombed by fruits and spittoons, you will, in short, be taken on a ride of unprcedented weirdness.  I abhor giving too much of the plot away, since part of the magic of this book is the wild and unpredictable turns that constantly keeps a reader on edge. But suffice to say, it is the story of Saleem Sinai, a midnight child, born at the moment of India's Independance, and therefore, absolutely and irrevocably tied to his nation's events. He will be your guide. Follow him, if you are ready to take your imagination on an uncontrolable roller coaster of sights, sounds, and ESPECIALLY smells!
