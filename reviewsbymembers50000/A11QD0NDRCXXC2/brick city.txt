 redman has done again what he does so well. he's combined a variety of beats and lyrics to create an outstanding album. some of the best songs would have to be diggy doc, the first single let's get dirty, bricks two which features a variety of talented underground rappers, and soopaman luva 5 (pt. 2) which features reggie noble's twisted storytellin at its best. redman produces many songs himself choosing beats which go perfectly with the moods of the songs. now to the downfalls. redman is one of the best emcee's of all time. but why does he have all these rappers featured on his album? no one can flow at redman's level. some of the guests are good like those on real n****z and bricks 2. but what the heck is missy elliott doin on here? another downfall are the skits. they're funny the first time, but you'll be forced to skip throught them all of your listens after the first. redman has dropped another dope album but hopefully  next time he will provide more rappin and less actin.
