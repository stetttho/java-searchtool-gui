 nelly's debut album was very impressive. the only parti didn't like is that most of his songs don't really make sense and he doesn't stick to one main topic. the songs i think he really flowed well on are luven me and utha side. utha side is my favorite track because it was an unexpected surprise about livin hard knock and about hooes and hustlrers. as for beats they're not the best in the world but they're not horrible. they're mostly bass. my favorite beat is the eerie flute on tho dem wrappas. as for choruses and hooks everyone on here is catchy. my favorite is the st. louie hook. my top 5 songs would have to be utha side, ride with me, st. louie, luven me, and batter up. i hope they don't play ride with me to death on the radio like the other 2 singles ei and country grammar. nelly has a lot of originality too almost singin his lyrics.if u like hiphop and don't analyze lyrics too much pick this album up. peace out.
