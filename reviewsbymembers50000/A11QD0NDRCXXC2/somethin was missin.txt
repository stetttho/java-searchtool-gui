 aight i got my handz on this hot new joint from black rob. all the online reviewerz r givin it 5 stars and even the source thinkz it'z an awesome album. i open up the package pop the cd in and expect a whole great album. i was pretty much wrong.only a limited amount of hot jointz appear on tha album. there were a lot of backup rnb singaz which i didn't really enjoy hearin. there wuz some dope stuff on here tho. some tight trackz include espacio, whoa!, thug story, and br. the rest is semigood. i expected a lil more out of this album tho. evry1'z comparin it 2 biggie so i dunno what to think. biggie was a much smoother lyricist. this is still the best thing bad boy'z put out in a really long time. black rob tried but i wasn't feelin it.
