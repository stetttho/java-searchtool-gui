 forget all the bleek haters. some say he wouldn't be nething without jigga.well they're all wrong cuz he'd be just as well off by himself. almost every song on here has a killa beat and dope lyrics. the only songs which i wouldn't give 5 stars are all types of s***, everyday, and in my life. the latter 2 feature rNb beats which don't sound tight with memph's voice. my favorites r is that your chick and bounce b****. bounce b**** has a headnoddin beat and i think memph flows best on this track. is that your chick has a beat by timbaland so u know its dope and has fast rappin by jay-z and twista. my 2 favorite verses are beanie sigel's on change up which features 3 different beats,and twistas on is that your chick because he spits so fast. memph also has some memorable verses like the 1st on P.Y.T.(pretty young thing) and his verses on we get low. my favorite thing about memph is the expression he uses in his rapping switching tones often. this cd is a rocafella classic. i would say its up there with volume 2 hard knock life. newayz if u like dope beats and flow with lots of expression cop this album.
