 the nutty professor 2 album is really good. it had a good combination of rNb and hiphop. the best hiphop song is either the hilarious duo of eminem and redman on off the wall or let me be by eve. memphis bleek outshines jigga and amil on hey papi and even if by method man is classic wu-tang. my only dissapointment in the hiphop area is im gonna crawl by dmx because the lyrics are stupid. as for rNb my favorite is do you remeber by montell jordan. i usually don't appreciate rNb but this is a perfect song about how it was back in the day. rNb dissapointments are just friends by sonny because its bluesy and boring,and thong song uncensored. foxy brown adds nothing to this already horrible song in fact making it worse. most of the beats are either bass or keyboard tho timbaland provides a funky guitar beat and shorty101's song has more of a pop beat. if u like hiphop and rNb in general pick this album up. peace out.
