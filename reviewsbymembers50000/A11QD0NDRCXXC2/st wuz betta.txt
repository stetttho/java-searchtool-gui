 ja's 1st album was betta. it was more gangsta rap than soul rap. this time it's soul rap. ja's vocal tone doesn't sound right with it and only a couplejoints on here are worth listenin too. there are only 12 real songs on here not countin skits. the best songs are one of us, die, 6 feet underground, and between me and you. the best skit is i'll f___ u girl. the otha 3 skits including intro r dumb. i like gangsta rap betta than soul rap but if u enjoy ja's old style don't get this album. u'll be dissapointed. if u like soul rap u'll enjoy the new ja rule. i personaally enjoyed the 1st much more.
