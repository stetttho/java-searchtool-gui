 This Ludacris album is awesome! the beatz were bangin from beginnin to end. some of my favorties were PHAT RABBIT, WHAT'S YOUR FANTASY, STICK EM UP, and HO! these tracks are all tight with good beatz and dope lyrics by ludacris. ugk and ludacris make an awesome collaboration on stick em up. look out for more releasesa ferom def jam south and pick up this ill album.
