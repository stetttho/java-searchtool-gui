 This is an off da hook cd. almost ALL the songz r good. my favorites are the clubhit HOLLA HOLLA, WORLD'S MOST DANGEROUS, DADDY'S LITTLE BABY, and IT'S MURDA. My favorite though is ONLY BEGOTTN SON! it's the most surprising song on the cd about ja's father who if u din't know left him. the erick sermon joint E-DUB AND JA is another outstanding song and i never really felt erick sermon like the other2 def squad members but erick shines on this song. i haven't got ja's new joint yet but when it comes out i'll have it. do urself a favor and pick dis joint up. peace
