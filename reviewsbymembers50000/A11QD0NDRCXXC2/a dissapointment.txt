 rugged xzibit is one of my favorite rappers. he always keeps it to thestreets. well at least he used to. now all of his lyrics seem watereddown and childish. the only songs i think he flows well on are kennyparker show 2001, double time, and best of things. there are some nicebeats on here tho. there are some straightdown westcoast beats like onloud & clear, and best of things, and then there's the moreuptempo beats such as those on alkoholik... The major dissapointmentis his song with snoop. on b please they both flowed so smooth but ond.n.a. it just sounds like a jumbled mess. almost every song lacks acatchy chorus.  most of theguests don't prove themselves at all. thesongs with other good westcoast rappers such as rimz & tirez andloud & clear are ruined by horrible vocals on the choruses bykokane and butch cassidy. if u r a former xzibit fan and r expectinflow like he had on b please u will be dissapointed. i reccomend thiscd to hardcore westcoast fans but not newcomers to westcoast hiphop orrap music in general. peace out.
