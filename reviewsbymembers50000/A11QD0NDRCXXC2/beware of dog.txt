 lil bow wow proves he has talent on this cd. his only weakness is he can't write his own lyrics.as an emcee bow wow lacks originality and creativity considering jermaine dupri writes his lyrics. but i'll give bow wow respect because jermaine dupri cannot execute his own lyrics as well as bow wow can. the songs which really stand out on this cd are bow wow (that's my name) and this playboy. the guesty appearances on this cd are all great and all add to the cd. the r.o.c. is my favorite because of all the similes and metaphors he uses. the beats on this cd are all good mostly keyboard like on the dog in me or basss like on you already know. my favorite beat is on bow wow ( that's my name) which uses bass violin and dj scratching. if this cd was longer it would also be better. 30-40 minutes just isn't enough. if u wanna hear a curse free hiphp talent cop this cd. peace out.
