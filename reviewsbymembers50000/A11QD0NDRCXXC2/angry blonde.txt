 this book was less than i expected it to be. i expected more insight from slim shady on why he wrote his songs, and expected some other songs analyzed such as stan which he left off. i liked some of the freestyle and more underground lyrics that were printed in here because i had never heard some of these songs and they have awesome lyricism. another good thing about this book is that the pictures are top-notch. they showcase a lot more quality than those u find anywhere else. also i found slim shady repeating why he wrote lots of his songs a lot which was a negative.mostly he said he was in a bad time and had been takin too many pills. if u can't understand slim shady or wanna hear lyrics from dope underground freestyles pick this up. also if u want fantastic pictures pick this up too. but if u are expectin lots of detail insight from slim shady u won't appreciate this book. peace out.
