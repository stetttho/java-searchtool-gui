 this is a fine combination of the finest and latest work pun has done. you have your classics like deep cover 98, off the books, and still not a player, but you also have unreleased masterpieces like how we roll and brave in the heart. despite having limited work to choose from, the people who decided on these songs did a great job. the latin guitar and bass beats are excellent, but my favorite beat is off the books eerie flute loop. the posse cuts like wishful thinking and fire water are all good because it's pun spitting with a variety of taleneted artists. the words from pun's close friends are also nice because you can see how they react to the "latin that went platinum's" death. this is the final work you'llbe able to pick up from this incredible lyricist and i advise everybody, rap fan or not, to pick this up.
