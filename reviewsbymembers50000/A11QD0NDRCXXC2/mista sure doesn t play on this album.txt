 this is, without a doubt, the greatest album to ever drop from the dirty south. for anyone who thought pat was a one- hit wonder with chickenhead, u thought wrong! this cd features your down south chants such as we ain't scared ho, north, north, and break da law 2001, but  thankfully also includes some slower more mellow dirty south music like life we live. pat also demonstrates great storytellin techniques on songs such as we can get gangsta and aggravated robbery. pat even goes as far as to include multiple beats on a single song. project pat combines catchy choruses such as ooh nuthin and if you ain't from my hood, with lyrical brilliance such as on chesse and dope and don't save her. i'd reccomend this album to any fan of hiphop in general.
