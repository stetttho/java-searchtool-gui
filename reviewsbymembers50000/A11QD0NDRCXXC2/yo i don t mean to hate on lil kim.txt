 yo i don't mean to hate on lil kim but it's just her lyrics r so wack. i  mean if u a lady u might like hearin bout male parts the whole song but  afta a while it gets nasty. her hit song no matter what they say is the  best song by far. it's just that's the only song that i can stand listenin  to besides who's #1. hey and this goes out to notorious: REST IN PEACE  PLAYA. peace out.
