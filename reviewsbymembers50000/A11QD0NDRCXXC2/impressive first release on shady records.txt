 eminem has done it again. although this time with assistance from 5 other talented emcee's, eminem truly stands out as the most talented in the group. the only rapper i think is not talented in d-12 is bizarre, because the comments he makes are so crazy they come off more as psychotic than funny. bizarre also has a lazy voice and is unable to ezecute his lyrics.  every song on here is good from the first single "purple pills" to the limp-bizkit dissing "girls." my favorite is "fight song" which has spectacular guitar and great emceeing. all the beats are bangin with guitar, bass, and synthesizer mostly produced by slim shady himself, althought dre also adds to the production. the skits were also good especially the obie trice freestyle. anyways, a nice first release on shadys records and proves theres more talent in detroit than just slim shady.
