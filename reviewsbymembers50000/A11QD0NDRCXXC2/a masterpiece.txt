 i don't c how u could not give this cd 5 stars. it is bangin from beginnin to end. lil zane switches styles between rappin fast and average often which makes it interesting. he uses rnb choruses like on callin me, ways of the world, and u must really love me. he also uses chant choruses like on what's up and top down. he uses all kinds of beats with horns, bass, piano, and latin style music. his main topics are high livin on songs like all about the fun, hard knock life on songs like beautiful feelin, songs about gettin women like what must i do, and songs about dough like m.o.n.e.y. my 2 favorite songs are the chanting what's up, and the song which has the best flow we ain't the one. my favorite song just to listen to the lyrics is beautiful feeling tho it has a horrible chorus. there is a bonus track that is pretty tight too. i think its called don't f with us. if u wanna hear a frresh new sound of hiphop cop this cd.
