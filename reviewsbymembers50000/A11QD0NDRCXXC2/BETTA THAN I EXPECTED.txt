 i think beanie sigel is a very talented mc. his rap has meaning to it. i bought this lp 4 no track in particular.i just thought i'd explore anotha memba of tha rocafella crew. well beanie sigel is 10 times better than fake jay-z and is 2 times better than memphis bleek and is 9 times better than amil. he shines as an individual and his collaboration with otha philly-native eve on remember them days is awesome. him and memphis bleek hook up 4 a good song and his solos pac man and the truth r good. in the bonus track jay-z actually makes up some clever meaningful rhymes the 1st verse is dedicated to his homies, the 2nd to his mom, and the 3rd to his nephew. jay-z is actually good on this song. go out and get this lp because it really is the truth!
