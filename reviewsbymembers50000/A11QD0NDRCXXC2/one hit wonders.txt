 i bought this lp 4 no pigeonz xpectin there to be otha good stuff on here. but o was i in 4 a surprise. it was simply horrible.cheapskate was the only othere song i could manage to listen to. sporty thievs are not lyricists and cannot pick beatz whatsoever. i'll admitit maybe this review is a bit harsh but they trul deserveit. they're a disgrace to rap. they remind me of the queer weird al yankovic jockin off otha songs. do urself a favor. DON'T BUY THIS TRASH AND IF U DO U'LL REGRET IT!
