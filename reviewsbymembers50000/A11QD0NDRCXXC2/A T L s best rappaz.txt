 this cd is so tight. the only song that i think coulda been done a little better is the last song stankonia. evrything else is really good tho. outkasty raps with meaning instead of just spittin out the 1st wordz that come to their head. they also have some tight smooth stuff on here that with otha rappaz would sound terrible. some favoritez include i'll call b4 i come, so fresh so clean, gasolinedreams, b.o.b, and ms. jackson. if u haven't heard ms. jackson on the radio u should buy this cd becauze the lyrics actually mean somethin and it has a good beat. a combination of big boi's fast paced rappin and andre 3000'z vocal tone equalz the best cd i've heard in a while. peace out.
