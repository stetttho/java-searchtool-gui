 snoop dogg made a smart move in leavin no limit. he didn't sound as good with the dirty south style and can now get back to make classic westcoast hits. the beats on this album are as west coast as they come. all the police sirens whistles bass and keyboards that come wth westcoast music are definitely there. go away has the best beat and sounds kinda like the beat off b please. anotha good beat is the timbaland set it off beat which sounds like the rappers make it with their own mouths. as for rappin this has the best lyricism of the year. snoop dogg spits all kinds of similes and metaphors with his clever rhymin. you can even catch him singin on some of the songs. kokane appears on 8 tracks. his vocals get kind of annoyin but on songs such as hennesey n buddah and brake fluid he really adds to the song. eve does a superb job on ready to ryde. other good guestsare suga free mc ren and lady of rage. if ur a fan of westcoast hiphop and or u just like hiphop pick up this dope album. this is one of the best cds of 2000. peace out.
