 this cd is tha illeset rap compilation to come out in a while. some of tha  key songs include cherz cherz la ghost, got beef?, and b please. i think b  please is the best overall track with it's catchy beat and xzibit's and  snoop's combined flow. forgot about dre is also a good song. i would  reccomend this cd to ne1 who likes urban music
