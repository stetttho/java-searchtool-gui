 when you combine too of hiphop's best most energetic and talented emcee's you should have a classic album right? well this album isn't classic but it's not terrible. i think only about half of red and meth's talents are shown here. on tracks like mi casa and 1,2,1,2 both are not lyrically present and sound tired. some of the highlights of this cd are the hilarious cerial killer, da rockwilder which had awesome bass but should've been longer, tear it off where both lyricists provide a ton of energy, and the ? which has a catchy high-pitched vocals in the background. the beats are primarily keyboards and bass. some of the best are on 1,2,1,2 which has awesome dj scratching, cereal killer which has a classic wu-tang beat, and fire in tha hole which has funny cannons in the background. the 2 rappers should've been emcee enough for blackout and guests weren't needed. also why are there old tracks on this cd? it's a true sign of laziness when you include old already released tracks on a new cd. the tracks aren't bad but i was expecting new material. if you are a former fan of eitheremcees you'll be dissapointed but still should pick this up for the few memorable moments. peace out.
