 this is one of the most original albums of 2001. the lunatics have all their own slang and an original way to present their lyrics. the lyrics may not be very deep nor meaningful, but they are fun to listen to because of the expression and accents the lunatics posess. nelly doesn't outshine his lunatic crew, and murphy lee seems to be the most talented lunatic. my favorite songs were the murphy solo scandalous, summer in the city, the brian mcknight featured groovin tonight, and the nelly solo here we come which sounds like a faster-paced version of e.i.  the beats are all bangin from beginning to end with bass and keyboard. if there is a downfall to this album besides the meaningless lyrics, it would have to be the lack of presence of city spud. you may remember him from "ride with me" from nelly's country grammar. he only appears on one song. this album proves there's more to the st. louis rap scene than just nelly, and hopefully we'll enjoy solo joints dropped by each of the lunatic's talented members in the near future.
