 this is a grat ep from the hilarious gimme that nutt to down 2 tha last roach. evry song is blessed with eazy's unique vocal skills, and he really shines on this ep. he was a tru compton g. the only man who stayed true to him was mc yella. dr.dre turned on eazy when eazy was the man who made dr.dre. snoop dogg is tight today bu ti will never c him as a true g cuz he hated on eazy.eazy kept it real his whole life. if u din't know, he died of AIDS. the whole g-funk thang was started by eazy not dre. RIP EAZY!
