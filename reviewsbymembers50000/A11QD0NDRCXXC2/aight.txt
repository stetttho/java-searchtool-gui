 odb mmakes a bizarre performance on this album. got yourmoney is the best track by far. this track got the cd 5out of 5 stars but some of odb's bizarre rhymes bring it down. odb was probably smokin while makin this album so it sounds good for how high he probly was. i think he should be allowed outta prison. he couldn't have commited all of those crimes. anyway the cd is funny but odb is not a lyrical genius. peace out
