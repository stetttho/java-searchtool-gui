 this new ruff ryder compilation is ill. da best song is twista and drag-on on twisted heat. they both spit flame over some tight beats from swizz. anotha good song is ww3. snoop dogg and scarface join yung wun and jadakiss tomake this tight track. da method man and redamn joint is hot too. kiss shows he can flow without fellow lox membaz sheek and styles. my name is kiss is a very unique song where kiss slows it down and really tells whats on his mind. the only song i don't like is parle's it's going down tonight. i don't think parleis very talented at singing. the trick daddy joint is tight and yung wun's screamin tops off thesong. o ya did i mention the skit i'm an h-o-e? this is tthe funniest tthing i've heardsince the late eazy-e's gimmie that nutt. newayz pick this joint up right here. it's betta than tha 1st ruff ryder compilation. u won't be dissapointed.
