 question:can jay-z still take it to the streets to like he used to? answer: not on this lp! big pimpin watch me and snoopy track are the only good songs onthe cd. the rest with the exception of s.carter is trash. not as good beats from jay hovah and his rocafella crew as i expected.texas boyz ugk hold it down on the track big pimpin. juvenile's funky chorus on snoopy track and dr. dre's clever rhymes on watch me r what make the cd not jay-z's lame rhymes. i used to consider him one of the greatest mc's ever but fame's gotten to his head. only the guests on this cd can save him. roc la familia i can already tell isn't gonna be much betta. don't waste ur money on this unless u want some lame rhymes with even lamer beats.
