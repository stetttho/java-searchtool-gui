 this cd is almost classic although it is totally outshined by the first collection. there are 4 new tracks on here plus a couple classics such as the all good, the western-like ghetto cowboy, and the 2pac callaboration on thug love. as for the new tracks weedman is the best with all bizzy's unique flow combined with great vocals on the chorus. this cd i wish could've been a little longer because there are is more bone talent than is recognized on here. a very weak song is the horrible can't give it up remix. there is an electric guitar and all the rappers are off beat. the other remixes are all good though the originals were better. my favorite song is change the world because its very meaningful. all the words bind together to form a strong sense of peace in your ming. as for beats they're all good and bassy. an example of a great beat is ghetto cowboy with its western harmonica and great sound effects, and a horrible beat is on the can't give it up remix with a horrible electric guitar. if u like bone thugs at all  or you wanna hear some fast verses spit where u can still understand the words pick this up. peace out.
