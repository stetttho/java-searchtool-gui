 big pun is possibly my favorite latino rapper of all time. this album is mostly good but a few weak tracks bring it down from acertain 5 to a 4. the tracks i didn't particularly enjoy are the bizarre leather face, and wrong ones which could've had a lot better production. now to the good side of the cd. the hardcore off wit his head is a great track, the collaboration with m.o.p. on n.y. giants is sure to keep heads nodding, andms. martin is another great song and u might recognize remy martin as big pun's wife. but my overall favorite is you was wrong. drag-on, the fromerlyy weak  fat joe, pun, and remy martin all spit fine verses. the beats which i thought were spectacular were the guitar on watch those, the island-latino beat on 100%, and the ancient chinese beat on ms. martin. if u have any respect for big pun and all his accomplishments pick this up. peace out.
