 this cd is the worst thing the artist known as trick daddy had ever put his name on. first up, it's not a trick daddy album. he's noteven on half the songs. he only has 1 solo track the weak i'm a thug where he tries to use a little kid chorus to draw attention to his lousy rhymes but fails. trick only succeeds in pleasing me with amerika where he finally gets into his real flow zone. the rest of the slip n slide crew besides society fails to represent. the worst by far is the mystikal jock-off migraine. the hotness and for all my ladies are the best tracks by far. trina's pull over remix fails to please considering the cut out the original best verse... the old school beat is somewhat accurate tho. there are hot beats throughout the album no doubt... but the lyricism is sure as hell not there. for example noodle has a bangin bass beat sure to rock any system, but the rappin is just a bunch of mumblin and cussin. society is the only person besides trick that is creative with his lyrics. the deuce poppi sampler has one good song hich begins about 3 minutes in. be sure to check this sample out. beside about 3 or 4 songs this album is garbage. i reccomend this to no1. even if u r a hardcore trick fan be warned this is not a real trick daddy album....
