 Vocalist Sherri Huffman does a wonderful job singing these classics.  We received this CD as a gift and we play it every day for our son.  This is far more enjoyable than all the Baby Mozart, etc. CD's that are so popular currently.  Of course we have those too, but this is one CD that is enjoyable for parents as well.  Some of the songs we had never heard before, but they are lovely, such as Lavender Blue and All the Pretty Little Horses.
