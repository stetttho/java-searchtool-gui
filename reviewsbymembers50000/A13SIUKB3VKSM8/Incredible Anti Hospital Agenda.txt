 I had been recommended this book to educate myself on what type of practices I might expect at the hospital.  I think most pregnant women already hope to minimize the amount of intervention during labor and delivery without all the scare tactics of this book.    Some bits of information were indeed helpful, and will arm the reader with questions for their medical provider on why certain options should or should not be employed (episiotomy, epidural, etc.) However, the tone is the book is so shrill and stridently anti-hospital that you come away with the impression that if the only safe and "right" way pregnant woman should give birth is to do a home delivery with a midwife.  Frankly, that's limiting a woman's choices rather than empowering her to make decisions.  Instead, I recommend people read Birthing From Within.
