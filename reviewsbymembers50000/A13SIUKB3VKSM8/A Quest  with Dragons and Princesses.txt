 This is not your usual light-hearted medieval romance.  With her customary style, Ms. Kinsale penned a rich and complex tale involving Princess Melanthe and her loyal knight, Ruck.   Melanthe is the widow of a powerful Italian lord, and is a woman greatly desired for her wealth and land.  So desirable that she is the object of great obsession to a competing Italian noble, Gian Navona who believes he will wed her. Ms. Kinsale employs the device that many romance authors use--create such an amazing hero that even the most unlovable heroine can be forgiven.  This was true with her brilliant Flowers from the Storm and her less stellar but still engaging Prince of Midnight.  (I adored Leda, the heroine from the beautifully written Shadow and the Star!) Melanthe is positively unlikeable.  She has been warped by a lifetime of deceit.  Her words and actions are often cold and cruel.  It's easy to see why she loves and needs Ruck, as he is ever steadfast, handsome and strong.  She is clingy, petulant and secretive when she is not being dismissive and haughty. It's often less clear what makes her desirable to him.  If you believe in destiny, then Ruck's 13 years of fascination with with after one glance makes sense.  He is the embodiment of the noble hero, and like a Templar in that he has been celibate in deed since his wife went to the nunnery. Worthy sideplots involve Alleghretto and Donna Cara, members of Princess Melanthe's retinue.  After a lengthy sabbatical from writing (7 years!), Ms. Kinsale returns with Alleghretto's own tale to be released summer of 2004.
