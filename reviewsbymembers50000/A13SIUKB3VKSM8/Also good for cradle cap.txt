 Our son had the most horrible case of cradle cap.  The pediatrician's office suggested this cream.  Don't be fooled by the photo, the jar is very small, but the salve is very concentrated.  The texture and color looks like vaseline, but actually is much thinner when spread on, and absorbs easier.  There is only the faintest smell, and not mediciney either.  The ingredients contain shea butter and calendula.    It has really helped with the cradle cap, severely diminishing the horrible weeping/scaling/flakiness of the condition.
