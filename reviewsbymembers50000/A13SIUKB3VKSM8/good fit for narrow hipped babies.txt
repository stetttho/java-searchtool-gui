 When our son was born, he was 8 lbs, 6 oz, and Pampers Swaddlers Newborn fit him very well.  After two weeks, the baby was 9.5 lbs and had outgrown newborn size. The Swaddlers size 1 were not a good fit, too low waisted for him and had a leaking problem.  The Huggies Size 1 baby shaped with gigglastic waistband had elastic in the back so they were better at containing the contents.  Fewer leaks, though still some urine leaks.  Never a blowout leak.  The one gripe - the velcro tabs stick to his fleece sleeper sack so occasionally you have to check to make sure the diaper is still secure.  Caution - the diapers appear too small to last up to 14 lbs despite the labeling of 8-14 lbs.
