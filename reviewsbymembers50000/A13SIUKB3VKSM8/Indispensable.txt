 This is Ms. Begoun's 5th Edition of her beauty guide.  I first purchased the 4th edition a few years ago and found it truly invaluable so I happily forked over the money to buy the 5th Edition the moment it was published. The guide reviews virtually every beauty brand you have ever seen, and then each of their major product offerings from department store giants like Estee Lauder to drugstore labels like Jane.  The book is arranged with the brands alphabetically, and then a 1 to 3 page overview of the brand and its product history.  The "reviews" of each product are extremely brief, rated with a smiley face, neutral face or frowning face followed by just a few lines reviewing the product.  Some of Ms. Begoun's reviews are very analytical, with a discussion of the chemical ingredients whereas others are very flippant, "if you believe this claim then I've got a bridge to sell you" type remarks. By far the most useful aspects to me were the introductory chapters on skincare, namely sunscreen protection and the cleansing regimen.  After reading those chapters, I felt better armed to find a complete UV sunscreen that would provide more protection for my skin.  Even better, I added BHA (salicylic acid) to my regimen and I've had amazingly clear skin ever since. since this worthwhile purchase, I have recommended the regimen from it to many of my friends.  This book purchase (both 4th edition and 5th edition) paid for itself many times over.
