 Foams nicely in the tub, rinses away cleanly.  Skin isn't left with any film.  Instead, your skin is left very soft and with a good scent.  Falling in love smells sweet and relaxing, and makes me think of cotton candy.  The large bottle lasts quite a while as a bath gel but goes considerably quicker if you choose to use it as a shower gel.  Recommend you use it with a loofah in the shower.
