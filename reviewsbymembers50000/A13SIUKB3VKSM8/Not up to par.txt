 I was looking forward to this book since the last couple were so disappointing and I knew that Ms. Palmer could do better. Matt Caldwell is an unfeeling, insensitive, unobservant and cruel man.  It's hard to see  the charm in loving a man like that.  After thoroughly crushing and  demoralizing the female protagonist (who of course, has been traumatized by  a man before), Caldwell then shows remorse.  His regret then mysteriously  transforms him into Mr. Tender & Caring.  She forgives without a  whimper.  Pretty hard to swallow.   Despite my disappointment with the  story line, I saw glimpses of the old Palmer style her fans know and love.
