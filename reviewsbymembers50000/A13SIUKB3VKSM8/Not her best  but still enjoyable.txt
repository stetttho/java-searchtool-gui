 Nora Roberts takes the reader back to the glorious setting of Ireland.  The dialogue is earthier than in her previous works, but the warmth of her characters still shines through.   Ms. Roberts writes so vividly of Ireland that I am transported whenever I read any of her "Born" series and this one is no different. Unfortunately, Jude seems to be virtually  identical in personality to the fragile, insecure Rowan of Enchanted.  Also, her  external manner seems recycled from Dr. Griffin in Inner Harbor.   Still, Ms. Roberts is a master storyteller and despite the annoying heroine, the ensemble and setting are delightful.   I  look forward to reading more about Darcy and Shawn in the rest of the  series.
