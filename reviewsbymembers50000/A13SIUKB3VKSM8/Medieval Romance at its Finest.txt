 I was delighted to discover Madeline Hunter.  By Possession is the first of several rich and complex novels set in the middle ages.  Addis de Valence has returned from the Crusades, and with the purpose of reclaiming his birthright and to claim his son.  Moira Falkner rejoices at his return, but it is a bittersweet happiness because she is a lowborn bondswoman and can never be Addis's wife.  Addis and Moira's love story unfolds with warmth and entices the reader under Ms. Hunter's skillful hand. Ms. Hunter plays on the timeless Cinderella relationship between a noble born person and a commoner.  I was completely immersed in the the story between Addis and Moira as they struggled against societal dictates and personal desires. Other characters emerge in By Possession that you will find in Ms. Hunter's subsequent novels, By Design and By Arrangement.
