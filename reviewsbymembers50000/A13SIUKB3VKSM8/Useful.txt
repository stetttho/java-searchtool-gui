 I was very disappointed to discover that the 16 year old book had NOT been updated in any way, other than a new cover and 1 page preface.  The photos are outdated and the wedding portion does not have any of the new cake  decorating techniques such as rolled fondant.  At the very least, I  expected updated photos. However, the recipes look wonderful and the tips  on entertaining for different sized groups are helpful.  The frugal shopper  may wish to simply purchase a used copy of the old version of Entertaining  on the auction site since it's EXACTLY the same.
