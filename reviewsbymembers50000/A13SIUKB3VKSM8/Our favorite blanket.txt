 It's pretty cold out lately, and this has become our favorite blanket.  It's thick and warm, as well as being large enough to be useful.  We always grab it on our way out the door to cover the baby in the car seat with.  It's held up well through the washings so far, and is still super soft.  Highly recommend as a shower gift.
