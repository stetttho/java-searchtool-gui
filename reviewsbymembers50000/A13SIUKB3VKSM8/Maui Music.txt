 This CD is extremely mellow, with slow-paced Hawaiian tunes that transport the listener right to Maui. The bandmembers are three guys, Kahi Kaonohi (Bass, Lead Vocals, Background Vocals), Bobby Moderow, Jr. (Lead Vocals, Background Vocals, Rhythm and Slack-Key Guitars) and Bruce Spencer (Ukulele, Lead Vocals, Background Vocals). My favorite song on the album is a lullaby, the 2nd track - Baby Kalae. Most listeners will recognize and enjoy the Maunalua's rendition of "Teach Your Children." One of the best purchase decisions ever. The lyrics are a mixture of Hawaiian and English. I wish I understood the Hawaiian but even though I don't, it doesn't take away from my enjoyment of the tunes. Everytime I play the album, I picture myself sipping Mai Tais and relaxing. Mahalo.
