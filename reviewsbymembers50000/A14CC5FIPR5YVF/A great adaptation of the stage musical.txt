 Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber's and Tim Rice's musical telling of the life of Eva Peron successfully makes the leap from stage to screen.  Alan Parker ably directs a fine cast, which includes Antonio Banderas as Ch, Jonathan Pryce as Juan Peron, and Madonna as Eva Peron.  The acting and the voice work are very good, and Madonna surprises you with her talent. The music is equally wonderful, keeping the rock opera feel of the original stage show.  Also, the new song "You Must Love Me," written by Sir Andrew and Tim Rice, flows nicely with the original music and won a deserved Academy Award for Best Original Song. Costumes, acting, sets, visuals and music all combine to create a great movie experience.  A note of caution to some, though: this is sung through with very little spoken dialoque.  I remember seeing this in the theater and listening to some people complain about it and walk out of the movie.  Stick with it, and you will definitely enjoy it!!
