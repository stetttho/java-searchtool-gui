 Who knew Robbie Williams would do such a great job with traditional jazz/pop standards?!  His voice is a perfect match with the traditional arrangements, and he gives much humor and class to all the songs.  My favorites are "Well, did You Evah" (a duet with Joh Lovitz) and "Somethin' Stupid" (a duet with Nicole Kidman).  With "It Was a Very Good Year," Williams sounds like a young Frank Sinatra. All the tracks are great on this album.  Many artists would have tried to update the songs, to give them a modern, poppy or dance feel.  I applaud Williams for keeping them as they are supposed to be.   His work pays off.  This is one good album!
