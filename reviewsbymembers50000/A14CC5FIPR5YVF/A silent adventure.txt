 Kay Hoog finds a message in a bottle floating near San Francisco.  The message tells about a hidden Incan city filled with gold and gives the location for finding it.  Intrigued, Kay tells his yacht club that he's going to find it.  Later,  Lia Sha, also a member of the club and the mysterious Spiders, steals the map and sets off for Peru, with Kay not far behind. Thus, begins the Indiana Jones-like adventure which leads from Peru to a hidden city beneath San Francisco to a deadly cave in the Falkland Islands.  "Spiders" from German director Fritz Lang, contains the first two parts of what was to be a 4-part serial.  It's not the greatest of all adventure stories and has quite a few plot holes, but it's easy to see the influence it has on many of the adventure films of today.  And, the acting is not bad, either. The DVD transfers are scratchy but still very viewable.  Not many extras, though.
