 In a small Japanese town, Kirie happens upon her boyfriend Shuichi's father mindlessly videotaping a snail.  She thinks nothing of it until strange events start happening: uzumaki, or spirals, pop up all over town; people turn into gigantic snails; other townsfolk become obsessed with finding spirals.  Shuichi realizes that something is terribly wrong and tries to get Kirie to leave before the mysterious spirals grab hold of them.  This is a bizarre film filled with intersting images - many of which are particularly gorey - and impressive special effects.  But, the movie seems to be just that: images joined together by special effects.  The story never really is fleshed out, and certain plot points are dropped just as quickly as they appear.  The acting comes across quite often as campy and over-the-top, though Fhi Fan does a fine job as Shuichi, the young man who knows something is wrong and feels almost powerless to stop it.  "Uzumaki" is an interesting film to view, if just for the special effects.
