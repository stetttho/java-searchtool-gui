 "Life for Rent," Dido's second album, contains great songs full of lost love, guilt, and hope, all sung by one of the most haunting, delicate and deceptively plain voices in pop music today.  (No flourishes or over-singing on this album!)  Dido's talents are not limited to singing, either writing or co-writing all the songs on the album.  The music ranges from pop songs, including "Life for Rent" and "Stoned," to an almost R&B/funk feel on "Who Makes You Feel" and even a danceable "Sand in My Shoes."  There's even a hidden track that fits well with the rest of the album.  Standout songs:  "White Flag," "Don't Leave Home,"  "Life for Rent," and "See the Sun."
