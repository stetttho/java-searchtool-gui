 Elder Aaron Davis has been sent to Los Angeles to fulfill his two years of misionary work for the Mormon Church.  He and three other missionaries move into an apartment complex, with one of the neighbors being Christian Markelli, a young, gay and handsome waiter.  After bumping into Aaron, Christian makes a bet with his co-workers that he can bed a Mormon.  He immediately starts in with Aaron, but his plans go awry when he starts to fall for him - and when Aaron tells him what he thinks about the shallow pretty boy trying to seduce him.  Christian is forced to deal with his own views and how others see him, while at the same time, Aaron must face the wrath of his church and his family when his secret is accidentally exposed.  Great performances by Wes Ramsey as Christian and Steve Sadnvoss as Aaron.  Jacqueline Bisset and Mary Kay Place also co-star and give fine supporting performances.  For an independent film, the writing is remarkably strong and all the actors give fine performances.  The two main characters make visible changes throughout the film, becoming more human and not so one-dimensional.  Plus, I feel that the handling of the church and its anti-homosexual views were dealt with realistically.  The DVD also has 3 deleted scenes (which are quite good), some music videos and featurettes.
