 Twice a year, birds make long pilgrimages -- migrations -- to find food and to raise their young.  Some of these migrations are merely hundreds of miles; others longer than 2500 miles, crossing continents and oceans. Directors Jacques Perrin, Jacques Cluzaud, and Michel Debats and their team spent four years and crossed seven continents to capture these wonderful creatures in their migratory patterns,  With stunning cinematography and breathtaking scenery, they put the viewer both above the birds, giving a view of the world as seen from the skies, and at eye level with the birds, flying and gliding alongside them, making the viewer feel as if he/she were part of the flock. Interspersed with some narration and music, they rely much on visuals to show how and why the birds migrate, to show the hardships they must face, such as weather and natural predators, and to display how mankind is making an impact of them through hunting and pollution. Picture and sound quality on the DVD are wonderful, much better than when I saw it in the theater.  Also included are director's commentary and featurettes on the making of the film and of the music.  (I highly recommend the making of the film just to give an idea of what the film crews went through to create this remarkble film.)  A first-rate documentary.
