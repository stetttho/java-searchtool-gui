 This CD has some great music on it.  Who really cares if there are two men hlding each other on the cover?  That's not the important thing.  This CD contains some of the best romantic music by some of the world's greatest  composers: Tchaikovsky, Chopin, Ravel, Mozart, and others. And, the  recordings are wonderful.  Congratulations to all the musicians!
