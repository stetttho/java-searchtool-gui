 Martha "Marty" Winchell is a columnist for a daily  newspaper in Chicago. Her one problem, as her best  friend Barb can attest to, is constanly falling for  straight women, even though she knows that nothing  will ever come of it.    Then, Janis Daly walks into her life. Janis is a  wealthy socialite who almost drowns at the lake until  Marty, who watches her from the shore, dives in to  rescue her. They soon develop a good friendship which  turns into something else, even though Janis is  straight and engaged to Jim.    This novel deals with the ups and downs of Marty and  Janis's relationship: Janis' first time with a woman;  Janis breaking off the engagement to Jim and its  violent consequences; an unexpected pregnancy; Marty  coming out to her co-workers; a suicide.    Lorio makes a few attempts at humor that are okay and  occasionally throws in a lesson about acceptance. She  also ties up the emotions a bit too quickly a few  times. But, it's a good story and worth reading. A  good read for a rainy day.
