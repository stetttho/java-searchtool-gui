 In the early 1970s, Astronaut Allen Cloud returns to his Houston, TX, home from a mission in Florida to find his wife Joan sitting on their bed, drunk and toying with a pistol.  He calmly takes the gun from her, which she swears isn't loaded.  She lays back on the bed and, before passing out, says, "You should know, your son is a homosexual." "Sea of Tranquility" relates the story of the Cloud family in the aftermath of that singular statement. Allen Cloud, astronaut and father who tries to cope with his mixed feelings about the son he never really knew.  Not that he ever really knew anyone or would allow anyone to get close to him.  Joan Cloud, finally feeling free of the loneliness of being an astronaut's wife, moves with her son to her hometown of Minerva, TN.  Coninuously drinking, her life centers around her son whom she loves but feels more of an equal to than a mother.  Jonathan Cloud, her son who wears tie-dye shirts and eyeliner to enhance his dark eyes.  Very much a free spirit with a vivid imagination and who doesn't care much for what others think about him.  Stayton Voegli, the son of a Baptist preacher and missionary, who falls for Jonathan after sneaking out to a club, watching him dance, and is then partnered with him in a high school science class. Each chapter is told from one of their points of view, all in the first person, allowing us access to the inner workings of their brains.  Stayton's hesitation at this new relationship he's forming and trying to reconcile it with his strng religious upbringing. Jonathan's vivid world, filled with the names of all the stars and planets and galaxies.  But, Allen's chapters are told in the third person, revealing much more about his character's feelings of being cut off and closed to those around him. This is a wonderful book, full of marvelous imagery and a unique glimpse into the characters.  Definitely a must-read!
