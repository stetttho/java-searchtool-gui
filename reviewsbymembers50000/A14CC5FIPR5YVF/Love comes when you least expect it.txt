 After finally ending a four-year, abusive relationship, Diana Holland takes a much-needed breather at a cabin in Lake Tahoe along with other woman - kind of a "Girls Only" getaway. The last thing she expected was to find love - especially in the form of Lane Christianson, a lawyer from San Francisco. Together, they both experience for the first time a physical and emotional relationship with another woman and deal with the repercussions to their personal lives as they prepare for what happens after they leave Tahoe.   I liked the relationship between Diana and Lane because of the newness of it and how that was shown from Diana's perspective - not believing that she's falling for another woman, trying to convince herslef it's just a phase with a One Night Stand with a football player, finally realizing what she wants and needs. The whole novel seemed to focus much on the physical aspects of their relationship and only to touch on the emotional reasons behind it.  A good novel about unexpected love between two woemn.
