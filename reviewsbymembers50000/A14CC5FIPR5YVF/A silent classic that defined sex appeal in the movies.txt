 Clara Bow stars in this wonderful silent film as Betty Lou Spence a shopgirl at Waltham's Department Store.  When she first sees her boss, the handsome Cyrus Waltham, Jr. (played by Antonio Moreno), she falls for him and decides that he is to be her husband.  But  Waltham barely notices the shopgirl until his friend Monty Montgomery (comically played by William Austin) spies her at the counter and determines that she has "It," a certain type of sex appeal.  With the help of Monty and her own "It" factor, Betty tries to win the man of her dreams. This is a delightful romantic comedy, based upon the short story by Elinor Glyn -- who also makes a cameo appearance in the film.  the acting is spot on, so much so that you don't even need the title cards.  You can tell exactly what's going on.  Clara Bow is amazing as Betty, with just the right charm and sex appeal.  The great music accompaniment on this DVD was written by Carl Davis and matches the film perfectly. A classic romantic comedy from the Silent Era.
