 The novel tells the story of Joe Boyd, a long-time fan of the Washington Senators who have the worst record in baseball.  One night after an incredibly bad loss, Joe decides to take a walk around the neighborhood and runs into the mysterious Mr. Applegate.  It turns out that Applegate has been keeping tabs on Joe and his Washington Senators and wants to offer Joe a proposition.  How would he like to watch his beloved Senators to win the 1958 pennant?  Not only watch, but even help the team by becoming their newest star player?  Reluctantly, Joe agrees but has Applegate write an escape clause into the contract.  Within a few days the old Joe Boyd is transfromed into the 21-year-old Joe Hardy and sets off on a whirlwind ride that moves the Senators up from 7th place to just within reach of the Yankees.

So many temptations to stick with the game, and even stronger feelings tying him to his old life.  Until the gorgeous Lola steps into the picture to keep his mind off the old Joe.  Author Douglass Wallop's story keeps you enrapt and rooting for Joe and the Senators until the very end, never quite sure just what the outcome is going to be.
