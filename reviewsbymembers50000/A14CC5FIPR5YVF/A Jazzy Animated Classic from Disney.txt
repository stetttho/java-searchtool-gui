 Disney's 19th animated film tells the story of Mowgli, a young human found in the wreckage of a small boat by the panther Bagheera.  He takes the young mancub to a family of wolves who raise the boy as one of their own.  10 years go by, and news begins to spread that the tiger Shere Khan, who distrusts Man, has returned.  Fearing for Mowgli's safety, Bagheera agrees to take Mowgli to the nearest Man village, where he will be protected. Mowgli, however, doesn't want to leave the jungle, the only home he has ever known.  He runs away from Bagheera and meets Baloo, a happy-go-lucky bear, and decides to be like him in order to stay in the jungle.  It's up to Bagheera to convince the two of them that Mowgli will be safer in the Man village.  Together, the three set out against the many hilarious and menacing obstacles that await them on their journey. A Disney classic, one of the best things about this movie is the voice work: Sebastion Cabot as the up-tight panther Bagheera; Phil Harris as the "jungle bum" bear Baloo; George Sanderson as Shere Khan, giving him almost an upper crust dignity; and in two of the best roles in the film, jazz star Louis Prima as the orangutang King Louie who wants the secret of man's fire from Mowgli so that he, too, can be a man; and Sterling Holloway as the sly snake Kaa who only wants the mancub for a tasy meal.  The film is also full of great music, including "Trust in Me" and the ever-popular classics "I Wan'na Be Like You" and "The Bare Necessities." This is a family film full of fun, music and adventure that everyone is sure to enjoy.
