 Five interesting women are nominated for the "Best Actress" Oscar:  Fiona Covington, who portrayed a lesbian nanny in a re-telling of "Mary Poppins" and whose personal life just took a turn for the worse; Amber Lyons, the newcomer with a serious drug problem; Connie Travatano, the sentimental favorite whose run-ins with the law could be a problem; Lori Seefer, who desparately wants to keep her private life - and her lover Maria - a secret from the publicity hounds; and Karen Kroll, a known former porn star with a dirty little secret of her own.  All of these women want that statuette.  But only one is willing to kill for it.  This is by far one of the cattiest, sharpest, most fun novel about the entertainment industry I have ever read!  It begins with the morning that the nominees are announced and from then on, it's a roller coaster ride into the personal lives of the 5 nominees.  It's chock full of nasty publicists, writers who will do anything to get a scoop, and enough bitchiness and backstabbing to put "Dynasty" to shame.  Author John Kane even has the characters interacting with the rich and famous like Goldie Hawn and Liza Minelli to keep things interesting.  He's also thrown in enough clues and red herrings to keep you guessing until the very end whodunnit.  This book is mindless entertainment, but it's so much fun!!!
