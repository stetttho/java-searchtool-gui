 Richard Garay, half-English and half-Argentinian, lives with his mother in Bueons Aires in the 1980s.  He's stuck in a teaching job he doesn't like and roams the streets at night, afraid of letting anyone close to him know about his homosexuality.  But Argentina is changing, and Richard soon must change with it. He befriends one of his students, Jorge Caneto, and travels with him to Barcelona.  His mother passes away.  The Falklands War begins and ends.  Once the war is over, Jorge's father, a powerful man in Argentina, gets Richard a job as an interpretor for the foreigners coming over to assist with the privatization of Argentina's oil industry.  And, he also hopes that Richard will help sway the visitors in the political arena.  At one of the fundraiser parties, Richard spies Pablo, a beautiful young man and also Jorge's brother. Richard slowly begins a romance with Pablo.  But, Pablo's past comes back to haunt the relationship.    Soon, Richard is having to deal not only with that past but also his future and the threat of HIV and AIDS. I felt that the author couldn't make up his mind what story to tell: the political intrigue of the privatization of Argentina or the romance of Pablo and Richard.  Either one would have been sufficient, but the stories didn't combine well and made it seem as though I were reading two novels at once.
