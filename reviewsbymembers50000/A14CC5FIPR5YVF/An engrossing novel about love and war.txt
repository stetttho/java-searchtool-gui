 Geroge Hardy, a surgeon and amateur photographer, discovers his father dead in the bed of another woman and hastens to bring the body home before his mother learns of it.  Three people help with this task, and their lives are irrevocaly changed because of it. The story is told through the eyes of those three people close to Master Georige.  The first is Myrtle, a young orphan who is accepted and raised by the Hardy family.  She immediately falls in love with Georgie, a love that will carry her from the streets of Liverpool to the battlefields of the Crimean War.  Next is Pompey Jones, a young street boy who helps move the body of George's father and then discovers George's passion for young men.  The last is Dr. Potter, a family friend who follows George all the way to the Battle of Inkermann, never understanding George's aversion to women or why he wants to attach himself to a unit during the awful war.  Through their eyes, we watch George change from a young doctor in England dealing with his father's troublesome death to the hardened field doctor trying to save lives during a time of war. This is a fantastic historical novel, with some of the most descriptive war scenes I've read in quite some time.  Bainbridge makes you feel the confusion, fear and dread that the soldiers faced both due to battle and due to disease.  At the same time, she shows how one life can effect others, either for better or for worse.  A highly engrossing novel.
