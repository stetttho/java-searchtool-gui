 Simon and Mark, a gay couple living in London, have an open relationship.  Mark is a drag performer living with AIDS; Simon his his lover who sleeps around.  When Mark passes away, Simon quickly removes every aspect of Simon from his life, tossing his clothes, boxing up their photographs and hiding Mark's AIDS quilt piece in the closet.  This does not sit well with the spirit of Simon who returns to wreak havoc on Mark's string of one-night stands. The film as a whole is uneven.  It kept jumping from being a movie about AIDS to a ghost story to a comedy to a drama to a soap opera, and was never quite able to hold my interest.  The acting is marginal and sometimes overly melodramatic so I never really liked the characters.  Add to that poor sound quality (I had the volume almost at full tilt but could still barely hear much of what was said) and a graininess to the film, and the movie veers away from its potential.
