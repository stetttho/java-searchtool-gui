 Young Varla follows in her mother's footsteps and moves to Hollywood to chase her dreams of stardom.  She moves in with two other actresses: Coco, trying to find her true love but haunted by dreams of Dr. Perfect; and Evie, an aging actress trying to make a comeback.  Along the way, Varla meets Stevie, the handsome son of Evie.  He falls in love with her at first sight, but wonders if his "tiny" problem will get in the way of their being together.  When Varla gets her big break in a commercial, jealousy rears its head as Evie remembers the shocking and disturbing events that happened between her and Varla's mother, Marla.  Is Varla here to thwart her efforts at regaining her stardom? This is a wonderfully campy and un-PC look at the Hollywood dream of making it big in the movies.  The story is a little slow in some points, but the actors more than make up for it with their delivery of the catty dialogue and their acting skills.  What also makes this a wonderful film is that all the actors are men: from Varla, Coco and Evie to Stevie, the nurse and Dr. Perfect.  Jack Plotnick (Evie), Clinton Leupp (Coco), and Jeffrey Robertson (Varla/Marla) are all phenomenal in their roles.  And Ron Mathews gives a fine, comic performance as Stevie.  The special effects are interesting, too, and quite surprising. The DVD is great, not only because of the extras (like the funny deleted scenes), but each menu has a little routine either by all four of the main leads or by them in groups of two.  Special dialogue written and filmed especially for the DVD.  The picture is one of the sharpest I've scene, and the sound quality is perfect.  For anyone who enjoys a campy, fun movie, this is the perfect one for you!!
