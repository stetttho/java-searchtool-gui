 The majority of stories in this collection - edited by Julie K. Trevelyan and Scott Brassart - deal with ghosts helping the living find love: of past loves trying to help their partners move on and to find love ("Taking Care of Faith" by A.J. Potter, "Old as a Rose in Bloom" by Lawrence Schimel); older ghosts and other supernatural beings helping new lovers to find one another ("The Course of True Love" by d.g.k. goldberg, "Paisley" by Jessica Kirkwood); and, of course those with a more evil bent ("amat67.jpg" by Hall Owen Calwaugh).  They're all fairly pleasant tales, easy to read an enjoyable; however, this collection is almost like reading the same story over and over.  Some of the standouts making this a worthy collection to read are "The Haunting of Room 110" by Michael Price Nelson about a ghost waiting for his lover to join him, and "Eyes" by E.J. Galusha, which really did put the scare in me and is a fitting finale to the collection.  An overall good collection for anyone wanting a gay take on ghosts.
