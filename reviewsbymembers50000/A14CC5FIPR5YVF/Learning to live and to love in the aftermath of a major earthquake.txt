 A major earthquake stirkes San Francisco, altering the lives of the city's many residents.  Patricia watches in dismay as the house she re-built along with her partner Trout (Tracy) crumbles completely to the ground.   Meanwhile, across town, Trout, a successful businesswoman, starts to lose control as the world around her spirals out of control.  Louise's dyke bar in the heart of the gay district becomes home to an ever-increasing stream of women trying to make sense of what just happened and how they're going to go on.  But the quake has done much more to Patricia and Trout than they realize as they struggle through new revelations about their relationship and try to repair the damage to their lives.   A good story overall, but some of the storylines, such as Cherice who is trapped in an elevator with a male clerk from her office building, don't seem that important to the novel as a whole.  A solid novel from author Jess Wells with many strong characters.
