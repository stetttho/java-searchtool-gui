 Nathan and his family recently moved into a farm house outside of town -- yet another in a long series of moves.  From his window, he sometimes watches the neighbor's son, Roy, who goes to the same school and drives the school bus.  One day Roy surprises him sits with him at lunch, beginning an interesting friendship that quickly turns into love. While Nathan is sure of himself, Roy is confused and needs to keep their intimacy hidden from the rest of the school, especially from his girlfriend.  The relationship is put to the test through a series of events starting with Nathan's father and his unmentionable past and culminating with a violent display at an abandoned house in the Kenicutt Woods. "Dream Boy" is a well-written story about the two young boys dealing with their growing love for one another.  Grimsley manages to get the emotions of both characters just right, from Roy's need for secrecy to Nathan's painful memories of his father.  The scenes involving the abandoned house were especially effective, with the dark and eerie atmosphere paralleling the mindset of Roy, Nathan and the other two boys, Randy and Burke, who are with them. The only fault I find is with the last 10 chapters.  They created a very confusing ending for me, and the novel lost some of its believability.  I found myself re-reading the (short) chapters again just to make sure what I read was correct.   Still, Grimsley's characters are very strong and fleshed out, and the story of a painful first love is worth reading.
