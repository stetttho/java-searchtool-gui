 Margaret Cho describes the rise and fall of her TV show "All-American Girl," her close ties with the gay community, being Asian-American, and her dead-pan impersonations of her mother.  By far one of the funniest stand-up films around, what makes this a great film is that she lets the audience see her human side.  It takes much courage to discuss the whirlwind of emotions as well as the physical and mental stresses surrounding her failed TV show -- the producers said she was too fat to play herself, she wasn't Asian enough, the alcoholism, the hospital time.  To go through that hell and still come out strong and with your sense of humor intact and then want to share it...she is to be admired. This is one film that I truly can watch over and over.  Even though I know the jokes and though my friends and I quote some of the lines to one another (the line about Gwen will drive you mad!!!), I still laugh so hard and so loud and wipe the tears from my eyes.   The DVD extras are also worth watching.  A definite winner!
