 This is a great colleciton of music for both fans of the TV show and for music lovers.  It contains some great dance mixes including the theme song "All Things (Just Keep Getting Better)" by Widelife with Simone Denny, "You Promised Me" by InGrid, "Move Your Feet" by Junior Senior, "Good Luck" by Basement Jaxx featuring Lisa Kekaula, and a great song titled "Everybody Want You To Emerge" by Fischerspooner vs. Billy Squier.   And, there's more than just dance mixes.  They've included "Extraordinary" by Liz Phair, "Superstar" by Jamelia (pop/R&B), Sting, OK Go, Kylie Minogue, Prophet Omega, Elton John, and a new song from the original line up of Duran Duran. The DVD that comes with the limited edition is equally good with a mini-making of for the video to "All Things (Just Keep Getting Better)," the video for Kylie Minogue's "Slow" and a dance video remix of Sting's "Send Your Love." A great music collection for everyone!!
