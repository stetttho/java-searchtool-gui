 Ned Weeks's lover died almost 10 years ago from complications of AIDS, and now, Ben has learned of his own infection with the disease.  Being an activist in the fight to bring national attention and funding to the seriousness of AIDS, he reluctantly (and clandestinely) checks himself into the very hospital against which his group has been protesting and the same doctor who has been the target of his activism. Feeling that his life is slipping away, Ned confronts his doctor about the lack of progress in AIDS research, the seemingly useless treatments and the lack of participation from the government.  At the same time, he tries to sort out his life, confronting his younger self, Alexander, as he begins to notice that he's different from everyone.  Alexander juggles this with his dislike of his father, his idol worship of his brother Ben, his love for his mother and society's visions of homosexuality. This is a strong and moving play, both about how far research and activism have come in finding a cure and about dealing with family while trying to accept your own feelings.  Ned is a very realistic character, and somewhat autobiographical, as Mr. Kramer draws heavily upon his own life and experiences.  The interplay between past and present is interesting to read, though sometimes a bit confusing.  I think a live performance of this play would bring a better understanding of this technique.  But, as a follow-up to "The Normal Heart," this is a marvelous play.
