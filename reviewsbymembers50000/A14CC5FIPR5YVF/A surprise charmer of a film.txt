 Life isn't going very well for Grace Beasley.  First, her husband Max decides to end their 25-year marriage so that he can live life more dangerously.  And, then, her favorite singer Victor Fox is murdered by the Crossbow Killer.  Determined to turn her life around, she sets off for England to pay her last respects at Victor's funeral. Events take a unique turn when Grace meets Victor's lover, Dirk Simpson, and Victor's three sisters.  Seems they want to evict Dirk from their brother's house, but Dirk insists that Victor left it to him.  Grace and Dirk form a quick friendship and get back at the three sisters.  Then, Grace convinces Dirk to come back to Chicago with her to find the Crossbow Killer. A little "out there" at times with the plot, this movie is still quite charming and funny.  Kathy Bates is both warm and hysterical as Grace.  Rupert Everett is equally charming and funny as Dirk Simpson.  Even Julie Andrews shows up in two of the best moments in the film.  But ,Meredith Eaton steals the movie as Grace's dwarf daughter-in-law Maudey.  She's brash and funny and gives one of the best performances I've seen.  The only extras on the DVD are a theatrical trailer and a deleted scene.   It's still a movie that surprised me with its charm and humor.
