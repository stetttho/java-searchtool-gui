 I fondly remember the video game arcades from my youth. Standing in front of those tall machines, staring at the monitors as Pac-Man gobbles his way around a maze of dots being chased by Blinky, Inky, Pinky and Clyde, shoving quarter after quarter into the narrow slot with the hope of one day breaking the high score. I must have spent at least $1,000 or more on those games while my brain cells slowly burned away in the electric blue glow. Ah, those were the days.  Imagine my surprise this Christmas when I unwrapped an odd gift from my brother: a joy stick that looked as if it had been ripped from one of those monstrous video games. A long black cable that split into two large colored plugs trailed from the back. Screen shots of Pac-Man and Dig Dug covered the panels, and I turned the package over a few times, trying to figure out what on Earth I would use a joystick for without a game console. My brother must have seen the confused look on my face so he leaned over and said that I plug the cable into my TV and presto! I could play 5 different video games.  I finally broke down and bought the 4 batteries needed to power it. I happened to glance at my VCR and noticed the two unused cable outlets on the front. The plugs fit perfectly, I turned on the TV and VCR then flicked the ON switch to the joystick and bingo! We have video game play!  The games resemble their arcade counterparts with a few changes -- reformattted to fit a TV screen, the villians move a bit faster, single-player games only. The graphics look almost exactly the same as if you were playing the games in an arcade.  I spent the good part of last night and a few hours after arriving home from the office today playing Pac-Man, Dig Dug, Galaxian, Rally-X and Bosconian. My hands hurt a bit from the design of the joystick unit itself, and it doesn't lend itself to long-term play, but it is still a lot of fun.  My inner 80s geek is reborn!
