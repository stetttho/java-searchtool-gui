 While enjoying the nightlife of Harlem in the 1920's, June Westbrook, a recent divorce and newspaper columnist, befriends Mark Thornton, a handsome young man with a secret.  As they are leaving one of the clubs, they witness a young, effeminate man named Nelly gets arrested.  June pleads with Mark to find out what happened to him. En route to the courthouse the next day, Mark reads a copy of the Penal Code and learns of the horrible laws society has created against men like Nelly - and men like himself.  He attends Nelly's trial at which the young man is sentenced to one year in prison for making advances towards another man and for dressing like a woman.  Unnerved by what he has seen and read, he decides to tell June everything, believing she is the one person who can understand him. Blair Niles' novel, first published in 1931, is a remarkable study gay life during the 1920's.: the powerfully negative views imposed by society, the feeling of loneliness, the secretiveness that gay men and women followed in order to fit in with society. Her main characters are wonderfully drawn: Mark, who is filled with self-hatred because of the way he feels toward other been and because of societal dislike of men and women such as he; and June, who, instead of behind disgusted by what she hears, is compassionate toward Mark, perhaps because she finds a connection between her and Mark.  The supporting characters are equally good, ranging from Mark's "mentor" Tom Burden, who first helped Mark to realize and to accept what he is, to Seth Vaughan, the object of June's affection. It's not a very negative novel at all, most of the time trying to understand and to show a positive light on homosexuality.  I found that refreshing for such an early novel, though Mark does come to the typical tragic end for a homosexual character.  Definitely a novel worth reading.
