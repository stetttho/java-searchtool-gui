 Young Irishman Kenny decides to follow in the footsteps of his best mate Byron, who left to make his fortune in the big city -- London.  He finds Byron shacked up in an abandoned building, but worse, he learns that his best mates been earning his money not in some blue-collar trade but as a hustler at the local gay bar.  In spite of this, Kenny decides to stay on with his mate and soon finds himself drawn Byron's life, as his money quickly runs out. But things take an unusual turn when words spreads that The Queen has been murdered.  Stories abound about a hidden trove of cash tucked away in the gigantic bed she shared with her lover, Golders Green, an Orthodox Jew.  Determined to find the money, they set off around London in search of Golders' house, leaving a trail of accidental deaths, a desparate dwarf, and Kenny discovering the truth about himself.   Writer/Director Ky Mo Lab's first film is irreverant, ballsy, campy and just plain fun.  The dialogue is sharp and funny, and delivered incredibly well by all the actors.  Glen Mulhern and Brendan Mackey are wonderful as the duo of Kenny and Byron.  They come across as genuine friends, willing to help one another out in a pinch.  The featured actors are equally fine, including Vas Blackwood, Steven Berkoff, Michael Praed, and Karen Sharman.  But, Raymond Griffiths almost steals the entire movie as The Desparate Dwarf who only wants someone to have sex with him. The movie doesn't take itself too seriously, which makes it even more enjoyable.  A great film that will have you laughing out loud.
