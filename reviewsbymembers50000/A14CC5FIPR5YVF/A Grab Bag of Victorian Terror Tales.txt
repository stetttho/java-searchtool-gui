 The 21 tales gathered in this colleciton run the gamut of the Victorian Eras fascination with death, the supernatural and all things that cause fright in some way.  From chilling ghost tales, including "The Ship That Saw A Ghost" by Frank Norris, "The Corpse Light" by Dick Donovan and "The Haunted Chair" by Richard Marsh to a potential mutiny in "Coolies" by W. Carlton Dawe, a unique foray in science fiction called "The Battle of the Monsters" by Morgan Robertson and an interesting way to end a marriage in "An Alpine Divorce" by Robert Barr.  These stories highlight some of the best and sometimes overlooked writers -- both male and female -- including Guy de Maupassant, Ambrose Bierce, Rhoda Broughton, and Erckmann-Chatrian.  Filled with rich descriptions and an almost palpable sense of terror, these tales will delight readers of Victorian literature and terror/horror fans alike.
