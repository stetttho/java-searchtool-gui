 On November 17, 1970, Elton John performed live in the W- ABC FM studios in New York, with the performance being recorded for what would ultimately become his 11-17-70 album.  The few tracks include what have become some of his classic songs: "Take Me To the Pilot," "Sixty Years On" and "Burn Down the Mission;" a cover of the Rolling Stones' "Honky Tonk Women;" "Bad Side of the Moon" which showcases his honky tonk and blues piano/singing; and an incredible, jam-versoin of "Burn Down the Mission" which includes references to Elvis's "My Babay Left Me" and The Beatles's "Get Back."  The entire album showcases Elton's talent not only as a singer but as a piano player, and is a must for any fan of Elton John.
