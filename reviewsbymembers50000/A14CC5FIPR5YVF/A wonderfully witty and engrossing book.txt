 Joan Littler is a well-known TV comedy writer in England. Beginning with sections of a taped interview, she tells us about her life and loves, from the lonely 23-year-old woman still living with her mother in Birmingham to the successful writer she is today.    Joan introduces us to two of the main female relationships in her life: her mother, Dolly, a witty woman with a penchant for crosswords, always has a remark about the women she brings home, especially for the no-good Susan; and Susan, the love of her life who walked out on her but still manages to keep herself in Joan's thoughts. It's the experiences with these women and with her friends and lovers that give her the self-confidence to change her life, to try her hand at stand-up comedy.   Which doesn't go so well.   Until one night at a party, she creates Freddy -- the perfect lover and companion. After the party, she goes home and creates a life for her fictitious other half, jotting notes about music and travel and creates such an involved life that she must make additional notes to remind her to whom she told what about Freddy.   I will leave you with that. Revealing any more would ruin the story.    Author V G Lee has written a very involving story with strongly developed and lively characters with whom I was able to connect. Her sense of humor is wonderfully witty and not overdone. This is a highly recommended book that I am making sure my friends read!
