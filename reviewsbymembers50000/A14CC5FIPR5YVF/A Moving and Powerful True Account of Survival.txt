 A sodomy law had been on the German law books since 1871, a law known simply as Paragraph 175.  Only a few people were ever sentenced under this obscure law until June of 1935 when, after the rise of Hitler and Nazism, the Nuremberg laws were enacted and the consequences of Paragraph 175 strengthened.  Where once before, you had to be caught in the act of same sex relations, now simply receiving a letter or the spreading of idle gossip would have you sent to a concentration camp. "The Men with the Pink Triangle" is one anonymous man's account of the harshness and cruelty faced by gay men at the hands of the SS and the ruling Nazi party, as well as by the other prisoners -- criminals, politicals, emigrants -- who viewed "filthy queers" as lower than the rest of them.  They were distinguished by the large, pink triangles sown onto their prison outfits, making them easy targets for taunts and punishments.  Also, homosexuals labored through the worst of the work details and "volunteered" for medical experimentation, which usually resulted in their deaths. Some advantages also appeared for gay men.  The "Capos" who were in charge of the prisoner barracks, often made lovers of some of the prisoners, giving them some protection and better rations and clothing.  As is says in the book: "Homosexual behavior between two 'normal' men is considered an emergency outlet, while the same thing between two gay men, who both feel deeply for one another, is something 'filthy' and repulsive."  The anonymous man used this to his advantage and survived the camps and the threat of being sent to the front lines. Ths is a moving and powerful story about survival and about the right to be who you are, during one of the darkest times in world history.  Highly recommended.
