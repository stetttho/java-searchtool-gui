 This new collection of stories, edited by Michael Chabon, aims to "reinvigorate the stay-up-all-night, edge-of-the-seat, fingernail-biting, page-turning tradition" (taken from the book's back cover) of literary short fiction.  For me, that was about half right.  Half the stories had me on the edge of my seat and didn't let up for a moment, such as "Lusus Naturae" by Margaret Atwood, "The Fabled Light-house at Via del Mar" by Joyce Carol Oates, and the astonishing "7C" by Jason Roberts (probably the best of the collection).  The other half seemed a bit unclear and left me wondering what I had just read.  The collection includes some already well-known authors - Stephen King, Joyce Carol Oates, Peter Straub - and introduces some welcome newcomers (to me, anyway) - Ayelet Waldman, Jason Roberts, Roddy Doyle.  As a whole, this collection was hit and miss; however, the hits make it worth reading.
