 I think most people know the story of Julius Caesar's death: stabbed 23 times on March 15th during a session of the Senate.  What Thornton Wilder has done with his novel is to give the reader a glimpse in to the human side of Caesar, through journal entries and correspondence from him and those surrounding him.  We learn of the statesman, who tries his best to govern his people; of his "divinity" and his tolerance of the belief in gods and goddesses; of the family man living in a tepid marriage with his wife Pompeia; and of his attraction to intellectuals, whether if be the poet Catullus, whose poetry he highly regards even if it mocks him, and the beautfiul Egyptian Queen Cleopatra, whom he considers almost an equal in terms of ability to rule.  Wilder also lets us in on public opinion concerning the Dictator, as Caesar was also known, through intercepted correspondence of Clodia Pulcher and others.  Caesar becomes more of a human figure in the hands of Wilder.  He has his foibles and his share of indecisions, just like any other person.  He also tries to do what he believes to be the right thing in terms of treating others.  A unique historical novel.
