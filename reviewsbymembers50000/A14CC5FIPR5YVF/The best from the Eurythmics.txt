 One of the best albums to come from the 1980s, "Savage" is more than just a great collection of songs showcasing the talents of both Annie Lennox and Dave Stewart.  If you listen from it's first song "Beethoven (I Love To)"  to the uplifting, gospel-flavored "A Brand New Day" finale, the album tells the story of a relationship gone wrong and the woman who puts her life back together.  Filled with the synth-pop that the Euythmics are known for ("Do You Want to Break Up?," "Shame," "Heaven") and a few different sytles (the vamp-rock feel of "I Need a Man" and the acoutic guitars of "I Need You") and all featuring Lennox's wonderful voice, this album offers the best of the duo.
