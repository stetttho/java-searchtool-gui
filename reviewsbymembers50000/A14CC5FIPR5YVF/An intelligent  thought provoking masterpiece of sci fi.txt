 In 2021, after World War Terminus, life on Earth has changed forever.  Those who were not killed either emigrated to other planets or chose to remain on a tainted planet.  With most species of animals dead, live specimens are prized possessions, and for those who can't afford a live animal, companies build artificial ones.  Some even build artificial humans. Rick Deckard is a bounty hunter, sent to find and to retire rogue androids, or "andys," who manage to find their way back to Earth.  The government has banned them, fearful of what they might do, especially since they blend in so well with regular humans.  But, the more contact that Rick has with the Nexus-6 android Rachel, the more he begins to question what life is.  Can an artificial life form have empathy?  What happens when a human starts to have empathy for an artificial life form? Philip K. Dick's masterful novel deals with these issues in a fast-paced, realistic environment.  All the characters are finely drawn, especially the andys, and the intelligent story keeps your attention.  I also found it relevant with what's going on in the world today.  It's one of those novels that I just couldn't put down.  A superb sci-fi novel.
