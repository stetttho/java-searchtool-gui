 In a part of Culver City, CA, next to a bus stops stands the Museum of Jurassic Technology, run by one David Wilson.  The exhibits are not what you would normally expect to find: a stink ant with a horn protruding from its head; a bat caught in mid-flight and encased in lead; old remedies involving mice on toast; and myriad other oddities.  Author Lawrence Weschler takes the reader on a tour of this little museum and delves into the history of such museums that cater to the curiosities of the natural world, known as the Wunderkammern.  They set out to insire and to create a sense of awe and wonder with the visitors, and Weschler chronicles them from their beginnings as collections in rich households to the museums that are accessible to everyone.  An intriguing book not juast about the museums but about the wonder that they inspire in the world outside the museum walls.
