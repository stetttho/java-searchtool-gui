 Albert is a street singer, selling songs on a Parisian street, when he notices Pola, shyly singing along with the crowd.  Later, at a bar/dance hall with his friend Louis, Albert again sees Pola sitting by herslef.  He and Louis roll the dice to see who gets to talk to her, but even though Albert wins, he stops short when he sees Pola with her gangster boyfriend, Fred.  Through a series of events, both planned and unplanned, Albert tries to woo Pola, but winds up in jail and then gets involved in a street fight with Fred's gang. This is a charming film from Ren Clair.  It was filmed just as movies with sound were beginning to appear so it has a unique style in that there is very little dialogue.  Most of the action is acted like a silent movie with music to enhance the action.  But, in a unique twist for its time, the characters do speak and sing, but only when necessary.  It's a mix between the two genres: silent and talkies.  A great little film. The DVD is a clean, crisp transfer with some camera shaking, problably from the original direction.  It also includes the original opening to the film, which Clair editied out in 1950, and his first silent film "Paris qui dort (Paris Asleep)" which makes for a very ineteresting early sci-fi film.
