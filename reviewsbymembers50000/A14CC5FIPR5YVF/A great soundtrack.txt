 The movie wasn't so great, but what a soundtrack!  Chock full of all genres: from the upbeat dance rhythms of "Here Comes the Hotstepper" by Ini Kamoze and "My Girl Josephine" by Supercat to smooth R&B tunes like "70's Love Groove" by Janet Jackson and "Close to You" by "Brand New Heavies," this album surpasses the film.  Other great songs included are "Natural Thing" by M People and "Martha" by Deep Forest.  And, the Rolling Stones even make an appearance.  Only a few glitches (The New Power Generation and Sam Phillips), but you can overlook those.  Definitely an album to add to your collection! Best songs:  "My Girl Josephine" by Supercat and "Close To You" by The Brand New Heavies.
