 Millions of people know of Bruce Villanche from his appearances on the "Hollywood Squares"  with his bushy hair, glasses, and T-shirt collection.  America has been laughing at his work for many years, though.  He's written everything from TV shows (the Academy Awards and "The Brady Bunch Variety Hou,r" just to name a few) to the speeches and jokes for today's hottest stars, including Bette Midler, Whoppi Goldberg and Billy Crystal.  This documentary takes you into his world, showing you his creative process in snippets of his own stand-up, interviews with some of his clients, and scenes from TV shows and ceremonies.   The DVD has no extras, but it's still a great film showcasing one of the funniest men in America.
