 This is story of a  naive young woman (played by Joan Fontaine) traveling in Monte Carlo as the companion to an older woman.  In the dining room of the hotel, she meets the brooding Maxim de Winter (Sir Laurence Olivier), who is taking some time off after the apparent suicide of his wife.  He takes a fancy to her and after a whirlwind romance, they wed. After a long honeymoon, they return to Maxim's family estate, Manderley.  Almost immediately, the second Mrs. de Winters begins to feel her inadequacy.  She thinks the staff look down on her as a common girl, which is further re-inforced by the contemptuous looks from the first Mrs. de Winters' personal maid, Mrs. Danvers.  And, then there is the presence of Rebecca -- the first Mrs. de Winters.  She seems to be everywhere, and the new Mrs. de Winters constantly feels that she needs to live up to her popularity with the staff and the people of the town. Through a series of disastrous events, the second Mrs. de Winters learns the truth about Rebecca's death and in the process grows into a stronger person. Hitchcock's first American film is a fantastic adaptation of the Daphne DuMarier novel.  With a great screenplay and fine performances by the actors -- especially Judith Anderson as the sinister Mrs. Danvers -- this film deservedly one the Best Picture Oscar.  The DVD also contains many extras, such as radio plays of the novel and featurettes which enhance the entire experience of the movie.  A true movie classic.
