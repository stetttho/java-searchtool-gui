 Darren Lemming, the star player for the New York Empires, matter-of-factly announces that he's gay during a post-game interview.  Told by his teammate Kippy Sunderstrom, the play follows the days, weeks and months after the announcement and the effect it has on the Empires.  The team seems to take it.  No arguments; no in-fighting between Darren, the management or any players; life proceeds as normal.  Until a racist and homophobic pitcher -- Shane Mungitt -- is brought up from the minor leagues, and his interactions with Darren lead to tragic consequences.  I think playwrite Richard Greenberg tried to meld two stories into one: a love for baseball as America's game and being openly gay in a overly macho place.  I briefly understood the love for the game through the character of Mason Marzac, Dennis' gay business manager, but barely caught a glimpse of how tough it is to be gay in such an environment.  The team doesn't seem to have a problem with Darren's homosexuality; that strikes me as odd.  Only one person from the team has a problem with him in the showers, but nothing ever really comes of it.  His best friend Davey Battle does have a problem with it, but he's a stereotyped Christian who finds Darren's sexaulity ugly.  The character of Shane Mungitt is stereotyped, as well, made to be a dumb and idiotic redneck, and no one from the team will even speak to him when he joins the team.  Darren Lemming is overly arrogant and unlikable, and through an unprovoked action on his part, causes Shane to commit his tragedy.  As a gay man, I couldn't get into the play or the characters -- all of which seemed very two-dimensional.  Maybe it translates better on the stage, but in book form, I did not enjoy it.
