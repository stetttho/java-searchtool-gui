 This collection of essays show James Baldwin as he strives to figure out who he is as a writer, as an American and as a black man.  Beginning with his self-imposed exile to Paris in the 1950's, he calls his own identity as both a black man and an American into question.  The Conference of Negro-African Writers and Artists which met in 1956 showed him just how different Europeans and Africans viewed cultural identity and hinted at ostracizing the American contingent.  And he felt distinctly American in that crowd.  Through his essays about returning to Harlem, his criticisms of William Faulkner ("Faulkner and Desegregation"), his review of a work by Andr Gide, his dealings with author Richard Wright, his friendship with author Norman Mailer ("The Black Boy Looks At the White Boy"), and his interview with Swedish director Ingmar Bergman, Baldwin displays his own feelings at finding his own identity as both man and writer in a world that tries to both accet and to reject him at the same time. Powerful essays from one of America's best authors.
