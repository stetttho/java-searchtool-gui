 Just after the end of World War II, a small literary movement began, unnoticed to most of the public: the gay pulp novel.  From quiet novels about homosexual relationships post-WWII to the psycho-analytic and sexually charged writings of the Sexual Revolution to the more speculative and activist writings post-Stonewall, Author Michael Bronski has drawn from extensive research and a large collection of pulp novels to give an in-depth look at this almost hidden movement.  Through this anthology, the reader not only sees a history of the gay literature but of societal views concerning homosexuality and how they have progressively changed. Bronski has chosen to cite only a few chapters from specific works to point out the pulp styles as they changed with the times.  At first, I thought I would be put off by this, but instead, it has interested me enough to try to find copies of some of these works, many of which have not been in publication since the 1950s and 1960s.  One selection of note is from "The Gay Haunt" by Victor Jay.  Kind of a gay "Blithe Spirit," even the snippet that was included in this book had me laughing hysterically. This is a fascinating read, most definitely worth your reading.
