 Danvers Mental Hospital, built in the mid-1870s, now sits empty on a hill in Massachusetts, closed since 1985.  The Hazmat Evacuation Company underbids other crews to clean up the asbestos that can be found all over the asylum.  The team members: Mike (played by Stephen Gevedon, one of the film's writers) finds a series of taped sessions in the basement.  Henry (Josh Lucas) discovers hidden treasure in the tunnels beneath the asylum.  Jeff (Brendon Sexton III) struggles with his fear of the dark.  Phil (David Caruso) tries to keep the crew working as a team.  The team leader, Gordon (Peter Mullan), longs to return to his wife and child. As the team begins to work, the eerie building begins to work on them.  This is a surprising thriller.  It doesn't rely on special effects to creep out the viewers.  It's all done with lighting, with story, and the use of a video camera instead of a big, bulky movie camera.  You feel that you're right there with the team, working in that immense building.  (A good example is when Henry is walking back alone from the tunnels, up a staircase that is divided by a gate for staff on one side and patients on the other.  The camera work and editing make this a genuinely creepy scene.)  When the team is told some of the sordid history of the asylum, that lends to the fear that both the actors and the viewers sense. All the actors give fine performances.  That, coupled with a great script and great directing, make for one of the scarier thrillers to be made in a long time. The DVD picture and sound quality are fantastic.  Plus, the extras are definitely worth watching: a featurette on the Danvers Mental Hospital (a real place in Massachusetts), audio commentary, deleted scenes, story-to-screen with commentary.  This is a creepy and atmospheric thriller that deserved much better at the box office.
