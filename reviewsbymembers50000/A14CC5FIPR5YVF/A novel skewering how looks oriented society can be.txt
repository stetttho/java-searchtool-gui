 John Eames is HIV positive, but thanks to his doctor, he's been given a new lease on life.  The new cocktail has dropped his viral load to nearly invisible, and the steroids to counteract his low testosterone levels have certainly brought about a physical change.  Unaccustomed to his new role as the Hottie Next Door, all the attention goes to his head, and he leaves his partner Harrison in order to explore his new body.  This novel focuses in on how looks-oriented and shallow the gay community can sometimes be.  We all want the perfect body, the perfect look and the attention those can bring; John's character has those same insecurities, and when given the opportunity to taste that section fo gay culture, he jumps right in.  But this new mindset changes him, brings out the worst in his personality.  He becomes catty and judgemental of others' looks and gets involved with drugs.  During this whole process, though, the novel also interjects with how important communication and mutual respect are in any relationship, and by the end, John has changed more than the steroids could ever have done.  I like that the main character grew and changed.  The novel is fast-paced and well-written, and I feel it does a good job of getting into our insecurities about body image.
