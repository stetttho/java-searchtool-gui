 Jimmy Zoole is having a bad streak of luck.  He's been robbed twice in the past three months, his best friend died, his girlfriend broke up with him on New Year's Eve, and his cat is dead.  Things are about to change when the burglar breaks into his apartment again and gets caught by Jimmy. Steve Guttenberg's directing debut is a margianl film at best.  The action takes place so fast that there doesn't seem to be enought time to get to know the characters.  Shirley Knight does a good job as Jimmy's Aunt Claire, and Lombardo Boyar plays Eddie Tesoro, the burglar, very well.  But, anyone who has read the book or viewed the play will be disappointed with some of the character and scene changes.  The humor of the book is missing, as well. The DVD does contain an okay commentary, some behind-the-scenes footage and an alternate ending.
