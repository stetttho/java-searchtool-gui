 C.K. Dexter-Haven (Bing Crosby) has moved back to his Rhode Island home to help with the new Jazz Festival that's taking place in a few days.  It also happens that his ex-wife, Tracy Lord (Grace Kelly), who lives next door, is going to re-marry the next day.  The problem is Dexter is still in love with Tracy and wants to try to get back together with her.  His plans to re-kindle their relationship get thrown out of whack when Tracy's uncle blackmails her mother into allowing two reporters from "Spy Magazine" to cover the wedding. The story is a bit weak.  Tracy left Dexter because he chose to write popular songs.  Oh, and because she couldn't mold him into the man she wanted.  (More emphasis is placed on the songwriting, though, as the reason.)  Also, Dexter never really does anything to try to win Tracy back, which made the ending of the movie not so believable for me. The acting was good, but Frank Sinatra and Celeste Holmes as the reporters from "Spy Magazine" are great.  In fact, Sinatra is one of the best things in the film.  Another standout that makes this movie worth watching is the score and songs by Cole Porter.  Some of his classics came from this film, including "Well, Did You Evah?" and the Oscar-winning "True Love."  The extras on the DVD are pretty good, as well, with a few behind-the-scenes featurettes and even a Tex Avery cartoon in Cinemascope: "Millionaire Droopy."  The picture and sound quality are good.
