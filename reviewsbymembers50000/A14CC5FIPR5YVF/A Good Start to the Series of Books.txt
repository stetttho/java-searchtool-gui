 This first in the series of novels based upon the TV show does a good job of introducing us to one of the other survivors on the island.  Yes, it is a bit predictable, but I'm glad to finally learn about the other people on the island, the one's who fill in the background spaces.  Faith Harrington, the "heroine" of "Endangered Species" interacts with the core group of survivors but has her own demons and her own odd experiences on the island.  And, just as with the TV show, we learn through flashbacks how she ended up on Flight 815.  If you're expecting huge revelations about the show or want Pulitzer-prize writing, this book more than likely isn't for you.  But if you take it for what it is, "endangered Species" makes a great companion to the TV series.
