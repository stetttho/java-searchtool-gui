 Flatland is a two-dimensional unvierse, inhabited not by people as we know them, but by shapes - triangles, polygons, circles, etc.  The narrator, A. Square, introduces the readers to the customs, class distinctions (based on geometric shape), male and female roles, how to tell one another apart, and on general life living in a world of only two dimensions.  Square's life is turned upside down when, on the eve of the new millenium, a strange visitor literally drops into his home.  This visitor - a Sphere - has chosen Square as his apostle to teach the two-dimensional masses about how more to life there is beyond their flat world view.  At first glance, this comes across as a novel about higher math: geometry, 2- and 3-dimensions, the possiblity of higher cimensions after the third, etc.  Author Edwin Abbott examines and illustrates what life would be like living in such flat world, in which everyone resembles a straight line - whether the "person" is a circle, a triangle, or a square - because only one side of them can be seen.  On a deeper level, though, Abbott offers a scathing parody of Victorian society.  (After all, the book was first published in the late 1880s.)  Class distinction based on birth is rampant.  The "lower" beings, such as isocoles triangles and irregular shapes, live in shame and are looked down upon by society.  They will never attain the good paying jobs or respectability that those shapes with more sides have.  Women are seen as merely lines, very dangerous to society, though, so they must be kept uneducated.  Their main purpose is to help their male counterparts achieve higher and higher status through breeding.  Quite a remarkable book for its time.
