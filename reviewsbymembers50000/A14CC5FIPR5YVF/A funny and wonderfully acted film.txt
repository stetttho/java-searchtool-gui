 Warren Schmidt is a just-retired insurance acutary in Omaha, Nebraska.  Getting ready to settle into retirement, he decides to sponsor a foster child in Africa for 72? a day and in the first letter to this child -- Ndugu -- he begins spilling his frustrations about his wife, his estranged daughter, the boyfriend he doesn't like, his former job.   When his wife suddenly dies, Warren takes their recently-bought motorhome on a roadtrip to Denver for his daughter's wedding.  Through a series of events and the first meeting with the boyfriend's eclectic family, he comes to terms with his wife's death and his own place in life, and relates most of this journey in comical letters to Ndugu. This is touching and funny movie with great performances by Jack Nicholson and Kathy Bates, a smart script and great direction.  The extras on the DVD are okay and worth watching.  Overall, a job well-done.
