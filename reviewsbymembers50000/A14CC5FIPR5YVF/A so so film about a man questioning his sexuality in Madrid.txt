 Handsome Marcos moves to Madrid with the hope of earning enough money to open a restaurant and settles in with his aunt and uncle.  While out on the town, he meets Daniel in a bar.  Under the watchful eyes of a Boy George poster, they strike up a friendship which quickly turns into romance. One night while they are on stage at a karaoke bar, the disco ball falls from the ceiling, striking Marcos on the head and changing him from gay to straight.  Within a few months, he's fallen for Marisol, a young Dominican woman trying to earn enough money to bring her daughter to live with her in Spain.  But Daniel isn't ready to give up on his love and will use any means to win him back. The big problem with this movie is the story itself.  What starts out as a promising romantic film turns odd and illogical.  I just couldn't believe that getting hit on the head with a disco ball would change one's sexual orientation.  And, the film didn't even expand upon the change.  Simply, 'poof, I'm straight!'  At another point, Daniel says something so out of character -- which has a major impact on the story's outcome -- that I started open-mouthed at the screen, wondering what just happened. The only saving grace of the film is the acting, especially bySantiago Magill as Daniel and Tiar Scanda as Marisol who play their roles as the love interests with ease and believability.  Jorge Sanz is quite wooden and wishy-washy as Marcos, and by the end of the film, I didn't feel that he was worthy of either Daniel or Marisol.  But Vernica Forqu steals the film as Daniel's single friend Carmen.  She's full of quirky wisdom and the friendship he needs to face his problems.  And she's quite funny. What starts out to be a nice film, turns sour and totally unbelievable.  See this fim only if you absolutely must.
