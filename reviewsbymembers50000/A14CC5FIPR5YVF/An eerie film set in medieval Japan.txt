 Two peasant women - an old woman and her daughter-in-law - in medieval Japan kill lost samurai in order to sell their clothing and weapons for much-needed food.  When their neighbor returns from the wars alone, he threatens to break up the duo by seducing the daughter-in-law.  Afraid theat she might be left alone, the old woman hatches a unique plan when she steals a demon mask from lost samurai, not realizing the dire consequences.  Director Kaneto Shindo has crafted an eerie and creepy film shot almost entirely in a field of tall reeds.  Very little to the soundtrack except for some dialogue and the sound of wind whipping through the reeds.  His use of lighting and the black-and-white film also add to the movie's effectiveness.  A great film to send shivers down your spine.
