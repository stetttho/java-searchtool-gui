 Author Erik Larson presents a unique look at a once-in-a-lifetiem event from the 1890s.  Something about the juxtaposition of true stories - of the architect Daniel Burnham and his struggles to design and build the World Columbian Exposition in Chicago and of the serial killer H.H. Holmes who used the fair as a ploy to lure young women to Chicago - captured my interest and wouldn't allow me to stop reading. Burnham faced the daunting task, once newspapers announced that Chicago had earned the right to hold the fair instead of New York, of mustering up interest by his architects of choice, finding a suitable location, working under the enormous time constraints (the fair wasn't completed when it opened), fighting unpredicatble weather, and, of course, dealing with the constant pressure of trying to top the more recent World's Fair in Paris that introduced the Eiffel Tower. I admit to smiling when I learned that thanks to Chicago's fair, we now have shredded wheat, incandescent light bulbs, and what surpassed the Eiffel Tower: a 250-feet in diameter iron wheel with Pullman cars spaced along its arc - the Ferris Wheel, named after its inventor George W. Ferris. But this particular fair also had a darker side, thanks to Dr. H.H. Holmes and his World's Fair Hotel. Many young ladies in his employ disappeared, and he created elaborate stories of them leaving town to wed or to visit family. When he was finally captured, he had come to believe that he was becoming the Devil.  A completely engrossing work of non-fiction that captures the time period of the 1890s to perfection.
