 I first heard Jem's song "They" on a local radio station a few months ago and was hooked.  The song was catchy, something that I found myself humming to while at work, and if it came on the radio, I turned it up to make everyone listen.   The rest of the album "Finally Woken" is that way, as well, mixing a kind of 60s-Brit-Pop sensibility with today's ambient groove.  Very stylish music combined with her fine, unadorned vocals. (By unadorned, I mean that she doesn't oversing like many of today's pop singers.)  With an eclectic mix of songs, this has quickly become one of my favorite ablums this year.  With songs ranging from "They" (very catchy, with its mix of modern pop grooves and elements from "Prelude in F Minor" by Ward Lamar Swingle and J.S. Bach) to the playful "Wish I"  to hopeful "Stay Now," this album is full of great music with smart lyrics. My favorite songs:  "They," "Save Me," "24," Wish I," "Stay Now," and "Flying High."
