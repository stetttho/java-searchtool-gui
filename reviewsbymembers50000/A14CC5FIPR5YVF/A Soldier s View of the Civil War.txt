 Ambrose Bierce served during the American Civil War, serving as a cartographer and officer for the Union.  In these 16 compelling tales, Bierce conveys the sights and sounds from a soldier's perspective of the war, ranging from being in the heart of battle  in "What I Saw of Shiloh" to a young boy lost in the woods in "Chickamauga" to tales of the supernatural and of odd events, including "One of the Missing" -- a chilling tale of a soldier in an abandoned house -- and his famous "An Occurence at Owl Creek Bridge."  Bierce's no-nonsense style puts the reader in the heart of the action, making the reader take an active part in the events.  A great collection of stories from one of America's best writers.
