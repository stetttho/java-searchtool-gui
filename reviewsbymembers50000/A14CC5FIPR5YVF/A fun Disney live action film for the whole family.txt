 Casey Brown is a streetwise American kid who is brought to London by conman Harry Bundage who wants to pass her off as the long lost  granddaughter of Lady St. Edmund, the owner of a large estate called Candleshoe.  Somewhere on in Candleshoe, Captain St. Edmund, a pirate, stashed his stolen treasure of gold dubloons, and Bundage has the first clue as to its whereabouts.  Casey tricks Lady St. Edmund into believing she is her granddaughter and begins her search for the next clue. Casey soon learns that Candleshoe is not as rich as everyone seems to think.  Priory the bulter has had to let all the staff go in order to pay the taxes on the property, but he wears costumes and pretends to be Mr. Gipping the gardener, Jon the chauffeur, and a host of others just to keep the truth from Lady St. Edmund -- all with the help of 4 orphans who live in the large, empty estate.  The more time she spends at Candleshoe, the more time Casey grows to like it and soon her loyalties are tested.  Does she keep her bargain with Bundage, or does she help the Lady St. Edmund?   This is a fun live-action adventure from Disney, full of wonderful performances by David Niven as Priory, Helen Hayes as Lady St. Edmund, and Leo McKern as the villainous Harry Bundage.  But, the young Jodie Foster steals the show with her already-apparent acting skill.  The story is good too, with enough to keep both kids and adults entertained.  An enjoyable film full of a lot of fun and heart.
