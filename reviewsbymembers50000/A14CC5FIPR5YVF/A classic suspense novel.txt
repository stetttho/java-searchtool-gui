 This novel tells the story of a  naive young woman (whose name is never mentioned) traveling in Monte Carlo as the companion to an older woman.  In the dining room of the hotel, she meets the brooding Maxim de Winter, who is taking some time off after the apparent suicide of his wife.  He takes a fancy to her and after a whirlwind romance, they wed. After a long honeymoon, they return to Maxim's family estate, Manderley.  Almost immediately, the second Mrs. de Winters begins to feel her inadequacy.  She thinks the staff look down on her as a common girl, which is further re-inforced by the contemptuous looks from the first Mrs. de Winters' personal maid, Mrs. Danvers.  And, then there is the presence of Rebecca -- the first Mrs. de Winters.  She seems to be everywhere, and the new Mrs. de Winters constantly feels that she needs to live up to her popularity with the staff and the people of the town. Through a series of disastrous events, the second Mrs. de Winters learns the truth about Rebecca's death and in the process grows into a stronger person.   This wonderful novel is full of twists and turns that leave the reader wanting more.  Du Marier's characters are all well-drawn, especially the sinister Mrs. Danvers.  The story gets a bit melodramatic at times, but that can easily be overlooked because of the age of the story. Still a page-turner well worth reading.
