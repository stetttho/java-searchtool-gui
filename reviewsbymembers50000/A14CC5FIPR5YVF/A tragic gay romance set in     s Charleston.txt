 In this novel, the unnamed narrator recounts the love triangle between himself and two other men in 1920's Charleston - a very repressive time when even a new dance was considered shocking enough to have people arrested.  The young narrator meets Ned Grimke, a shy, club-footed boy, when just a child and begins an unusual friendship.  As they grow older, the narrator begins to distance himself from him, not liking the unusual attraction that Ned has for him; he soon learns that he himself has such strange urgings.  He begins to haunt the secret places where such men meet: a waterfront area known as The Battery and the Peacock Alley Bar.    One night, the narrator meets the handsome Hirsch Hess, a brooding Jew who seem sbent on self-destruction over his homosexualtiy.  They share a short-lived affair until Hirsch accidentally meets Ned.  The two form a strange, very close bond that both the narrator and societal pressures attempt to break with disatrous results.    "Why We Never Danced the Charleston" offers a unique glimpse at homosexuality in the South during the 1920's - a time when sexual expression was just beginning with new dances and other forms of culture.  Greene depicts a very repressed society, in which everyone knows that the love between two men is wrong, where such men are taught to loathe themselves and others like them, and yet they survive, live and love despite what society says.  His characters and their reaction to the time and societal norms with which they live come across very realistically.  And, even though the ending is typically tragic for a gay novel, I still enjoyed reading it.
