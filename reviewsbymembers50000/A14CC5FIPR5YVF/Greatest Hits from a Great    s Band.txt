 Michael Steele, Susanna Hoofs, and Debbi and Vicki Peterson make up Bangles, one of the best musical acts to come from the '80s.  With hits such as "Manic Monday," "Hazy Shade of Winter," "Walk Like an Egyptian," and many others, their '60s-influenced style and great vocals made them a stand-out group. This album showcases some of their best work.  They covered many styles, such as the rock influenced cover of Simon and Garfunkel's "Hazy Shade of Winter" to the more romantic touches of "Manic Monday" and "Eternal Flame" to pop rock with "Walk Like an Egyptian" and "In Your Room."  Some of their best work is from their first album "All Over the Place" and is represented by "Hero Takes a Fall" and "Going Down To Liverpool." This is one great album and is a must-have for fans of the '80s and of Bangles.
