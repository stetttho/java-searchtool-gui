 Dublin, Ireland; 1915.  James Mack is a young scholar, a bit naive about the world, but is learning much about it from his daily swimming lessons at the Forty Foot with his friend Doyler.  Doyler could have been a scholar, too, but his parents sent him to work straight away.  The plight of the working man in Ireland is his, and he strongly wants to bring an end to the British dominion over his homeland.  Through their swims, the bond of friendship strengthens, eventually turning into a bond of love between them, and they make a pact that in one year, they will swim together to the beacon at Muglins Rock and cliam it for Ireland.  But, whereas Doyle is sure of himself and his feelings for Jim, Jim is unsure of the emotions playing inside his mind. This poignant and emotional story is set in the changing landscape of Ireland during WWI.  Young men are serving England in the War, and rumors of rebellion abound in Ireland.  Jamie O'Neill has done a marvelous job of incorporating Jim Mack and Doyler into these events, and while their relationship is the main focus, the events of the world don't take a backseat to it.  Instead, they add to the drama and the emotional impact of the decisions that each of the characters make. the characters are wonderfully drawn with Jim Mack and Doyler being the opposites of one another.  They are eventually brought together through the mentorship of Anthony MacMurrough, a man with a penchant for young boys.  With him as guide, both boys learn to be proud of  who they are and to accept themselves.  This is a wonderful story of love and self-discovery set in a time of uncertainty and is a must-read.
