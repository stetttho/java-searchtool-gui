 I admit that I'm a bit biased. Horror and dark  fantasy stories have always been of keen interest to  me, ever since reading "The Shining" by Stephen King.   They are the kind of books that I just can't seem to  put down. And, "Trysts" is no exception.    The thirteen stories in this collection take the  reader from a session with a ouija board to the dark,  back alleys of New Orleans, from the grotesqueries of  an artists' studio to a "Fallen Area" where nothing is  what it seems anymore. Each story has great  characters and is visually appealing and imaginative.   (Just thinking about the statues in "Cries Beneath the  Plaster" makes me shiver.) Some horror/dark fantasy  has a tendency to get stale, with the same types of  characters being overused, but Berman's have just the  right amount of uniqueness to make them stand out.    A must-read for any fan of horror/dark fantasy and a  great addition to gay fiction.
