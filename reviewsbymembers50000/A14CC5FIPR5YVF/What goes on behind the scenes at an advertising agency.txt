 The London arm of Millers Shanks, an international advertising agency, is trying to land the Coca-Cola account.  Through a series of e-mails, we get to see the entire process, including the in-house romances, the back-stabbing, the ineptness of some in upper management, the gossip.  Author Matt Beaumont has created a juicy and comic novel about life behind the scenes, and even more amazing, it's told completely via e-mail.  At first glance, you may think this would make the storytelling more difficult, but after a few pages, you pick up on personalities and quirks and soon forgetting that the book is a series of emails.  Wonderful characters, a great story, a fantastic novel.
