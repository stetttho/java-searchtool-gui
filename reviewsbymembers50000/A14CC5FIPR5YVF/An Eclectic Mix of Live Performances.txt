 This collection of live recordings is taken from LA-based radio station K-CRW's "Sounds Eclectic" series of broadcasts.  Each performance was recorded live in their studios with the choicest tracks being released on this great CD.  The tracks cover a wide variety of music genres: from Kinky's Spanish-language track "Mirando De Lado" and the bombastic and joyful "It's the Sun" from The Polyphonic Spree to more mellow tracks such as "Answer" from Sarah McLachlan and the quielty beautiful "The Blower's Daughter" from Damien Rice.  There's a little bit of everything, and that's what makes this a great recording - it introduces you to artists to which you may not normally lend an ear.  Favorite tracks:  "Amongst Butterflies" by Paul Weller and "Flying High" by Jem.
