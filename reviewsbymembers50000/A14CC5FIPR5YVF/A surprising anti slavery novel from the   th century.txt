 Young Oroonoko, a Prince of Surinam, falls in love with a beautiful young maid named Imoinda.  but unbeknownst to Oroonoko, his grandfather the King also has designs on the young maid.  While the Prince is away, the King sends his vail to Imoinda, a sign that he wants to bed her.  She reluctantly goes and staves off all his advances, professing her love for Oroonoko. Upon his return, Oroonoko learns what happened to his love and finds her at the King's seraglio.  they share a night together, but when the King finds out, he sells Imoinda as a slave, telling Oronooko that she died. Despondent, Oroonoko is tricked by a British captain and becomes a slave.  Taken to a new land, he accidently discovers his true love Imoinda and determines to escape the bonds of slavery no matter what it takes.  This story deals with true love and is probably one of the first novels to deal with the issue of slavery -- even though it wasn't a hotbed issue during the 1680's.  The characters are very well-defined, either incredibly good or monstrous, even though they sometimes act more over-the-top or overly dramatic than normal.  Oroonoko himself is even based upon a real prince that Behn had met from Surinam.  It does take a bit to get used to the lingo and word usage of the 17th century, but I found myself seriously enjoying the story.
