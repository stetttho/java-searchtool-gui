 Norwegian-born singer/songwriter Sondre Lerche has a clean sound, just guitars, some strings, drums, a great voice and intelligent lyrics.  Nothing like the over-produced, electronic-infused pop most people hear on US radio today.  A very refreshing change.  Some of the best songs on this CD are "Dead passengers," "You know so well," "Virtue and wine," and "No one's gonna come."  Plus, the US release of the CD contains a wonderful bonus track called "Rosebud" and the video for "You know so well."  A great CD!!
