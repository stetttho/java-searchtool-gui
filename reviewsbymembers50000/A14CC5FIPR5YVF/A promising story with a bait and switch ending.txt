 Five young classmates agree to be locked for three days in a cellar, which they refer to as "the hole," located beneath a seldom-used school building.  Masterminded by a sixth classmate, Martyn -- known around school for his stunning pranks -- he's set the five up for more than they bargained for.  After the three days, Martyn doesn't appear, then the water and electricity stop.  The five begin to realize that they may never leave the whole.  Or is there more to Martyn and this "prank" than they were lead to believe? "The Hole" starts a well-crafted story that slowly builds its suspense through both the story of the five in the hole and through remembrances from a survivor.  But, just when I found the conclusion to be very satisfying, an epilogue is thrown in that tossed in many confusing new questions about the reliability of the survivor and the veracity of the events I'd just read.  If this ending had been hinted at throughout the book, I probably would have found the epilogue more palatable than I did.  Instead, I felt cheated and disappointed.
