 In a series of letters to an un-named friend, the narrator talks about his life: the death of his father, his quest to be a writer, his interesting and varied sex life, even bits of the novel he's working on. In reading over the snippets of critic reviews from when the novel was first published in 1964, I can understand why, for them, it had such an impact, comparing it to "Tom Jones" and "Lady Chattereley's Lover."  The narrator's exploits would have shocked society and effected the sexual revolution of the 1960's.  His mother wants him to get a good job with a large company; he wants to be a writer and goes through a series bad, low-pay jobs instead.  He is engaged to two women (one of whom he's lied to in order to get to bed with her).  His circle of friends is populated with odd characters such as Jose who is infatuated with his cousin Rita, a nun at the local convent, and plans on marrying her.  The narrator's openness about discussing sex is shocking for the time. But, today, they have lost their shock value.  We are so inundated with sexual weirdness and innuendos in the media that the narrator's exploits don't effect us in the same way.  He's just a man who enjoys sex.  That does not detract from the readability of the book.   In fact, the novel which the narrator is writing -- concerning a man who loses his floggis and becomes invisible -- is one of the best things about this book and makes it worth reading.  It is a good glimpse into sexuality and society of that time period.
