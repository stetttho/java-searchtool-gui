 This contains only a small sampling of author Ambrose Bierce's work with ghost and horror stories.  Most are the ghost sotries we are used to with vengeful spirits or loved ones trying to connect to the world of the living, but have just the right little twist to make them unique.  In "The Middle Toe of the Right Foot," for example, what starts out as a duel in an empty house ends up with the death of a duelist by the ghosts that inhabit the palce and recognize him.  Other stories deal with man's own fear of the unknown, such as in "The Man and the Snake" or "A Watcher of the Dead," in which the characters literally scare themselves to death.  The most unique story in this collection, though, is the last one titles "Moxon's Master," which gives a dealy warning about the progress fo man and machine.  These are all great tales to read aloud by the campfire and are sure to send just the right amount of chills down your spine.
