 A troubled man tries to visit the Oracle at Delphi but is turned away by the priests.  Undaunted, he learns that a sibyl, or female prophet, is living in exile with her son somewhere in the mountains along the sacred path to the temple.  He finds her and begs that she listens to his tale and guide him along his path.  The stranger relates his story about a being cursed by the Christ to wander endlessly. In response, she tells her own story of becoming a pythia, or priestess of the Oracle at Delphi.  The novel is a look into the meanings of love and faith and how humans try to reconcile themselves with the divine.  When the stranger is cursed because of his inhospitality, he's outraged and cannot understand why a god would do such a thing.  The sibyl sees both sides of her god, realizing that he is both good and evil, and accepts what happens.  And it's not preachy, trying to tell the reader that religion is the ultimate answer or that one religion is better than the other.  (I didn't feel as though someone was trying to convert me.)  "The Sibyl" is an interesting and enjoyable novel.
