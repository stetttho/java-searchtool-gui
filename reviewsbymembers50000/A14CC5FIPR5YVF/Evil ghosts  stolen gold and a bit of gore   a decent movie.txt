 At salvage crew sets out for the Bering Sea to locate a deserted ship and to bring her back in.  One stormy night, they come across the ship, almost out of nowhere, and it turns out to be none other than the Antonio Graza, an Italian cruise ship lost at sea in 1962.  The crew's captain recalls that every salvage crew around the world has been looking for this ship and its cargo of gold bars.  Eerie things start to happen, such as the sighting of a young girl, music replacing the chatter on the walkie talkies, a digital watch found in the helm.  Soon, the salvage crew is fighting for their lives against the evil forces at work in the ship. This is a decent movie, if somewhat predictable.  Julianna Margulies (as Maureen Epps) and Emily Browning (as Katie Hargrove) are both quite good and wind up being the only characters I cared about.  What really stands out in this movie are the special effects and the creepy atmosphere of the ship.  The opening sequence alone is quite ingenious and sets the mood for the enitre film.  The interior of the ship itself is dark and gloomy, and ranges from narrow, claustrophobic hallways to cavernous, tomb-like rooms. Also, some of the extras on the DVD are worth watching, such as the featurette about how all the gore sequences were created.  There is also a game which, if played correctly, reveals some insight into the events of that fateful night when the Antonio Graza disappeared.   The overall story is a bit formulaic, but with just enough visual candy to make it worth while.
