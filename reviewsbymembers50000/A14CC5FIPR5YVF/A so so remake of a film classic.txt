 Marion Crane (Anne Heche) steals $400,000 from her boss and flees from Phoenix, AZ, to California to meet with her boyfriend Sam Loomis (Viggo Mortensen).  Along the way, a heavy rainstorm forces her to seek shelter at the Bates Motel, where she meets Norman Bates (Vince Vaughan), an odd fellow who enjoys stuffing birds, is very devoted to his mother, and hides a twisted little secret. Gus Van Zant's remake is only so-so at best.  Most remakes try to update the film, adding new technology or bringing some of the themes up-to-date.  Van Zant's remake is shot-for-shot with the only changes being that the film is entirely in color and that he's added a few non-sensical images to the murder sequences.  With some of the scenes, the viewer can tell they were shot either in front of a green screen or in front of a movie background, making it appear very stagy and dated.  Also, the color takes away some of the menace that is created in the original black-and-white.  Most of the cast does an admirable job, including Anne Heche as Marion Crane, who portrays the nervousness and anxieties of her character extremely well.  Vince Vaughan is miscast and over-the-top as Norman Bates, making him too menacing and too unsympathetic.  The supporting cast is okay with Julianne Moore, William H. Macy and Viggo Morensen. One other good point of the film is Danny Elfman's presentation of the Bernard Hermann score.  No changes to it, but it does prove how important music can be to setting the mood for a film, and that urgent violin strain in the shower sequence still causes chills.  But overall, this movie remake is only so-so.
