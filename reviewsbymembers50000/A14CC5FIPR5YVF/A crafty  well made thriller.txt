On the advice of family and friends, Paula moves out of the country, to live with a family friend.  After many years, she falls in love with Gregory Anton, and he convinces her to move back into her Aunt's house.  Nothign has changed since she left 10 years ago, but Gregoy persuades her to remove her Aunt's belongings in order to keep those painful memories at bay.  Soon after moving in, though, strange things start to happen.  The gaslights mysteriously dim each night, followed by strange noises coming from the closed off upper floor.  Paula begins to lose and to misplace things, convinced by Gregory that she must rest or the strain would get to her.  On one of their few outings, for she is somewhat unstable around the outside world, a strange recognizes her and soon discovers that things are not as they seem and that her husband maybe up to something involving her Aunt's hidden jewels which have never been found. Director George Cukor presents a remarkably thrilling film, with superb acting from Ingrid Bergman (in an Oscar-winning performance) as Paula Alquist, Chalres Boyer as her mysterious husband Gregory Anton, Joseph Cotten as Inspector Brian Cameron, and Angela Lansbury in her first screen role as the maid Nancy Oliver.  The captivating story of a woman struggling to maintain her sanity is marvelously portrayed on-screen.  Bergman fills her character with  enough frayed nerves and self-doubt that you feel right along with her.  Boyer is both menacing and debonair and gives off just the right amount of malice to make you bite your nails as you watch the film. This is a first-rate thriller that will keep you glued to the screen!
