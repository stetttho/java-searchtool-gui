 Walter Van Tilburg Clark's classic novel begins like many Westerns: two ranchers, Art Croft and Gil Carter, ride into the town of Bridger's Wells.  They stop at the saloon, have a few drinks after which a poker game begins followed by a fight.  Things change quickly when a young man storms into town with a tale of murder and cattle rustling.  Though he hasn't actually seen any of the events he's describing, the young man's tale is strong enough to insense the men in the bar.  They form a lynch mob and go after the murderers and rustlers. "The Ox-Bow Incident" is told through the eyes of Art Croft.  From him, we see and hear Farnley who is dead set on forming the mob to exact justice; of Osgood and Davies, who both try to convince the group that justice can only be handled properly by the law; and Art himself who has doubts about the lynch mob but goes along, like every other man. This is a story about who determines what is right and wrong and how justice should be determined with all the facts instead of partial truths and one-sided ideals.  It deals with the mob mentality and its consequences.  Not your typical fare with a Western.  Clark expertly handles the subject matter, and as I was reading, I felt as though I were part of the mob, knowing the mob is not right but powerless to do anything to stop it, swept along for the ride and the outcome.  A definite classic.
