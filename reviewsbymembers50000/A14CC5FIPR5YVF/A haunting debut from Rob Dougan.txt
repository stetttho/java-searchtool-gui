 Australian-born Rob Dougan injects some much-needed originality into the 2003 music scene.  His debut album, "Furious Angels," is filled with haunting music and intelligent lyrics, all backed with full orchestra, that show of his talents as both a singer and a songwriter.  His smoky, Leonard Cohen-esque voice blends in with his music and adds to the emotion on such songs as "Furious Angels," "Left Me For Dead," "One And The Same," and "I'm Not Driving Anymore."  His instrumental songs are equally praiseworthy, including the tracks "Will You Follow Me?" and "Clubbed To Death," to name a few.  Their mix of traditional orchestra and electronics give them a cinematic feel. The second disc contains instrumental versions of many of the songs, as well as the videos for "Furious Angels" and "Clubbed To Death."  A fantastic album.  One of the standouts of 2003.
