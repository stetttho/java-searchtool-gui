 Diane Ffitch is being called back to the Glastonbury Tor.  She sees it in visions, in objects transforming in front of her eyes into the Tor.  The pull is strong enough that she quits her job, leaves her fianc and tags along with a group of New Agers heading for Glastonbury -- but with a sense of dread. Joe Powys, an occult author, is having strange experiences of his own.  Books are throwing themselves from a bookshelf, with one in particular seeming to be at the center: "A Glastonbury Romance."  Reluctantly, he travles to Glastonbury on the pretext of writing a book but soon finds out that dark forces are stirring in the town.  He hears the tales of a dark chalice -- an anti-Holy Grail -- and begins to wonder just what role Diane has to play in this. Another fine work from Phil Rickman.  The characters are all interesting and well-developed.  Plus, he gives enough background information on the people and the area's history  that I was enthralled with the story.  A definite page-turner.
