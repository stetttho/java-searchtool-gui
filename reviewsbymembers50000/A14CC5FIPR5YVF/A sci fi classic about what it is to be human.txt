 Dr. Kris Kelvin, a psychiatrist, is sent to find out what happened to a crew in orbit above the planet Solaris.  Upon arriving, he discovers that one of the crewmembers committed suicide and only two more remain.  But, they are not entirely alone.  Kris also learns that the planet can create people from the crewmembers' pasts and gives life them.  Soon, he has fallen under Solaris' ways as his deceased wife, Hari,  appears in his cabin. Director Andrei Tarkovsky has created visually stunning movie discusses what it means to love and to be a human being.  Filled with fine acting performances by Donatas Banionis as Kris Kelvin and Natalya Bondarchuk as his dead wife Hari, the film relies much more on storytelling than special effects.  The only drawback to the film is its length.  A few scenes seem to drag on forever with no point to them.  But, those can be easily overlooked. Don't confuse this with the George Clooney remake!  There is no comparison between the two.
