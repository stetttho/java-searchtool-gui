 An American, now living in Europe, creates an homage to his lover that he let slip away.  He reviews his life, from childhood and his unstable upbringing to the self-made end of his perfect relationship and on through the aftermath of various lovers in whom all he can see are aspects of his one true love.  through poetic use of language and masterful imagery, White has crafted a unique novel about what happens when you shut out the one person who means so much to you.  It's by no means an easy read, and I admit that I had to re-start after 20 pages because I was trying to zip through such a short novel.  This novel deserves to be read slowly so that the words and images can make an impact on you, otherwise you will miss something.
