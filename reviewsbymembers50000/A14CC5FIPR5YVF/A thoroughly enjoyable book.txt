 This quirky novel tells the story of Jeanette, who is  adpted into a very devout, Evangelical house in  England. As she grows, she begins to realize how  different she is from the people around her, whether  it's the reaction of teachers and students to her  religious views at the public school (the 'Breeding  Ground,' as her mother calls it) or her "unnatural  passion" for young Melanie who works at the fish stall  in the local market.    Her views of God, religion and the search for  perfection are all challenged by her desire to learn  more about herself. At one point, she is locked into  a room for 32 hours to "purge her of the demons" when  her church discovers her relationship with Melanie.   Through all the obstacles, she remains true to  herself.    This book is filled with both humor and drama, as well  as strong characters: the strong-willed Mother whose  ideas of God and religion make an imprint on  Jeanette's view of the world; Elsie, the only woman  who seems to truly understand what Jeanette is going  through and how to deal with it; and Jeanette herself,  a sharp young girl with strong opinions of right and  wrong and learns that it is okay to be different.
