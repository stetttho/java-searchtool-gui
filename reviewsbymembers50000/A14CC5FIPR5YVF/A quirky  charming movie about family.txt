 April Burns decides to invite her estranged family to her new apartment in New York's Lower East Side to enjoy a homemade Thanksgiving meal and to meet her new boyfriend, Bobby.  Problems start to crop up, though, as her stove breaks down and she must hunt through her apartment building (on Thanksgiving Day) to find a stove that works.  Jim and Joy Burns have problems of their own, with their other two children trying to convince them not to go to April's and the whole family struggling with Joy's terminal illness and their feelings regarding April. Writer/Director Peter Hedges has crafted a quirky and uniquely charming film, with more of a home movie look to it.  At times, this detracts from the film because a few of the shots are unsteady.  The cast is wonderful, with Katie Holmes as April, Oliver Platt as Jim Burns, the wonderful Alice Drummond as Grandma Dottie, and Derek Luke as Bobby.  Patricia Clarkson is fantastic as Joy Burns, juggling her feelings toward her estranged daughter with her terminal illness and her family's treatment of her.  Also making a fine appearance is Sean Hayes as Wayne, the man with the new stove who lives in 5D.  The cast works very well together, bringing home the message that family means togetherness no matter what. The DVD contains both the Full-Screen and Widescreen versions of the film along with audio commentary and a nice "Making Of" featurette.  The movie had me both laughing and near tears toward the end, and just left me with a good feeling.  It's definitely a charming film.
