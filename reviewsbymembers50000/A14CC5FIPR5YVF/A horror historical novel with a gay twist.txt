 Cole Seavey is a frontiersman traveling through Ohio during the winter of 1799.  During a fierce storm, he happens upon a terrified and severly injured young girl, lost in the woods, but is attacked by some kind of creature before he can save the girl.  A handsome young Delaware brave named Pakim stumbles across the terribly wounded Cole and takes him to a cabin near the town of Hugh's Lick.  Days later, he awakens, trying to piece together what happened with that strange creature as well as trying to understand his strange feelings for Pakim, believing them to be caused by his high fever.  Soon, townsfolk began disappearing; animals are slaughtered; tales of an Indian demon -- a wendigo -- begin to work their way through Hugh's Lick.  Cole and Pakim set out to put an end to this demon before more deaths occur.  A very interesting historical novel that interweaves two good stories: the mystery surrounding the wendigo and the coming out of Cole Seavey as he begins to understand his feelings for Pakim.  Being a fan of horror novels, author Michael Jensen handled the wendigo aspect of the story with much tension, gore and suspense to satisfy me.  Eerie forests, thick fogs, and the fear of the unkown and unseen are used well by Jensen to heighten the creepy feel of the book.  He also handles the homosexual aspect of the book equally well, showing Cole trying to come to terms with his new feelings for Pakim which shows him insight into his own past, and also portraying how 18th Century America felt toward what they considered a deviant lifestyle, with the characters of John Chapman -- who later became the American folk legend Jonnhy Appleseed -- and his partner, Palmer, who are forced to live on the outskirts of Hugh's Lick.  I found this book hard to put down and finished it in one sitting.  Guess you could say that I liked it.
