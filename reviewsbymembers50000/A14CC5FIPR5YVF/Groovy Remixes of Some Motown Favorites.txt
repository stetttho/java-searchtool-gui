 Take a collection of classic Motown recordings, allow some of the best DJs to re-mix the master tapes and what do you get?  Some of the grooviest updates of these classics.  Eddie Kendricks' "Keep on Truckin'" becomes even funkier thanks to DJ Spinna.  "I Heard It Through the Grapevine" by Gladys Knight and the Pips  -- as reworked by The Randy Watson Experience -- is packed with even more soul (and that gorgeous voice of Ms. Knight's).  Some different arrangements are thrown in to make the classics sound new and fresh, such as "My World is Empty Without You" by Diana Ross & the Supremes, which is slowed down and becomes more of a plaintive message of lost love in the hands of Lionel Sanchez, Jr.  Other artists remixed on the album include The Temptations, The Jackson 5, Rick James, Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder, all mixed flawlessly.  My favorites: "Quiet Storm" by Smokey Robinson remixed by David Baron and Rafe Gomez and "The Tears of a Clown" from Smokey Robinson and the Miracles, remixed by Hotsnax.  AS it reads in the liner notes: "The groove goes on."
