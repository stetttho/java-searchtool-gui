 "Grab Bag" contains two novels from Canadian author Derek mcCormack.  The first -- "Dark Ride" -- weaves the tale of a young gay man learning about his sexuality and trying to find love.  The main character's rage at the world and himself comes through flawlessly.  The second novel -- "Wish Book" -- tells the story of a young man trying to make money during the Great Depression by working as a carny then at a department store and finally as a door-to-door salesman.  McCormack's style is very minimal, with words chosen carefully to paint a uniquely dark picture, something akin to a Ray Bradbury story.  The problem sometimes, though, is that the style takes precedence over the story, as in "Wish Book" which took me a while to figure out what was going on.  Overall, this is a good colleciton of McCormack's novels, with the first being much stronger than the second.  An interesting read.
