 Former tennis pro Tony Wendice found out many months ago that his wife Margot was in love with another man, Mark Halliday, an American author of crime novels.  After many weeks of planning, Tony sets in motion the perfect plan to kill his wife.  The only problem is, as Halliday unknowningly remarks, there's no such thing as a perfect murder, and when something goes wrong, Tony has to quickly formulate another plan to do away with his wife.  This is a classic of suspense from director Alfred Hitchcock, based upon a very successful stage play.  All the actors - Ray Milland, Grace Kelly, Robert Cummings and John Williams - all give fine performances, but Milland's as Tony Wendice is a standout.  You're instantly won over by his conniving charm, and I admit to following his plan with a tiny bit of satisfaction.  He's never over-the-top, remaining perfectly cool and collected even when things go awry.  Hitchcock's directorial style also keeps the viewer confined to the apartment, only venturing outside very infrequently.  As with the play, much of the action takes place in that small space, and Hitchcock uses it to his advantage with intricate staging and camera angles.  The DVD is wonderfully clear with sharp sound as well.  The two featurettes are equally worth watching, especially the one on 3D.  I never knew that the film was originally shot as a 3D feature, and this goes into some detail about how Hitchcock set up many of the shots without relying too much on the effects.  Even as a flat screen movie, the film works perfectly.  This movie is a genuine pleasure to watch and should be part of any movie buff's collection.
