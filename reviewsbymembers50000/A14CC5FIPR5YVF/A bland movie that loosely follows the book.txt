 In 1774 Peru, five people are crossing the hundred-year-old bridge of San Luis Rey when it suddenly collapses, plunging the five to their deaths.  Witness to this startling event is Brother Juniper who decides to find out why God has chosen those particular five people to bring into His realm.  He travels to Lima to meet with Uncle Pio, a local character who knows everyone and everything surrounding Lima.  From Pio, Brother Juniper learns how the lives of the five were connected to one another. Sort of.  The movie focuses on only four of the characters, and three of them in a very secondary sort of way.  The fifth character, an old man who was transporting grain, is mentioned only in passing.  To me that was disappointing, after having read the book, because each of the characters has his or her own unique story which connects with the others.  The acting is very wooden, with too many varying accents and some with no accents at all, so it's difficult to believe the film takes place in Peru.  (The Spanish viceroy looks and talks decidedly British, whereas Micaela has an American accent, and Uncle Pio sounds Russian when he speaks.) The one good aspect from this film is the score by Dimitri Tiomkin, which was nominated for an Academy Award.  However, even that gets marred by the poor sound quality of this DVD transfer.  It fades in and out too much, and at times, I could not hear what was being said. See this movie if you must, but the book is better.
