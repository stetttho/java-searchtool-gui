 Almost everyone knows the story of "The Lin King," of how Simba becomes the king he was meant to be, but does anyone know the  story behind the scenes?  Finally, the truth comes out in this fun re-telling of the now-classic  movie, told by Timon the meerkat and Pumbaa the warthog.   It begins with Timon's family of meerkats, tunneling their way through the savannah.  He doesn't feel that he belongs and wants to explore, to find the right place for him.  So he sets off across the grasslands, running into Rafiki the baboon who tells him to search beyond what he sees for Hakuna Mata.  In the grasslands, Timon runs into Pumbaa the warthog, and together, they set off in search of their paradise.  Along the way, we get to see just how Timon and Pumbaa fit into the story of Simba.  And, they happened to be everywhere, from Simba's debut to the animals to the wildebeast stampede. I absolutely loved this movie.  Not only does it mesh well with "The Lion King," but it doesn't take itself too seriously.  Timon and Pumbaa constantly break in during the film to give some kind of commentary on the scene, or to get a fresh bag of grubs.  The Disney team even managed to get many of the original voices to return: Nathan Lane as Timon, Ernie Sabella as Pumbaa, Robert Guillaume as Rafiki, Matthew Broderick as Simba, and Whoopi Goldberg and Cheech Marin as the hyenas.  Some fresh, new voices have been added as well, including Julie Kavner as Timon's Ma and Jerry Stiller as his Uncle Max. The extras on both discs are pretty good, especially the delted scenes and the Hidden Mickey Hunt.  Peter Graves makes a special appearance as the narrator for the short feature: "Timon: Behind the Legend."  This is a fun film that everyone in the family will enjoy.
