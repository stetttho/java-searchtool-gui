 In 1931 Berlin, 8 children have fallen victim to a murderer.  Suspicion abounds on the city streets, and the police have very few leads to follow.  To expand their search for the killer, the police raid the dens of the underworld, infuriating the crime bosses.  How could the police think that a murderer of children would be included in their ranks!!  They may be theives and prostitutes, but even they wouldn't stoop so low as to harm a child.  In an effort to rid themselves of such a terrible mark, the criminals take it upon themselves to track down and to bring their own form of justice this terrible person. "M" is Fritz Lang's first "talkie" and is filled with great camera shots and very little sound.  Sound is only used when necessary, giving this a great mix of the silent era and the new age of the talking pictures.  The story is wonderfully told and displays one of the finest performances of Peter Lorre's acting career.  His portrayal of the child killer is chilling and beautifully acted.  An incredible film.
