 Handsome, young detectives Frank and Joe Hardly travel home to Lake Merrimen, Illinois to find that their parents, world-reknowned detective Fennel Hardly and his loving wife, Mrs. Hardly, have been kidnapped and rumors are spreading about Mr. Hardly's being a Russian spy. Meanwhile, Nancy Clue, girl detective and snappy dresser, ventures with her friends to the Lake Merrimen Auditorium to view the annual dog show.  But something's amiss as she and her friends follow a scream only to discover that all the toy poodles have been dognapped! Could the two incidents have anything in common?  What is the terrible secret that Fennel Hardly keeps locked in his closet?  Will Nancy ever win back her true love -- Cherry Aimless, Registered Nurse -- from the handsome, streetwise San Francisco girl detective Jackie Johnson? Join Nancy and her friends as they dive into this hilarious, gay/lesbian spoof of the Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew mysteries.  Mabel Maney has constructed a fabulous world full of sharp characters --  each with a very keen fashion sense -- and thrown in many a surprising twist that kept me enthralled with the events of the mystery.  Her style is very descriptive and conjures up the 1950s mindset.  I could not help but smile as I was reading.  A great read for everyone!
