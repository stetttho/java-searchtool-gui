 From the beginning of motion picture history, gay men and women have played an important part in movie history.  This wonderful film documents the roles of gay and lesbian characters in film, taking the viewer from the early days, when gay men were obvious characters in films.  Gay men were always portrayed as the man wearing to much makeup, walking with a definite mincing gait, or playing the sissy. Then, came the Hayes Commission, designed to keep the movie industry up to some form of moral code.   This didn't stop the appearance of gay and lesbian characters; it only hid them, such as the character of Mrs. Danvers in 1940s "Rebecca" by Alfred Hitchcock.  It's never stated that she is a lesbian, but her obsession with the former mistress of the house, keeping her bedroom as it used to be, even her overall bearing -- all these let the moviegoer know who/what she is without disturbing the Hayes Commission policies.  It's only recently that movies have portrayed openly gay and lesbian characters without fear of a gigantic backlash and in a positive light.  "Jeffrey," "Kissing Jessica Stein," "The Boys in the Band" are just a few examples of this openness. When I first saw this film in the theater, I never knew how large the GLBT presence was in front of the camera.  it made me go back and watch many films again, with a new understanding of the characters.  With a wonderful narration by Lily Tomlin, this movie is a must-see for any chronicler of GLBT history, any cinophile or any movie buff.
