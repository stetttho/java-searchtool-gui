 Three homeless people are celebrating Christmas Eve together.  Gin is a former bicycle racer who left his family after amounting incredible gambling debts; Hana is a drag queen who left the safety of her surrogate family after a violent incident at a bar; Miyuki is a young girl who ran away from home after a fight with her father.  While rummaging through a garbage heap, they hear a baby crying and find an infant girl hidden among the trash.  Determined not to let the child have unhappy memories of Christmas, Hana convinces the others that they need to find the child's family.  Along their journey, each is forced to confront his or her own past and what forced them to turn away from their families.   Filled with beautifully animated scenery, great stories about friendship and family, and just a hint of the magical, director Satoshi Kon has crafted a marvelous anime film that goes beyond the futuristic action that I've usually associated with anime.  The characters are very human, very believable.  It shows you just what animation can do as a storytelling medium.
