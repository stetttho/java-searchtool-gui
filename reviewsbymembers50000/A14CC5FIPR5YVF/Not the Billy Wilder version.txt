 Don Birnam is ecstatic when his brother Wick finally leaves their apartment for a long weekend in the country.  Free of the constant watching, he is incredibly happy and feels even better after the second drink. Throughout the five days, Don drinks, makes and forgets promises, discovers numerous brilliant ideas for writing and dismisses them just as quickly, loses track of time.  His mind takes him on a guilt-ridden trip through past experiences and hallucinations: in the backseat of a carriage with young Mel Ostler, his expulsion from a fraternity due to an "unhealthy" attachment to one of the brothers, his failed romances with Anna and Helen.  And, during one of his blackouts, he awakens in a hospital with a black eye.  The stocky male nurse comforts him and confides that "I know who you are." This novel does a fine job of detailing what happens to someone in the grips of alcoholism: the desparate need, the hallucinations, the blackouts, etc.  It is fast-paced and you get the feeling that you are living every moment with Don.  Kind of a roller coaster ride and worth every minute.
