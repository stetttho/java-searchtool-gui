 Tyler Monroe's partner -- Andy jones -- disappears after 15 years together.  No note. No reason.  He seeks the help of private eye Jake Lieberman.  Jake, thinking that maybe Andy wanted a change of pace after 15 years, reluctantly takes the case after realizing how heartbroken Tyler is. During the first night of Jakes' search, Ty receives a mysterious phone call, telling him to come alone to get Andy.  Sensing something suspicious, Jake tags along and the meeting ends in gunfire.  His interest now piqued, Jake finds out that Andy's disappearance isn't just a case of the seven-year-itch.  Somehow, it's tied in with a strong political family, and now, it's Jake's job to find out just what's going on. Overall, this is an average mystery novel.  The characters are okay, but there isn't enough about them to really get involved with or to care about them.   Some of the writing is a little too clichd, as if the author were  trying to get the feel of a Mike Hammer or Philip Marlowe mystery and left me wondering why there were a lot of little bits of information that weren't really necessary.  The story itself is okay and moves quickly.  It's a good book to read while sitting at the beach.
