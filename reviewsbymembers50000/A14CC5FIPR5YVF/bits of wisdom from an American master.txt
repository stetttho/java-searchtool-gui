 This unique book is filled with 245 "fantastic fables" as Ambrose Bierce termed them.  Each one is a classic of Bierce's bitterness and insight into such things as greedy politicians, not-so-holy holy men, legislators, doctors, judges, dogs sheep, lions and diplomats.  Many read more like anecdotes, but in true fable style, he personifies animals as well as ideas, and even creates his own fantastic characters, such as the Pahdour of Patagascar and the Gookul of Madagonia.  Bierce attacks each fable with much of his own sarcasm and satirical style.  He even re-works some of Aesop's reknowned fables to suit his needs.  Fans of Bierce's work will want to add these little gems to his or her collection.
