 E.F. Besnson, the son of an Archibishop of Canterbury, is a master of the ghost story.  This collection contains stories of troubled spirits, both good and evil; sances; vampires; the occult; curses; ancient gods; etc.  All of them show off his remarkable talent for creating an eerie atmosphere and realistic characters, as well as his knowledge of the spirit world, especially with the last entry "The Recent 'Witch-Burning' at Clonmel," an article he wrote for a magazine which describes primitive exorcism practices. One thing I most enjoyed about his stories is that even though the subject matter can become tiresome, Benson interjects enough new twists and types of spirits and other creature to make them feel new and unique.  With "Caterpillars," for example, involving an empty bedroom in which someone passed away from cancer, Besnon creates a materialization of the disease in such a creepingly disgusting way that you are repulsed and entranced at the same time.   Fortunately,  all the stories are classics that are sure to enthrall any ready and to keep them up until the early hours, wanting to read just one more story.
