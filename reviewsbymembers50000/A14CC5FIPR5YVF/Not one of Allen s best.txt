 Take a B-grade, Japanese spy film, write an entirely new script, and dub new tracks with English-speaking actors.  What do you get?  A B-grade Japanese spy film dubbed into English.  Woody Allen's re-wrttien script did not do anything to enhance the movie.  Granted, there are a few good one-liners, plus the first score of a film written entirely by a rock band, The Lovin' Spoonful, but the humor is lacking.  Maybe when the film was first released, the search for the world's best egg salad recipe ("it will make you PLOTZ!) was considered funny.  Now, it just seems outdated and very safe.   I actually enjoyed when Woody Allen cut in with his interview regarding the movie itself.  That's where Allen's sense of humor really shines.  But still, I found it difficult to laugh during this film and had to force myself to watch it all the way through, just to be fair.  Woody Allen has better films out there! The DVD has some okay extras and, if you look hard enough, you can find the egg salad recipe hidden in the main menu.
