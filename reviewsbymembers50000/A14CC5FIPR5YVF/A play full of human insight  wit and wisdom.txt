 Trudy the Bag Lady has made a life for herself on the streets, offering her own bits of wit and wisdom to the passers-by.  Before she wound up on the streets, she was in and out of hospitals, receiving so much electro-shock therapy that she believes her nervous system has been re-wired and now tunes into the bio-rhythms of people around her. Trudy takes us, along with her two alien companions, on a discovery trip to find out what it means to be human and imparting her own impressions on life.  She tunes in a wide array of people, ranging from Agnus Angst, a 15-year-old punk performance artist; Agnus' grandparents Lud and Marie; Chrissy, a recently unemployed workout enthusiast; Lily, an actress currently performing a one-woman show; and many others, both men and women, gay and straight. This play is full of marvelous insight into the human condition and life in the 1980's.  This is very apparent in the incredible second act, in which we follow Lyn from the consciousness-raising times of the 1970's through her rise and fall in the business ranks of the 1980's and her turbulent family life.  Also, all the characters, in one form or another, have some influence on the life of the other characters in the play, whether or not they actually meet: Lyn has an affair with Agnus's mother; Kate, a rich trendsetter, finds a suicide note left by Chrissy lying in the street; Trudy takes the aliens to see Lily's play in order to show them goosebumps. The book also includes still images, from the stage production, of Lily Tomlin, many of which were shot by Annie Leibowitz.  Jane Wagner also created some montages of Lily as the many characters in the play. Full of wit, insight and tenderness, this play stands as a perfect glimpse into understanding society.
