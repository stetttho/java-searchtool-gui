 A new reality TV show is in the works for the British viewing public: Elephant and Castle.  Cameras follow the residents of a neighborhood in one of London's seedier areas, showing their triumphs, their defeats, and just a little bit of fictional intrigue.  The characters: the galmorous Serena Ward, a womand with a little something extra; Jamie Lord, an ex-marine turned hustler who's smitten with Serena; Maureen and Muriel, two devious drag queens trying to break back into show business any way they can; Debbie Wicks, a busty young woman with manipulative parents; Fat Alice who will do anything to get her 15 minutes of fame; and a host of other residents.  "Fly on the Wall" delves into the tricks people will do to get their time in the spotlight, no matter who they step on or the problems they cause.  This is a wonderfully catty novel that gives the reader a no-holds-barred look into the world of reality TV.  Great characters, interesting story lines, and sometimes just plain evil -- this novel delivers.  It sucks you in and doesn't let go, offering tears, laughs, and a devilishly good time.
