 In the summer of 1946, just after the end of WWII, Philip Froelich heads from Oregon to Amphib Island in Seattle to undergo the proceedings for a General Court Martial.  Missing the bus, he manages a ride with another officer, an older, handsome gentleman who has been watching him at the bus station.  Philip relaxes a bit too much along the drive and wakens to find himself cradled against the driver. Unnerved, Philip quickly gets away from the officer once they reach Amphib Island.  Later in the day as he meets with the officer handling his case, he is introduced to the officer from the car, Commander Tim Danelaw, and something stirs inside of him, something he struggles to keep hidden.  Danelaw notices something of Philip's true nature and takes him under his wing, hoping to guide him to understanding and acceptance of who he is.  Danelaw knows that Philip will only truly be happy once he has accepted himself.  Otherwise, his life will be a miserable one. But, Philip is being groomed to take over the family bank, one of the most successful in Oklahoma.  Certain ideals have been set upon him and are fixed into his being.  Yet, he knows that deep down, he has feelings for Tim Danelaw but must keep them hidden both for his family and for his place in society. "Quatrefoil" is a great novel dealing with self-acceptance.  Philip's character grows and changes from the confused, somehwat closed-minded boy at the beginning to a man who understands himself and what makes life happy for him.  He's learned, thanks to Danelaw, how to balance his public life and his private life.  It also gives a positive look at homosexuality in the 1940's without being tawdry and preachy.
