 The story centers on Fred Lemish, a 39-year-old gay man trying to find true love in New York in the late 1970s. In fact, he's told the man he's been dating that he is in love with him and is waiting for his response. In the meantime, we follow Fred and his friends as they party and sex their way through New York gay night life from the Everhard Bath and club openings to the first summer parties on Fire Island. I found this book very difficult to enjoy.  While Fred is agonizing about his boyfriend, Dinky, he's also out at the baths, experimenting. His friends are drugged to a very high degree and are also lamenting about love but having sex with anything and everything that catches their eyes. Kind of hard to warm up to these characters. For me, this book espoused all the negative aspects that we're pounded into me about being gay: everyone does drugs; it's all about sex, sex and sex; and you must have the perfect body (looks, weight, etc.) in order to be accepted into gay society. Maybe on a historical level, this book works to show what gay life was like back in New York in the late '70s. I don't know if that's enough to recommend it as a "must-read."
