 The Russian exploration vessel, the Saint Anna, set sail in 1912 to search for hunting grounds in the North Polar region.  Within a few months, the crew of 33 had become icebound and spent the next year and a half trapped in the ice, drifting farther and farther North.  In 1914, the navigator, Valerian Albanov, decided to risk a trek across the ice with the hope of reaching Franz Josef Land.  13 crewmen set off across the ice, with the remaining 20 choosing to stay on board the ship.  Of the 13 crewmen, only two survived. "In the Land of White Death" is the true account of the trek, as written by Valerian Albanov.  Starting with the few days before leaving, he writes a remarkable story of survival in severely cold conditions, with supplies diminishing and morale quickly ebbing.  It is very detailed with its discriptions not only of the terrain, but of the crew and their physical and mental states throughout the journey.  Translator David Roberts also includes in his epilogue some of the text from the other survivor of the journey, crewman Alexander Konrad.  His take on certain events sheds a whole new lights on certain aspects of their voyage across the ice. This is a remarkable book, both for its story of survival and its glimpse into human nature.  One of the best non-fiction books that I've read.
