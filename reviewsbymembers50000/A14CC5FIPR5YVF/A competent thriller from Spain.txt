 Angela's thesis is on the subject of violence in the media, and in order to aid in her research, she asks her professor to get a movie from the Univerisity's film library.  She also asks Chema, one of her classmates, to help as everyone knows he has a large collection of violent films. The nest day, Angela finds her professor dead in a viewing room at the University, steals the tape he was viewing and takes it to Chema.  They soon discover a snuff film - a filming of an acutal murder in one take.  And, Chema recognizes the girl as a young student who disappeared two years ago.  Together, they set out to discover who made the film.  But Angela soon discovers that Chema is not exactly who he says.  Can she trust him?  And just what role does the university have with this video? A very competent thriller from Spanish director Alejandro Amenabar.  The script has enough twists to keep you guessing as to who is on Angela's side and who is telling the truth.  Plus, with some excellent filming, you can feel Angela's anxiety as she watches the film for the first time, with the picture contrast turned to black, only hearing the sounds. The picture quality of this DVD is a bit grainy, but the sound quality is very good.  There are some nice extras, too.
