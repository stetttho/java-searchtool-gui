 Mun, who has been blind since the age of 2, is given a corneal transplant.  With her sight restored, she must re-learn to view the world.  Along with the wonderous sights, she also begins to see mysterious shadows and ghosts.  Unsure if what she sees is real or imagined, she decides to track down information about whose corneas she received hoping that this will hold the key to her odd visions.  This movie sent shivers up and down my spine from the beginning.  A great story combined with expert direction by the Pang Brothers and effectively creepy music make quite an impresive horror film.  Angelica Lee plays the part of Mun perfectly, as the blind woman who regains her sight.  She cannot tell the difference between real people and ghosts, having never seen the distinction before, and Ms. Lee makes you feel sorry and frightened for her.  This film also contains one of the more frightening and tension-laden scenes since the shower seen in "Psycho."  (You'll think twice about entering an elevator by yourself again.)  The DVD aslso contains a good "Making Of" featurette.  Overall, a great film to add to any horror collection.
