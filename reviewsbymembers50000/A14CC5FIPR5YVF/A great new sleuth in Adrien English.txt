 Adrien English runs a small bookstore in Pasadena, CA.  He also owns one of the largest collections of gay mysteries in the Los angeles area.  His life soon becomes like the subject of one of those mysteries when his best friend, who also works at the bookstore, is found dead -- stabbed to death -- and Adrien is viewed as the main suspect.  He sets out to learn what happened to his friend and along the way, begins to wonder what the motives are behind hunky Detective Jake Riordan's unusual concern for him.  This is a great introduction to a new gay sleuth.  He's not the stereotypical gay man, making it easier to get caught up with his emotions as he delves deeper into the mystery surrounding his friend's death.  The story flows logically and easily and has plenty of twists and turns to keep every mystery fan happy.  Not to mention that all the characters -- from Adrien to Detective Riordan even to the minor character of Angus who fills in at the store -- are well-written and enhance the story, making it more realistic.  This novel is a great introduction to a new sleuth.
