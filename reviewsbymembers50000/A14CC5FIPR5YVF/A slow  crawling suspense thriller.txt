 In a small South American town, where most of the town can barely make enough to get by, a US oil company is in desparate need of men to transport a dangerous cargo of nitroglycerin to a sister oil refinery.  The only problem is that the drive is hundreds of miles over treacherous roads that have already killed many.  Four drifters decide to accept the job and the $2000 that each will receive once the job is done. Henri-Georges Clouzot's  excellent direction and fine screenplay make for one of the most suspenseful films created.  The four main actors also deserve much of the credit:  Yves Montand and Charles Vanel portray the two Frenchman, Mario and Jo, whose relationship begins as friends, but slowly disintegrates as their trek continues.  Peter van  Eyck and Folco Lulli are the other team of Bimba and Luigi whose friendship strengthens.  All four give fine performances and strenghten the suspenseful moments of the film. My only criticism of the film is that the ending seemed predictable.  But, the slow buildup and nail-biting tesnion throughout more than make up for this.  All in all, a great film!
