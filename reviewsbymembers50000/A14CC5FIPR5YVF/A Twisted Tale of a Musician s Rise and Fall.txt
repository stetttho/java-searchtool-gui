 Nudie, the costume designer for a mysterious carnival, takes a shine to up-and-coming countrysinger Hank.  Hank's just been asked to appear at the Grand Ole Opry, and Nudie convinces Hank to allow him to design his clothes.  Soon, it becomes clear that Nudie's intentions are more wicked and devious than what Hank is prepared for.  With minimal and precise words, author Derek McCormack creates a creepy underworld of country music and vamprisim.  He uses only what is necessary and allows the reader's mind to fill in the scenes, offering a very effective story that sent chills down my spine during the last chapter.  A fine, quick read.
