 A group of archaeological students ventures into the woods to find an ancient indian burial ground.  Once they find it, their teacher (played by Richard Hatch) decides to steal the treasure that's hidden inside.  Unwittingly, the team releases an invisible monster that starts hunting the students and killlling them one by one until the treasure is returned. A very B-grade movie with a bad script, lots of overacting, and a comupter-generated creature that is so two-dimensional in appearance that even the creature from "Alien" would be laughing hysterically.  And, like with any B-movie, you alternately groan and laugh at the screen albeit unintentionally.  Tim Thomerson is good as the park ranger and the scenes involving attacks by the creature are done fairly well.  But, the ending makes no sense though the effects are okay. DVD picture and sound quailty are just okay, and there are no extras.  Get this film if you enjoy Mystery Science Theater 3000 because they would have a field day with this film!!!
