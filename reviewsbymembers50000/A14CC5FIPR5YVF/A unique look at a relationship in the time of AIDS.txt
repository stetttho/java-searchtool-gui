 This is an interesting love story about a couple battling against AIDS.  John struggles to keep the relationship with the man he loves, Martin who is living with AIDS.  Martin, however, is bitter at the world for giving him the disease and at John for not having to suffer through his pains and mental anguish.  To get his own feelings out about Martin, AIDS, and the whole gay culture, John writes stories about what life may have been like with Martin if things were different: they meet as children; Martin as a rich philanthropist drawn to the naive John; Martin as a street hustler who meets John on his first visit to New York; and many others.  Each story reflects at what stage their real relationship is at.  It's a unique look at love and relationships in the gay community in the face of AIDS.  But, I will admit that I wasn't sure what was going on; the real relationship of Martin and John is noted by italics, whereas John's stories remain in regular font/text.  Once I realized what was going on, the story was very much enhanced by this form of storytelling.  Dale Peck also has a knack for dealing with human emotions.  Nothing is cheap or wasted, and the actions and reactions fo the characters seem very realistic.  A great book!!!
