 In the very distant future, world overpopulation has become a serious problem. Food levels are quickly dropping. Space is becoming so scarce that an island has been built in the Atlantic to hold the overflow. As a last measure, the government has embraced homosexulaity as a way to curb the population growth. Signs are posted all over London tht read "It's Sapiens to be Homo!" And, society even rewards homosexuality with promotions and higher societal standings. Infanticide is promoted, with state-paid condolences doled out to the families. And, births have been limited to one per family. Beatrice-Joanna Foxe and her husband Tristram have lost their only son, and, by law, are not allowed to have any more. To cope, Beatrice has a tryst with her husband's brother, Derek, who is high up in the Ministry of Infertility and a pretend homosexual. In the meantime, Tristram is passed over for promotion due to the large size of his family (three brothers and one sister). When Tristram learns of his wife's infidelity, he has it our with her in public and is thrown in prison. Beattrice also discovers that she is pregnant again and has to leave London before anyone finds out. As the story progresses, religion and hetero sex do come back into fashion with a bang, as does cannibalism. It becomes rampant and orgiastic, then state-authorized, eventually causing a steady increase in popluation worldwide. To combat this problem the new "War Department" creates Extermination Sessions to start controling population growth as well as something more akin to "Soylent Green." Tristram sees all this first-hand and manages to survive, his one intent to make it back to the woman he loves. An interetsing glimpse into a dark future. For anyone who enjoyed Orwell's "1984" or Huxley's "Brave New World," this book fits well with them.
