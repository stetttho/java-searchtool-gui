 Mark Isham's quiet score, using a variety of  serves to enhance the movie "Crash" rather than to intrude upon it.  Much of the music comes across more as a collection of sounds -- much like a tone poem -- and lingers behind the scene of the film, such as the title song "Crash" and "Hand in Plain Sight."  They add to the sublty to the emotionally charged film.  Other tracks employ a solo female voice, giving it almost a Middle Eastern feel which, for me, always seems very ethereal.  Songs such as "Flames," "Safe Now" and "Saint Christopher" make great use of this quallity.  A few songs do add to the urgency of certain sequences in the film, such as "Siren" which picks up the pace by adding more drums and driving rythms.  But they never overpower the film.  Two other songs -- "In the Deep" performed by Bird York and "Maybe Tomorrow" from Stereophonics -- copmlete this amazing soundtrack.
