 The Little Tramp meets a beautiful young woman selling flowers and falls for her.  As he buys a flower, he discovers that she's blind and that she thinks he's a millionaire.  When he learns of an operation that could restore her sight, he'll do anything -- from shoveling manure in the streets to boxing -- in order to get her the money, even though it means she'll find out who he really is. This is a heart-warming movie filled with all the wonderful comedy stunts that have become a trademark of Charlie Chaplin.  His timing and choreography are perfect and make the humor more believable.  Also, with the advent of the talkies, Chaplin still crafted a masterpiece of silent film making, with a touching story, great performances, and he even wrote the music. A great film that can still make an audience both laugh and cry.
