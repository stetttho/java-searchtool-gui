 A grown-up David Hayden recounts the events during the summer of his twelfth year, the summer that changed his family forever.  At his home in Montana with his father the County Sheriff and his mother, they employed a young Sioux woman named Marie Little Soldier to act as a housekeeper and as a nanny for David.  She became a member of the family, so much so that when she took ill, they called in their own family doctor -- David's uncle (his father's brother) -- to look in on her.  But she refused to be left alone in the room with him, and soon a dark family secret made its way into the open.  A few days later, Marie mysteriously died, changing Hayden family relationships forever.  "Montana 1948" is a quiet novel, filled with insight into the 12-year-old mind when dealing with important issues that threaten the family.  All the characters -- good and bad -- are presented realistically and believably, and as a reader, I really had a sense of what small town life in 1948 Montana must have been like.  Author Larry Watson sets at the heart of his novel the difficulty of having to choose between family and what is right and just, all revealed through the eyes of young David.  Gripping and powerful, this is a remarkable piece of writing.
