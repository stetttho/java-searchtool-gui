 For those of you looking for a good dance mix, this is one of the better ones out there.  The 25 tracks range from pop remixes ("Thank You" by Dido and "We Are All Made of Stars" by Moby) and dance mixes ("They Say Vison" by Res and "Fire" by Dolce) to some great electronica, including "Star Guitar" by Chemcial Brothers, "Nebuchan" by Frank T.RA.X. and "Omnibus" by Laut Sprecher.  The songs segue into one another nicely so you can keep on moving.   One or two of the songs may seem a little off pace, like "the Sound of Goodbye" by Perpetuous Dreamer which appears to slow the beat a little, but overall, this is a good collection of somgs.
