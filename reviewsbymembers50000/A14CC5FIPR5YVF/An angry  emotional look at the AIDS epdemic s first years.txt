 Ben Weeks is witness to the opening years of the epidemic soon to be known as AIDS.  As his friends start dying, he is amamzed at the small amount of knowledge about this new disease.  What's more, he's outraged at lack of responsiveness by the media and by the government.  (The New York Times  wrote 54 articles about the Tylenol poisoning scare of 1982 within a 3-month period, with 4 articles on the front page.   During the first 19 months of the AIDS epidemic, the same paper wrote 7 articles, with only 1 appearing on the front page.)  His anger leads him into becoming an acitivist and creating a Gay Men's health center to spread the word about the epidemic.  But, Ben runs into obstacles from unlikely places: his friends and the gay community who are scared and don't want to have their freedom of promiscuity taken away from them.  And, he also must deal with his partner who contracts the disease. This incredibly angry and powerful play sweeps you up with its emotions, alternately feeling angry and wanting to cry for desparation.  I've read many plays, and this is one of the few that actually makes you feel as though you are the main character. I wanted to scream along with Ben as his frustration grew about the lack of anyone taking notice about the disease.  It's also semi-autobiographical.  Mr. Kramer, at the onset of the epidemic in the early '80's, became very vocal about getting involved against AIDS and started the Gay Men's Health Crisis in New York, from which he was eventually asked to leave because of his outspokenness. A masterful play full of energy and emotion that should definitely be read by everyone.
