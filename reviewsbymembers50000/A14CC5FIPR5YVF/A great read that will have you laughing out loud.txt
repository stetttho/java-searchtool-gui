 The past few months have been terrible for James Zoole.  His apartment's been robbed twice.  His best friend Pete passed away.  He was laid off from the play in which he had a lead role (and rehersals hadn't even started).  His girlfriend Kate dumps him on New Year's Eve.  And, Bobby Seale, his cat, died.  What a way to bring in the new year! Feeling angry and sad, Jimmy decides to hole up in his apartment and to not answer the phone, knowing that if he'd been robbed twice, the burglar was sure to come back again.  Enter Vito Antenucci, a bisexual burglar who returns for a third robbery.  They struggle, and Jimmy knocks Vito out, then ties him to the kitchen counter. Throughout this New Year's Eve together, Jimmy discovers what he's been avoiding in his life and begins to understand that he and Vito aren't that different from each other in what they want from life.  To Jimmy's surprise, he begins to find friendship with his captive.   A few unexpected interruptions from people in Jimmy's life help to liven up this dark comedy from one of the writers of "A Chrous Line."  It's full of strong characters, even those with only minor roles such as Jimmy's Aunt claire, a rich spinster who sublty tries to control Jimmy's life, and Crazy Carmine, a drugged-out sex fanatic who's been trying to get into Jimmy's pants for years.  It's the developing friendship between Jimmy and Vito that drives this story, though.  I wanted them to get together at the end, either as friends or lovers, it didn't matter. I laughed out loud while reading some of the passages.  Though it was written in the 1970's, the humor is defintiely NOT dated.  If you're looking for some light, fun reading, then this is the perfect book for you.
