 Stephen and Danny are the perfect gay couple in New York: both handsome, living in a great house, with well-paying jobs.  Their world is turned upside down, though, when Stephen's parents decide to pay a surprise visit on the couple.  You see, the problem is that Stephen's been lying to his parents.  They know that he and Danny are lovers, but not that they work as hit-men for the mafia.  Stephen's parents think they're caterers. The story lines are okay, with some working very well, like the party that Stepehn and Danny have to cater to hide their real jobs from Stepehn's parents.  Other lines seem underdeveloped, such as one character's parents being part of a militia.  The pacing is slow, and the humor is hit and miss.  When something is funny, it's very funny.  When it's not, you want to fastforward to the next scene. Greg Lauren (Stephen) and Christopher Gartin (Danny) do a great job as the gay couple.   Beth Fowler is also good as Stephen's mother Ada.  And, even though he plays the stereotypical gay man, Edward Hibbert is wonderful as Richard Grayson who is brought in to teach Stephen and Danny's mafia cronies to play gay for a dinner party. This was a fun movie to watch, and I recommend it for anyone who wants a light  comedy.
