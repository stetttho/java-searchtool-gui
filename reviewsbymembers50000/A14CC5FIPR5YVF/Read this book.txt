 This short novel follows one day in the life of George, a 58-year-old English professor at San Tomas State College in Los Angeles, CA.  From the moment he wakes up and shuffles to the bathroom, we are immediately thrust into his perception of life both as a gay man in the 1960s, and without his partner Jim who died in a car accident.  His views are based upon both of these events, sometimes viewing the world as a big, happy joke, and other times as a very hostile place. It's a great character study into something I think we don't read about too often: the life of a gay man in his fifties.  Too often, gay books deal with men in their twenties and thirties, and if someone older than that appears, he's a caricature or stereotype of the dirty old man.  George is very human and is presented in a very realistic manner. Beautifully written.  Definitely worth reading.
