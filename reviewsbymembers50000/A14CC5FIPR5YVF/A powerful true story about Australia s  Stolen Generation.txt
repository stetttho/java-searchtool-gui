 In 1931 Australia, A.O. Neville, working within the boundaries of the law, forcibly removes three half-caste girls from their aboriginal home.  The three girls -- Molly, Daisy and Gracie -- are sent 1,200 miles from their home in Jigalong to a school for children such as themselves, half-aborigine, half-white.  the camp strives to assimilate the children into the white culture through such things as church and disallowing the use of their native language.  Molly is determined, though, to make it back to her mother, and on a day threatening rain, she, Gracie and Daisy escape from the school.  The only way to make it back to Jigalong is to walk the 1200 miles along the rabbit-proof fence that stretches the entire length of Australia. This film tells the true story of the girls' trek across Australia through such dangers as hunger, thirst, the desert and an aboriginal tracker who is just as determined to re-capture them.  With stunning cinematography, a fine script and marvelous direction from Phillip Noyce, the viewer is drawn into this harrowing story.  Peter Gabriel's score suits the setting and subtles acts to enrich the emotional impact of the film.  The acting is equally good with Kenneth Branagh as A.O. Neville who earns the nickname "Devil" and David Gulpilil as the aboriginal tracker.  the best performances, though, come from the three young girls: Tianna Sansbury as Daisy, the youngest; Laura Monaghan as Gracie, who forces herself to escape with Molly; and Everlyn Sampi as Molly, the head-strong young girl determined to let nothing stop them from returing home. This is a powerful true story, full of emotion.  Definitely not one to miss.
