 From the first bars of "Wow" (the first track) Thomas Newman immediately makes you feel as though you're in an underwater world.  This carries over into the main title piece "Nemo Egg (Main Title)," very delicate with piano as the main instrument.    Newman has sprinkled the soundtrack with many other styels and themes that evoke scenes from the movie as well, such as "Mt. Wannahockaloogie" when Nemo sees the fish tank volcano for the first time, and  "Sydney Harbour" which changes the tone from underwater to the hustle and bustle feel of human city life.  Robbie Williams also does a great job with the pop standard "Beyond the Sea" giving it just the right swing feel. It is a good album, and the music flows seamlessly from one track to the other.  But, good as it is, the music tends to work better in context with the movie.  Get this album if you are a Thomas Newman or a Disney Fan.
