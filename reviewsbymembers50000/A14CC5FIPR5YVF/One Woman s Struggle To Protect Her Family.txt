 Knowing that she will be accused of the death of Vera Donovan, her bitchy and mean former employer, Dolores Claiborne turns herself into the police and relates to them the story of her relationship with Vera as well as the details surrounding the death of her husband almost thirty years prior.  Told completely by Dolores and with very little of the supernatural twists and turns we've come to expect from him, Stephen King crafts a remarkable portrait of a woman struggling with an abusive husband, his impact on their family, and of life on Little Tall Island just across the Reach from the mainland.  Dolores comes across as a strong and self-reliant woman very devoted to her family, someone who won't put up with anything from anyone.  Her story is equally as strong as she is -- and yet, the reader only hears her version of events.  Just how reliable can she really be given the circumstances surrounding her tale?  King leaves that up to the reader to draw his or her own conclusions in this compelling tale.
