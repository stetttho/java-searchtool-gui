 Sally Mayes is one incredible singer!  She takes many of these wonderful songs and makes them her own.  Two of the best songs on the album show off not only her singing, but her acting ability: "If" and the  beautiful "Our Private World."  This is a fantastic collection of  songs by Jules Styne, Leonard Bernstein, and many others.  Buy it!!!!!
