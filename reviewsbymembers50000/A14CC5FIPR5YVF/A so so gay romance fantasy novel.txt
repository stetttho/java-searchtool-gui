 Russ is a changeling, or elf child.  As a changeling, he will never grow old and has the ability to change his appearance to man, woman or beast.  He is also gay and trying to find love in modern day San Diego.  One night, while on a date, he runs into Eric who accidentally spills beer all over him.  Russ notices an immediate connection with him, and they soon start dating.  But Russ must keep his abilities a secret from Eric and that soon begins to take its toll on their relationship.  Much is happening with this novel: the search for love and acceptance as a gay man, connecting your present with your past, the overly-image consciousness of some in the gay community.  But  I had a problem with the characters.  None of them displayed any emotional depth, made me empathize with them.  They went about their routines and too easily accepted everything that happened.  They came across as very one-dimensional.  Also, the genealogical connections were just a bit too coincidental which had me shaking my head as the story progressed.  This is a so-so novel that could use a bit more character development.
