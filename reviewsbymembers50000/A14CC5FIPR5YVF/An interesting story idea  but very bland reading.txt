 Benita Ryan arrives at her Dade County home one night to find the police awaiting her.  Burglars had broken into her home, rifling through her husbands office and scribbling "Ed Dean is queer" on one of the walls.  After the police leave, she quietly cleans the mess, and is incensed enough to start a crusade against those nasty homosexuals. Following the events in Dade County is Luis, a reporter for a New York newspaper.  He follows the story from Florida to the streets of San Francisco, falling in love with another man (to his surprise) along the way.  As the political environment surrounding the gay community intensifies, Luis witnesses the burgeoning strength of the gay community in San Francisco as it struggles against the sentiments created by Benita Ryan's Crusdae in order to form a city-nation, with the help of the U.N., that respects people of all colors and sexual identities. The story really does have potential: creating a city-nation, separate from the United States and recognized by the UN, with all the freedoms that we are supposed to be guaranteed by the government.  The problem here is the execution of the story.  Diaman's book reads more like an outline.  Story lines need to be fleshed out.  The characters are very one-dimensional, lacking any kind of emotional involvment from the reader, and are desparate need of more development.  Though, there is the character of Benita Ryan who reads as a very thinly veiled Anita Bryant.  Overall, it's a very bland read.
