 Benjamin Braddock comes home after his college graduation with offers for other schools and even a major scholarship to finish his studies.  Disillusioned with what the world may have in store for him, he spends most of his time lougning around his parent's pool not thinking about what to do with his future.  Then, in walks Mrs. Robinson at a party his parents are throwing in his honor, and by the end of the evening, he's begun an affair with her.  However, his disillusionment grows even more, and Ben finally decides that he's in love with Mrs. Robinson's daughter.  None of the characters has any emotional depth so I wasn't attached nor could I empathize with any of them.  Ben Braddock comes across as a slacker who can't make his own decisions and won't even try; he's easily manipulated by everyone with whom he comes into contact.  So many times I wanted to reach into the novel and slap him for being such an educated idiot.  I didn't understand the motives behind any of his actions, and the author didn't try to give any clues about it, either.  The dialogue, instead of adding any emotional depth to the characters, comes across flat, unconvincing and sometimes confusing.  I forced myself to finish this book, and if I hadn't been familiar with the movie, I probably wouldn't have picked this one up after reading a few pages at the bookstore.
