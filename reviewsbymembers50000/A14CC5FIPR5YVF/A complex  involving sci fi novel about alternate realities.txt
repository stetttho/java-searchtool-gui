 Jeannine, anxiously awaiting marriage to her boyfriend, is a librarian on an Earth that never saw an end to The Great Depression.  Joanna is a 1970s feminist trying to make it in a man's world by being just like a man.  Janet Evason, a traveler from Whileaway which has not been home to a man in over 800 years, suddenly appears on a Broadway sidewalk.  The three women are drawn to one another, presumably to learn and to share information.  Things take a different track when they meet Jael Reasoner from an alternate Earth with separate, warring male and female societies.  She has plans of her own for the three women. This is a fantastic science fiction book centered on the idea that any given situation has a number of choices.  What happens if all the choices actually occur, creating separate realities.  What would the Earth be like in each of those realities?  How would humans behave and act?  Author Joanna Russ lays all these ideas at your feet, and then throws in: and what if you could travel between these realities? Russ also gives the story a feminist flavor, having each of the characters represent a different aspect of a woman without being weak or vicitmized.  They're very strong, very well-defined characters, challenging the reader to open his or her mind to all the possibilities around them. The only difficulty I encountered with this book was sticking with the narrator.  I never really knew who was talking at which time because the scenes would change from chapter to chapter.  A little confusing at times, but if you stick with the book, the outcome is definitely worth it.
