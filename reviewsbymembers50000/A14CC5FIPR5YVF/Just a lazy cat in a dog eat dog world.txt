 The opening line to "Golddigger," the second track on this groove-laden album from the LA-based quartet.  The songs range from electronic-jazz-pop on such tracks as "Golddigger" and "Truth From Fiction" to danceable grooves with no overpowering bass thumps like "Strangelove Addiction" and "You're Always the Sun."  They mix a space-age lounge feel with electronica, perfect for relaxing or dancing.  With fantastic programming by Ramin Sakurai, Kiran Shahani, and Rick Torres and smooth vocals from Geri Soriano-Lightwood, this album is a must-have and has quickly become one of the albums I listen to over and over.  Favorite tracks:  "Golddigger," "Strangelove Addiction" and "Sublime."
