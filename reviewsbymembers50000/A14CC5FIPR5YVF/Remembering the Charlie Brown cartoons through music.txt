 Vince Guarldi's music is always mingled in my mind with those classic Charlie Borwn/Snoopy cartoon specials.  Those driving low notes on the piano followed by that off-beat melody always let you know that something good was about to appear on the TV screen.  I'll wager that most folks my age know that song -- the opening to every Charlie Brown special -- even if they don't know the title, it's so ingrained into our pop culture.  And what a perfect introduction to a truly American music style.  What George Winston has done on "Linus & Lucy" is combine all the great moments from the TV specials with Vince Guaraldi's magical music.  From the incredibly recognizable "Linus and Lucy" with the driving bass to the autumnal feel of "The Great Pumpkin Waltz," this album contains the songs of childhood and the pains and pleasures of growing up.  But, this album has more to it than Snoopy and the gang; Winston has included some of Guaraldi's other jazz wonders such as "Cast Your Fate to the Wind" and "Monterrey," to give us a taste of just how good Guaraldi's music is.  A great album to add to any jazz collection.
