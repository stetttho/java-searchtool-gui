 Hilary Stevens, a poetess and novelist in her 70s, prepares for an interview regarding her latest book of poems which has once again made her the darling of the critics.  That morning, thanks to a puzzling encounter with young Mar Hemmer who desires to write his own poetry, Hilary begins to look back on her career and her life, her lovers and the elusive Muse.  Just what is it that propels her to write her poems?, the interviewers want to know, and through their questions, she relives the moments in her life when the Muse entered and the poetry flowed -- when she was with the women who set her mind aflurry with words and passion.  Slow-paced and thought-provoking, May Sarton's novel discusses what gives writers inspiration, as well as what effect love has not only on writing but on life.  All the characters are well-fleshed out, from Hilary to Mar and both the interviewers, and even the young Hilary who provides a conflict between the generations within Hilary herself.  A beautifully written book that examines what it is to be a writer.
