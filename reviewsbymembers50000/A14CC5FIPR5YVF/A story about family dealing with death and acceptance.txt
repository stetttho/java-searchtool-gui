 Max Desir comes from an old Italian family, but his parents left the old country and made a new home for themselves in New Jersey.  As he grows up, Max discovers his own preference for men, but nothing ever becomes too serious.  Until he meets Nick during a trip through Italy.  They live together for a few months in Rome, then move back to the U.S. when they decide it's time to settle down. John, Max's father, doesn't take to the idea that his son is a homosexual; his mother, Marie, accepts her son and acts as a buffer between the two.  But after 15 years of keeping them civil, she succumbs to cancer, and John struggles to accept both Max and Nick while dealing with the loss of his Marie. This is a beautiful story about a family dealing with old values, acceptance and death.   The character of Max is one of the strongest I've read, and I emapthized with him.  I could feel his anger and confusion, his sense of loss, his struggle to be accepted and to have Nick accepted by his father as part of the family.   Very realisitc, too, in its rendering of the family and how it reacts to obstacles placed in its way.  No shiny, happy ending but no sterotypically tragic one, either.
