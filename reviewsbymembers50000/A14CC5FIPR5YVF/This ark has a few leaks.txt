 Pig, who prefers to be called Mole, has taken up residence in an abandoned stone quarry, slowly converting it into an ark to save humanity during the inevitable nuclear holocaust.  He has room for a little over 300 people to become his crew, but must be selective in his choosing.  Only those who he deems acceptable will be offered safe harbor in his huge ship. During one of his few outings to buy provisions for the ark, he comes across Komono, an insect dealer, and after lunching with him, offers one of the keys to the ark.  Komono asks if he can think on it and walks off to use the bathroom.  In the meantime, two sakura, or shills, trick Mole into giving up two keys.  They immediately make a run for the ark, followed by Komono and Mole in hot pursuit.  When they reach the ark, they discover that they are not alone in the depths of the quarry. The remainder of the book discusses a wide variety of topics from old age in the form of the Broom Brigade, environmentalism, survivalism, murder, loyalty, sex, humanity and nuclear devastation.  More and more chaacters are added as the book progresses, each with a different story to tell, making it difficult to follow along and unenjoyable to read.  I still am not sure exactly what point the author is trying to make with this novel, or even if there is a point to it.  The characters themselves were not believable to me, especially Mole, a big, fat man who is obsessed with the end of the world and the female shill's behind, continually wanting to pat it even when his life is in danger. The only saving grace for me is Abe's writing.  He has a very fluid style that's descriptive and easy to read.   But, with the piling on of characters and story lines, I can't say that I would add this to a must-read list.
