 Young Torless and his classmates study at a private boys' school in Austria.  He feels somewhat apart from the rest of his classmates, wondering what his place in the scheme of things is.  Then, two of his "friends" accuse another classmate of scheming and thievery, but instead of reporting it, they decide to take matters into their own hands.  Torless witnesses the sexual degradations through which the accused is placed, which only heightens Torless' need to understand things.  Unwittingly, he finds himself physically drawn to the accused boy, something which he is unable to comprehend but against which he is powerless.  A dark and disturbing look at how adolescents learn about their place in the world through power, brutality and sexuality.  I was confused by parts of it, as the author threw in much psychoanalysis and delving into Kant which made it difficult to follow the story, reading more along the lines of an essay at times. The ending is dissatisfying and doesn't give any clear solution.
