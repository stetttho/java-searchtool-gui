 One night, a young man is bitten by a transvestite and undergoes a strange transformation during a full moon.  Sounds like it might be campy and fun, right?  That's what I thought until I started watching this film.  Usually bad acting and a bad script can be funny and make a film worth watching, just for the sake of its badness.  Not in this case. The sound and picture quality of this dvd are sub-par.  I had to up the volume many times to hear what was being mumbled. Also, the film is very grainy and too dark.  I have to give them kudos for the idea behind the story, though.
