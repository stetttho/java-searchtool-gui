 Yet another Christmas compilation, but this one stnds out thanks to the unique choice of songs and performers.  Most of the songs on this album are traditional for the holiday season: "God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen" performed by Barenaked Ladies with Sarah McLachlan, "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer" sung by Jack Johnson with his trademark beach sound, "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" by Coldplay, and many others.  But it also throws in a few new songs: "What A Year for a New Year" by Dan Wilson, "Snow" by Celtic songstress Loreena McKennitt, "121/23/95" by Jimmy Eat World," and "Bizarre Christmas Incident" -- which is a bizarre little story -- by Ben Folds, among others.  This is a great addition to the holiday music catalog, bringing a fresh update to older songs and introducing quite a few new ones.
