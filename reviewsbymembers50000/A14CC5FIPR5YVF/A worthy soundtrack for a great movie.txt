 Kander & Ebbs' music translates beautifully to the film version of their hit musical.  All the songs capture the jazz flavor of 1920s Chicago and give a bit of insight into the characters themselves.  For a good example of this, check out "Mr. Cellophane" about Roxie's husband Amos who is the most unnoticed person in all of Chicago, admirably sung here by John C. Reilly.  Queen Latifah is brassy and risque with her rendition of "When You're Good To Momma."  Catherine Zeta-Jones astounds with her sexy and boisterous "All That Jazz."  Ren?e Zellwegger and Richard Gere surprise with their vocal talents, as well.  My favorite number in the entire album is "The Cell Block Tango," a clever telling of how the Six Merry Murderesses wound up in jail. Included also are the deleted song "Class," a duet between Catherine Zeta-Jones and Queen Latfiah, and two excerpts of Danny Elfman's excellent score to the film.  The only drawbacks (and the only reason why I don't give the album 5 stars) are the songs "Love is a Crime" by Anastacia and "Cell Block Tango/He Had It Comin'" by Queen Latifah, Lil' Kim and Macy Gray.  They seem out of place with the jazz feel of this album. Barring those two songs, this is an excellent album and really exudes the style and feel of the film.
