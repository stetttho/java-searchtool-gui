 The Galleria Umberto is an arcade of shops and cafs at the center of Naples, Italy. In 1944, after the Allies had taken control of the country, everyone managed to make his or her way to this galleria: the Neapolitans to watch and to take advantage of the Americans; the Americans to get drunk, to find a trick or to think. In "The Gallery," the narrator takes us on a tour of the galleria, showing us the sights, sounds and people who frequent the area. Each of the 9 stories gives the reader a glimpse in to the social and sexual practices of the American GI in 1944: from a censorship office run by an egomaniac to an Italian girl finding love in an America officer's club to a gay bar.  These portraits are linked by the narrator's own experiences from Casablanca to Naples and his realization of what love and the war mean to him. This novel might be considered semi-autobiographical as John Horne Burns served during World War II and undoubtedly drew inspiration from his surroudings.  For example, the portrait titled "The Leaf" takes place in a censorship office; Burns also served in a censorship office while in Italy.  It is a wonderful book to read.  My only gripe is that many of the characters speak Italian or French, and what they say is not translated.  Perhaps this works to show what it may have been like for the American soldiers, most of whom went to Italy and the rest of Europe not knowing the languages.  I would like to have known what was being said, though.  (This last part may only reflect the copy I was reading.  There may be translations in other copies.)
