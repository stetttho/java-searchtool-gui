 One evening, Michel calls together three of his close friends from his school days to relate a story to them and to let them decide for themselves what should be done: Michel and his new bride, Marceline, are traveling through Northern Africa on their honeymoon when Michel comes down with tuberculosis.  During his recouperation in Biskra, Algeria, Marceline does all she can to nurse him back to health.  He slowly recovers, but something in him has changed.  Michel loves his Marceline, but disdains her company, preferring to be surrounded by the young boys of the area, in particular Moktir, whom he spies stealing from Marceline. When the weather changes, he and Marceline return to his family farm in Normandy, hoping that this change will evince an even stronger change in him.  He strikes up a close friendship with Charles, the 17-year-old son of the farm's manager, and begins to spend more and more time with him, trying to find any excuse he can to be away from Marceline and in the company of Charles. Throughout the novel, Michel struggles with his new yearnings for what may, at the time the novel takes place, be considered the immoral things: his attraction to young men and to the darker side of society, while trying to maintain his marriage.  Plus, he has to hide his new feelings behind a false acceptance of society, and it just tears him inside that he must act that way.  I alternatley felt sympathy for him as he attempted to understand the new emotions that resulted from his near-death expereince with tuberculosis, and loathing him for his treatment of Marceline who understood what was going on and yet remained by Michel's side. A fascinating character study.
