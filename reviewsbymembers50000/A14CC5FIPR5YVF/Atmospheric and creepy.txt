 Hill House has stood for nearly 80 years, vacant for the last twenty.  With eerie stories of its past residents, what better place for Dr. John Mantague to conduct his study on hauntings.  With him are Luke Sanderson, soon to inherit Hill House from his aunt; Eleanor Vance, whose only experience with the supernatural was a poltergeist phenomenon that rained stones upon her house for 3 days; and Theodora, an artist with a bit of ESP. But, they are not alone.  Thanks to Jackson's unique descriptions of the house, Hill House itself becomes a character, with cold spots, shaky metal stairs, the rooms built in concentric circles, and slightly off-kilter measurements (doors not on the jamb, the stairs leaning slightly toward center, a tower that can only be seen from certain angles).  It seems to be designed to keep people slightly off-balance. No one experiences this more than Eleanor.  The recent death of her mother seems to be lingering in the air, and maybe the house is picking this up.  Of all the characters, she is the only one whose thoughts Jackson allows us to see, and her unease permeates the whole house (and novel). With a surprise ending, this is one of the creepier haunted house novels, and it doesn't rely on blood and gore.  It's very atmospheric and character-driven.
