 HIll House has been standing empty for almost 90 years.  Whipsers of strange phenomena have kept would-be ocupants away for a long time; not even the owners will live their.  That is, until Dr. John Markway assembles a small team to invesitgate the supposed supernatural events of the house.  He invites Theodora, a psychic who lives a very different lifestyle; Eleanor, a sheltered young woman who recently lost her canterkaerous mother and has had experienece with poltergeist phenomena; and Luke Sanderson, soon to inherit Hill House and acting as the family's representative.  Together, they begin to study the house, it's history and architecture.   Or, has the house chosen one of the team for its own purposes? Horror film director Robert Wise does a magnificent job with this  adaptation of the Shirley Jackson novel.  Very few visual effects are used, instead relying on lighting (the one scene with the wallpaper in Eleanor's room is eerie), atmosphere, sound and the viewers own fear to create a creepingly chilling film.  They make the viewer feel like actors in the movie instead of bystanders.  All the actors give fine performances: Clair Bloom as Theo, Russ Tamblyn as Luke, and Richard Johnson as Dr. Markway.  But, Julie Harris' performance of Eleanor makes the film.  Her almost childlike confusion, fear and determination to stay the course keep you enrapt in the film. It's very refreshing to see a horror film that doesn't rely so much on expensive special effects to get the chills across, instead using acting, lighting and story to convey terror and fright.  This is a classic horror film that still delivers to this day.
