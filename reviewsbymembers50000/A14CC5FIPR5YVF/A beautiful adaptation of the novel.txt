 Vanessa Redgrave gives a fine performance as Clarissa Dalloway in Marleen Gorris' adaptation of the Virginia Woolf novel.  It tells the story of one day inthe life of Clarissa Dalloway as she readies her house for a dinner party later in the evening.  Throughout the day, she remembers people and events from her past that had a lasting effect on her.   But, during her party, the news of a suicide causes Mrs. Dalloway to step aside and to wonder if she's given up anything with her own life's path. Ms. Redgrave's performance is subtle and really shines during the party sequence.  Her facial expressions alone show what a fine actress she is.  Other great performances in the film are Rupert Graves as Septimus, a soldier suffering from a late onset of shell shock, and Alan Cox, as the young Peter who was desparately in love with the young Clarissa. Not many extras on the DVD.  But the film is self is definitely one to watch.
