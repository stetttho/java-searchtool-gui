 This soundtrack is wonderful collection of music, displaying the talent of a great American musician.  Full of live tracks and studio recordings spanning Charles's career, giving the listener a chance to follow his growth as a singer, songwriter and great blues piano player.  The list of tracks include "What'd I Say," "Hit the Road, Jack" and his signature song "Georgia on My Mind" in both a studio recording and a more recent live recording.  This is a great album to introduce anyone to the genius of Ray Charles.
