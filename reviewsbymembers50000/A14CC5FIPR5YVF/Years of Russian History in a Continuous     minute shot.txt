 After an accident, a man comes to in complete darkness, not sure where he is.  When his eyes focus, he sees before him a carriage of aristocrats hurrying through the cold to the Hermitage in St. Petersburg.  Invisible, he follows them into the palace where he meets a French Marquis.  Together, they roam the halls of the Hermitage, discussing art, people and Russia while spying on Catherine the Great, Nicholas and Alexandra, Pushkin and other great figures of Russian history. Director Aleksandr Sokurov has chosen to tell his story in one continuous 96-minute shot -- a first of its kind.  No editing or film breaks; just a single take, almost as if you were walking through the Hermitage with the characters.  What also makes this film unique and beautiful is the seamless intermingling of time periods.  In the hallway, it's the grandeur of the 18th Century with tsars and tsarinas, but open a door, and you step into the 20th Century where the general public can come to view the magnificent works of art.  Through another door, and you're following Anastasia as she runs down a hallway dressed as a nymph to have a final meal with Nicholas and Alexandra. I saw the film in the theater and am impressed with the DVD.  The picture and sound qualities are very good.  The "Making of " featurette is definitley worth watching, and, to me, is just as intriguing as the film.  I did have a problem with some parts of the dialogue as it is hard to tell who is speaking and to whom the subtitles belong.  but, this is definitely a fine movie and one worth watching many times.
