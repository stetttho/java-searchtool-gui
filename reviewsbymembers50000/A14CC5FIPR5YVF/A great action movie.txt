 John Bridger, an aging robber, helps out with one last job before passing the reins over to his protg, Charlie Croker.  The job: to steal a safe full of gold bricks from a heavily guarded house in Venice, Italy.  The plan goes without a hitch until the team is double-crossed by Steve, one of its own members, who kills Bridger and believes the others dead. A year later, Charlie's been searching for Steve and the gold bricks and finally tracks them down to Los Angeles.  With the aid of Bridger's daughter Stella, a top-notch safecracker working on the right side of the law, the team plots to exact revenge on Steve and to steal back the gold bricks. I thoroughly enjoyed this film.  The script takes a back seat to the action sequences: the opening heist in Venice with a power boat chase through the canals to the Mini Coopers racing through the Metro of LA to the carfeully planned re-routing of armored cars via hacking into the traffic mainframe.  The actors work very well together: Donald Southerland as John Bridger; Mark Wahlberg as Charlie Croker; Charlize Theron as Stella Bridger; Jason Statham as Handsome Rob who has a way with cars and women;  Mos Def as Left Ear, an expert safecracker; Seth Green as Lyle the computer genius; and Edward Norton as Steve, the double-crosser. The DVD extras are prettygood, especially the documentary about the car chase sequence throught he Metro tunnels.  This is a fast-paced, exciting movie sure to get your adrenaline pumping
