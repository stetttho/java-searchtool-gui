 Transamerica tells the story of Bree, a pre-op transsexual woman, who learns -- just one week before her operation -- that she fathered a son 17 years ago. Her psychologist refuses to authorize the operation until she deals with this one last piece of her past so Bree reluctantly flies to New York to get to know her son, Toby. She bails him out of jail and then, learning that he wants to go to Los Angeles to find his father, she hopes to help him and herself by driving him to California. Throughout their journey, Bree struggles to keep the fact that she is Toby's father from him while at the same time trying to become closer to him, eventually becoming the strong woman she always knew she could be. A touching and very human movie about family, filled with much humor and sensitivity. Duncan Tucker's script is flawless and lays out the universal struggles of all families: communication, unconditional love, rebellion against parents, being true to one's self. Felicity Huffman's portrayal of Bree is remarkable. She brings much dignity to her character and allows the audience to see beyond what the eyes see into the heart of her character. Kevin Zegers gives a fine performance as Toby, struggling to find his own identity in the world.  This is a carefully crafted film filled with fine performances -- I can't forget to throw in Graham Greene, Fionnula Flannagan and Burt Young -- and a touching story about family and discovering your true self.
