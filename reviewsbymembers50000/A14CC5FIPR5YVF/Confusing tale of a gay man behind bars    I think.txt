 I figure to be the lone voice of dissent with this novel, which I found confusing and ultimately uninteresting.  Genet's novel, written while in prison, jumps back and forth among the many characters, often following tangent upon tangent.  I kept losing track of who was who, which one is supposed to be Genet (because I had the distinct impression that this novel might be autobiographical), sorting out the names and sequences of events, and trying to find a storyline that would last long enough to hold my interest.  Genet would start on a good story and then all of a sudden jump in another reflection from that, never satisfactorily returning or finishing the original story.  It's very sexual and delves into the world of transvestism, but ultimately left me more confused than ever about what Genet was trying to say.
