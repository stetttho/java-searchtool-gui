 A friend recommended this film so I started to view it but had to stop after 30 minutes.  I usually give films more of a chance but the sound quality of the DVD was so poor that I was either straining to hear what was being said or turning the volume down.   (I tried it on a second DVD player with the same results.)  The two main actors (Gregory Phelan and Victor Spirtas) were not too bad, but the script -- what I was able to make out of it -- left little to be desired.  A bit too confusing and not conversational and realistic.  The supporting characters were too clichd and made the one scene of the introduction dinner difficult to sit through. The film's creators seemed to have made this film with good intentions: showing the effects of AIDS on the gay community by focusing on one relationship in particular.  But, the script and the sound problems make it difficult to watch.
