 A nice optical mouse that fits the right hand perfectly. It's arched for a more natural feel. The wheel is easy to move and fairly quiet.  And, much llike the two-button mouse for a PC, the right button on this one activates the control menus.  The mouse plugged directly into the USB port of my computer and didn't require any special software.  The only drawback is that it is right-handed, and I haven't seen one made for the left hand.
