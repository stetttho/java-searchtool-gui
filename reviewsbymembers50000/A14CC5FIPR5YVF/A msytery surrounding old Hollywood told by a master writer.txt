 One dark, stormy night in Venice, California, a writer's worked is interrupted when Constance Rattigan, a glamorous movie star of old Hollywood, shows up on his doorstep.  Frightened by something following her, she gives the writer two books and disappears.  The books are phone registers of old Hollywood, filled with names of stars long dead or waiting to die.  Some of the names have been circled and marked with a red cross, including hers.  The writer enlists the aid of his friend Crumley and sets off on a trek through Hollywood haunts and memories to save Constance. This is a marvelous mystery, filled with images both real and ethereal, as only Ray Bradbury can conjure them.  Hollywood becomes a mysterious and magical place, filled with secrets waiting to be discovered.  And, in the midst of these images, he tells the story of a glamorous actress from old Hollywood trying to get away from memories of the past.  The characters all have a certain quirkiness about them that makes them fit seamlessly into the novel, whether it's Crumley the faithful friend; Henry, the blind man who used to search old cemeteries with the writer; or the writer himself, nameless but makes you wonder through sublte hints if you actually know him. It's a fast-paced book that I couldn't put down once I started.  I felt as if I were right in the thick with the characters as they searched for Constance.  Few books can really do that, in my opinion, and this is one of the best.
