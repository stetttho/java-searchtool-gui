 It's 1978, and Kevin Doyle has a lot to deal with during his senior year.  His mother died two years ago in a car accident.  He earns margnial grades in school.  His relationship with his father Patrick is shaky at best.  And, he's in love with his classmate, Jon Thompson.  As the winter sets in, Kevin learns from his Aunt Nora a troubling secret about his parents' relationship which makes him question his mother's death.  At the same time, he's struggling to keep his desire for Jon a secret so that he can continue to fit in.  "The Year of Ice" is a powerful novel of family tragedy, deep-seated secrets, and the inner struggle to put everything together and to understand what it means.  One critic termed the book a "bildungsroman," a novel of growth from childhood to maturity, and that's exactly what happens with Kevin's character.  Through his eyes, we see his world and his beliefs shattered, but instead of succumbing, he learns from what he sees, his opinions about people change, and his vision of himself changes as he accepts who he is.  This is a fantastic story told with just the right amount of humor and with strong characters with whom you can empathize.  A great book.
