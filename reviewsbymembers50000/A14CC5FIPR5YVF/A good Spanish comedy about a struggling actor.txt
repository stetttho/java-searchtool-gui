 Javier Bardem plays Victor Ventura, a young man who moves to Madrid to make it as an actor.  While waiting for his big break, he struggles to make ends meet as a pizza delivery man.  Forced to find a way to make more money, he becomes a phone sex operator.  His first client, a man who calls himself "Bill."  Some time later, he is requested by a woman  named "Amand" and, during their phone conversation, he immediately falls for her and breaks the cardinal rule of the group: meeting one of the  callers.  After a fantastic night together, she confesses her true reason for calling him and enlists his help to get evidence so she can divorce her husband, "Bill."  And, he's just about to get his big break in an American film.  But things are not quite what they seem, and Victor soon finds himself involved in a murderous plot as well as a love triangle. This is a charming and funny comedy gem from Spainsh director Manual Gmez Pereira.  Javier Bardem does a fine job as Victor and really carried the film.  I had problems with his character immediately falling for Amanda (played superbly by Aitana Sanchez-Gijon).  No build up to the relationship or any understanding why he falls for her.  Alastair Mackenzie does a fine job as the American movie director Oswaldo, though much of the English diaolgue (from other characters) is obviously dubbed and sounds very stiff and unnatural.  Overll, it's a fun movie to watch, and I really enjoyed Javier Bardem's performance.
