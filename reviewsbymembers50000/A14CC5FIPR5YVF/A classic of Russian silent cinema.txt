 The sailors, fed up with the poor rations they must eat while the officers dine in splendor, stage a mutiny and take over the Potemkin.  In the fray, the leader of he sailors, a Bolshevik named Vaculinchuk, is killed.  The sailors take his body to the shores of Odessa where they lay his body in tribute.  The people of Odessa flock to see his body when they learned of the events on the Potemkin.  Enraged at the treatment by the government, the citizens of Odessa rebel against the tsarist government.  This films is probably the best example of a propaganda film ever made, showing the perceived menace of the Russian government back at the turn of the century.  The message seems to be that the citizens need to band together,  that all Russians are brothers and sisters and must rise up against tyranny and fight for their freedoms.  While the story isn't completely engaging today, it does contain one of the most startling sequences in a silent film: the Odessa Steps.  As the citizes of Odessa start to gather, the Cossacks ride in resulting in one of the bloodiest slaughters to reach the screen.  Directors Grigori Aleksandrov and Sergei Eisenstein knew how to use this medium of film to get their message across, and this is one of the most effective scenes you'll ever see on screen.  It's a remarkable piece of cinematic history.
