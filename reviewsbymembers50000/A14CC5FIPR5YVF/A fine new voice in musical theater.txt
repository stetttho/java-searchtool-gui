 "Myths and Hymns" brings a fine new talent to musical theater.  Adam Guettel has taken Greek myths and combined them with songs found in an old hymnal to create a unique cycle of songs ranging from funny ("Pegasus" and "There's A Land") to poignant ("Migratory V" and "Hero and Leander") to uplifting ("There's A Shout").  And, for this recording, we get to hear some of the original cast members from "Saturn Returns," the off-broadway show which featured the 16 tracks on this album.  Theresa McCarthy, Audra McDonald, Billy Porter and Mandy Patinkin, to name a few. Some of my favorites are "Hero and Leandro" sung by Adam Guettel, "How Can I Lose You?" sung by Annie Golden and "Awaiting You" sung by Billy Porter.  But, the entire album is filled with fantastic music and wonderful voices.
