 Klaus Badelt's fantastic score is a great companion to the movie.  It's full of the adventure and menace of the film.  Beginning with the quiet "Fog Bound," the album builds in intensity, and you actually feel as though you're right there watching the battles at sea or following the skeletal pirates on their "Underwater March."  This is one of the few album scores that can actually stand on its own, apart from the film.  It has the feel of the open seas and of pirates and adventure.  A great album!
