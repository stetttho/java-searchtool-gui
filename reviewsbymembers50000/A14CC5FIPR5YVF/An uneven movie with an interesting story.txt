 Not having any luck finding a job in Tokyo, an unemployed salesman named Yosuke promises an old, dying friend that he will claim a hidden treasure for him; a golden statue of Buddha.  Yosuke travels to a small, seaside town and finds a house where the statue is supposedly hidden.  Before he can step inside, he spies a young woman hurrying from the house located beside a red bridge and for some reason, follows her to the market.  There, he watches her shoplift some cheese while she stands in a puddle of water. When the two eventually meet, he learns of her secret affliction: that she fills with water.  The only way to release the water is through sexual release.  Soon, Yosuke abandons his treasure hunt, finds a job as a fisherman and sees more and more of the young woman. I admit that I thought this an intriging story.  A woman who fills with water and can only release it through sex.  A great idea.  But, this movie confused me.  I didn't know if I were watching a comedy or a drama.  It starts of very heavy, with the state of unemployment, Yosuke's wife who nags and demeans, the death of Yosuke's friend.  but when Yosuke and the young woman have sex for the first time and the water bursts out, this funky Japanese music starts playing, giving the impression of a bad 1970s soft-core movie.  I started laughing, though a bit self-consciously. What I really disliked about this movie is that the relationship between Yosuke and the young woman is unbelievable.  I felt no chemistry between them.  Only later -- much later  -- did I discover a real connection with her immediate taking to Yosuke, but it felt like a copout. While the story has potential and Koji Yakusho gives a fine performance as Yosuke, I can't help but be a little disappointed with the results.
