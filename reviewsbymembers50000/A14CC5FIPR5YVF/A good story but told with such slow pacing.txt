 Maggie Gilkeson is a doctor living with her two daughters, Dot and Lily, in the plains of 1885 New Mexico.  One morning, her two daughters set off with ranch hands Brake and Emiliano, promising to return by nightfall.  As night approaches, Brake's horse returns to the ranch without a rider.  Maggie sets off to find them and discovers her daughter Dot still alive in the midst of a massacre.  Dot tells her that Lily's been taken by Indians.  Determined to find Lily, Maggie strikes an alliance with her estranged father, Samuel Jones.  With Dot in tow, the three set off to get Lily before she's taken across the border into Mexico. This is a very good story, almost an ode to the old Westerns.  The acting really stands out in this film, especially Cate Blanchett as Maggie and Eric Schwieg as Chidin, the brouja who is kidnapping young women to take across the border to Mexico to sell.  His performance is quiet astonishing and full of menace.  The two daughters are also very good: Jenna Boyd as the young Dot and Evan Rachel Wood as Lily.  Val Kilmer and Aaron Eckhart make appearances, too.  Tommy Lee Jones is okay, if a little wooden. What I didn't like about this film is the slow pacing.  The movie's over two hours in length, but feels like seven before you get through.  I fast-forwarded through a lot of scenes that were simply filler and could have been cut without damaging the story.  This is a chase; it should feel as if the story is moving along quickly.  Also, the music didn't blend in or enhance the story.  I was very aware of it and, for me, that's distracting. A good story with fine acting, but very slow pacing.
