 Molly Bolt was just another dirt-poor little girl growing up in Coffee Hollow, just outside of York, Pennsylvania.  Pretty much a tomboy, she could beat up her cousin Leroy and wouldn't take lip from anybody.  She also lost her virginity to her girlfriend in the sixth grade. "Rubyfruit Jungle" is a chronicle of Molly's life, told from her perspective, from the poor area of Pennsylvania to the somewhat nicer area near Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, to her hitchhiking to New York to become a film director.  Along the way, she learns that she's the bastard child of a woman named Ruby and some unkown, married Frenchman, and she also must contend with the societal pressures of the 1960's and 70's of marrying a man to secure your future and that wanting to be a film director is easier than becoming one. Molly Bolt is a strong-willed, self-suficient, incredibly proud character.  She's a lesbian and doesn't care what anyone thinks about it.  (I like that she's so matter-of-fact about herself.)  She's determined and nothing is going to stop her from fulfilling her dream of becoming a director, even if she isn't able to make her film until she's 50.  I think that she represents the kind of person that we would all like to be: strong, no-nonsense, and comfortable with ourselves. The only item I didn't like about the book is that every woman Molly meets -- with the exception of her family -- falls in love with her: cheerleaders, New York socialites, college roommate.  That just seemed a bit too farfetched to me.  But, it doesn't detract from this incredible novel about remaining true to yourself.  I highly recommend it!
