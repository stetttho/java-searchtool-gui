 At the outbreak of the Civil War, 12-year-old Steven Moore watches on as his father Jason saddles up his horse to join other Confederates in the fight to protect Tennessee.   After many months of hardship, Steven's youngest sister, Liza, becomes so gravely ill that he decides to find his father and to bring him home.  With his mother's approval and a crude map, he and his companion, a young slave named Dink, set off into the heart of the battle to find his father. This is one of the most compelling novels of the Civil War, told from the perspective of a 12-year-old boy.  Through his eyes, we see the area surrounding Nashville change from healthy farmland to desolate battle fields.  The Confederate soldiers whom he knew to be proud and strong turn out to be haunted men with sallow faces, bare feet and rags for clothing.  He and Dink watch some of the fighting firsthand: the booming of the canons, the black troops fighting for the Union, the dead and the dying everywhere.  And, still he continues to search for his father, diving deeper and deeper into the heart of the battle. With fantastically detailed imagery and strongly developed characters, Madison Jones has created a Civil War novel that appeals to all readers, both young and old.  You have a real sense of what the war must have been like for a young boy, witnessing his family life upturned and almost destroyed.  Nothing is romanticized.  A strong novel for young adults and anyone interested in the Civil War.
