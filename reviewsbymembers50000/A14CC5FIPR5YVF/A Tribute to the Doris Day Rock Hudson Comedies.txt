 Small town farm girl Barbara Novak (Ren?e Zellweger) writes a best-selling book called "Down with Love" instructing women how to find the same satisfaction in sex and work as men. Catcher Block (Ewan MacGregor) -- ladies' man, man's man , man about town -- sets out to expose her by making her fall in love with him.  But things go awry as he begins to have feelings for her in this tribute to the 1960's sex comedies of Doris Day and Rock Hudson. It's full of wonderful performances by Zellweger and MacGregor, but the supporting cast steals the show.  David Hyde Pierce is Peter Macmannus, Catcher's boss at "Know" the magazine for men in the now; Sarah Paulson plays Vikki Hiller, the editor-in-chief at Banner Publications.  The banter and sexual tension/frustration the two of them share on-screen is hysterical.   The film is also filled with fabulous fashions and hairstyles  reminiscent of those romantic comedies.  The film's creators kept the spirit of those films alive in costume, set design, music, film technique and a script full of sexual innuendo.  The phone conversation between Cathcer and Barbara --using split screen -- is one of the funniest scenes I've seen to date.  (And, you must watch the credits for a song by Barbara Novak and Cather Block!) The DVD picture and sound quality are great.  Plus, the many extras -- including deleted scenes, a blooper reel, hair and wardrobe tests, documentaries, and a music video -- make this a great DVD to watch.
