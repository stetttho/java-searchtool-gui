 Tanith Lee provides a darker, more gothic feel to the classic fairytales we all know: Snow White is a creature of the night in "Red As Blood;" Little Red Riding Hood has meets a very different kind of wolf in "Wolfland;" Rapunzel's prince is more sinister in "The Golden Rope;" plus six othe re-tellings.  Each one takes place in a specific time and place on Earth, mostly in the past - with the one exception being "Beauty," Lee's re-telling of Beauty and the Beast, set on Earth in the distant future.  Even thought the titles of the stories have changed, Lee makes it easy to figure out which story is being re-rold.  It's a bit too dark for children, but for fans of horror and gothic tales, this makes a great addition to your reading list.
