 The history of the film is just as intriguing as the movie itself.  Amidst controversy, the original negatives of the film were destroyed back in the '20s.  A print was known to exist, but it was believed to have been lost until someone discovered a Danish copy of the film tucked away in a closet of a mental institution in 1981.  French and Danish filmmakers worked together to piece the film into what they hoped was as close to director Carl Th. Dreyer's original and released it in 1985.  Then, Criterion got a hold of it, worked their restoration magic, and released a wonderful DVD edition with two versions of the film, one silent and the other with an accompanying oratorio called "Voices of Light" by Richard Einhorn which was based upon the silent film.  This is a remarkable film, focusing on Joan's trial and her persecution as the judges attempt to make her confess that she did not hear the voice of God speaking to her.  The judges - and the church of that period - come across as almost intrinsically evil, with their use of torture and forced confessions.  The revelation of this film is Maria Falconetti as Joan of Arc.  She gives one of the finest performances I've ever seen.  No fancy face work or overstated actions; just by using at her eyes, she makes you feel the intense passion that Joan had for God and for her beliefs.  The camera work is very French avant-garde, with many extreme close-ups and quick camera movements, and is very effective in creating an opprressive atmosphere.  I viewed the version with "Voices of Light," and must say that it greatly enhacnes the emotion and feeling of the entire film.  They fit so perfectly together.  This is a magnificent film that should be a part of every movie buffs film collection.
