 When the royal family cibducts birthday festivities for their newborn dauhgter, Aurora, they neglect to invite the evil Maleficent.  She in turn curses the young child, that before sunset on her 16th birthday, she will prick her finger on a spinning wheel and perish.  To save her from such a dire fate, three good fairies take the young princess into the woods to protect her.  What follows after is one of Walt Disney's most beautifully animated films.  The story is basic fairy tale stuff: a princess in danger, a charming prince battles the forces of evil to save her, and everyone lives happily ever after. Two things that set this apart from other Disney films are first, the adaptation of Tchaikovsky's music for the ballet "The Sleeping Beauty," which gives us the beautiful song "Once Upon a Dream."  The second is the stunning art work of Eyvind Earle: marvellously detailed landscapes that could almost be tapestries hanging in some centuries-old castle.  that alone makes this DVD worth watcing.  But, Disney has included both the original widescreen release and the full-screen version from when the movie first came out on VHS.  The tons of extras including the making of the film, a Princess Persnoality game, the award-winning short film "Grand Canyon," and much more make this one of the best DVDs to be released in 2003.
