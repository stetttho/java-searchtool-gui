 John Baxter, an accountant from New York, inherits a Colorado hotel from a great Uncle.  Tired of the rat race, John packs up his family and moves to Colorado, imainging a new life as the owner of a prosperous hotel.  Unfortunately, all is not as he had hoped: the hotel is way, way, way out of town and is in desparate need of repair.  Baxter tries to get a loan from local banker, Martin Ridgeway, who has his own ideas about sneaking the hotel away from Baxter. This is a great movie for anyone between the ages of 5 and 13, who will probalby like all the slapstick humor and silly situations in which Baxter finds himself as he tries to get the money to keep his hotel from foreclosure. ( I remember really enjoying this movie as a kid.  Now, the film seems a bit out-dated, the humor somewhat forced.)  The acting is good, with many well-known stars: Harry Morgan, Dean Jones, Keenen Wynne, and Mary Wickes. The DVD has no extras.  It's a fun Disney film that kids are sure to enjoy.
