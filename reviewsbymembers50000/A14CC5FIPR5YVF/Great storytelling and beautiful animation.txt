 On the day that one of Jaopan's oldest movie studios is being torn down, filmmaker Genya Tachibana and his cameraman decide to film a documentary on the studio's most celebrated actress, the reclusive Chiyoko Fujiwara.  They track her down and begin the interview.  What follows is not just the story of Chiyoko's desire to become an actress against the wishes of her family and her search for a mysterious stranger who gave her a key, but also an unusual history of Japanese cinema from pre-WWII and historical films to Godzilla and space adventures.  Chiyoko's quest to find the stranger and to discover what the key means drives every single film she's in so that her movies mirror her own life. Through deft storytelling and beautiful animation, director Satoshi Kon takes his viewers on a unique trip through Japanese cinema.  In any other film about films, this might be boring, but as Chiyoko tells her story and we see the flashbacks, Tachibana and his cameraman are also taken back, sometimes taking part in the events of Chiyoko's past.  This insertion of the present into the past makes for a unique film that is both funny and touching.  A great movie that everyone can enjoy!
