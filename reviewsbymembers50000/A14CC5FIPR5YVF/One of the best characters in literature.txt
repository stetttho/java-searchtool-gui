 "Mrs. Dalloway said she would buy the flowers herself." Thus begins a very intriguing novel that revolves around a single day in the life of Clarissa Dalloway. Clarissa is a good-natured woman who is throwing a party. As the day goes on, her strong aura begins to wear away due to small events: the surprise return of a former admirer which recalls to her memories of a secret kiss with a young lady years ago; her husband being invited to lunch at Lady Bruton's without her; Miss Kilman's unnatural attachment to her daughter Elizabeth; and a death. This is a beautifully written book that discusses the relationships between men and women and serves as a fascinating character study. Clarissa Dalloway is one of the most invloved and interesting characters in literature.  Highly recommended reading.
