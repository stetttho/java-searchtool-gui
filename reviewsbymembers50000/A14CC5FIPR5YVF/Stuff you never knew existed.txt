 Have you been searching forever for necktie made from duct tape?  How about a 1963 J.F. Kennedy Garden Gnome?  Author Marc Hartzman discovered these and 99 other items -- all actual listings  found on eBay  -- and compiled them into this humorous short book.  Some interesting, some disgusting, but all totally bizarre. The book includes a picture, item description from the auction, starting price, and the sale value (if the item sold).  For a few items, Hartzman emailed a question or two and included the responses.  And, almost anything you can imagine is listed here.  One of my favorites is the last listing, for "Nothing!  Absolutely Nothing!" which someone bought for $1.03. They say that truth is stranger than fiction, and this book does a fine job showing that and how much eBay is becoming part of the American culture.  This is a must for anyone who has bought or sold on eBay or who simply has a hankering for the bizarre and unusual.  A funny little gem of a book.
