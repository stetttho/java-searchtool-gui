 While working out at the local gym, New Orleans private detective Chanse MacLeod meets a good-looking young man with a problem.  It seems that someone's been threatening to reveal his rich, closeted boyfriend's identity to the public unless he comes up with $50,000.  Seems like a simple case of blackmail until Chanse finds the young man dead.  Against his better judgement -- and that of the police -- Chanse sets out to find out who killed his client, following a winding trail through New Orleans high society and the world of gay rights.  The story itself is ripe with possibilities, but the execution of it leaves much to be desired.  Chanse MacLeod comes across as arrogant, boring and very much into the looks-oriented stereotyping that plagues gay culture.  He summarizes each man he meets by referencing his height, his build and his relative attractiveness, at one point even stating that one character would be attractive if he lost weight.  For a mystery to have a chance, shouldn't the reader like the detective even a little bit?  Most of the male characters have no problem removing their shirts at the drop of a hat to show off just how muscular and toned they are, even if it doesn't have anything to do with the plot.  The writing style is very monotonous, wanting to explain every little action in short, passive sentences that drone, almost as if the author were trying to imitate the speech of the old hardboiled gumshoes  la Dashiell Hammett.  I found it very difficult to get into the story and to like any of the characters, making this - for me, anyway - a very weak murder mystery.
