 I had the privilege of attending the CD release concet for this CD  back in August 2004.  Susan Egan has an amazing voice and stage presence, and it comes across beautifully on this album of atypical cabaret-style songs.  "Coffee House" opens with  a cover of Joni Mithcell's "Both Sides Now" which displays Egan's clear and strong voice perfectly.  The entire album is filled with wonderful covers, such as Cat Stevens' "Oh Very Young" and the funny "Where in the World Is My Prince" from Jerry Herman; some unrecorded jems, including "I Can't Believe My Heart" which was cut from Disney's "Hercules;" and lesser-known songs such as the quietly beautiful "There Are No Words" and the comical "Taylor, the Latte Boy."  Egan uses her magnificent voice to inject each song with just the right amount of emotion, be it humor or tenderness.  This is a wonderful album from an incredible voice.
