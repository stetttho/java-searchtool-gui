 Sutty leaves Earth to become an Observer on the planet Aka.  Once there, she is disillusioned by the dystopian society that has done away with the planet's rich history.  Or so they think.  Her mentor, Tong Ov, finally gains the ability to allow one Observer to travel outside the limits of Dovza City to experience life outside the Corporation that controls daily life.  She travels to the village of Okzat-Ozkat and discovers a hidden oral tradition called The Telling and a small group of people that are trying to keep this "religion" alive while under the rule of the Corporation.  While I enjoyed Le Guin's rich descriptions of the Telling, the villages, the scenery, her characters fell flat, coming across as very one-dimensional and never really developed.  I never empathized with Sutty and her feelings of supposed disbelief that what was once such a rich culture had, within the course of a few decades, obliterated its past; the same with the other characters.  I felt more as though I were sitting through a college lecture on culture, society and history.  The parallels between modern society and the fictional societal upheavlas on Aka are very clear and kept me interested in at least finishing the novel.  Not one of her best works, but it does give an interesting look into what could happen if we let things get out of control.
