 "Two Way Monologue" is a fantastic follow up to Sondre Lerche's debut album.  The songs range from the instrumental opening track, "Love You," to traditional folk/pop songs infused with a touch of Brian Wilson, such as the upbeat love song "Counter Spark," the quirky "Wet Ground," and the plaintive break-up song "It's Over" to even the country-feel of the song "Stupid Memory."  One of my favorites, that showcases Sondre's talent as a songwriter, is the title song, "Two Way Monologue,"  about trying to find common ground when communicating.  It starts out with just the singer and a guitar then builds into a full-fledged pop-rock song, that keeps you tapping along with the music without missing the story of the song.   Filled with intelligent and sometimes whimsical lyrics, energetic, traditional pop infused with a folk rock sensibility, and a deceptively sweet voice, this album displays what pure music can be.
