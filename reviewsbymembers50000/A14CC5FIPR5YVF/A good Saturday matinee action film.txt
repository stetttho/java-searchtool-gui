 Allan Quartermain is called back to England by the British government to help stop a mysterious villain know as The Phantom from taking over the world.  With a team of well-known literary characters -- Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Tom Sawyer, Dorian Gray, Wilhelmina Harker, Captain Nemo, and an Invisible Man -- he sets sail for Venice to stop the Phantom. Not a bad action film for a Saturday matinee, full of explosions, chases and evil plots.  One of the main problems, though, is the special effects.  A few of them are quite good, such as the Invisible Man, but the majority tend to be very two-dimensional.  They look like computer-generated images, and, sadly, the movie relies on them, instead of the story and characters, to carry the film.  Also, for gathering such a great array of actors -- Sean Connery as Allan Quartermain, Jason Flemyng as Jekyll/Hyde, Richard Roxburgh as M, and Peta Wilson as Mina Harker, to name a few -- they are given very little to do, and almost no time is given to get to know the characters, almost as if the creators took advantage of the fact that the viewer alredy knows who they are. The "making of" featurette on the DVD is very good, actually showing shots being set up and filmed, mixed in with director and actor commentary.  Not a bad action movie, but not too memorable, either.
