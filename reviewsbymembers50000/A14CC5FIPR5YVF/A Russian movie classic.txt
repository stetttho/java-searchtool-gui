 Dziga Vertov's 1929 film is a montage of one day in the life of the Russian people as told (or viewed) by a cameraman. Starting in a movie theater with the audience preparing to view the film, Vertov's cameraman takes them on a whirlwind tour of Russian life, from daybreak and visions of people sleeping on the streets and benches, interspersed with a young woman lying in her comfortable bed, to the everyday people working in the mines and factories. It's a fascinating way to show the usage of the camera as a tool to document life, to display reality.  In addition, the viewers get to see how a movie is made, with many shots of the cameraman hulking the huge camera from place to place, cranking the handle in order to get the desired sequence on film. The version I saw also has a great score by composer Michael Nyman and written biographies of the Dziga Vertov and michael Nyman.  A unique film that is a must-see for any cinophile.
