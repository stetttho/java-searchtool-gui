 When legendary folk music promoter Irving Stenbloom passes away, his son Jonathan decides to hold a tribute concert, re-uniting the three folks bands that his father helped to make famous: The Folksmen, The Main Street Singers, and Mitch and Mickey.  What follows is a hilarious mockumentary following the reunions of the three music groups as well as Jonathan trying to organize the event. Eugene Levy is at his best as Mitch Cohen, the quite off-kilter folksinger who had a breakdown (of sorts) after a TV kiss with his partner Mickey Crabbe (played by Catherine O'Hara).  His slowed speech and facial expressions are hysterical.  John Michael Higgins and Jane Lynch are wonderful as Laurie and Terry Bohner, the leaders of The New Main Street Singers, who have their own religion involving colors.  The rest of the cast is equally funny and well-cast: Fred Willard, Ed Begley Jr., Parker Posey, Christopher Guest, Michael McKeen, Bob Balaban, and the rest. Oh, and before I forget, the actors do their own singing as well.  (Christopher Guest's folk style is wonderful!) The DVD picture and sound quality are top notch, and the disc is filled with great extras, including additional scenes, mock 1950s and 1960s TV performances of the groups, and the televised reunion-tributre concert as it was aired on PBN, a fictional public broadcasting station. Fans of "Best in Show," "Waiting for Guffman," and "This is Spinal Tap" will definitely love this film!
