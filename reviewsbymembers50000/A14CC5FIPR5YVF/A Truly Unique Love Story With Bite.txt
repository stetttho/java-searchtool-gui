 After being attacked the night before, Jody wakes up beneath a dumpster.  Her hand is burned and, surprsingly, she finds herself endowed with incredible strength and the ability to sense people's auras which leads her to the grim discovery that she is now a vampire.  Determined to find out who did this to her and why, she seeks out the help of a lonely young writer named C. Thomas Flood, newly arrived to San Francisco and trying to fend off the charms of his new Chinese roommates.  Together, Flood and his new love Jody scour the city to find the root of her problems before more bodies start to pile up.   From start to finish, I could not put this book down even while I was laughing out loud.  Strong, funny characters; a biting (no pun) wit; and an incredible story with great pacing make this one incredible read.  Author Christopher Moore re-works the traditional vampire story with a wonderful twist of two people falling in love and trying to understand how they fit into the world.  All that you know about vampires is put to the test, examined, re-examined and re-worked into a very readable and enjoyable tale.
