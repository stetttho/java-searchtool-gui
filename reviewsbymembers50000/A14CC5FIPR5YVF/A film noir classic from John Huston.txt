 Brigid O'Shaughnessy hires Sam Spade and his partner, Miles Archer, to bring back her sister who's been living with a "dangerous" man.  Miles sets off to tail the man, but winds up murdered.  Trying to discover who killed his partner before the police can lay blame on him, Spade gets more involved with Brigid's search for a missing statue, the Maltese Falcon.  She must find it before the nervous Joel Cairo or the mysterious Kaspar Gutman can get their hands on it. Director John Huston, who also wrote the screenplay based on Dashiell Hammett's novel, a crafted one of the finest examples of film noir to hit the screen.  Humphrey Bogart's star-making turn as Detective Sam Spade is full of sharp-tongued intelligence as he plays each of the characters against themselves to get to the truth.  Peter Lorre is devious as the nervous Joel Cairo, determined to locate the Maltese Falcon for his employer, Kaspar Gutman, played with finesse by Sydney Greenstreet.  Mary Astor does a fine job as Brigid, but to me, she comes across as a bit too melodramatic.  I found it hard to take her seriously in the role of a woman out to use whatever it takes to get the statue.  The script is fast paced with excellent dialogue, especially the scenes between Spade and Gutman. The DVD transfer has some satisfactory extras, such as movie trailers and a history of the film.  I'm a bit surprised at the picture quality.  Many grainy spots, noise lines, and other imperfections.  I hope they release a restored version of this in the near future. "The Maltese Falcon" is a marvelous film and is a must for any cinephile.
