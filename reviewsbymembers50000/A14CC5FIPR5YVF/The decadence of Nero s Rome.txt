 Follow the bawdy adventures of Encolpius through the  decadence of Nero's Rome as he tries to maintain the  love of his beautiful young male slave Giton. They  must contend with an evil roommate, Ascyltus -- also  vying for the attentions of Giton -- an orgy from the  Priestess of Priapus, a shipwreck, and a severe case  of impotence.    This satire of Roman life during the time of Nero  unabashedly shows the love (and sex) between  Encolpius and Giton. Not to mention the fact that  others -- both men and women -- also are attracted to  the beauty of young Giton and sometimes have their way  with him. It's quite humorous, sometimes a little  long in the speeches (like many Greek or Roman works  of the time) and even manages to throw in some poetry.     I was actually surprised at this openness to talk  about homosexuality in the First Century A.D. I would  have thought this to be a taboo suject at the time.   After some reasearch, I discovered that Petronius  actually served under Nero as his "arbiter elegantiae"  -- which means that he advised Nero on luxury and  extravagance. He was what would be considered today a  "partier:" sleeping during the day and staying up  until all hours with both young men and women, as did  Nero. So what Petronius writes about was actually  happening -- all the extravagant dinners, the orgies,  the openness of sexuality.    I highly recommend this!    (Also, as a note on the book. It is fragmentary. The  scholars have been unable to find a complete text of  "The Satyricon" so in reading it, you need to give a  little leeway in what happens.)
