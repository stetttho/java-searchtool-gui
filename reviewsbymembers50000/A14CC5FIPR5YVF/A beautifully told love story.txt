 Therese works as a shopgirl in a large department store as it prepares fro the Christmas rush.  But it's only a temporary job as she wants to become a set designer, with the help of contacts provided by her boyfriend Richard.  She's content but life with Richard isn't quite what she's looking for.  In fact, she's not sure what she needs until Carol, a handsome older woman, walks into her department to buy a doll for her daughter.  Therese manages to strike up a conversation with Carol and soon, they begin to see quite a bit of each other.  Their friendship changes while on a cross country trip and soon Therease and Carol must battle to keep their romance going despite the possible threat of Carol's husband and threats to keep her away from her daughter.  This is a thought-provoking novel about coming out and trying to maintain a relationship that runs askew of societal norms.  Highsmith expertly tells the story from Therese's point of view, voicing her fears, opinions, thoughts so that as a reader, I felt as if I were taking part in the story.  It's also good at giving the reader a glimpse into how homosexuality was treated during the 1950's.  What I enjoyed most about this novel, though, is that the characters do not have the tragic ending common to gay/lesbian characters at the time; they have the possibility of continuing the relationship.  A refreshing change to novels of the time.
