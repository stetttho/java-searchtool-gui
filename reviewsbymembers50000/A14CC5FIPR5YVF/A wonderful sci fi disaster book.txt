 While everyone's eyes are turned to the skies to watch a lunar eclipse, a planet appears out of nowhere.  At first, people are intersted in this new planet, then the devastating earthquakes and tidal changes begin as the Wanderer, as many have named the planet, begins threatening the Moon. This engrossing novel catalogs the catastrophic events following the Wanderer's appearance through the eyes of many people instead of focusing on just on small group.  From the saucer students, gathered on a California beach near Vandenburg 2 to watch the eclipse, to a treasure hunter in the waters off Vietnam, to a man crossing the Atlantic on a small boat and a cruise liner being hijacked off the coast of South America, and even to a few astronauts on the Moon.  The author Fritz Leiber does't just give an anecdotal visit to each; he returns to them, keeps their storylines going so that the reader gets mutliple viewpoints of the same events.  This is especially effective when the saucer students on Earth watch what the Wanderer does to the Moon, while the astronauts on the Moon live through the experience.  It keeps reminding you that the events have a global impact.  Plus, Leiber's descriptions are rich and detailed, even with some hand drawn illustrations showing the phases of the Wanderer. Full of rich descriptions and great characters, this is a very entertaining sci-fi novel.
