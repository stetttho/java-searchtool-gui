 Yukawa is hired by Ichiro Ono of Ono Robotics to be the head curator of a new museum he is building to honor the 365 Views of Mt. Fuji painted by the artist Takenoko.  The problem is that Ichiro only owns one third of the paintings; the others are divided equally between his brother Gun, who runs a gay nightclub, and sister Akiko, who operated a ryokan (similar to a motel) which has been in the family for generations.  They haven't spoken in nearly 20 years so the task is placed upon Yukawa to gather all the paintings together.  As Yukawa begins his task of cataloguing the views and trying to convince the others to loan them to the musuem, he tries to make an intimate connectionwith both the methodical Kumi (Ichiro's daughter) and the overprotected Haruna (Akiko's daughter).  Then, mysterious packages containing some of the views begin to arrive at his dorm room, his office, his car, and Yukawa is unwittingly drawn into the bizarre and secretive world of the Ono family.  This is an intersting novel with a very good story.  The author Todd Shimoda has added a unique twist by inserting more stories which run concurrently with the main plotline into the margins of each page, to give character depth as well as background into the artist Takenoko.  While each of the characters is well-drawn and interesting, I felt that much of the extra info given was unnecessary and sometimes distracting.  The story itself is intriguing enough to keep you reading.
