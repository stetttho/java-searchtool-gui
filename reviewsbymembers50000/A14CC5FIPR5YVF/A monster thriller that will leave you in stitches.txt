 In the small coastal town of Pine Cove, CA, the local psychiatrist decides to take everyone off their regular medications, quietly replacing them placebos.  Soon enough, the whole town starts acting funny, and things get even strange when a seabeast named Steve roars up on the shore.  He has a certain way about him that brings out the libidos of anyone around -- human and animal alike -- and starts to enjoy his new hunting grounds.  It's up to local sherriff (and stoner) Theo Crowe to figure out how to rid the town of their newest resident before more people start to disappear.  Author Christopher Moore is at his best with this comic horror tale.  Great characters -- especially Steve, a throwback to the swinging days of the '70s sex scene...even if he is a 100-ft. sea monster; imaginative storytelling; lots of intrigue and action.  An all around great book to read.  Fans of monsters, horror novels, even comedies will love this!
