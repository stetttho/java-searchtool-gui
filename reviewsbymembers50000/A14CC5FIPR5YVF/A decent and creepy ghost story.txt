 When a US submarine is ordered to pick up survivors from an attack during WWII, eerie things start to happen on board the sub.  Crew members start to hear whispering voices or to see things.  The sub mysteriously changes its course which can't be corrected.  But, something's up with the officers.  What exactly are they hiding from the rest of the crew? This is a very effective ghost story with great visual effects, a few gorey death scenes, and just an overall creepy atmosphere.  You get the sense of being trapped in the submarine, with its cramped quarters and tempers on edge, the periods of complete silence, and even suffer along with the crew when a German ship drops explosives all around them.  (A visually great sequence, too.)  Some of the dialogue is a bit cheesy and some of the performances just manage to go overboard (no pun intended).  But the visuals and the story more than make up for that. The picture quality of the DVD is fantastic, very crisp and clear.  Soudn quality is very good, too.  Not a lot of extras, but the deleted scenes are worth watching.  (I even prefer the "Red Flare Ending" to the original.)
