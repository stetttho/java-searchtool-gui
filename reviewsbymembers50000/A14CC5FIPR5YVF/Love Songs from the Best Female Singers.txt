 A torch song is a senitmental love song, usually about an unrequited love.  The 18 songs on this album offer some of the best examples of this beautiful type of music with a wide range of female singers, from Ella Fitzgerald, Judy Garland, Lena Horne and Peggy Lee to Linda Ronstadt, Aretha Franklin, Etta James and Carly Simon.  All the songs are classics, including Dinah Washington's "What a Diff'rence a Day Makes," Lena Horne's "Stormy Weather," Patsy Cline's "Crazy," Linda Ronstadt's "My Old Flame" and some signature songs, as well, such as "La Vie en Rose" by Edith Piaf and "Over the Rainbow" by an older Judy Garland.  When these ladies sing, you can feel the love and the pain in their voices.  A truly wonderful CD that is highly recommended to all music fans!!
