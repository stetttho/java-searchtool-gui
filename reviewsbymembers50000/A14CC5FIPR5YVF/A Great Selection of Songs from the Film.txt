 This album contains the best songs from the motion picture, from the rocking anthem "Rent" to the timable-flavored "Today for You, Tomorrow for Me" sung by Wilson Jermaine Herendia to the heart-renching "I'll Cover You (Reprise)" sung by Jesse L. Martin and many of the great moments in between.  Members of the original Broadway cast still  wring all the emotion out of every song, and the newcomers to the cast (Rosario Dawson and Tracie Thomas) are right up there with them.  The songs are also presented in the order in which they appeared in the film, allowing the listener to folow the story through the songs.  The last track, "Love Heals," was also written by Jonathan Larson as an AIDS benefit song; the entire cast gives it a rock/gospel/r&b flavor that results in the perfect closer for the album.  Favorite songs:  "Take Me or Leave Me" by Tracie Thomas and Idina Mendel, "I'll Cover You (Reprise) by Jesse L. Martin, "Rent" by the cast.
