 Stanley is a bored, alcoholic young man who feels disconnected from the rest of society.  His best friend John is contstantly trying to help him to fit in and get over his feelings of awkwardness.  One Sunday morning, while the two are at a restaurant, a rhinoceros rampages through the streets.  Soon, Stanley notices more and more rhinoceroses and begins to realize that everyone in town is turning into them.  Determined not to change, he confronts John with the problem only to watch his transformation in a rhino.  As the rest of the world changes, including Daisy, the woman of his dreams, Stanley desparately tries to transform, but realizes that he can't and that he won't. This is a good adaptation of the absurdist play by Eugene Ionesco and changes the setting from a small French town to a big US city.  Wonderful performances by Gene Wilder as Stanley and Karen Black as Daisy; and a standout performance from Zero Mostel as Stanley's friend John.  Tom O'Horgan's direction is definitley unique, making it feel as though the viewer is watching a stage play.  The only drawback is the bad '70s music that doesn't fit. The DVD has some great extras including an interview with Tom O'Horgan, an interview with Zero Mostel, information about Eugene Ionesco, and the original movie trailer, to name a few.  The trailer gives an idea of how the studio marketed this film as a comedy, even though it views more along the lines of a drama or a very, very dark comedy. Having read the play in college, I enjoyed this adaptation.  If you enjoy a movie that makes you think, then this is definitely the movie for you.
