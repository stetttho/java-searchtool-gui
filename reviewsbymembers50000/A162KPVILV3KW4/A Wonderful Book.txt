 I just finished reading "The Kid" this morning and feel I should add my voice to the chorus of people who are praising it.  This is a wonderful story wonderfully told.  I deeply appreciate the author's  excellent sense of literary style.  Nothing to flashy.  Nothing too  self-aware.  Just a graceful and sometimes spicy lilt that pulls you in and  keeps you happily turning the pages.  It is great to read a book which  isn't -- as most literature is -- about the problems of the rich and  independently wealthy.  This book is crammed with real people, dealing with  real situations.  I can't overpraise it.  Thank you, Dan Savage.  I assume  there will be a sequel when the kid reaches, oh say, 10 years old; right?
