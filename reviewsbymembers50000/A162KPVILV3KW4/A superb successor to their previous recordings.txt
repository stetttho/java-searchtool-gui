 I first learned about Night Ark through NPR.  On a slow news day, they decided they'd tell their listening audience just exactly what the sources were for those little snippets of music that book end their news stories.   One of the more haunting, an oud solo, was by Night Ark -- and I was off to  the record store.  (Yes, *record* store; I don't know that the first two  recordings were ever released on CD.)  I played the records a thousand  times.  I even made a tape of them to play in the car.  Quite aside from  any new age-y virtues they might have (which would be a turn off for me),  they treat a very ancient tradition, expressed through very ancient  instruments, as something living, something vital.  Enormous creativity  involved here and some damned good music making.  I only gave it 4 stars  because I thought the first two recordings had more of an edge to them.   There is certainly nothing unsatisfying about this new one (I've already  listened to it many times), I just want it (unfair expectation) to be more  aggressive, less satisfied with previous accomplishments.  jma
