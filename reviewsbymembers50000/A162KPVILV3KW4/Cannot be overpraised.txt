 This recording cannot be overpraised.  I was looking for more Silvio Ridriguez and I discovered Aute.  They each sing short sets of their own songs and then switch hats, singing a few of each other's songs, climaxing with a glorious moment in which phrases of one's song are woven inbetween phrases of the other.  Beautiful, stirring, sometimes soothing music that reminds this veteran of social protests of the glory days of the folk movement in US music in the '60s.  And nothing, NOTHING, will ever erase from my mind the ghostly sound of a large audience singing a composer's song with him and then, with the composer dropping out but still accompanying, to him.  This is the sort of experience you live for and cherish.  Really.
