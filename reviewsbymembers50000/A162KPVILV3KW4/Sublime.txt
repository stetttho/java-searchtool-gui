 I just got this CD in search of the "Fratres for wind octet and percussion."  I was braced for some trying repetition, even though the recording also includes my very first Part piece, "Cantus in Memory of Benjamin Britten," and two others, "Summa" and "Festina Lente." I was wrong.  The 79-minute recording is sublime.  I was constantly taken by surprise in the different realizations of the basic "Fratres" materials.  The "Cantus," "Summa" and "Festina Lente" were added, not to break up the monotony, but to enhance the variety of the CD. This CD will now join the precious few I listen to when life simply ceases to make sense and I am in desperate need for centering and grounding.  (The recording of mystic minimalist works by the Chilingirian String Quartet is one of them.  The achingly slow late Bernstein recording of the Barber "Adagio for Strings" is another.)
