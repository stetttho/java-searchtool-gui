 Really.  The author grafts one of the most gratifying writing styles I've every had the pleasure to read onto his experiences as an ambulance EMT and a fireman in his small Wisconsin home town.  This creates a text of wonderful simplicity and beauty.  The cover understates the case of the book.  This book grows from the conflict between what we think and believe, and how life actually works out in the day to day details and dramas.  (Now here's the improbable part: One Sunday morning, as I dragged my laundry up the hill to the laundry mat at 6 am - to miss the crowds - I saw this book lying in the middle of the street.  There'd been rain the night before and it was soaking wet.  On my way back from the laundry two hours later, it was still there, so I picked it up and scanned the cover.  Interesting.  I'll take it home, dry it out, and toss it on the pile.  I read between 30 and 40 books a year, so it's quite a pile.  I put it on the heater to dry it out - probably not the wisest choice - and when I smelled something toasting, took it off and flopped its wrinkly pages open.  I started reading and was instantly hooked, by both the style and the raw honesty of the author.  Everything else could wait; I had to read this book.)
