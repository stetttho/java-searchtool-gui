 I first heard this recording of the Scarlatti Stabat Mater late one evening on KUHF in Houston.  It was nearly as thrilling an experience as discovering Handel's Dixit Dominus.  Here is genuinely thrilling Baroque  choral music whose drama and skill inform the listener, in amazingly few  notes, why Alessandro Scarlatti was THE man to beat in the Baroque opera  biz of his day.  I bought the record album immediately.  The 'frosting on  the cake,' so to speak, was the Gesualdo Ave Dulcissima Maria.  People  interested in choral music of this period have heard their fill of  performances of Gesualdo, performances intended to shock through the  weirdness of his harmonic vocabulary.  John Eliot Gardiner and the  Monteverdi Choir have come along and performed Gesualdo in a way that makes  his chromatic harmonies the logical servants of the texts he is heightening  -- not weirdness for weirdness's sake.  This short performance is  absolutely breathtaking.  Let's hope Erato discovers, some time soon, what  a prize they have in this recording and re-issue it on CD.  I'm there!
