 I absolutely loved B Boy Blues when it came out.  The author created a unique writing style, firmly anchored in the everyday speech and real people of a special community, and told a story of universal appeal in that  style.  As with most sequels, 2nd Time Around is 'pastoral' in character.   B Boy Blues is, by necessity, character- and plot-driven.  In 2nd Time  Around, we know the personas of the characters and how they communicate,  and there is time to get into their heads more deeply -- who is where on  various political and social issues, to say nothing of their own developing  identities.  In the end -- able craftsman that he is -- the author shows  that it is all relevant to a skillfully insinuated plot that ties together  like a classic pastoral comedy in the end.  I was raised, long before the  days of political correctness and the purchase of social status through  elevated literary pretentions, on the down-to-earth value of 'dialect'  literature.  I was, and still am, completely in love with the dialect works  of James Whitcomb Riley ("The Bear Story") and Paul Laurence  Dunbar ("Little Brown Baby").  Since then, I've discovered that  many languages have masters of the same approach -- Abu Nuas in Arabic  comes to mind.  The fact is, you can say the most profound things and make  the most on-target observations in the spoken language that gets us from  rising up to lying down every day.  And so can James Earl Hardy.  I can't  wait to read the third in this series.
