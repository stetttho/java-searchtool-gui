 Recently, I volunteered to sing the various choruses in Magic Flute in a local production.  Not owning a recording of the opera (I have the Bergman film, of course), I decided to check out the local stores for a 'quick and  dirty' version to use to learn my cues.  My first surprise came when I  discovered that not many recordings are available.  There are Giovanni and  Figaro recordings galore; not many Flutes.  I was reluctant to buy this  recording, although the price was right.  It was done in 1954 (one of the  first complete opera recordings ever -- the LP had just been invented), it  was an unknown cast (except for a young Fischer-Dieskau), it was mono, it  was the RIAS (Radio in the American Sector of Berlin) orchestra, and it was  Ferenc Fricsay -- who I remember hearing announced on my local classical  radio station as a child but haven't heard mentioned for a long time (he  died in '63 of leukemia).  Next day, I broke down and went back and bought  this one because it was the cheapest.  Boy was I wrong on all counts of my  prejudice.  The ADD recording is sparkling clear.  German actors perform  the dialogue in impeccable German.  The singers are absolutely comfortable  with their roles -- a true ensemble.  And the conducting is sharp, quick,  and well disciplined -- belying his studies with both Bartok and Kodaly.   Fricsay obviously was a highly disciplined score worshipper who produced a  brisk, unsentimental narrative here.  This recording never bogs down.  It's  a delight from beginning to end.  I'll be learning from it for a long time.
