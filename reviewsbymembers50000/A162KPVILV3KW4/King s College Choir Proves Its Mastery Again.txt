 I have been extremely hungry to hear English Tudor composers lately and came across this CD.  Since it contained works by Tallis, Morley, Gibbons, Taverner and Sheppard, was sung by my favorite choir, and was very reasonably priced, I figured I had nothing to lose.  Everything else on the disc was frosting on the cake. I am especially delighted with the attention to program on this CD.  From following Tallis's lavishly dense "Lamentations" with his thrillingly sparse "O Nata Lux" (full of tasty cross relations), to following Taverner's "Dum transisset Sabbatum I" with the well known Easter hymn, "Jesus Christ is risen today," careful attention is given to pacing and contrast over the generous 73 min 18 sec of the recording. If I were to select two items worthy of special note, I'd point you to Lotti's "Crucifixus" and Kenneth Leighton's "Let all the world in every corner sing."  The first is certainly the most exquisite use of dissonance I've ever heard in a Baroque choral work.  Burney records in his 1770 diaries that the Italian choir brought him to tears when it nailed the entries on dissonant suspensions, and this recording shows you exactly what he was talking about.  In the context of this program, Leighton's anthem is also a thrilling piece of work.  Though decidedly modern, it uses modern organ and choral writing to the service of the text.  Never do I pull back and think, "Is this weirdness for weirdness' sake?" -- as I do when listening to the works of many moderns, and Gesualdo, for that matter.  It is a thrilling ride on the crest of a wave of sound that brings the entire program of King's College Choir's "Music for Holy Week" to an exhilarating conclusion.  (I don't know any other work by him.  Surely this isn't unique in his catalog.)
