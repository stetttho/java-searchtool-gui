 I have just finished reading this book.  It was my intention to get the bits and pieces I have been taught over the years about Verdi together in order to teach a short course on him in January 2000.  It has done so much more.  If you're looking for a book that details the opera plots and offers translations of the librettos, this isn't it.  But if you're looking for a great summary of what we know about this truly great man, his friends and enemies, his work habits, his interests in farming and charity, the gestation and difficult birth of his operas and other words -- and what we *don't* know, things that might still be discovered -- you've come to the right place.  It has NEVER taken me so long to read a book because the pages are so densely detailed.  That being said, I am very glad that I did.  VERY glad.  Here is a hero for the ages, pace his operas.
