 What most reviewers miss about this romantic comedy is that it's primo for its style -- Good Neighbor Sam, Please Don't Eat the Daisies -- and they decided to spice up the montages by animating Thurber comics (since the central figure is a misanthropic cartoonist who falls in love in spite of himself).  It's an old fashioned comedy, funny like they used to be: two dimensional characters, a conflicting love interest (Jason Robards taking a break from O'Neill for a change) interjected to put the heat on and help things come to a boil, and a flock of children each responding to the situation in a different way -- like the second tier comedia del arte characters.  Give yourself a break, get a bottle of wine, a pizza, and a friend with a sense of humor and make an evening of it.
