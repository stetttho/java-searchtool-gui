 I have been hooked on the power of words in poetry -- secretly, of course, since I'm a guy -- since I was a little kid.  I have absolutely no problem with reading an entire book of modern poetry and coming away with a single line, a single image that moved me, the hunger is that great in me. I found this book back in '92 when it was first published.  It spans the centuries and the continents; but has a healthy dollop of contemporary writing that is stunning.  It's quite possible to imagine that all greatness belongs to ages past; this book proves that a lie by nestling examples of past excellence with their contemporary heirs. My favorite pieces especially include "Becoming Milton" (p. 81), "The Colonel" (p. 89), "A Story About the Body" (p. 266), and "What Happened During the Ice Storm" (p. 249); which I have redubbed "A Sack Full of Ears," "Entombed in Tanks," "A Bowl Full of Bees," and "Frozen Pheasants," respectively.  I just read the last one at a poetry reading in New Hampshire on the first Wednesday in January 2001.  A third of the way into the poem, the entire room audibly gasped and tensed.  At the end, I felt a tremendous sense of redemption and relief overcome the SRO room as they burst into applause.  No credit is due to myself; it's entirely the power of Jim Heynan's words.  If you believe, or need to believe, in good poetry, you should own this anthology and read from it frequently, as I do. And the search continues ...
