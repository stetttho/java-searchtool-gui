 I can't imagine a better sampler of harpsichord 'hits' played by one of the great stereo-era masters.  A full complement of emotions is displayed here, from the most delicate and sparing texture to the most rip-roaring  martial roar.  If you're wondering what the harpsichord is about, or if  you're already a fan and want a great sampler to play for your own delight  and amusement, you cannot go wrong with this recording.
