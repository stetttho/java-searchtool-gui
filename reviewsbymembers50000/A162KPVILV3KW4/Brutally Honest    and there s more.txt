 The previous reviewer bemoaned the disappearance of Michael Casey.  At the risk of starting an "Elvis Sighting" type phenomenon, I just saw him last night.  He was at a "Poets for Peace" reading at the old North Church in Portsmouth NH last night [November 13, 2001].  I absolutely love his style.  Gone are all the gooey and fay poetisms, all the 'delicate flower' stuff of the past.  Here is a guy who refines each poem until it is as true to the way people are and the way people speak as possible.  *I* should be so true to my ears!  And, in case you're interested in pursuing things, his other books are: The Army at War, Millrat, and the brand new book he had at the reading last night: Million Dollar Hole.  Such an Irish mensch you won't believe!
