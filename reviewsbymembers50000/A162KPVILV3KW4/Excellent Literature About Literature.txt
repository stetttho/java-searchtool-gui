 Tom Spaccarelli was one of my professors at the University of the South (Sewanee TN).  He was a major influence as a teacher -- fanning the flames of my passion for Medieval and Renaissance literature -- and has remained a  major influence as a friend.  I hear his voice on every page of this book.   But for those who don't know him, I'll let him introduce the work himself  (from Chapter I, INTRODUCTORY REMARKS).    "The codex traditionally  known as Ms. h.I.13 of El Escorial, which I have named the *Libro de los  huespedes,* has generally been edited by medievalists as nine separate  works ...    "This now traditional fragmentation of the codex has  resulted in our failure to perceive that the book was compiled and  comprehended in its own time as a unified work.  Modern editions of the  separate chapters, produced in the tradition of scholarly concepts such as  source texts, regularization of language, literary genres, the primacy of  the relationship author/work, etc., have diminished our ability to  comprehend the unique and unified nature of the LH, thereby distorting our  knowledge and appreciation of the canon of medieval Spanish literature.  I  intend to show in this study that the LH is a text intimately related to  the pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela and to various religious,  literary, and artistic traditions associated with it.  To restore the  integrity of this text, I believe, is also to provide a more historically  accurate view of medieval Spanish culture and of the concerns and issues  that fired the enthusiasm of medieval people."
