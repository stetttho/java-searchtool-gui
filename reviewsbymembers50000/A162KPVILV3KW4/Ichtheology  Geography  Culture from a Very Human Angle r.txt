 When I heard the author interviewed on NPR, I said to myself, "I have to read that book."  My neighbor down the street is a passionate trout fisherman and I felt strongly that this book would help me understand his passion better.  And so it does.  As promised, we join the young author on a trip around the world on the 41st parallel, exploring countries, politics, and cultures and discovering similarities between all the passionate fishermen he encounters.  The book has two weaknesses: the writing style is not as mature and strong as I might hope for, AND the publishers inserted water colors by the author (which I appreciated a great deal; they have a an immediacy of experience that somehow exceeds that of photographs) at intervals of x pages (no doubt a publishing thing) with no references to what part of the text the illustration was referring to -- ideally belonging in both the text and in the caption.  They don't even correspond to the narrative sequence of the text.  It might have been better to simply insert them as a discrete section in the middle of the book, as so many books do photo-illustrations.  All that aside, this book was a very pleasant traveling companion with me for two weeks and I would count the author a very interesting friend and drinking buddy.
