 I don't read history.  Public schools cured me of that.  But there was so much hoopla about this book when it came out, and there seemed to be such a  high adventure factor involved, I bought it and read it.  It is wonderful.   A real page turner.  I couldn't wait to get back to it when I put it down  to work or sleep.  So many amazing things.  And they're all true.
