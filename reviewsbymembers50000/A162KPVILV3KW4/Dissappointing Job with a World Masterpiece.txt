 I hate being negative; but I have to in this case.  I have been a student of epic literature for a long time and I particularly enjoy the early Islamic/Persian poems in the genre.  Nizami tops the list of these poets  with the likes of Omar Kayyam and Farid uddin al Attar.  So, I was  particularly happy to discover this translation of the Majnun and Layla and  ordered it from Amazon.com.  My joy quickly turned to disappointment.   There is so much compression, so much excision of the philosophical and  allegorical content of the work, it becomes little more than a 3rd rate  Romeo and Juliet.  In fact, it is much much more than that.  Three stars  because it is great to have a translation, any translation.  But now  (2000), one of the great modern classic translations, first made available  from Shambala press (1978), is available again and you should get that one.   Translated by Omid Safi and reprinted by Omega Publications.  The work,  particularly in this guise, will knock your socks off.
