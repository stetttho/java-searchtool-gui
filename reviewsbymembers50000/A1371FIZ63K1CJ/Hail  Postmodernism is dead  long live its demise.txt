 Recently I was staying at a friend's house and in the library was Ulysses, I pulled the book out from the shelf and started to read it.  I knew the book was famous, considered by many the greatest book of the 20th Century, and I had a vague recollection of having tried to read it when I was still a teenager.  Fully conscious and wide-awake I closely read the first 40 or 50 pages.  I can't say I don't remember what I read, but I can say I had no idea where the "action" took place, no idea of who was talking, and absolutely clueless to what any of the characters thought.  The experience was completely mind-numbing.  I then turned to the last chapter, and turned page after page looking for the period at the end of that chapter's opening sentence.  I don't know how thorough my scanning was but I believe the whole last chapter, several pages, is one very long sentence. Joyce is an aesthetic bother of Marcel Duchamp (known for The Fountain, a urinal, now a museum piece) and John Cage (the composer of pieces for prepared piano, where the piano's strings are mangled with trash. He also is the "composer" of violin piece where the performer goes through the motions of playing without making a sound. I don't know if Amazon's audio capabilities can capture the nuance of that piece.)  In this "club" we have a composer who writes noise or silence, an artist who exhibits a toilet, and a writer who is incomprehensible...long may they rest in peace. Two positive things I can say about James Joyce is that he has a great sounding name and he gives wonderful titles to his works.
