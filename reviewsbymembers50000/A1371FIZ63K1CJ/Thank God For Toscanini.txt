 What is there to say about Toscanini, but that he is the greatest conductor I have ever heard.  His integration of structure, momentum, and detailed expression is without peer.  I don't know how its possible but the  first cord from each of these Symphonies, seems to set the whole in motion.   He creates an overwhelming sense of anticipation, moves through waves of  feeling, and then lets loose with cataclysmic precision.  And he does  something that I have rarely heard, but he makes every note seem as if it's  a human expression.  I don't mean that its as if it was made by the thought  or feeling of the composer, but that the orchestra itself is an intensely  passionate and intelligent animal whose form of expression is solely by  sound.  His interpretations never sound like musical abstractions, which  are how most conductors' interpretations sound to me. There is something  primordial in hearing Toscanini, that feeling makes me recall that someone  said that the first musical instrument was the voice.  The sound, for '52  recordings, is remarkably good, really! And the booklet has wonderful  insights and factual notes about Toscanini and these Beethoven Symponies.
