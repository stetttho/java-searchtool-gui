 Kitch! Wonderful singing, really wonderful, but 12 (of 22) of the songs are marred by the insipid lyric translations of Merl Puffer and Deena Cavalieri.  Unfortunately, the singers sing so well that you hear every  word with crystal clarity.  Here are some lines: Darling trust in me, for  I'll always be a loving subject waiting your command...for a love sincere,  conquers every fear...champagne will flow, and our hearts will glow...social  pressures I faithfully shun, I defy, those who pry, boredom exists  everywhere, and I'll escape from it's snare...ah, you see, what love can be...I  languish as I linger, from love's fragile bloom, if you'll but raise a  finger, I'll clime to your room, the night is growing colder, the world is  growing older, don't turn an icy shoulder.  I am no expert on poetry but I  think that stuff is awful. If these lyrics won't bother you, these are  beautifully sung operetta/show tunes. Tucker and Della Casa are fantastic.
