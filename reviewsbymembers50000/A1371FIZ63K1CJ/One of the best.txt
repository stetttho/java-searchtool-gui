 Von Karajan's recording of Puccini's La Boheme is probably the best all-around; sound, orchestra detail, structure, and magnificent singing, especially from Pavarotti and Freni.  Von Karajan's concept of the opera is grand, which isn't exactly to my taste.   I prefer the Beecham-Los Angeles-Bjorling for the conductor's lyrical concept.  Above both of them I love the Toscanini set with Albanese and Peerce with only passable sound.  It's a little wacko because you can hear Toscanini humming throughout!  But the conducting sears with throbbing vitality.  Albanese is superb. You can't go wrong with either the von Karajan or Beecham sets but the Toscanini will be an acquired taste.
