 I have yet to hear any Chailly recordings that I have liked.  They all sound long-winded, lush, and heavy-something whale-like!  What he is doing  paired with the sparkling, passionate, brilliant Argerich? ...in the  Rachmaninov 3rd?  It's like champagne and mud.  In the 2nd movement, about  's in, there is a scherzo, and Argerich is magnificent in pointing out  detail.  The orchestra by contrast sounds drugged and ill, the conductor  needed to crack a whip or toss a firecracker under their seats and get some  sparks flying!  Listen to what Ormandy does in this same spot-that  orchestra is intensely sensitive and alive.  I have no idea or suggestions  what anyone can do with a boring conductor-but Argerich managed to turn it  all into a definitive recording!  If anyone thinks that Argerich was too  heavy-handed, let them take Chailly, please!
