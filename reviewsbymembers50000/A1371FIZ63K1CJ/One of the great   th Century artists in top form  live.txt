 Leontyne Price sings all arias with full orchestra at the top of her career.  The sound quality is very good, the audience is enthusiastic, and Leontyne delivers the goods. At the cost of this CD, its a gift! This CD would also make an excellent introduction to Opera, beautiful arias  combined with etheral and passionate singing! Brava!
