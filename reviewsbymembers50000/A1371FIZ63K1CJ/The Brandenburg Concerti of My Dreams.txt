 Hurray! Found the Bach I have always been looking for!  I Musici...they are  simply a marvel.  They create the most delightfully natural sounding pacing  that I have yet to hear in Bach recordings.  The inter-weaving lines sound  separate, and they play off one another with so much ease and virtuosity it  seems like all the obstacles are joyfully hurdled.  This is the FIRST  recording I have heard where I am not offended by the harpsichord!  In an  understated way it adds body to the piece, a colored texture that sounds  indispensable.  The horns and the woodwinds are in wonderful pitch, and  they accent the rhythm until they point out highlights with controlled  bravado.  The strings are warm and clean sounding and they play  beautifully, unsentimental with a very refined elegant line.  Listen to  them trill.  When the music picks up in pace the clarity and warm sound  comes flying through.  And the slow movements are exquisite, where the  legato line is played with taste and feeling. The Violin Concertos were  recorded in '58, the Brandenburg in '65, and the sound is good.
