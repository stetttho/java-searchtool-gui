 Though this Romeo and Juliet was recorded in 1957 the sound is quite good, and definitely excellent for the time.  I love Mitropoulos interpretation; it is haunting, moody, big, modern, and monumental.  He pushes the music to its outer reaches yet maintains cohesive line throughout, there is a part where the woodwinds each maintain the line and yet stand out beautifully.  The strings sound emotionally gripping and anxious.  I have not heard most of the interpretations from other conductors but this one blows me away! Again, with Rite of Spring, I have not heard all the interpretations, and normally I don't like Mehta's symphonic conducting, his operatic conducting is phenomenal (Turandot, Il Trovatore, Tosca), but his Rite is...if it were not for the clarity of the orchestra's color and sound I would call it SAVAGE. The booklet comments on these works' inceptions and their path towards being autonomous classics.
