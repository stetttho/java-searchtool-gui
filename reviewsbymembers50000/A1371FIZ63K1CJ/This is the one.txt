 There are some pieces of music that I love the composer's concept, but cannot for the life of me find the right recording! Dvorak's Symphony No.9 comes to mind, Rachmaninov's Concerto No.2 is another, and up until I found  this recording, Songs of the Auvergne.  Wow! Stokowski and Moffo breeze  through these pieces like romp through a sparkling lit countryside filled  with dewy leaves, a babbling brook, and wafting scents.  Her voice is rich,  pure, and playful.  And Stokowski sets and changes the mood for each piece.  My chief complaint for the Te Kanawa and von Stade versions is that all the  songs have identical moods.  Also included in the Moffo set are the  ravishing beautiful Villa-Lobos' Bachianas Brasileiras No.5 and  Rachmaninov's Vocalise, wait until you hear that!
