 Hmmm...Vivaldi's music had always reminded me of a sparkling morning, with flowers blooming, and birds chirping.  And perhaps a lover bringing fresh squeezed orange juice on a tray and saying, "good morning sunshine."  But Il Giardino Armonico does not sound like that at all!  The music is "in your face" demanding to be heard with all of your attention, like a pesky child.  Even the quiet lyrical moments have a current of intensity that promises the evasion of tickling hands, or a big shove that totters you over the edge to splash in a pool.  This is not dreamy, background music, so hold on to your chair and be prepared to face the playful onslaught. The sound is superb.
