 This CD is a little difficult to review because Leontyne was past her prime by some 15 to 20 years, she was 64 at the time of the Carnegie Hall concert.  For the first half of the concert her voice sounds...strange,  obviously not the glorious sound of her earlier triumphs/recordings.  But  something amazing occurs in the course of the concert, she wraps her voice  around the audience and builds piece upon piece until she blows the  audience away!  The exalted thunderous applause she receives was earned for  THAT evening.  Aside from her mature sound, her interpretations are nothing  short of magnificent.  With the lines from Handel's aria, Just Heaven, I  Shall Die, she wafts up to an ethereal high on the word, ciel (heaven), and  then drops down to a dark sad low at, io moriro (I shall die).  In  Villanelle of Berlioz, the song is about the lightness of spring with  singing birds and a scattering rabbit, her voice takes on a light, quick,  and flexible rhythmic style. With that contrasted with the hauntingly  beautiful rendition of Strauss' Befriet, a song about a lover dying, she  works her magic. With every song, she changes the character, changes her  stylistic approach, but she keeps her view of the entire piece.   Rachmaninov said that every piece should have its climatic point, and the  interpreter should build up to that point and down from it.  Leontyne does  precisely that with these pieces.  She gives us nine encores, NINE, and she  glowingly nails them.  Her America, The Beautiful, sung a cappella, is  crystal clear in diction and expression, and it grows and climaxes at the  most astounding sustained high note I have ever heard (a B-flat, I  believe)! Her long time accompanist (some 35+ years), David Garvey, is  assertively supportive.  Though like I said earlier her voice sounds a bit  odd, but for anyone interested in the interpretations of a great artist,  this is a CD for your collection.
