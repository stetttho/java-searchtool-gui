 For over twenty years I have tried to love Mozart.  Without fail, every hearing of his work made my skin crawl.  I would hear interviews with great musicians and singers and listen to them rave about his genius.  Knowing that he must be great there I would buy another recording with my favorite singer or conductor's interpretation...nope, and it wasn't that I felt nothing, it would hurt my ears.  What I thought strange is that I love Bach and Beethoven and Opera, why didn't Mozart do it for me? Two months ago I was driving through New York State and I was listening to WQXR, and they began to play one of Mozart's Symphonies, WHAM...every cord, note, phrase was singing to me--it sounded so RIGHT.  That feeling did not leave until the final note--I had to hear who was the conductor.  Apparently, none of you Mozart lovers will be shocked but the conductor was Karl Bohm. When I got home I listened to many of Bohm's recordings of Mozart and I bought four: Magic Flute, the Requim, Eine Kleine Nachtmusik, and Syphonies 40 and 41.  And now finally after all these years I am so happy I have found Mozart pieces I love thanks to Karl Bohm.
