 What a wonderful recording.  Bernstein does a magnificent job conducting this stellar cast. The sound is top notch, and the singing sounds very well balanced. Lucia Popp and Gundula Janowitz SHINE.  The characterization of  the male principals may not be menacing or tortured, but Hans Sotin and  Rene Kollo sing beautifully.  Each and every one of the singers seems to  place their notes perfectly and they sound like exclamation marks of the  orchestra.  I know this doesn't sound fantastic, but it ALL, under  Bernstein's command, comes together so tightly with pacing and structure,  that I feel swept into a heroic universe, like I am hearing Beethoven at  his greatest!  I do have one disparaging comment, perhaps aesthetically  incorrect, but I can't stand hearing dialog in opera recordings!  It  completely halts the momentum of the music.  In this recording there is  only a few minutes of dialog, separately tracked, which I program out.   Humor me and try it, and see if you feel that Fidelio improves without the  dialog (sincere apologies to purists and to Beethoven).  There is included  a very good booklet with an insightful interview with Bernstein.
