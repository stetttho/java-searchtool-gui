 This is the best performance of Rachmaninoff's 3rd I have yet heard.  It was recorded live in 1978 at Carnegie Hall with some inserted corrective replays following the concert. Horowitz is moody, elegant, and very passionate in his playing.  But what makes this a hit for me is the great conducting by Ormandy with New York Philharmonic.  I think Ormandy is underrated.  He keeps the rhythmic structure of the entire piece, swells romantically with lush sound, and in the scherzo parts he really whips the orchestra to play with pinpointed exclamations.  This is the only CD I cannot work by; I close the lights, get a pillow for my head, lie prone with the speakers aimed at my ears, and go for one of the greatest rides of passion and beauty I know. The sound is good though it seems a little dry and monoistic.  The booklet has some nice stories about Rachmaninoff and Horowitz.
