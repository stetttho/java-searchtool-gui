 This opera is a masterpiece, though it doesn't really have arias it has glorious music.  It is really like a huge romantic symphony.  Unfortunately we don't have many choices for recordings, and of them there aren't great ones like you would find with Puccini's other operas. I agree with an earlier reviewer, once past the mediocre sound, that this Fanciulla grows on one.  The melodies haunt me for days after I hear it.  Though Tebaldi, here, sounds mature and almost like a mezzo, she has a magnificent way with this opera--she handles it with nuance, passion, and with big high notes.  Barioni is not Domingo but he does an excellent job as Johnson and he sounds like a rough and tumble guy.  The chorus is wonderful, I almost cry when they pass the hat to raise money for the broke, homesick miner so they can send him home. Arturo Basile conducts with a magnificent flowing line. Last year I was in a record store that had Tebaldi's studio recording and I opted not buy then but later, now, like many of you, I can't find it! I do not recommend the Mehta-Domingo-Neblett because it is a frustrating experience. Mehta's conducting is sublime. Domingo's performance is nothing short of great. The problem is that Neblett sings has if she were studying the role for the first time and testing to make sure she as all the notes, which she does.  I am sorry I don't like to make negative comments about any of the singers but her musicality and lukewarm disposition destroys the line, the movement, the intensity, all the brilliant work that Domingo and Mehta created...argh. So if you don't mind the sound this is the one!
