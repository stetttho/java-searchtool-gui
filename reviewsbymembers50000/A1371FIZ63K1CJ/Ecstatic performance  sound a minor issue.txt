 I have wanted to get this particular performance for many years but I was tentative because of the price and the date of the recording, fearing it would sound like a bunch of noise. I love Puccini and I am addicted to this opera. And like an addiction somehow I was not completely satisfied with the recordings I do have; Mehta, Tebaldi's two (studio and live) and one with Gobbi and Corelli (horrible horrible sound)-listening to them made me fantasize about a dream cast-fantasy is not really for me. Anyway, I bought this recording, used, through Amazon; it was cheaper and came in a few days, well packed and in excellent condition. And it is fantastic. Ketchrigged gave a wonderful review of the performance, spot on. The wonderful phrasing of the singing, Mitropoulos (!!!) big, lush, passionate concept and the sound is not bad. What seems to be different from my other recordings is that these singers milk the lyricism for all its worth with really big phrasing and it grows in waves of layers through to the end. In the other recordings the vocalism seem to go in hiccups from very quiet to a few huge notes, if I sound rude don't mind me I am musical amateur.  I am very happy, nay, ecstatic about this recording and I am glad I no longer fantasize about dream casts what ifs!
