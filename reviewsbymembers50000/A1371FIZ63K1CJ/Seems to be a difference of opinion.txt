 This recording of the Magnificat and the Cantata, Wachet auf, sounds ideal to my ears. From the little of Bach I know I don't like period performances and I don't like romanticized concepts either.  But the conducting here flows with grace and taste.  The sound of the orchestra has sparkle and, yet, there is richness to the melodic lines. The chorus and soloists for both are appropriately magnificent.  Fischer-Dieskau has a beautiful voice it resonates with clarity and feeling.  I could say the same things of all the soloists.  They all produce clear ringing sound and maintain beautiful lines.  They all sound stress-free and their sound seems effortless. The contralto, Hertha Topper, has a great low voice with very beautiful high notes.  Peter Schreier, the tenor in the Cantata, his diction is so clear that I can distinguish the German though I don't speak it, and his voice comes across with power and purity.  Ernst Haefliger, the tenor in Magnificat, has a deeper sound than Schreier, and he also sounds just right to me.  The two sopranos, Edith Mathis and Maria Stader, perhaps do not have the size of voice as the other soloists but they both produce wonderful sound. And I tip my hat to the chorus--Wow.   I love this recording.
