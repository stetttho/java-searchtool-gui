 I am not a musicologist or a pianist but I can tell you what I hear on this CD.  To paraphrase a comment I made about Toscanini, every note sounds  human.  Its as if the piano is the vocal cords of some powerful, agile,  passionate, and sensitive animal-whose sole means of communication is by  sound.  This recording of Bach does not sound like a musical abstraction,  like how most interpretations sound to me.  Stylistically, Argerich's  playing doesn't sound like a Romantic mannerism, and doesn't sound like a  period affectation complete with powered wig.  It sounds like I'v died and  gone to Bach heaven; it seems like she tosses off the complex structure of  the pieces with irresistible movement, immaculate timing, and with an  affection I would call joy or love. And far from sounding like Argerich,  the music sounds like...Bach.  But I have that sense that with all the  interpretations I have heard from Argerich, that Chopin sounds like Chopin,  Ravel sounds like himself, Prokofiev etc. I don't know if I made myself  clear but I am raving!  This is the greatest recording of any Bach music  (orchestra, choral, whatever) I have ever heard.  Thank you Martha!
