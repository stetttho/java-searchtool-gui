 This is one of the hottest live Opera sets in existence!  The principals don't sing they pour out molten streams of gold.  Von Karajan conducts with  sure-handed brilliance making the orchestra seem to speak for itself.   Simionato taunts us with solid, solid bravada, creamy and exclamatory in  her upper register, and theatrically dark in her lower depths.  Corelli's  lower voice is huge, and his high phrases are so great it's  incomprehensible that all this sound is coming from one person.  Price  tosses off phrases of exquisite smoldering beauty. Her upper register must  be heard to be believed, it's not just her floating stratospheric highs  that are fantastic but her fluid development of the arias.  In D'amor  sull'ali rosee she unfolds ream after ream of silken phrases, and then  launches the most vibrant, thrilling high note I have ever heard, and from  there wafts to a smoky low. Bastianini and Zaccaria fill out the furnace!    The sound is...good.
