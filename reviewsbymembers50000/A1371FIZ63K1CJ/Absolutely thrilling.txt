 This recording of Verdi and Puccini arias is absolutely thrilling.  In 1960 Leontyne Price had newly arrived, more like had blown away the opera world, and during this period she made this recording.  Every aria on this album is superb.  She develops every phrase with a beautiful legato line and sings the words with meaning and feeling. Also she has the ability to crown the arias with some of the most spectacular high notes I have ever heard, both full-voiced and softly. The arias are conducted with brilliance by either de Fabritiis or Basile.  The sound is good for this early recording.  The booklet does not have translations of the arias but it has biographical information on Leontyne.
