 Sparkling clarity, dramatic pacing, meltingly soft lyricism, and thundering climaxes just begin to describe the attributes to this brilliant studio recording of Puccini's epic, 20th Century, masterpiece.  Mehta  weaves in and out of the colorful orchestration, pointing out moments of  sheer sensuality, drives to huge sound, and intertwining it all with a  glorious chorus, and soloists that match him note for note.  Sutherland's  voice is shimmering steel. She starts off big with beautiful arched  phrasing and simply continues to clime.   Caballe sound is liquid gold.   And Pavarotti rings above the orchestra throughout.  The supporting roles  are delightful.  But the amazing thing is that everything, the soloists,  the orchestra, the chorus, the conceptions, the climaxes, the details, seem  perfect.  This is the definitive recording.
