 I have never been quite happy with pianists; it seems I should love much of the piano repertoire from Bach through Ravel and Rachmaninov.  I have some things from Horowitz, Rubinstein, Ax, and Van Cliburn, but they don't  give me feeling the excitement the music seems to promise.  Last year I got  this Argerich recording (thanks to Amazon's audio abilities).  Now this is  a great pianist...what a sound, what passion, how lyric, dynamic...and there is  movement, tension that drives the music-something similar to Toscanini.   Emotionally the playing is smoldering; at times blazing, and at other times  so delicate and meaningful you could cry.  And it all seems so natural, so  right.  I have gone on to buy many of her other recordings-and they all  bring me tremendous satisfaction.  In fact Argerich has inspired me to go  and listen to other pianists with a renewed interest to hear their  interpretations.  But for me she plays on a level above the rest.
