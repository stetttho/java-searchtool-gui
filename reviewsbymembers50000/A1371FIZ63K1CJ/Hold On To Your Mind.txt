 This Symphonic Dances, for me, is the best version hands down!  And that "hands down" is delivered with a thunderous slam on the table.  Kondrashin's conducting is deliciously wild, erotic, pathetic, glorious,  cataclysmic, and catastrophic. He keeps a Toscanini-like command of the  structure of the whole piece.  He weaves in and out of big phrases, being  tender one moment and aggressively stretching the limits of the music in  other parts, and throughout the hauntingly gorgeous melodies are inflicted  onto us.  In the last minutes of the piece the music builds up so much  passion, tension, and raw energy, becomes so orgasmic, that the sweep  absolutely obliterates understanding, and the whole concept crashes into  chaos. The Previn and Ashkenazy versions are anemic by comparison.  The  sound is quite good for a '63 recording, and the included Bells is equally  great except for the disappointing soprano.
