 If I could have two choices of music to have on a deserted island, this would be my second choice.  Turandot with Mehta conducting would be the first.  Kremer and Argerich play these Beethoven Violin Sonatas with so much passion, joy, and drive that I am completely dazzled.  They show me a brilliant universe which I have rarely experienced.   Kremer and Argerich play all the tracks of the four CDs except for three on the 2nd CD.  Menuhin and Kempff play variations on theme of The Marriage of Figaro and Rondo in G major. And on third track Garret and Canino play Six German Dances. An 85-page booklet comes with the set.  It describes the pieces in an academic manner.
