 These CDs contain great performances from all the principals, not the least of which is Zubin Mehta magical conducting. Many years ago I bought cassette tapes of this recording.  Absolute bliss!  It's my all-time  favorite recording of this opera.  Cossotto, Milnes, Domingo, and Price  simply nail it.  But they and the music are hideously marred by the digital  remastering!  Every time the music and vocalists reach intense climaxes,  which is quite often; there occurs a weird vibration in the speakers.  It's  similar to the old AM car stereos at excessive volume.  I thought it was my  speakers but I assure you it is not, and I am talking about at very  reasonable volume levels.   I see green when I hear Leontyne Price flow  upwards in a magnificent phrase and the simultaneously hear static, what an  incredibly disappointing experience.  Perhaps this is the result of  engineering terrorism!   So, performance rates a 5+, sound...what rating  would you give if you wanted to smash the CDs, stomp on them, cut them into  little pieces, and then burn the remnants!
