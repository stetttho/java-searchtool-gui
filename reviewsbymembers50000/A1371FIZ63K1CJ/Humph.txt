 There are only two reasons to buy this set: Leontyne Price and Tatiana Troyanos.  They are wonderful.  But there is a major reason not to acquire this set: the humor of the male cast, of Judith Raskin as Despina, and of the conductor is disgustingly bad.  When the male singers are singing straight they are very good but a great deal of this opera involves comedy and standups they are not.  Leinsdorf, the conductor, is the one to blame for delivering the buffa with a heavy and ugly hand; he should be booed of the podium.  Continuing my rant, don't you think that especially in opera if you cannot sing funny you should sing with charm? Just like in real life when someone can't tell a joke well but they tell it with charm--it works!  My apologies for going on, but it is a 3 CD set and I program out more than half so that I can enjoy what is good and even excellent in it.  If I couldn't program out the horrible parts I would throw the whole thing away!
