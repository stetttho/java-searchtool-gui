 I didn't do justice to an earlier review of this CD, so now I would like to make amends.  Kathleen Battle has a great, great voice.  It is surprisingly rich, full-bodied, and quite simultaneously pure, ethereal,  and simply the most beautiful vocal sound I have ever heard.  Another  surprising thing she does while maintaining this sound is that she places  her notes with wonderful nuance along an elegant line.  Some singers,  mostly coloratura, tend to hit one note after another with the same  exactness throughout the aria, or worse for the entire opera.  Another  phenomenal addition to her sound is her crystal-clear diction.  The  conducting of Previn is delicately intense, never drippy or unassuming, and  the sound balances seem wonderful.  But I cannot go without a disparaging  comment. I cannot say that her characterization is even minimal.  In the  first aria these are some of the translate lines: I want to reveal to you,  oh God! How much I am suffering, But fate condemns me...By this harsh  duty...Ah, spiteful stars! You are against me.  Just reading the lines I hear  Callas in my head.  But to hear Battle sing these lines sounds like she  dying of exaltation in a Victorian manner.  That aside, it is an incredibly  ravishing set of music...and I come back to again and again.
