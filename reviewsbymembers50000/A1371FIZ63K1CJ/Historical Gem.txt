 Toscanini, what a conductor!  This Boheme documents a great performance and a definitive concept of Puccini's masterpiece.  The pacing is brisk and passionate, and there is something urgent in the music...like the exuberance  and intensity of youthful love.  The principals' virtuosity seems  effortless.  They oscillate between forceful exclamatory bursts to lyric  tenderness, and swell romantically through high arching melodic phrases. I  love the singing Licia Albanese, she is a fantastic Mimi, young and fresh  sounding and has power that seems to come from nowhere.  The Musetta of  Anne McKnight is sultry and though Jan Peerce's voice sounds mature it is  nonetheless magnificent. Two weak points are that, for some reason,  Toscanini is heard, quite often, HUMMING! Bizarre!  The other thing, of  course, is that it's an early recording, 1946, and the sound...well, its not  bad.  But I would not part with this performance; I feel EVERY note as if I  was right in the middle of the bohemians' bittersweet joys and their  passionate love.
