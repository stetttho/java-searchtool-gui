 Recorded live (though without any sound of the audience) in Rome in 1969 under Muti's sensitive and dramatic conducting.  The sound is remarkably good, and the voices are recorded far foreword.  Freni, Bruscantini, and  Pavarotti sing superbly and seemingly effortlessly. Pavarotti is  unbelievable! The whole thing comes out beautifully.  Though the Callas-I  Puritani with Serafin conducting in the studio is a must have, it seems  Callas sings restrained, perhaps she had to tone down her voice not to blow  away the 1953 microphones! But Serafin's conducting drives rigorously until  the last note! The other famous recording, Sutherland-Pavarotti-Bonynge,  has magnificent singing, but the conducting loses all momentum rendering  the 3rd and last Act formless.  This live recording is my first choice, but  the Callas-Serafin is the standard by which the others should be compared.
