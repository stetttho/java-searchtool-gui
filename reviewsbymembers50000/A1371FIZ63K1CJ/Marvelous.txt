 This recording is simply a marvel.  Ormandy conducts the Philadelphia Orchestra with incredible pathos.  The concept is hugely romantic, the melodies and passion really come through.  But there is more to this performance than emotional accents; Ormandy keeps a Bach-like eye for the big structure of the symphony.  Each section is beautifully molded, equally the lilting balletic movement next to the big fanfare of the 3rd movement.  The last movement is pathetic but with a grandeur and integrity that is heart wrenching. The sound is good for a 1960 recording.  The fillers are also excellently played.
