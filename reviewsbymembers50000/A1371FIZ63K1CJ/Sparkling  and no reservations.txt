 If lovely melodies, crystal-clear sound, wonderful pacing do not interest you...then, do not buy these CDs, otherwise, go for it.  Charles Dutoit does it again, he brings freshness, intelligence, drive, and, above all,  incredible sound to this music.  This is my first listening experience with  Pascal Roge, he plays with deftness, charm, and, I think, with an  appropreiate amount of romanticism.  I had not heard four of the Concertos,  and it is exciting to discover something new and unexpected.  One of my  favorite recordings!
