 I was really excited to get this performance; I love Bach, I like Klemperer, and I love the operatic voice.  And this recording as an all-star cast of opera giants.  But the total does nothing for me and the poor thing sits on my shelf ignored like a dead plant in a pot. The sound is very good and the orchestra has a lovely warm sound, the problem, for me, is Klemperer's pacing and his grand concept.  He seems to wring importance from every detail, almost like he is slowing down to point at how magnificent each and every one of the notes are.  I had, also, assumed that these opera singers would elevate Bach's music--but they don't sound right to me, perhaps due to the conducting. By contrast, I love Richter's performance of St. John's Passion.  It's clean and well paced, with beautifully woven lines of the music.  The singers have a kind of "ring", that sounds clear, crisp, and perfectly in pitch; they sound perfect!
