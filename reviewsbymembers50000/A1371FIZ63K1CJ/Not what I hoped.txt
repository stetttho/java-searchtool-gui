 This recording is very good.  The sound and the soloists are excellent.  Kudos to the mezzo-soprano as Romeo, Vesselina Kasarova.  She is solid, expressive, wicked chest voice, and a beautiful tone that rings through to the high notes.  Eva Mei, as Julia, is sweet and lively lyric soprano. Ramon Vargas has a warm and manly tenor. But overall the performance sounds careful.  What I miss are two things, the architecture and momentum.  For example, in the beautiful duets, the singers don't build phrase upon phrase, creating tension and anticipation, what they do is wind the first phrase down to a halt and then the orchestra and singers have to be wound up again.  This goes on throughout the recording. It sounds like the joint uncertainty of the performers and the conductor.  Michelangelo has said that movement is equal to emotion.  In that context we could also ask where is the intense youthful passion, the jealousy, or the emotional devastation? And yet, it is a beautiful opera. My recommendation is to buy some of the live recordings from Opera D'Oro--they are very cheap, but they have captured some really great performances. I Capuleti e I Montecchi with Claudio Abbado conducting, Pavarotti, Aragall, and Rinaldi is a good case in point. As a novelty, there the third CD is devoted to Vaccai's (a composer from the same period as Bellini) second act of Giulietta e Romeo with Mei, Kasarova, and Vargas.
