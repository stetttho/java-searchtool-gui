 In an early review, Songs of the Auvergne, I commented that there were some pieces of music like Dvorak's 9th that I loved but I couldn't find the right performance.  Recently I heard samples of this recording on Amazon.  Based on those samples I got it.  It is a marvel.  Though it is a 1966 recording the sound is superb and it feels virtually live.  The conducting of Istvan Kertesz is more tender than sentimental, more clean than lush, more brilliant than loud, and the pacing is more like advancing rapids than like a driven war-horse.  The strings are right on, the brass are virtuosic, and the drama resplendent.  A tour de force. I prefer this CD well above the Karajan, Masur, and Solti versions. The Othello and Carnival overtures are also well played.   The jacket cover has an irrelevant and insipid essay by a writer; I guess Penguin is using the space to promote its library of literature.
