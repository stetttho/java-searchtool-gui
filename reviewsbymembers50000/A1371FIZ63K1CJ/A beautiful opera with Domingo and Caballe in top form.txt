 Adriana Lecouvreur (1902) is Puccinisque in style, or sounds like early Puccini, and it has more going for it then the gorgeous arias I have heard excerpted.  This recording is from a great live performance (Paris, 1975) with Caballe and Domingo in stunning form.  Caballe sings with her customary meltingly beautiful lyricism but in this role she also gets to show off her range of character.  There is a scene where she enacts a theatrical monologue, entirely in exclamatory bursts--it is black and venomous and makes for incredible contrast with her other arias.  Domingo sings with passion, beautiful tone, and he escalates his phrasing to ecstatic heights.   The sound is good. Enclosed is a brief synopsis, but, unfortunately, no libretto.
