 My two choices for Four Last Songs of Richard Strauss are the Norman and the Schwarzkopf versions.  Going by sound Jessye Norman and Kurt Masur combine to make beautifully phrasing-her sound is rich, pure, and arches  over the heavens.  By comparison Elisabeth Schwarzkopf's voice sounds a tad  smaller, but her interpretation of both the music and the lyrics is  integrated so well that you are swept into the conception of the piece.  In  song 2, SEPTEMBER, when she sings, Lange noch bei den Rosen, Bleibt er  stenhen, sehnt sich nach Ruh, (Long by the roses, it tarries, yearns for  rest), I can feel the length of the stem and the bloom of the rose and I  feel I am calm, lying in a quiet garden.  But my first choice is the  Norman, my soul takes wing and I am gone!  Both have good booklets, with  German text and English translations, though the text and translation is  not side by side in the Norman.  They both included several other Strauss  songs with full orchestra, equally excellent.
