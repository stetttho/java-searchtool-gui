 I can't stand this opera!  Yes, there is a rating, deservedly so, of five stars.  The cast of great opera stars sings superbly.  The conducting is vivid, passionate, and touching.  The music is melodically beautiful and fascinating in its colors and moods; it's undoubtedly a mid-twentieth Century masterpiece. But I am going to rant. The story and the lyrics are so cynical in the extreme that, for me, the philosophical question arises: What is the point? And an aesthetic question also arises: If the music and the word are to be integrated does Bernstein's magnificent music match the absurd lyrics, the disconnected events, and the characters' total lack of connection with each other in the duets and assembly pieces?  Perhaps John Cage would be a more appropriate composer for this libretto?
