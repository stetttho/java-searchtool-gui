 A catastrophic drama, glorious music, magnificent conducting, and three huge operatic stars, add up to exalted experience. Comparing an orange to a peach, I would say that you have the Callas' Tosca and you have Mehta's  Tosca; of the two Mehta's conducting tips the balance for me.  He has got  to be considered a great opera conductor, and probably the best Puccini  interpreter of the last 40 years. (Toscanini is another incredible  conductor of Puccini.) Milnes has a big, full-bodied, and rich sounding  voice and his interpretation is cold and menacing-where a lack of  introspective quality is ideal for the melodramatic Scarpia. And Domingo,  that guy is simply our gift from the heavens. With a voice that is  smoldering and expressive, lilting and passionate, he is perfect as the  sensual, non-conformist artist Cavaradossi.   Hmmm...Callas vs. Price.   Shall I risk ex-communication?  Who could doubt that either of them doesn't  LIVE FOR ART AND LOVE!  And I do think that Callas is the greatest opera  singer of the recorded era, but...there is one small nuance of difference  for how I feel about their interpretations.  I always have this sense that  in whatever Callas does there is something competitive, as if she uses her  art to trounce her enemies and exalt her fans-and I do think that that is  thrilling beyond belief!  But with Price, I feel she really lives for and  sings for the glory of art and her passionate love.  Price's Tosca gets  under my skin; it hits the core of my soul. To return to Mehta; he  inspires from the orchestra fantastic sound, passionate responses, clarity  of detailing, and this all weaves and flows to throbbing and thunderous  climaxes (and here the soloists expand into the heavens)! This is the  Tosca for me.
