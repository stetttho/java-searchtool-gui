 Leontyne Price singing this collection is, for one thing, fascinating because it is a taste of what could have been.  These arias are from operas that she didn't perform or sing complete.  And that doesn't mean they are  stolid, quite the opposite. In fact, there are some arias that I would  claim, set the standard on how great an interpretation can get! Caro nome  from Rigoletto, is a case in point.  Callas and Sutherland do magnificent  and very different interpretations of this aria, but Price comes in with  yet again a take radically different than either of theirs.  It has a  wonderful structure that unfolds with nuance, her tone is warm, heartfelt  and absolutely limpid in the stratospheric highs-it's a perfect mesh  between the lyrics (of sighing, flying, and adoring) and the quality and  tone of her singing.  She creates a haunting, bittersweet, and ravishing  image in Korngold's Marietta's Lied, again accomplishing a marriage between  the lyrics and the voice.  Her Dido from Purcell is the most moving and  beautiful aria I have ever heard, its out of time and place.   One more  aria that is the best interpretation I have heard is Dvorak's Song to the  Moon.  With all the rest of the arias she comes through with flying colors.  Perhaps with the Liebestod, there will be a few other sopranos with  superior takes. The sound is very good; the conducting is not consistent  due to the four different conductors.  But overall the collection is  sincere, fascinating, and amazing!
