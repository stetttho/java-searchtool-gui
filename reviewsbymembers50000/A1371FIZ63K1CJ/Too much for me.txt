 Lithe, sparkling, transparent, impressionistic--this recording is an outpouring of incredible delicious sound and it all reaches me so sublimely. It is the one piece of music I feel insecure writing about because I am so completely drawn into the moment, into the flow of the music. The orchestra and the piano are interwoven like the early sunset glow caressing a meadow's grasses. The slow movement of in the E minor is like a lullaby sung tenderly and quietly and with loving intimacy. In total both concerti seem to be played in an understated way, not with bravado, but with irresistible momentum. Dutoit and Argerich flow.
