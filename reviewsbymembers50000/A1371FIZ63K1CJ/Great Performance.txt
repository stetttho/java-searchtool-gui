 I love this recording of this Salzburg live performance. The three sopranos, Grummer, della Casa, and Streich are in fantastic voice, they don't sound the same, and they are deliciously feminine. They are right on the money in all the arias! The lyric tenor, Simoneau, has hauntingly beautiful pianissimi. And Don Giovanni of Siepi, simply tosses off the compelling, erotic, and glorious phrases as if they were "sweet nothings." And the greatest artist of them all for that evening is the conductor, Dimitri Mitropoulos. Every note is throbbing with life! The sound is quite good. Bravi.
