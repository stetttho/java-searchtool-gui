 You just can't go wrong on a Janis Siegel recording.  Ever since I heard Janis sing the lead on the Manhattan Transfer's song, "Operator", I've been amazed by her abilities.  This is the kind of CD you put on when you want to unwind and relax.  If smooth jazz music and superb vocal ability is your cup of tea, you must add this to your CD library.
