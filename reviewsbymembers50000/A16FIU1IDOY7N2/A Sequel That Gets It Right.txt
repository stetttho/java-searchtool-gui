 The original "Dr. Phibes" movie was the best role of Vincent Price's career, in my opinion.  The vague ending of the original left the door wide open for this sequel that brings a unique life of its' own.  If you liked the first one, you will like this one.  This isn't the type of "horror" movie for the "Freddie" and "Jason" set.  It does require thinking, but you will not be disappointed in this film.  Have fun with it!
