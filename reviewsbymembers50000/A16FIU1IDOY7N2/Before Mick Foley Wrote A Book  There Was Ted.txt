 Wrestling has been a lot of fun for me over the years and Ted was one of the best entertainers. This book is more of a spiritual journey for a man that I have come to know and admire. He takes you behind the scenes of his own experience and shows his heart. He pulls no punches about his failures and shortcomings, but ultimately, it's a story about a prodigal who came home! This will be a blessing to you!
