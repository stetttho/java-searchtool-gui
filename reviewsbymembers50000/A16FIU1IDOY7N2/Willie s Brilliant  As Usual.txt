 Willie Nelson has never released a bad recording. He tells a story better than anybody who's ever done it and this one stands with the best of them.  It didn't contain any "knock-em-dead" hits (in my opinion) but Willie just has a way of turning a phrase, using his unique voice to sell the emotion.  Genius may be a term that would fit Willie Nelson.  Add this one to your collection!
