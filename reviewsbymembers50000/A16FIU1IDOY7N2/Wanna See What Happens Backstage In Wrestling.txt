 This is almost the "ultimate" documentary.  Brett Hart was considered one of the great "heroes" of professional wrestling until the owner of the WWF, Vince McMahon thought it would be better to make him a villain. Brett resisted the character change at first, but he noticed American wrestling audiences were cheering for the "anti-hero" so he used that idea to get the audience to "boo" him.  what happens during the filming of this documentary is a chronicle of events that seem to indicate that he was the victim of some shady "backstage politics".  The villain becomes none other than Brett's former boss, Vince McMahon. Watch the documentary and judge for yourself.  This is a great story even if you aren't a fan of professional wrestling.It's almost worth the whole show to watch Brett working out while listening to "Pacing The Cage".  Watch the tape and see what I mean!
