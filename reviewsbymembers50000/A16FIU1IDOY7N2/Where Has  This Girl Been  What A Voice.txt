 Before anybody had heard of Jessica King her husband (and producer) released a single from this CD (Keep Me In Your Will) and for a minute I thought Lorrie Morgan had recorded a gospel release.  This girl could sing with any of Nashville's finest female country singers, yet the message here is absolutely gospel. If you or someone else has never heard "gospel" music because they were afraid it didn't meet the "quality" they expected, get them this CD.  I can't wait for Jessica to record again!
