 Another in a long string of powerful releases from the Gaither Vocal Band.  This may be the best line up Gaither has had since the Vocal Band began as a "gimmick extra" at Bill Gaither Trio concerts.  It is not hard to find that the Gaither Vocal Band is the #1 selling Male Gospel Quartet in America.  Get this CD, put it in your player and be prepared for a great ride through nearly emotion and spiritual response possible.  You will clap your hands, tap your feet, wipe a tear, but you will have a great time doing it!
