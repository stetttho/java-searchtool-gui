 Bill Gaither & Company paid a visit to Ireland and the result was 2 releases on Video and CD and cassette.  One is called "Irish Homecoming" and this one, "Whispering Hope". What a flow this concert event has!  From top to bottom, you will be blessed!  When Cythia Clawson takes the stage with "Hear The Voice Of My Beloved", I defy anyone to say they didn't feel anything! If you are a "Homecoming Collector" as I am, don't leave this out of your collection!
