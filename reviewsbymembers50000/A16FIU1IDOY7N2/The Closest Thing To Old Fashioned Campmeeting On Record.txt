 Being in the south and being in the Bible belt, I've been to a lot of All Day Singings And Dinner On The Ground.  If you haven't, get this CD and video and you can tell everybody that you certainly have been to one now!  By the time "Holy Ground" is sung, you will feel like you are standing on Holy Ground! Another great release in the Gaither Gospel Series.
