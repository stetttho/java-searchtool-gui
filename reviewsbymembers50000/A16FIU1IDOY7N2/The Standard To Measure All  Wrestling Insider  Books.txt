 What a peak behind the scenes!  Gary Cappetta has written what must be the ultimate insider look at the spectable of professional wrestling.  I've been a fan since the olden days when all a wrestler had to do to be a "bad guy" was raise a foreign flag.  Gary takes us inside the world where very few people ever dare to go and you will enjoy the trip.  I write for Gary's website and he's one of the nicest people you would ever sit and talk with.  This book is like having Gary on the phone or in your home sharing his experiences as an announcer for both the WWF and the WCW.  He's been there, done that, and this is the "t-shirt".  You will love it!
