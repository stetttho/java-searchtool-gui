 I hate to admit this, but I'd never heard Keb' Mo' before I walked into a music store in our local mall.  They were playing this release and it was love at first listen!  I bought it and grinned all the way home.  This is great music to unwind to after a long, hard day.  Hmmm, I might just have to add some more to my collection!
