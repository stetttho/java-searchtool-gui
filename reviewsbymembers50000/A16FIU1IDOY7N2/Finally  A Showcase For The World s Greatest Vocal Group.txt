 After looking everywhere for a VHS copy of the Manhattan Transfer,I finally found this DVD release of a live concert recorded in 1986 in Tokyo!  What a show these people put on!  If you thought that all the Manhattan Transfer could do was novelty jazz, you are in for a treat.  They do a little scat singing, Doo-Wop, old time Rock & Roll, and they do it will the style that tells you that they refuse to be placed in one category.  This, by the way, was the 1st DVD I ever bought, and it is already my favorite. If you are a casual fan, check this out!  If you are like me and already knew they were the best, you will want to put this in your collection!
