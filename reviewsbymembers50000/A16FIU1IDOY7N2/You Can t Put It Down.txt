 I write wrestling columns for two websites. We see wrestlers come and go with little or no fanfare.  When Bill Goldberg burst on the wrestling scene, nobody had every created that much notice in that short length of time.  In the book, Goldberg discusses the "positives" that this brought, and he pulls no punches (pun intended) talking about the negatives that he is learning from.  If you are a wrestling fan, add this one to your library!
