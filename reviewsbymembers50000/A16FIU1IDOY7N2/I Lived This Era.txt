 I bought this CD for really only one selection, Samantha Sang's "Emotion".  When that song was released, everybody called her a "female Bee Gee".  They do sing the back-up harmony and as far as I know, this was her only hit, but it's a classic.  Every song brought back it's own memories. I was just out of high school and working in radio, so these songs took me down memory lane and it was a nice trip!
