 I bought this because of an in-store play of the song "Seperate Ways"! What passion this guy plays and sings with! It's a good release over all, but I keep coming back to "Seperate Ways". It's a song that reminds me of the best of the 70's style ballads that went beyond the bubble-gum junk of the era. This has teeth!
