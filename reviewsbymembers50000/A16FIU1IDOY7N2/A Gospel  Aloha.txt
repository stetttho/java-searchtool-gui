 The Gaither Gospel Series has become a phenomenom.  You would think that with all of the products that are in it, you would find some that were not able to meet the standards that others have set.  This concert, taped in Hawaii is incredible!  As the concert moves from song to song, the evening backdrop adds to the mood and spirit of this gathering.  Vestal Goodman will go on record as one of Gospel Music's greatest treasures and she shines on this!  Add it to your collection!
