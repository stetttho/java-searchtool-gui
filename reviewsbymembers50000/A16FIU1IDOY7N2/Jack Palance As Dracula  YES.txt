 I remember waiting for "Dracula" to air on network television. The creator of the Dark Shadows soap opera was bringing the novel of Bram Stoker's "undead stalker" to the small screen.  Jack Palance was announced to play the lead.  To tell you the truth, this would not be the first name that would come to mind to cast the role that has been played over and over, but Palance makes one of the greatest "Counts" of all!  There is just enough sympathy created for the character to make you almost care, but they don't overdo this element. He's still a bloodthirsty vampire stalking victims.  This is a great DVD to add to your horror collection.  The companion "Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde" was equally good for atmospheric sets, acting, and great direction. I was glad this became available.
