 I've known about the Manhattan Transfer since I first heard them sing "Operator". I don't know of any other group that is this versatile. They can do it all from jazz, blues, pop, gimmick, you name it and they can sing it. If the Manhattan Transfer decided to sing the phone book, I'd probably buy it! "Boy From New York City" was one of the best covers of an older song. They made it their own!
