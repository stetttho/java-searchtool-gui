 I am sitting at my computer listening to one of the new "jewels" in my CD collection!  Aaron has a voice that reaches out, grabs you, and takes you into his heart.  This may be the most personal release he has ever done.  We got a sneak preview of this on his "To Make Me Who I Am" release, but on Devotion, he bares his soul.  The second track, "Jesus Is A Friend Of Mine" has Aaron giving testimony of his own journey and the highs and lows of his life.  My favorite cut on this CD is "Banks Of The River Jordan".  Gospel soul at its very finest!  If you need a little "pick me up", buy this CD and let Aaron Neville share with you where his hope comes from!
