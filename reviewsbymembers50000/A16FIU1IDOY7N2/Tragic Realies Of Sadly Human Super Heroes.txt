 This has to be one of the saddest books I've ever ordered.  That's not a negative opinion.  The basis of this book is a sort of snapshot at the lives and deaths of some of wrestling's biggest names.  Meltzer has done his research and tells the truths that maybe we wouldn't really want to know about these people.  The great majority of these wrestling stars were lost due to alcohol abuse, drug addiction, and the pursuit of the top of the wrestling ladder. Owen Hart is deservedly the first "salute" in this book and the chronology of events around his tragic accidental death will leave you in tears.  He truly was a great figure and is missed.  Most of the others had very sad events surrounding their passings.  This is a "coffee table" style book and is very nicely done.  If you have been a wrestling fan for a long time, you will look at these photos and read these stories and remember the events as they are told.  Newer fans will appreciate the price many wrestlers paid to entertain us.  Great book!
