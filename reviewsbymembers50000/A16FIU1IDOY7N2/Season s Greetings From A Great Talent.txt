 I bought this CD for one song in particular, "Born To Die". This is a wonderful declaration of the reason for the season. Christmas releases have a somewhat limited appeal because of the "seasonal nature", but you can actually listen to this one all year 'round and have a great time.  Barbara Mandrell is one of the most talented female artists ever and she's never sounded better.  This one is a nice addition to your Christmas Music!
