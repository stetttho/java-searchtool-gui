 Bryan Duncan has a voice that demands to be heard.  When I saw the song titles, I was surprised to see him cover Paul McCartney's "Maybe I'm Amazed", but it's a dynamite cut.  My second favorite song (so far) is "If You Pray For Me".  This is super R & B Gospel with tons of brass and beat.  Give this CD to somebody who thinks that gospel music can't entertain as well as bless!  I love this CD!
