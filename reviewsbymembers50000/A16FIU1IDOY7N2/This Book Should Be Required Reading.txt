 Like millions of readers, I fell in love with Frank Peretti's book, "This Present Darkness" and have followed his writings from book to book.  Peretti introduced many believers and non-believers to the reality of "Spiritual Warfare" through his novels, but the demons revealed in this book may be the most frightening.  This would be a priceless gift for someone you know that has been wounded by the past, or treat yourself to a book that will force you to look inward. Be aware: You may not like what you find in there, but you will realize that you are not alone.  By all means, get this book!
