 It had been quite some time since the Happy Goodmans recorded something featuring just them.  They have been on nearly all of the Gaither Gospel Series videos.  This release is a mixture of some of their all time classics and a few new tunes sprinkled in.  Everybody has heroes in whatever field they are interested in, and the Happy Goodmans are my heroes! This is a great CD!
