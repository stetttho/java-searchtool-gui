 I am a wrestling fan and I've ready quite a few of the wrestling biographies that have come out.  By far, this one had the least purpose.  Kurt Angle has come to the top of the professional wrestling world in an incredibly short amount of time and that is to be respected.  However, how he got there was hardly worth an entire book.  There were no great "inside stories", horrible obstacles that he overcame.  His talent as a wrestling performer is without question, but did he need a whole book to talk about it?  I just didn't see the need. Read Foley's book if you want to be entertained and watch Angle to be impressed with his abilities.
