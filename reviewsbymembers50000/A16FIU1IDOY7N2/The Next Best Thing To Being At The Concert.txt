 Bill Gaither knows how to put a concert together, and this one was taped in his home state of Indiana.  Live albumns sometimes suffer from the difficulty of conveying on tape what was happening at the moment, but this "Live" release will not disappoint you!  The special guests, Candy Hemphill Christmas, Jessy Dixon, Amy Lambert, and others all work together to make this a 1st class blessing!
