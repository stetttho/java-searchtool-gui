 It's cheesy and sometimes a little sleazy, but it's a lot of fun!  This is a great series that my wife and I watch each Tuesday night on A & E.  For some reason, the stories of the Chapmans' have captured our imaginations and we have a blast with this show!  These are great episodes chosen by Duane "Dog" Chapman himself.
