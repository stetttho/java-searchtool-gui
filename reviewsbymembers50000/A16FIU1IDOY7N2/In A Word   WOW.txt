 This might actually be the best solo outing for Janis. I've loved every release she's had and there have been "high spots" on each of them.  This one is one outstanding performance after another.  Surrounding herself with a four piece band and the "Siegelettes" this is a great recording.  Right now, I'm leaning towards her cover of "Let It Be Me" as my favorite and "You Don't Know Me" coming in pretty close.  There isn't a bad song on the entire effort. If all you know of Janis is her blend with the Manhattan Transfer, do yourself a favor and get this CD.  You won't regret it!
