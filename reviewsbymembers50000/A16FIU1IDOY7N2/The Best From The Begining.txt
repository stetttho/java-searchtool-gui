 I had this release on LP when if first came out.  It looked like I was going to have to transfer it to CD myself when I found that it was finally released!  This is the Man Tran's best early work.  If you are a fan now and aren't familiar with the roots of this legendary vocal group, get this CD.  The styles are varied and the harmony is incredible.  Manhattan Transfer has some of the best showmanship of any group recording today.   Sit back and enjoy some of the BEST!
