 This is a live concert celebrating the lives and ministry of the 1st Family of Gospel Music.  Two of the "Original" Happy Goodmans have passed away, but Howard, Vestal, and their friend Johnny Minick have the closest sound to the original group as possible.  Surrounded by friends, the Goodmans take the stage and sing with a passion and power that defies generations.  Age has made some notes a little more difficult, but this is history! Vestal Goodman will continue to sing and make appearances, but this is the "Final Stand" for what we know to be the "Happy Goodmans". This is a great treasure and a lot of fun!
