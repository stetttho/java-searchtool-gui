 I bought this on LP back in 1977 in New York City. My copy of their first release was almost worn out and this one was on the shelf. What a treat to find it released on CD! Nobody does harmony like the Manhattan Transfer. They may not be for everybody's taste, but they sure are great to me. This is a neat albumn with a pretty good range of material.
