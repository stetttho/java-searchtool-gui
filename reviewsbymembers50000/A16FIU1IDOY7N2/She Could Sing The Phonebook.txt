 Vestal Goodman wanted to sing opera as a young lady and she would have been incredible.  God had other plans for her and this release shows the evidence of that plan. Vestal shares the recording with artists from the secular and sacred music fields, but this recording belongs to the 1st Lady Of Gospel Music, Vestal Goodman!  Get it!
