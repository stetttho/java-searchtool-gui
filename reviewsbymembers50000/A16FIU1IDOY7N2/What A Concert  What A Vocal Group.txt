 I have been a Manhattan Transfer fan ever since I first heard them sing "Operator" and have nearly everthing they have recorded. After searching nearly every store, web site, etc trying to find a video of a "Transfer" concert, what a joy it was to come across this DVD recorded during their tour of Tokyo.  It was recorded in 1986 and contains many songs from the "Vocalese" release as well as favorites from their career.  If you have thought that the Manhattan Transfer was just a novelty act, you owe yourself a look at this! By the way, this was the 1st DVD I purchased.  Even casual fans need to treat themselves to this concert!  Janis Siegel rocks the house with her lead vocals on "Boy From New York City".  These folks are the best at what they do!
