 I grew up enjoying professional wrestling as a child and I still enjoy the spectacle of the "show".  Heenan is one of wrestling's legendary talkers.  He was never blessed with a great build, but nobody can tell a story like Bobby "the Brain".  This book would have rated "5 Stars" if it had been longer.  If you are a fan of pro wrestling, you'll enjoy having this in your collection.  There are some hilarious anecdotes sprinkled throughout.  It's almost like sitting down with Heenan and listening to him tell you about his adventures.
