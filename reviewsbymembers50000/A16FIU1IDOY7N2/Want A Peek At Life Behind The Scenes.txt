 Barry Blaustein follows a childhood love for wrestling in this documentary feature.  He takes his crew into the backstage areas that few fans ever get to see.  The stories are primarily positive. We get to see Mick Foley/Cactus Jack/Mankind as a real life dad.  Out of the wrestling superstars, Foley probably comes across as the most "normal".  Terry Funk has long been known as "wrestling's original madman" and we get to see the effects that a so-called phony sport has taken on his body.  Something drives him to keep doing it, even though he's allegedly retired many times. The feature of Jake The Snake Roberts is the darkest. Here is a man haunted by a past that he can't seem to escape.  The contrasts in Jake's early appearances and what he's become due to drugs and alcohol are astonishing.  This isn't easy viewing, but maybe this film is the most honest documentary ever produced about professional wrestling.
