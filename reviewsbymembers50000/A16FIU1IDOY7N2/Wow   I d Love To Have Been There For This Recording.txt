 Christmas In The Country is the newest release for the holidays from the Gaither Gospel Series.  I own the video of this concert and had a blast watching it.  The singing is superb, the song selection has everything from "standards" to some new and soon to be standards.  Highlights include Babbie Mason singing, "Tennessee Christmas" (which could play on secular radio), Russ Taff singing "What A Wonderful World" in tribute to a "Homecoming Friend", Bob Cain that passed away recently after a bout of cancer.  The Happy Goodmans bring the house down with a song called, "Unspeakable Joy".  My favorite moment came when George Younce (formerly with The Cathedral Quartet), Jake Hess (A gospel legend), Ernie Haas (tenor for the Cathedral Quartet), and Wesley Pritchard (a regular on the Homecoming Series videos) sing "Glory To God In The Highest".  They could have sung that all night long and I think the crowd would have loved it!  Check this out!
