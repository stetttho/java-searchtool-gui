 After all these years, this is the book I come back to when I am stuck in my practice and need a little inspiration.  If you are a beginner student, don't be scared off by some reviewers who say this book is not for you. If you are drawn to this book, then that is enough.  You will learn plenty and grow with this book and find your bliss.
