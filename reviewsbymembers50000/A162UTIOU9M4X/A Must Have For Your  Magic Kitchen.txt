 I use this book for labeling my jars of herbs. I find the definitions, comparable names, history, legend, all facts stories pertaining to each herb to be interesting, informative and fun to read.  This book really helped me get started in herb collection and storage.  You don't have to be into wicca to appreciate and enjoy this book.  There is plenty of information for anyone interested in herbalism, magic or otherwise.  Also, before you begin creating tea recipes or brews, it is recommended to read a book of this nature before you begin. There are references for safety and physcial conditions which are essential to know before ingesting or combining herb mixtures.  It is always good to have at least a few reference books and this is definitely one of them.
