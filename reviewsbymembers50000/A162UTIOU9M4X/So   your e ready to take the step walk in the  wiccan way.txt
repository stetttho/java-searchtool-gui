 If so, take your time reading this book.  Absorb each chapter at a time.  Meditate on it.  Scott Cunningham's easy going style makes this book an easy read but yet makes one mindful at the same time.  What is so great about this book is that you realize, you can walk the wiccan path without having to join a coven which might be scary to some.  You can find your own way and keep your spiritual convictions intact.. challenged but intact. Though some "kind hearted fundamentalists" may say otherwise, this book really helps to bridge that gap.  You will very quickly be on your way to exploring the path of wicca to walking the path of wicca. Learning the practical rules of magic and how to bring that in your everyday life with steps that are easy to follow and plenty of room for creative exploration. A must have for every magical library.
