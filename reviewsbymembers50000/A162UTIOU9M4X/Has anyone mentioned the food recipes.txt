 Not only does this almanac offer a wide range of wicca traditions which are educational, enlightening and fun; but the FOOD!  If you scrounge a copy of this edition, make the Harvest recipes, the stew, cornbread and pumpkin bars.  YUM!  I made these for Halloween (Samhain) using red lentils, not black (sold out!); and the food was delicious and easy to make.  I've made the stew twice and always tasty.  The pumpkin bars will be a Halloween tradition from now on.
