 Serious cuban coffee/espresso lovers, look no further!  This espresso is so rich.  Its smooth intense flavor with the right amount of earthiness that is deeply satisfying to drink and savor.   Pilon is perfect for your espresso machine, pot or drip coffee maker, if you prefer a strong, rich coffee.  You want to store this coffee in an air tight container at room temperature so the oils can stay consistent for that fresh, fabulous flavor everytime.  I'm not a local Floridian, but I love good espresso and with a good equipment like Gaggia or better, you want espresso that can take the heat and render its flavor and Pilon delivers wonderfully!
