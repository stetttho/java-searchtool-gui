 This is my 3rd almanac in this series.  Each year there seems to be more and more material, ideas and traditions.  I have been exploring alternate spiritual traditions on and off over the years and it is within the last 3 or so years I have been exploring and learning about Wicca, wiccae.  I can only speak for myself in my own experience. I find this almanac to be helpful for newbies for those I've spoken to, who are more along in the craft, recommend this as well.  If you are open to many traditions and are not locked in to a specific magic practice or not, this almanac contains a variety of traditions, ideas you can try or use to expand your book of shadows and perhaps, create your own magic as well. Like in all magic practice, it is wise to understand and develope your style of creating, holding, closing your circle.  That said, enjoy this book with an open heart and mind.  I am sure you will find something to spark your light.  Bright Blessings to all!
