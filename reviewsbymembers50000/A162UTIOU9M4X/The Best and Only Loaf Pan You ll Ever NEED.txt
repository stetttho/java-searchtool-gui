 After years of using every kind of loaf pan under the sun, Le Creuset is by far superior in quality.  The heat distribution is even and results in tender sweet quickbread with a lovely golden crust.  I also use other Le Creuset bakeware for other things and once again, the same excellent quality.  I notice my cooking has IMPROVED as a result of using Le Creuset.  Buy it!  It is worth the price.  The ease of cleaning in the loaf pan and other items is a breeze AND if you have the newer ovens with convection, anything you make turns out fabulous!  I can't say enough about Le Creuset. Best quality for the money! Bon Appetite'!
