 I have been searching for cookware sets for my kitchen when my cheapie chrom stuff conked out.  I have been using this set for over a month.  The key is in heat control.  Start at a low to medium flame and then let it build from there.  The set is sturdy with a copper inlay near the bottom, insuring even heat distribution.  Although dishwasher safe, hand-washing is recommended - although I have put in the dishwasher with no problems. The handles stay cool, which is also a big plus.  However the lids do get hot, so use a mit for the lids.  Use a stainless steel wipe every so often and this set will last for many years to come.
