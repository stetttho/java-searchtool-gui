 These dinnerware place settings are durable and solid with colors so vivid making it "goof-proof" to mix n' match for a great table setting for any mood.  I have this dinnerware in tangerine, persimmon, scarlet,(it's red, o.k.?), sunflower, shamrock and cinnabar,(reddish-brown).  I love the colors so much I am going to order more and also am ordering the linens to go with.   I love the mug handles, which I find to be very comfortable to use and the bowls are generously sized as well as the dinner plate. The salad plate is a bit small, but I've been able to work around that with no problems.  I also get a kick now and then, when I see Fiestaware on T.V. shows and commercials.
