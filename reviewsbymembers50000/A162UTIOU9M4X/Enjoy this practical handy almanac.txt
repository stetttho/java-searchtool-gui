 What I like about this almanac is the calendar for the lunar cycles, astrology and the suggestions for each day.  It is a wonderful way to stay in tune with the universal vibe.  I also found the rituals for new moon (previous issue) helpful and herbal lore and recipes for sachets, etc.  This almanac has something for everyone whether you practice wicca or not. It has definitely added more depth to my practice being somewhat new to the craft. Highly recommend in addition to Llewellyn's.
