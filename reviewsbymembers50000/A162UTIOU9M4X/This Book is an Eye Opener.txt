 This book is an eye opener.  The information is well documented, well researched and very comprehensive. In response to those reviewers who "poo-pooed" the "what if's"; those what if questions are based on DOCUMENTED FACTS! Those that refute the book only have the bible to go on and most arguments I've read on books of this nature, like the Da Vinci Code, never get to the point of the facts these books present.  Simply put, these kind hearted fundamentalists can't really prove their argument with just the bible to go on, whereas in the other camp have information based on DOCUMENTED HISTORY.  This book is a compelling read, though a bit long in the mouth, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  You have to get through at least 600 pages to see how it all connects.  Fundamentalists will find this book disturbing but if you are open minded you may see that these theories do have some merit worth considering. I also recommend getting The Messianic Legacy along with this book.  Both excellent and informative.
