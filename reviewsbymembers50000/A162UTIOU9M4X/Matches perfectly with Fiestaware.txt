 I bought the plates, bowls, cups, etc. to go with my fiestaware because I like to mix and match my patterns to create a colorful, festive table to suit my mood for myself or entaining dinner guests.  The colors are actually more vivid and brighter than the pictures show on Amazon and the merchant's website.  I have tangerine, sunflower, cinnabar, persimmon, scarlet and shamrock in the fiesta. This set would also go well with the periwinkle and plum colors as well. Hopefully, they can find a way to create a more accurate picture of the colors. I have had the Santa Fe set for a few weeks now and using them in microwave and dishwasher is no problem. That said, if you like to mix n' match colors with Fiestaware or want a nice sturdy dinnerware set with lots of color, than this santa fe style is it!
