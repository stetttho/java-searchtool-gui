 This is the first book I read about Wicca and of Scott Cunningham.  He is thorough with his explainations on each recipe - the substitution list alone is worth the price of the book.  If you are new to wicca, exploring wicca or have been practicing for many years, this book is a constant you will return to again and again. The references contain good information to assist you in further exploration. I especially appreciate his openness. He is not at all pretentious as I have read in other books. Scott encourages you to be creative, free thinking and not to be constantly worrying about "getting it right". A very down to earth writer who knows his subject well and communicates it in such a way to get your "magical kitchen" started. May all who read this book find the "magic" in everyday things!
