 This cappuccino cup and saucer set is an authentic european style of how cappucino is served. This is not the latte bowl we are used to in the U.S.  The cups are made of durable porcelain and are dishwasher and microwave safe.  I've been using these cups to make double espresso and find the shape and size of the cup truly brings out the flavor with enough room for a nice dollup of foam/merengue or just plain, straight, double-shot. The cups clean up in a jiffy by hand or dishwasher. It is the perfect size for the perfect cappucino. If your'e serious about flavor, function, durability, these cup and saucer sets do the job.  If you like the flavor and feeling of being in a european cafe/bistro, you will love this and other products in this cafeware line by Konitz.
