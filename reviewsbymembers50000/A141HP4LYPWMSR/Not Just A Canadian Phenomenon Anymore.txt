 With the release of Gordon Lightfoot's breakthrough album 'Sundown' in '74 the Canadian troubador's name was forever engraved into the consciousness of American music. This was his tenth album overall, his fifth with Reprise and it contains -10 tracks- of essential Lightfoot classics which included his mega-hit 'Sundown.' My pesonal favorites on this album/CD are 'High And Dry' and 'Carefree Highway.' Every track is first rate, '74 was a great year to be a Lightfoot fan!
