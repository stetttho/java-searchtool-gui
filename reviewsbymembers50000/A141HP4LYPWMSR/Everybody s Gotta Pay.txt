 A band of disinfranchised blacks who have lost their land, possessions and loved ones to the evil 'powers that be' decide to take the law into their own hands and seek revenge against those responsible. Soon branded as outlaws with 'dead or alive' bounties on their heads they gallantly ride into Driscollville in search of redemption.   The town is owned by the despotic and powerful Driscoll (David Carradine) and his son, both responsible for murdering the family of two of the outlaws Linc (Gabriel Casseus) and Zane (Antwon Tanner), who also happen to be brothers. If they can successfully rob the bank and kill Driscoll and his son their revenge will finally be realized.  A wonderfully dark off-the-wall western reminiscent of both Jim Jarmusch's 'Dead Man' and Quentin Tarantino's 'Kill Bill.' And in the same vein as Jarmusch and Tarantino, director Jean-Claude La Marre understood that the real strength of his film was to be found in choosing the right cast to portray the quirky, unique characters for 'Brothers In Arms.' He certainly delivered a stellar cast! Every role, no matter how small, seems to have the perfect person in place.  As for the main characters, joining Linc and Zane on the gang is a wonderfully ecclectric group of personalities; Reverend (Raymond Cruz), Mara (Kenya Moore) and my personal favorite Kansas (Kurupt). Great performances are also delivered by David Gianopoulos as the merciless bounty hunter Wolverton and David Carradine (Driscoll) is as always, magnificent.
