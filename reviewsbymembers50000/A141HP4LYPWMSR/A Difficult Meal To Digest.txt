 Have you read the cover of this DVD?  SEE: The nerve shattering Dance of Death  SEE: The Woman Eater ensnare the beauties of two continents  SEE: The hideous arms devour them in a death embrace  Who writes this stuff? Well I did SEE this movie and guess what, no nerves were shattered. There are a couple of attractive women such as the popular British model Vera Day and a young redheaded beauty named Sara Leighton in her one and only movie appearance.  And what about the horrific Woman Eater with the hideous arms and death embrace? Just imagine a very large, bristly pipe cleaner with appendages. Got the picture?
