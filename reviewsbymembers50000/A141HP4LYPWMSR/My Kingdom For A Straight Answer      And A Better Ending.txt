 And so after three movies the 'Second War in Heaven' saga finally comes to a conclusion. Thank God! [get it, thank God]. It appears that the amazingly original concept and dark, cutting edge humor that generated the masterpiece 'The Prophecy' and an admirable follow-up in 'The Prophecy II' eventually ran out of ideas and what little was left became the disappointing 'Prophecy 3.'  The once formidable fallen Archangel Gabriel (Christopher Walken) introduced in the first feature film, the one with a gaze so terrifying your heart stopped everytime he appeared on screen, wasn't even a shadow of his former self by the third film. Now lowered to the status of mere mortal poor Gabriel seems to have lost not only his angelic powers, but his once sharp wit and laserlike tongue as well. His remarks are now trite, whimsical and all but senile in nature. My how the mighty have fallen.  Unfortunately the storyline doesn't fair much better. What began as a potentially good film simply failed to deliver the apocalytic climax promised. The offspring of the mortal woman and angel from 'The Prophecy II' is now grown. His name is Danyael (Dave Buzzotta) and he is a Nephilim, part angel and part human, chosen by God to bring an end to the rebellion. The time of the end is drawing near and Pyriel, the Angel of Genocide is coming to destroy the human race. As you probably already guessed by now the task of facing and defeating Pyriel has fallen to Danyael.  Positives: Even though this isn't Walken at his best he still makes it worth watching. The special effects surrounding the coming of Pyriel are rather well done and Danyael's girlfriend Maggie (Kayren Ann Butler) is quite attractive.  If you're a fan of 'The Prophecy' and a complusive completist as I am I guess you'll have to buy the DVD.
