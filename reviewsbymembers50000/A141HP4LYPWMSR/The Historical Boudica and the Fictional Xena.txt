 While this film fails miserably as a documentary, it does succeed as an entertaining action / adventure movie. I enjoyed it immensely. However, I must also admit that I'm a big Xena fan and since the historical Boudica served as the model and prototype for the fictional Xena character my opinion is probably somewhat subjective in nature. Nevertheless I'll give it anyway.  First and foremost remember, this is a made-for-television movie. Any attempts to compare this production with the likes of such theatrical blockbusters as 'Braveheart,' or 'King Arthur' would be not only unfair but ridiculous. Scaled as it was for the small screen, I found the production values to be quite high. I also disagree with some reviewers who thought the acting was substandard. Alex Kingston was wonderful in the role of Boudica, perfectly capturing the fierce warrior spirit of the Celtic queen and her love for the land and her people. I also enjoyed the performance of the lovely Emily Blunt playing the part of her oldest daughter Isolda.    Enjoy this movie for what it is, not what it could have been. And, if you're a Xena fan as I am (owning all 6 seasons on DVD), this is an ABSOLUTE MUST! To my knowledge this is the only film dealing with the life of Boudica. Flawed as it is, it does provide insight into this historical heroines' passion for life and courage in the face of impossible odds. Good reference material for the serious Xenaphile. It deserves a spot in your DVD collection.
