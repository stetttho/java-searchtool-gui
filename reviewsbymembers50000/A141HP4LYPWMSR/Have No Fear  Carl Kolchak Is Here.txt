 While a skeptical, unbelieving 20th century world slumbers through the night in the false security that there's nothing out there in the encrouching darkness to fear, there is one man who knows otherwise. He knows that the discarded myths, legends and assorted folklore of the past were based on more than just primitive flights of fantasy. These ancient tales were meant to express the existence of something horribly real that modern society now ignores at their own risk. That man is Carl Kolchak, newspaper reporter extraordinaire!  Yes Carl Kolchak, a motley dressed, unkempt blowhard knows that the night is filled with ghosts, ghouls, vampires and the rest of the supposedly mythical beasts long since discarded by an enlightened age. Armed with his trusty camera and a little black bag containing the pre-requiste wooden stake, mallet, vial of holy water and whatever else is necessary Carl boldly pursues his supernatural foes in search of the ultimate news story.  Can one man push back the gathering evil and awaken a sleeping world to the threat awaiting to consume the unbelieving masses? If anyone can it's Carl Kolchak!  One of the great though short-lived television series of the mid-seventies starring Darren McGavin in his signature role as Carl Kolchak and Simon Oakland as his editor and foil Tony Vincenzo. Highly recommended!
