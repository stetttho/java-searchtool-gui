 I remember the film 'The Crawling Eye' quite vividly from my childhood. Who could forget the magnificient snow covered mountain range towering above the quiet Alpine village of Trollenberg with those thick, mysterious cloud formations nestled around the higher elevations and peaks. It was an eerie feeling knowing that within those vaporous white forms moved large, grotesque alien creatures consisting of one giant eye and long octopus like tenacles. When you saw the clouds begin to move down the slopes towards the village you knew what was about to happen, THEY were coming.  If their appearance wasn't frightening enough, how about the fact that they had the ability to communicate telepathically with humans. These communications added a somewhat occult flavor to this sci-fi feature that successfully generated even more angst into the mind of the viewer. But worst of all was the unearthly sound they made. Ohhh... that screeching was something that belongs only in ones' most frightening nightmare.  All and all an entertaining, low-budget B-film for '58 that once again proves that modern day special effects isn't everything.
