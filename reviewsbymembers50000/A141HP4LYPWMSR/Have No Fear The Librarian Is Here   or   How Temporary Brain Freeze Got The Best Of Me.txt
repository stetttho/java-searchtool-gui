 "Mea Culpa, Mea Culpa," I should have known better but I bought it anyway. I simply couldn't help myself, I'm a sucker for anything dealing with the 'Spear of Destiny,' the legendary sword that pierced the side of Jesus as he hung on the cross.  How could I not have known it was going to be an inane comedy and not an exciting action/adventure a la Indiana Jones. Seeing the names of Bob Newhart and Jane Curtin listed among the cast on the back of the DVD case should have been a dead giveaway. I was a fool.  I can just imagine the conversation that must have taken place by the Hollywood 'Think Tank' that threw this one together. "Hey, how about this super secret, top security library like the one at the end of 'Raiders of the Lost Ark.' Only ours will have more than just the Ark of the Covenant. We'll have Excalibur, Pandora's Box, the Golden Fleece, the Holy Grail, the Spear of Destiny, H.G. Wells' Time Machine, the Goose that laid the Golden Egg, etc..."   [Getting the picture?]  "Then we'll have this librarian who's in charge of preserving and protecting all this stuff from an ancient and sinister  cult like the 'Serpent Brotherhood' who want to steal the artifacts and rule the world. How about getting that Noah Wylie dude from 'E.R.', he's pretty popular with chicks right now and we'll need a couple of hottie's (Sonya Walger and Kelly Hu) to get the guys watching. It's sure to win the time slot!"  That's the 'Reader's Digest' version. Believe me when I tell you the extended, unedited version doesn't get any better. So, if you have one of those evening where you have absolutely nothing else to do, it's too early for bed and you just want to watch something silly and unchallenging, this is the movie for you!
