 This CD contains Gordon Lightfoot's first two albums, 'Lightfoot', released in '66 and 'The Way I Feel' in '67. These -26 tracks- of now classic tunes began the long and illustrious career of Canada's favorite musical native son and undisputed poet-laurette of our neighbor to the Great North.  Tunes like; 'Early Morning Rain', 'For Lovin' You', 'I'm Not Sayin' and 'Canadian Railroad Trilogy' (what I like to consider the unofficial National Anthem of Canada) will echo within your heart and mind long after the music stops. Classic Lightfoot!
