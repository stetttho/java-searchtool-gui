 With the approach of his fifteen year high school reunion and the possibilty of re-connecting with his teenage sweetheart (Anne Archer), an aging lifeguard (Sam Elliot) re-examines his career choice and single lifestyle.  This is my favorite Sam Elliot role and conversely probably his least well known. It's one of those perfect little gems where everything seems to work to perfection. Much like the main character, Lifeguard Rick, the viewer subtly touches on so many different emotions during this film that it's hard to define exactly what you're experiencing at any given time. But in the end you are left with a quiet contentment, an understanding and acceptance of who you are and what is the right choice for yourself no matter what the mainstream opinion might be.      Paul Williams' song "Time and Tide" was removed from the soundtrack when this movie hit the T.V. screen. I hope it has been restored on the DVD release, it just wouldn't be the same movie without it.  Update 06/22/05: The DVD came out yesterday. I bought it and watched last night. All is well, the song is back. Thanks Paramount!
