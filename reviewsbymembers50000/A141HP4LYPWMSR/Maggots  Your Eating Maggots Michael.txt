 What would happen if the members of the rock band Bon Jovi all became vampires and they decided to recruit Jim Morrison into the group? That's kind of what the plot of this '87 movie is like.  "The Lost Boys" was a film way ahead of its time, mixing various genres (Horror - Comedy - Romance) in a unique blend that made it not only an instant classic, but established a formula for success that has been much copied since. Who would have thought of using a California hippie beach community with a year around carnival zone to serve as the hangout for a group of young vampires looking for a good time. Add to that a couple of wannabe vampire slayers known as the Frog brothers, two oddball adolescents who run a comic book store, and a handsome newcomer in town who happens to be the mirror image of the late Jim Morrison and you have the makings of a cult phenomenon.    Superbly filmed, intelligent script with lots of quotable lines, great soundtrack and a wonderful cast of characters featuring; Keifer Sutherland, Jason Patric, Corey Haim, Corey Feldman and Jami Gertz make for first rate entertainment all the way. However, if you're planning on watching it during dinner DON'T ORDER CHINESE!
