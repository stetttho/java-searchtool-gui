 All the Enya video's released pre 'Lord of the Rings.' If you've seen her videos on MTV or elsewhere you pretty much know what to expect.       Playing List:  1) Orinoco Flow  2) Evening Falls  3) Storms in Africa  4) Exile  5) Caribbean Blue  6) How Can I Keep From Singing  7) Book of Days  8) The Celts  9) Anywhere Is 10) On My Way Home 11) Only If 12) Only Time 13) Wild Child  Also contains three special features:  1) Enya, A Life in Music  2) Caribbean Blue - Making of the Video  3) Only Time - Making of the Video  This is really the essential video/DVD for the avid Enya fan. As far as I know it's the only DVD release of her material. I find it especially important for the inclusion of 'Only Time' which received extensive television play after 9/11.
