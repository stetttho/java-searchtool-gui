 Very nice -4 track- CD with a good mix of studio, live and instrumental selections. The two "live from Cologne" tracks are my personal favorites.  The CD also has a very nice close-up shot of Amy Lee on the cover (with the rest of the band in the background). Probably the best picture of her to be found on any of their CD's. This CD is now OOP so get it while you still can.
