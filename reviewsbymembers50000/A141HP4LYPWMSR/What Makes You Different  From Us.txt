 Wow, who could've guessed that Milla Jovovich was such an artistic, multi-talented individual! Not only can she model and act, she's a singer, wonderful mandolin player and composed all the lyrics of this delightful -11 track- masterpiece.  I'm not exactly sure how to categorize her sound. I think about as close as I could get would be to compare her to a medieval troubador performing at some grand yearly village gathering like the 'Feast of Fools' Festival. Maybe that's just the image I perceive because of the mandolin?  Every song is different and memorable, my favorite being -track 7- 'Bang Your Head.' An amazing and eclectic collection and a very bold musical statement by Milla to step out with something so unique and be so successful with it.  My Highest Recommendation!
