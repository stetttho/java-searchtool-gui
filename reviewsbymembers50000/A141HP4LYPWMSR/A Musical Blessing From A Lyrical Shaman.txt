 Martin Page's 'In the House of Stone & Light' is a true masterpiece. Released in '94 Martin's debut album/CD contains 10 of the most poetic, lyrical, heartmoving and infectious compositions you'll ever hear. I really can't say enough about this CD, now and always this one will remain in my all-time top ten.   Now OOP, I highly recommend you purchase one used, the price is definitely right.
