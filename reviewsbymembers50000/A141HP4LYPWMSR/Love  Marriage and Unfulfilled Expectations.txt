 WARNING: To all lonely and single American males who maybe considering sending for a mail order wife from the Orient. See this film before you do.  This is a surprisingly good and very insightful film in the disguise of a documentary about Adrian, a lonely doorman (Adrian Martinez) from Queens, New York who gets involved in an overseas correspondence with Lichi, (Eugenia Yuan) a pretty young girl from Burma. She agrees to marry him and he pays the fees to fly her to America. He ends up treating her badly and she escapes into the arms of Andrew (Andrew Gurland) who happens to be filming their relationship.  However their relationship also quickly falls apart as their maritial and relational expectations for each other go misunderstood and unfulfilled.  Wonderful examination of two nice people who really seemed to love each other, but simply didn't have the understanding or communication skills to work out their cultural differences. This may not have been a real documentary, but its message sure comes across as one. Highly recommended!
