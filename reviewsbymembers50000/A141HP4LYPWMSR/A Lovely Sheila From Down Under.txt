 Very nicely packaged 2 disc set with lots of photos of the lovely Aussie Delta Goodrem both on the CD case and the 16 page enclosed booklet. Booklet also contains the lyrics to all 14 tracks.  You always have to wonder about daytime television stars when they decide they're also a singer. Well, this one is. All in all an enjoyable array of safe songs that don't challenge her vocal range so it's a little difficult to tell how good she really is. I'd love to see her perform live, she's definitely very easy on the eyes!
