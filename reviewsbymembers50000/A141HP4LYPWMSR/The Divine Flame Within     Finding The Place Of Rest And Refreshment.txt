 'Lux Vivens' (Living Light) is nothing less than a mystical journey into the medieval spirituality and soul of Hildegard von Bingen. Performed by Jocelyn Montgomery who possesses a voice worthy of a solo position in the heavenly choir, you will be entranced by this beautiful -15 track- CD's exploration of Hildegard's interior world.  With limited instrumentation, Jocelyn is accompanied by the sounds of nature as provided by David Lynch; gentle rain, storm and thunder and birds chirping in the trees. One track even includes the sound of charging horses and swords clashing.  A great way to unwind at the end of the day, or prepare oneself for a spiritual respite in the middle of the everyday madness.
