 What an incredible wealth of arcane knowledge awaits the reader of 'The Pillars of Tubal Cain' by Nigel Jackson and Michael Howard. The darkside of the Western Mystery Tradition is about to be revealed, shedding light on areas within the Luciferian Tradition that have been unavailable in one volume until now. This book could've been titled, 'Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Lucifer and His Fallen Angels But Was Afraid to Ask.'   Jackson and Howard's amazing volume reminds me quite a bit of Kenneth Grant's classic, 'Nightside of Eden.' In fact I think it would serve as an excellent companion piece to their work. Grant's book serving as the authority on the unmanifest Qliphothic energies located upon and within the Tree of Life, while 'The Pillars of Tubal Cain' deals with the manifest forms moving within the shadows of occult history.  This is by no means an easy read, there is so much information crammed into this book it will demand your full attention. If you attempt to carry on a conversation or watch television at the same time just put the book down, you'll just be wasting your time.  Invaluable resource material that you will return to often! My Highest Recommendation!!
