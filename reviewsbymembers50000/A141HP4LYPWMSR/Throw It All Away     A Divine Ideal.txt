 I first saw this movie in 1976 and immediately fell in love with it. Now some twenty-nine years later I can honestly say it hasn't lost much of its initial impact on me. While I won't go so far as to say that it played a part in my conversion to Catholicism, I will say that it provided me with a 'divine ideal' of what being Catholic should be about.  While it's true that the sixties hippie movement was a little too influential in Franco Zeffirelli's re-imagining of the young, nature loving saint, it doesn't take too much effort to simply acknowledge those cultural elements and move past them. Of course the Donovan music in the soundtrack may make it a little difficult for some.  Another often heard complaint concerns a number of historical inaccuracies within the script. I'd like to point out that the main function of a movie is to entertain. I don't know of any movie based on a real person or true event that is completely accurate. When you watch a movie a certain amount of artistic freedom with the storyline should be a given.  What we do have in 'Brother Sun, Sister Moon' is a film of overpowering innocence and spiritual purity. It's a story of one man's vision of the "Life of Christ" and his commitment to living that vision to its fullest. Coupled with some of the most amazing scenic footage of the Italian countryside you'll ever see Zefirelli has given us not only a moving spiritual document but a visual feast not soon to be forgotten.  Praise should also be given to a young cast, most of whom I've never seen in anything else. Graham Faulkner "is" Saint Francis as far as I'm concerned. Leigh Lawson was superb as his best friend Bernardo, as was Judi Bowker as the lovely Clare.
