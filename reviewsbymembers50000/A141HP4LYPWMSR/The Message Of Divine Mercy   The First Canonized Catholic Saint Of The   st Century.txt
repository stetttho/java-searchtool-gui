 Note: Polish with English subtitles.  Sister Maria Faustina (born Helena Kowalska in Glogowiec, Poland on August 25, 1905) was canonized on April 30, 2000 by Pope John Paul II thus becoming the first Catholic saint of the 21st century. This all Polish production was released in '95, five years before Sister Faustina's canonization and was most certainly intent on helping promote the good sisters' Papal consideration for sainthood.  However having said that, please don't shy away from seeing this film thinking it was meant to be nothing more than a proselytizing vehicle for Catholicism. Personally I found 'Faustina' to be a very honest, historical presentation that was never overly dramatic or preachy in any way. The screenplay, based on her diary, conveys a simple, straightforward look at her life making this a film that could be enjoyed by everyone no matter what religious, or non religious persuasion you may adhere to.  Director Jerzy Lukaszewicz and the all Polish cast did a fabulous job of recreating the time, place and events in the life of Sister Faustina. I also need to mention the charming and demure Dorota Segda who was wonderful in the lead role, capturing both the inner and outer beauty of this deeply mystical and devoted servant of God.  Saint Faustina died in 1938 after a long and painful battle with tuberculosis. Fortunately an amazing record of her life remains with us in the form of her diary covering four years of her life. It contains her mystical and revelatory experiences along with her personal insights and prayers and is over 600 pages in length. She was also granted permission by the Church to commission a painting which is now known the world over as the "Divine Mercy."
