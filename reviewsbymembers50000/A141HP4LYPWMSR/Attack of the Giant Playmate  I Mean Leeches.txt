 11 out of 12 reviewers (now 12 with mine) are in agreement. 'Attack of the Giant Leeches' is all about the very sexy, kittenish Yvette Vickers in the role of the town tramp Liz Walker. Yvette undoubtedly got the part based on her recent popularity as the July '59 "Playmate of the Month" and all the males out there who were in their adolescence back in the late fifties certainly appreciated her inclusion in the film. She certainly made it watchable for me.  Make no mistake, you're watching this movie for one reason and one reason only. Thanks for the memories Miss Vickers!  Note: Can you believe it, one reviewer actually prefered the leeches over Yvette. Now that's scary.
