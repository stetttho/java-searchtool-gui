 Sarah (LeeLee Sobieski), an aspiring young actree from Australia moves into an upscale apartment building in France. When a brief but emotionally charged relationship fails and she loses the lead role in a play Sarah falls into a sucidal depression. Unable to function or complete the most elementary of daily tasks, she lays prostrate on her bed neglecting both hygiene and nourishment.  Fortunately an elderly Chinese neighbor (James Hong) observes her plight through an open door and decides to care for her. Taking on the chores of cooking and cleaning he nurses her back to health. Before long a tenious bond of friendship and mutual fascination forms between them.  The pace of the film is excruciatingly slow and for those who watch it to the conclusion are bond to wonder why they even bothered. For those who want to see LeeLee Sobieski topless I guess this is the movie for you. Or if you're a manic depressive who appreciates slow, somber studies in self-loathing and psychological isolation, ENJOY!
