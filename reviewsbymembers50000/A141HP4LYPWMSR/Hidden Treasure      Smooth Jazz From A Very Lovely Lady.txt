 The first track on this -9 track- CD is titled, 'Hidden Treasure.' Most appropriate beginning for this wonderful and enjoyable collection of smooth jazz by the very lovely and talented violinist Sonya Robinson on her debut album/CD self titled, 'Sonya.' Released in '87 and now long OOP and extremely hard to find, I can't help but wonder why this little gem hasn't been re-issued.  The price tag is pretty high on this item, but if you're into jazz you might want to consider the investment.
