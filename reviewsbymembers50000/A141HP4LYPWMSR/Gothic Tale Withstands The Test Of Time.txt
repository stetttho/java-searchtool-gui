 'The Hound of the Baskervilles' ('59) is one of the earliest and one of the best Hammer Films. This atmospheric black and white production perfectly captures the mood and intensity of the dark, dreary, fog shrouded moors. The ideal location for an unresolved generational mystery and a recent unexplained death. Enter Sherlock Holmes and the rest is, well, elementary.  Boasting a cast containing some of Britain's finest; Peter Cushing (Sherlock Holmes), Andre Morell (Doctor Watson) and Christopher Lee (Sir Henry Baskerville) you have before you one of the essentials in the Hammer Library of Film.
