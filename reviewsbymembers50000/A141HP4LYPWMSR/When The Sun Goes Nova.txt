 Hal Lindsays' teaching on Biblical prophecy as encapsulated in his best-selling book 'The Late Great Planet Earth' had a major effect on evangelical Protestantism during the decade of the '70's. An effect so profound that just about every pastor teaching prophecy today approaches the subject using the same methodological framework that Hal made so popular a quarter of a century ago.  This DVD released in '78 is a visual restatement of Hal Lindsay's prophetical teachings. Now that some 27 years have passed since it's release the information contained upon this disc is far from cutting edge material. It does however serve as a fascinating timecapsule concerning many of the current events of that generation and the theological underpinnings of how the Church interpreted those events from a Biblical perspective.  Whether you buy into the "End of the World" scenario as presented by Evangelical Christianity or not it's worthy of at least one viewing. There might even be a few surprises that you didn't expect.
