 Hawaii is one of the most beautiful, bittersweet movies ever made. From the opening prologue with Keoki (Manu Tupou) relating the history of the Hawaiian people over the glorious music of Elmer Bernstein I knew I was going to love this movie.   Keoki, a native Hawaiian and first convert to the Christian faith has traveled across the ocean to America in hopes of convincing some of the upcoming graduates of a Calvinist College in New England to sail to Hawaii and share their faith with his people.  Amongst those to accept the challenge is Abner Hale (Max Von Sydow) a young man of good intentions, but overzealous and prideful in his Christianity. Unable to join in the missionary effort unless he is married, one is arranged for him with the lovely Jerusha Bromley (Julie Andrews).  The hardships of the sea voyage are only a taste of the hardship that face them once they arrive at their destination. As the new arrivals acclimate themselves to their new surroundings Jerusha soon falls in love with the open and loving nature to the natives while Abner grows more narrow and unbending in his proselytization efforts. Unable to appreciate the beauty around him, he sees only heathens doomed to hell for their pagan ways.  Abner eventually loses sight of the Christian message to "love one another" and in a fit of range calls upon God to bring death and destruction to the unrepentant Hawaiians. When a measles epidemic spreads through the islands it appears Abner prayer has been answered with dire consequences.    A poignant and ultimately sad tale of the lose of yet another native 'land of paradise' brought about the greed and lack of concern by foreign powers.   MGM only receives -4 Stars- on this DVD. Why in the world they didn't restore 'Hawaii' to its full 189 minutes theatrical version instead of releasing this truncated 161 minute version is beyond me. Come on MGM, try again!
