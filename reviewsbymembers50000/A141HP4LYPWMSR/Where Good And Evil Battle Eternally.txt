 Ask any male who went through adolescence in the '50's and 60's for the one word that was synonomous with special effects and they will all answer, Harryhausen.  'The Golden Voyage Of Sinbad' was the second in a series of three Sinbad movies highlighted by the clay models of Ray Harryhausen. It was also the best. Yes, it's true that by todays standards the stop-action techniques used back then to provide the illusion of movement by Ray's fantastic creations was slow and cumbersome compared to what we can accomplish today with computer-generated images. However for us old-timers who didn't know any better it was absolutely magical.   'The Golden Voyage of Sinbad' was a classic of the genre in '73 and can still be enjoyed by the younger, albeit more visually sophisticated generation if they are willing to overlook some of the inherent flaws from a time before computers forever changed the cinematic landscape.  While somethings constantly change, somethings remain forever constant. No special effects are necessary to enjoy the ravishing Marigiana (Caroline Munro), looking better than any woman has ever looked on film.
