 Note: Hindi with English subtitles.  Simran (Mallika Sherawat) and Sudhir (Ashmit Patel) are a young, good-looking and wealthy couple that seem to have all the necessary ingredients for a perfect life together. However something is missing and it seems that something has been rediscovered when Simran unexpectedly encounters Sunny (Emran Hashmi), an old boyfriend, on a crowded Bangkok street. This chance meeting between two ex-lovers soon re-ignites old passions and a torrid affair ensues. However when Simran finally returns to her senses and tries to end their illicit relationship Sunny reveals his true evil nature and things turn exceedingly dangerous for everyone.  This isn't a film that ranks up there with the likes of 'Lagaan' or 'Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham.' It is however quite good with production values and a script a cut above most Indian films. What really makes this movie a must see is the unbelievably beautiful Mallika Sherawat. Director Anurag Basu certainly knew what he was doing when he picked her for the part of Simran. The camera absolutely devours her at every opportunity. Every angle, every lighting effect is utilized in maximizing her exotic loveliness. The scene of her soaking wet in the rain trying to flag down a taxi is worth the price of the DVD. You won't be able to take your eyes off the screen for fear of missing another view of Mallika.
