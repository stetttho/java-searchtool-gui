 The first time I watched this movie I wasn't too impressed. Looking back I'd have to say this negative first impression was totally my fault and not the films. I guess it just didn't fit my preconceived notion of what Neverland should be like and simply didn't give the movie a chance to pull me into its wonderfully imaginary landscape of people and places. Fortunately my daughter loved it and forced me to watch it with her over and over and over again. Once I learned to let myself go and become a child (which is what this film is about in the first place), I fell in love with it!  While some Amazon reviewers have questioned the choice of Robin Williams for the lead role of Peter Panning, I found him to be absolutely perfect in the part of the middle-aged workalcoholic who had forgotten all about his childhood adventures as the legendary Peter Pan. Then of course you have stellar performances by the rest of the all-star cast:  Dustin Hoffman (Captain Hook), Bob Hoskins (Smead), Julia Roberts (Tinkerbell) and Maggie Smith (Granny Wendy). Lesser known, but three of my personal favorites in the movie were:  Caroline Goodall (Moira Panning), Dante Basco (Rufio) and Amber Scott (Maggie Panning).  Become A Child Again! It Will Be An Awfully Big Adventure!
