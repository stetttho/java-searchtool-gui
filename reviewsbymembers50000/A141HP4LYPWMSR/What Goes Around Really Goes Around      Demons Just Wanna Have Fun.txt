 John Hobbes (Denzel Washington) is an honest, hardworking, detective who believes in facts, not fantasies. However shortly after the gas chamber execution of convicted serial killer Edgar Reese (Elias Koteas) a series of events begin to take place that severly challenges his belief system.  Another series of murders begin and the evidence seems to point to an ongoing connection to the deceased Edgar Reese. With the help of Gretta Milano (Embeth Davidtz) a Theology professor and expert on Angelology, Hobbes eventually comes face to face with the ultimate truth. The real killer is an evil, disembodied spirit named Azazel who randomly possesses humans to carry out his murderous deeds.    Initially and understandably Hobbes has difficulty understanding and accepting this truth. However he is forced to reconsider the possibility when strangers passing by on the street and fellow officers in the police station begin to look his way with a malicious smile and begin singing the classic 60's tune, "Time Is On My Side" [the same thing Edgar Reese did in the final moments before his execution]. He realizes Azazel is taunting him as he moves from body to body.  This is an outstanding film of psychological/supernatural horror. You will never be able to listen to that 'Rolling Stones' song again without feeling the presence of Azazel lurking somewhere in the shadows. Magnificent directorial job by Gregory Hoblit and a wonderful all-star cast featuring: Denzel Washington, John Goodman, Embeth Davidtz, James Gandolfini, Donald Sutherland, Elias Koteas (who had a small part but was brilliant) and of course Azazel as himself.
