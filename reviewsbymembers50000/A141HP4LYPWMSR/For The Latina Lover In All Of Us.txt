 Look at the DVD cover. If you like the cover, you'll like the movie. This film has assembled an amazing bevy of Latina beauties that is truly mindboggling. I'm not talking about just the three women on the cover (Roselyn Sanchez, Sophia Vergara and Jaci Velasquez). That's only the beginning. Just to name a few, your television screen will be graced by the likes of; Lisa Vidal, Nicole Scherizinger and Ivette Sosa (both formly of Eden's Crush), Joy Enriquez and Sandra Ramirez (my personal favorite). How's that for a line-up and still there's more.  Oh yea, I almost forgot to mention the plot. Young, successful guy tries to juggle three girlfriends at the same time. I bet you've never heard that one before have you? On second thought, forget about the plot, just sit back and enjoy the scenery.   By the way, for all the ladies out there's also Eduardo Verastequi in the cast to peek your interest.
