 Plot: Dr. Bolton (Boris Karloff), highly respected surgeon in mid-19th century England believes in the possibility of painless surgery dispite the derision of his unbelieving colleages. In his obsessive desire to discover the right mix of chemicals for his proposed anesthetic he risks his reputation and life by acting as the guinea pig for his experimental concoctions.   This '58 film is not some much a horror movie as it's a tale of how complusion and lack of self restriant can lead one down the road to addiction and depravity. 'Corridors of Blood' chronicles Dr. Bolton steady descent into an intoxicating, hallucinatory realm as his continued inhalation of his elixir slowly overshadows his senses.  This film was directed by Robert Day who was also responsible for directing Karloff's obsessive-complusive performance in 'The Haunted Strangler.' You'll notice the similarities in both movies immediately. Directorial style, cinematic approach, the background settings of 19th century London and Karloff's characterization are all but identical. This film is also noteworthy for bringing Boris Karloff and Christopher Lee together for the first time, two of the great classic actors of the horror genre.  Yvonne Romain and Betta St. John have small roles but add a much needed touch of beauty to an otherwise dark and unseamly tale.
