 The Fantastic Four were my favorite superheroes growing up. It's been a long journey from their first appearance in Marvel Comics in the early sixties to a big screen live-action feature film in '05, but it was certainly worth the wait. Here they are in all their glory to be enjoyed by young and old alike; Mr. Fantastic (Ioan Gruffudd), Invisible Girl (Jessica Alba), the Human Torch (Chris Evans) and of course the indominable Thing (Michael Chiklis). They look and act exactly the way they did in the comics!   All this and Doctor Doom (Julian McMahon) too! FANTASTIC!!  Note: Forget about all the negative reviews and the criticism about the one-dimensionality of the characters. Excuse me, but isn't this supposed to be based on a comic book? If you want depth watch an Ingmar Bergman film.
