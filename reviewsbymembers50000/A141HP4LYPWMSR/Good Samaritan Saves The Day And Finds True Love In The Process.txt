 Keanu Reeves is wonderful as Paul Sutton, a young WWII vetran turned traveling chocolate salesman who finds true love on a public bus. The lovely Aitana Sainchez-Gijan plays his love interest Victoria, a college student returning to the family vineyard to help with the harvest.   Through a series of unforeseen circumstances Paul decides to accompany Victoria home and pose as her new husband in order to save her the embarrassment of telling her stern, disciplinarian Father (Giancarlo Giannini) she is pregnant and unwed. In the days that follow the romantic pretense between the two slowly but surely becomes a reality. There's only one problem, Paul is already married.  Great performances abound in this film, especially the delightful portrayal of Anthony Quinn as Don Pedro Aragan, Victoria's chocolate loving Grandfather and family patriarch.
