 This is definitely not something for the mainstream film fan, but if you're into Spanish horror and more specifically writer/director Amando de Ossorio's atmospheric four movies known lovingly as "the Blind Dead", this is the item for you.  Blue Underground has put together one of the best boxsets to come along in quite some time. Yes, the price tag is a little steep but if you're a true fan of this rarely seen series it's worth every penny. The box contains -5 discs- (4 movies and a documentary), each in their own plastic case with great cover art, a 40 page booklet with photo stills and original poster art and a sturdy casket shaped box for display (or to hide away from friends and family unsympathic with your "perverse" taste in movies).  The collection is not perfect, there are several missing scenes here and there no matter what the distributor says to the contrary. Be that as it may, these films have been unavailable for so long I'll overlook this one tiny flaw.  Warning: Be sure your wife or girlfriend are safely inside the house before viewing and if you hear the sound of hoofs approaching DON'T OPEN THE DOOR!
