 Note: Korean with English subtitles.  Love comes too late for a thirty-something photographer that discovers he is terminally ill with only weeks to live. A lovely meter reader begins to frequent his shop just after he receives the bad news. They fall in love, but never openly express their feelings for each other. He keeps his illness secret from her until the end.  Wow, this Korean film from '98 is one of the most beautiful, bittersweet love stories I have ever seen. I haven't seen anything this sad and romantic since "Somewhere In Time." The only thing that bothers me about this movie is the title. Christmas has nothing to do with anything in this story, it's never even mentioned. Be that as it may the movie is so good I'll forgive this one little discrepency.  Han Suk-Kyu and the beautiful Shim Eun-Ha are magnificent together. If you loved "Comrades, Almost A Love Story" you'll love this one too!
