 Did highly advanced civilizations exist on the earth long before conventional history wants us to believe? Civilizations that understood secrets in astronomy, mathematics and many other fields of scientific endeavor that have unfortunately been lost with the passing of time, now buried somewhere in the sands of antiquity.  Are the ancient tales of an antediluvian "Golden Age" populated by beings with miraculous God-like abilities really just nothing more than myth and legend? Or are they in reality the last remaining fragmentary accounts of what mankind once was and may become again in some future age?     Warning, this documentary will challenge everything you've been taught about history, astronomy, religion and the nature and destiny of mankind. Be ready to postulate such concepts as:  1) The discovery of a 24,000 year celestial cycle which determines the rise and fall of civilizations and man's ability to comprehend 'higher wisdom.' 2) A 'second sun' rotating in conjunction with our own. 3) Flying machines and intercontinental travel thousands of years before the pyramids were built. 4) A time when telepathy, levitation and other psychic powers were commonplace.  A very well produced documentary that will make you re-think your belief system. Nothing will ever be the same again. Highly recommended!
