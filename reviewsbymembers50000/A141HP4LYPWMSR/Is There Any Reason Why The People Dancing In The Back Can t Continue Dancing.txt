 Recorded during a live concert in '77, 'Circles In The Stream' is in my estimation the best live concert album/CD I've ever heard and an "ABSOLUTE ESSENTIAL" to any serious Bruce Cockburn collection.  Containing - 17 tracks - this highly original musical blending of folk-jazz-blues and rock influences along with a medieval melody or two, we are treated to a truly delightful listening experience featuring the very best of the early Cockburn years (which are by far my personal favorite). Filled with a compilation of songs from his first seven albums/CD's: 'Bruce Cockburn', 'High Winds White Sky', Sunwheel Dance', 'Night Vision', 'Salt, Sun and Time', 'Joy Will Find A Way' and 'In The Falling Dark', this CD is a wonderful trip down memory lane.  From the opening bagpipes to the finale; 'God Bless The Children' you will be in awe of the amazing musicianship, lyrical depth and soul of this French Canadian composer and musician. Much like the people dancing in the back spoken of by Bruce at the end of the concert, you too will continue to dance to this glorious music long after the concert's over.
