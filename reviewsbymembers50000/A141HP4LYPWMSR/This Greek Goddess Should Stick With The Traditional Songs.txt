 Well there's a little bit of everything on this 2 CD set. Dance - Techno Pop - Romantic Ballad - Contemporary and Traditional. Some of it is excellent, some not so good. Despina is incredible on the traditional and romantic material, however when she speeds up the tempo for the dance and techno tracks her voice suffers considerably.  If you are going to buy just one Despina CD for your collection I'd look for a copy of her now OOP '10 Entoles.'
