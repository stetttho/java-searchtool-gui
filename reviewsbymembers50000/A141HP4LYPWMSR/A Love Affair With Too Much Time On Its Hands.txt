 Note: Hindi with English subtitles.  Writer/director Ashutosh Gowariker's follow-up film to the brilliant and highly successful 'Lagaan' is an enjoyable but far too long tale of one man's effort to unite a rural Indian community in chaos and show them the path to a better future for everyone is one that can change with the times while still embracing the past.  This is a classic case of going one too many times to the same well of inspiration. Gowariker repeats the basic storyline from 'Lagaan' where we had the courageous Bhuvan (Aamir Khan) breaking through the bonds of old resentments, customs and taboos in his village in an effort to unite his people and defeat the British at their own game, cricket. This time around in 'Swades' it's Mohan (Shakrukh Khan) who is trying to unite a rural village in Northern India to forget about their old prejudices and work together in an effort to provide much needed electricity to the village. Unfortunately repetition doesn't guarantee repeated succcess.  On the positive side, Shahrukh Khan as always proves himself to be not only the top actor in India but an upcoming world star of the future. This is also the first film for Gayatri Joshi who plays Mohan's love interest Gita. She simply lights up the screen with her smile and graceful movements. It isn't an easy task for anyone to play opposite Shahrukh Khan, but somehow she pulls it off masterfully. Their chemistry is wonderful.  In the final analysis it's the length of this feature that does the most damage. It's just sooo long that it simply wears you down, unlike 'Lagaan' which made you forget about time altogether. By the end you really don't care if they marry or not. In the case of 'Swades' shorter would've definitely been better.
