 It's a little embarassing but I admit it. I absolutely loved this movie when it first came out in '65 when I was a lovestruck, impressionable thirteen year old. I had quite a crush on Julie Andrews back then. But as the old adage goes, "The day eventually comes for childish things to be put away." After watching this movie recently on DVD I think this might be one of "those things."  Yes, the scenery is magnificent, the Bavarian/Austrian architecture superb, the music delightful (though overly sachrine) and seeing Julie Andrews so young and beautiful dancing across the Alps brings back wonderful memories and youthful fantasies. But that's good for about thirty minutes and then what? Maybe I've just become jaded as I've grown older, but I now find the blatant overacting and the excessive sentimentality difficult to watch. Whatever the case maybe 'The Sound Of Music' is best remembered as a pleasant memory of my youth and leave it at that.   With that said, I still can't give it less than - 4 Stars - just for old-times sake and those lingering feelings for Julie Andrews. A great movie if you have young children, or if you're really nostalgic about this genre of film. Otherwise look for something more challenging.
