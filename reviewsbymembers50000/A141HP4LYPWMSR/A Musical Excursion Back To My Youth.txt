 The music of Glenn Yarbrough's first solo album 'Time To Move On' brings back pleasant memories from my youth. Whenever I heard that unmistakeable smooth tenor voice coming from behind my sister's closed bedroom door I couldn't help but intrude upon her privicy and go in and listen. Eventually I had to buy a copy of the album so I could listen undisturbed in my room. I couldn't be more pleased when I found out it was finally available on CD!  'Time To Move On' is one of those very rare albums/CD's where everything comes together to absolute perfection. The production values, song selection and Glenn's unique voice and style make for a listening experience truly beyond description.   Somethings are best left in the past. This is not one of them. Glenn's music has withstood the test of time and is still as enjoyable today as it ever was. In my opinion this CD captures Glenn at his peak.
