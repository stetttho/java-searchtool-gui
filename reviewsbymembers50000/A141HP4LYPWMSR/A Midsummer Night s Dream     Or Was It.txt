 I experienced the most beautiful vision a fortnight ago. I perceived eight lovely maidens dancing and singing in an enchanted grove. Prancing and gliding in the light of a full moon, they moved back and forth between the standing stones scattered here and there around a grassy clearing.  At first I surmised they must be wanton maidens from a nearby village, but as I moved closer, working my way through the encroaching brush along a seldom traveled path I discerned them to be more than just pagan women at play. Incredibly beautiful they were with an inner glow about them that made me think them to be Sidhe folk awaiting the arrival of the Fairy Queen. Growing ever more excited, I was just steps away from entering into their magical ring when suddenly the music stopped and the maidens and landscape disappeared into the shadows.  Opening my eyes, I found myself alone reclining on the den couch. The room was still, the time just past the witching hour. I walked over to the stereo cabinet and removed 'Mirabilis' by the Mediaeval Baebes from the CD player and placed it back inside its jewel case. Proceeding down the hallway to the bedroom I thought I heard a fairy voice off in the distance but couldn't be certain. Oh well, maybe tomorrow night.
