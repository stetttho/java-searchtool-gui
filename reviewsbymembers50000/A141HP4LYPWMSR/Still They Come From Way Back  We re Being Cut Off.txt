 Ah......, how could you not miss the fifties with all those sci-fi/horror films about mutant bugs - animals - or - people genetically altered into something monstrous by over exposure or ingestion of radioactive material.  Such is the plot in the '57 low budget bugfest 'Beginning of the End.' An immense swarm of grasshoppers get into an experimental site using radioactive feed to enhance plant growth in order to increase the size of fruits and vegetables. An altrustic scientific project to provide alternative food supplies in the event of any future food shortages. However good intentions don't always produce positive results, as in this case.  You guessed it, the grasshoppers chow down on the plant food and before long begin to grow to the size of a school bus. Fortunately their wings don't develop in keeping with their new body size so they can't fly, but unfortunately with their ever increasing need for food they decide to focus on the nearest human for their next meal.   Imagine tens of thousands of gigantic grasshoppers covering the landscape as the march towards the next population center in search of fast food to go. Pretty scary don't you think? Who can ever forget that impressive battle scene when the U.S. Army take on the thundering herd and get wiped out. I can still hear the field commander on the walkie-talkie discribing the onslaught to General Hanson (Morris Ankrum), "Still they come from way back! We're being cut-off!" Chilling last words which seem to indicate that the 'Beginning of the End' really was upon us.  Great stuff, so push the start button on your DVD player and let the invasion begin! Starring; Peter Graves and Peggy Castle. Also a special thanks to Eilene Janssen, the cute teenager necking in the convertible at the beginning of the film and the unknown actress in the high rise apartment building wrapped in a shower towel. Two of the tastier morsels digested by the evil swarm.
