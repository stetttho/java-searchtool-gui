 Liv Kristine's angelic soprano voice counterbalanced by the gruff, demonic refrains of Raymond Rohonniy work together perfectly in the Theatre of Tragedy -9 track- CD, 'Velvet Darkness They Fear.' Unlike many other Goth bands that rely too heavily on their female vocalist to keep their audience involved, Raymond somehow manages to bring his discordant vocals into an adversarial, yet complimentary relationship with Liv's ethereal incantations. Truly light and shadow have become one.  Dark, Haunting, Unrelenting, Erotic and Beautiful. Everything you could ask for from a Goth/metal band.
