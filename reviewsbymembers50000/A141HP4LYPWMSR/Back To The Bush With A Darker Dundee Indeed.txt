 'Crocodile Dundee II' is one of the very rare movie sequels that is as good, if not better than the original. However in installment two we are given more than just a light, romantic comedy. Mic's new wife Sue has just learned that her ex-husband has been murdered by a South American drug cartel. When a package arrives in the mail from the deceased containing evidence against the killers Sue becomes their next target. Obviously unsafe in the city, Mic and Sue return to the Australian Outback where Mic is most at home and better prepared to protect his wife.  Paul Hogan does a masterful job of retaining all the light-hearted, boyish charm displayed in the original film while at the same time showing us a darker, determined Dundee willing to stand against the evil drug lords threatening his newfound happiness. We can now add the genre of action/adventure to the Crocodile Dundee legacy, the 'Hero from Down-Under!'
