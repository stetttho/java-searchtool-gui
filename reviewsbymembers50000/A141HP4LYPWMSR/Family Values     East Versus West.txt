 'Bollywood Hollywood' is a relatively enjoyable comedy/romance that pokes fun at both East and West cultural differences in a lighted-hearted, unoffensive manner. This Canadian production stars Rahul Khanna as Rahul and the very lovely Lisa Ray (who recently co-starred in the Bollywood murder/mystery 'Kasoor' - Hindi with English subtitles), as his love interest Sue.  Nothing new or original here. Wealthy Indian family living in Hollywood want there son Rahul to wed. He pretends to be engaged to a nice Indian girl in an attempt to get his parents off his back. As expected real emotions soon arise between the two and before long "love is in the air."  Good for at least one viewing. Repeat screenings, I don't think so. If nothing else watching Lisa Ray on-screen is a nice way to while away the time.
