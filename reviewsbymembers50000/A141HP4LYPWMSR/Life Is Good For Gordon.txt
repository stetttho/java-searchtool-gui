 Gordon Lightfoot's 'Summer Side of Life' released in '71 was his seventh album overall and his second under the Reprise label. Continuing his rise in popularity in the U.S. this -11 track- collection contains many memorable tunes, some of the best being; 'Miguel', 'Cotton Jenny' and my personal favorite, "Talking In Your Sleep.'
