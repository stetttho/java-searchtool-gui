 Prepare yourself for an illuminating evening which begins in an upscale New York bar but slowly degenerates into visiting some of the more unseamly locations of the big city. The story revolves around Rodger (Campbell Scott), an egotistic, insecure, overly analytical wordsmith who has just been dumped by his female boss (Isabella Rossellini). His sixteen year old nephew Nick (Jesse Eisenberg) unexpectedly shows up in his office and Roger decides to break the young boy in 'New York Style.' Prepare for a crash course in how to pick up a woman as taught in the sometimes alluring, often times sleazy world of Uncle Roger, the proverbial lounge lizzard.   Dialogue is everything in this film and most of it comes from the incredibly glib and searing tongue of the recently scorned Roger who has yet to learn how to deal with rejection. Roger is the self-proclaimed prophet of the "Gender Wars" and is determined to teach his naive nephew how to cope with the opposite sex. This is as close to a one-man-show as you can get and Campbell Scott pulls it off in amazing fashion.  This is a film that demands your full attention. The dialogue comes fast and furious and you really don't want to miss a thing in this somewhat pessimistic but well contructed production.
