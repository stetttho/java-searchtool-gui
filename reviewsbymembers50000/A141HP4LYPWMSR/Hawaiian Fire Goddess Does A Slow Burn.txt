 Originally released in 1957, 'The Legend of Pele' was recorded at the Henry J. Kaiser aluminum dome on the grounds of the Hawaiian Village Hotel in Honolulu, Hawaii. This early concept album by the Arthur Lyman Group is pure 50's through and through.  Arthur Lyman's attempt to conjure up a sound worthy of expressing the firey and playful nature of the Volcano Goddess makes for a highly original and fascinating project. It begins well and ends quite nicely with very Hawaiian based melodies, however there are some weak spots interspersed throughout the album/CD. Some of the tracks sound more like an evening in a smokey beatnik cafe back on the mainland rather than a night among the gently swaying palm trees of the big island. But I guess that was the prevailing 'big sound' style in the late fifties so it's to be expected. In my opinion Lyman wandered too far from his main theme for this recording and it's this lapse in focus that suggests he didn't quite succeed  in achieving what he had hoped for. Successful or not, it's just a little too 'Old School' for my tastes.  Overall enjoyable listening, but essentially ambient background music perfectly suited for adding a little atmosphere to a summers evening pool party for the older crowd.
