 Note: Vietnamese with English subtitles.  Director Anh Hung Tran's has followed up his academy award nominated masterpiece, 'The Scent Of Green Papaya' and 'Cyclo' with yet another cinematically lush and textured film which relies more on its visual appeal than substance of storyline. Also returning for her third appearance in an Anh Hung Tran film is the exotic and lovely Tran Nu Yen-Khe in the role of Lien, the youngest of three sisters and a brother.   Another gently flowing, beautifully filmed tapestry of color and form weaved seamlessly together in a surreal, sensual tale of Vietnamese siblings, their spouses and families. All seems happy and carefree in the beginning as you view them together planning a ceremonial dinner honoring the birthday of their deceased Mother. They harmoniously interact during both the preparation and celebration of the meal, giving every indication that all is well. However some are secretly harboring personal secrets concerning where they go and what they do when alone. Secrets that exposed would bring turmoil and disruption into their peaceful existence.  Like Anh Hung Tran's previous endeavors you go into the film knowing that it's going to be first and foremost about the visuals. Accepting that premise you will find 'The Vertical Ray of the Sun' a rewarding experience. If however you are more concerned with storyline you should look elsewhere.
