 Definitely an oldie but a goodie. I read the 'The Western Way Omnibus' some twenty or so years ago when it was originally released as two separate books, 'The Western Way: Native Tradition' and 'The Western Way: Hermetic Tradition.' These two volumes served as my initial introduction to Caitlin and John Matthews' work and I found them both to be highy informative, easy to understand and incredibly rich in the understanding of sign and symbol.   However what I found the most helpful is the Matthew's wonderful storehouse of imaginative and potent journeying narratives. I have personally used a number provided within and have found them to be amazingingly successful.  A wonderful read of both traditions, specially if you're into pathworking. I was particularily impressed by the native material in volume 1, but that opinion is based more on personal perference than anything else.
