 Newly arrived Indian immigrant Ramu Gupta (Jimi Mistry) hopes to discover his own piece of the American dream in the urban sprawl of New York. It doesn't take long for Ramu to discover that opportunities are not easy to come. However events take a sudden and hilarious turn for the better when he is embraced by high society as an enlightened sex guru which leads to instant fame and fortune.  Lots of silliness but lots of fun too! Jimi Mistry is absolutely delightful as Ramu. Also wonderful performances by Heather Graham as the the streetwise yet vulnerable porn star Sharonna and Marisa Tomei as the insecure, obsessive socialite Lexi.  The storyline is a bit uneven here and there, but the cast is so endearing and the music so infectious you won't care. If you are uninitiated into the wonderful music and dancing to be found in Indian films 'The Guru' will definitely serve as an enjoyable and insightful introduction into this genre of cinema. Once the music takes you over you'll be hooked for good.  -5 Stars- for the Music and Dancing / -4 Stars- for the Storyline = -4 1/2 Stars- Overall!
