 Esteemed psychiatrist Martin Dysart (Ricard Burton) takes on a case nobody else wants to deal with. Alan Strang (Peter Firth), an eighteen year old working at the local stables blinds four horses with a metal spike in an unpresidented night of unspeakable madness. As Dr. Dysart delves into the causes leading up to the event he soon realizes he is dealing with more than just a confused, emotionally unstable teenager. He has stumbled upon a shocking tale of intense spiritual devotion gone horribly wrong.  As the ongoing therapy with Alan reaches its climax Dr. Dysart finally comes face to face with the young mans' inner passion and divine obsession. An encounter which challenges Dysart to finally look into his own soul and confront his personal demons and loss of passion. As though peering into a mirror darkly it eventually becomes a case of "Physican Heal Thyself."    Truly one of the darkest, most penetrating journeys into a troubled mind you will ever view. Peter Shaffer's masterful screenplay along with director Sidney Lumet performing at the top of his craft have brought to life a harrowing vision not soon to be forgotten.
