 'Psychonavigation' by John Perkins is a thin, but extremely potent book that you will read over and over again. Only 144 pages in length, it's a very quick read, just an hour or two and you're done. However don't confuse brevity in length with lack of depth and content. There is much insight and wisdom within.  Journey with John in his cross cultural travels as he shares tales about the old ways of knowing and how they can be applied in any kind of modern setting, urban or otherwise. His stories and experiences are the real jewel of this book and will leave the reader with an almost transcendental feeling of joy and wonderment about the marvelous and mystical world in which we live!  My Highest Recommendation!!
