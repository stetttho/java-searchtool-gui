 I could say that I bought 'Spice World' for my teenage daughter and that would be quite true. Of course that statement wouldn't account for the additional copy stashed away in my own personal DVD collection. I guess it's time for me to face up to the truth and just say it out loud. Mel B - Mel C - Victoria - Geri & Emma, your movie is hilarious!   Yes, it's predictable, shallow and inane, but it's also adorable, quirky and off-the-wall in a good, Monty Python sort of way. It actually works! Say and think what you will, I LIKE IT!  So no more excuses accepted, get your own copy of 'Spice World' so you can enjoy the Fab Five as they romp about jolly old England in their very 'posh' double decker bus! GIRL POWER!!
