 An epic love story the likes of 'Tristan and Isolde' can only work if the love interests are admirable and likeable. You know, people you can empathize with. Initially you feel sympathy for poor Tristan (James Franco) when he discovers the future wife (Sophie Myles) of his adopted Father and soon-to-be-King (Rufus Sewell) happens to be the woman he loves.  At first noble, Tristan convinces Isolde that they must forsake their feelings for each other for the greater good of their warring tribes and she must unite with the King in marriage in order to achieve peace. Unfortunately his noble sentiments turn out to be only meaningless words as his personality quickly changes to that of a boorish, sulking adolescent. Thinking only of himself and his desire for Isolde they begin a secret love affair clandestanly meeting whenever the Kings back is turned.  Though 'Tristan and Isolde' boasts wonderful production values and a strong cast they simply cannot overcome a strikingly bad performance by James Franco. No matter how good looking he may be, he simply turns out to be a rather self-centered, unlikeable character. Definitely not the timeless, unforgettable love story I'm sure you were hoping for.
