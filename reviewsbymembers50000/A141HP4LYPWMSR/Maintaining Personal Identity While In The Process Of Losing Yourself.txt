 I purchased this CD on a whim, contemporary Christian music is not something I'm usually into. Having said that I'll admit this self-titled CD 'Sarah Masen' is an enjoyable, upbeat, easy listening -10 track- collection not only performed by this young artist, but 9 of the 10 tracks are also composed by Sarah.  Trying to compare Sarah's voice and style with someone you might be more familiar with, I'll describe her as Alanis Morissette without the anger and angst. This was a tough call, I also hear hints of Sheryl Crow and Sarah McLachlan in her vocals.   What I like the most about Sarah is the thoughtfulness and depth she puts into her compositions. Her lyrics are an honest reflection of someone who while pursuing her convictions and beliefs isn't afraid of asking questions and re-evaluating the process along the way. My personal favorite song is -track 3- 'Flames of Truth.'
