 Note: French with English subtitles.  A group of local Montreal actors rewrite the 'Passion Play' with an updated interpretation. Their passionate but unorthodox production stirs controversy within the Catholic Church and the community-at-large. As the pressure mounts, whether to perform or not to perform, the personal lives of the individual cast members begin to take on the persona of the characters in the play.  This transformation is most evident in Daniel (Lothaire Bluteau) who plays the role of Jesus. As the 'Life of Christ' unfolds around and within Daniel he eventually discovers the ultimate meaning of sacrificial love.   What a wonderfully original and inventive film! They just don't get any better than this. Imaginative script, superb acting (Catherine Wilkening in the role of Mireille is stunning), evocative cinematography and ethereal soundtrack (with Lisa Gerrard from Dead Can Dance) all come together to bring this glorious modern day story of Jesus to life.
