 Are you one of the few who remember seeing this movie at a theater in '73 and have anxiously awaited its release on DVD? If you are, pick your three or four favorite scenes and then watch this Geneon (Pioneer) release. Guess what, they're not there. Where did they go, why they've been cut - cut - cut. So much for enjoying a rather obscure and perverse piece of cinematic history.  Positives: 'The Mad Bomber' boasts a suprisingly strong cast for a low budget exploitation film which includes; Chuck Connors, Vince Edwards and Neville Brand. More importantly, it only costs $5.99 so you haven't lost much.
