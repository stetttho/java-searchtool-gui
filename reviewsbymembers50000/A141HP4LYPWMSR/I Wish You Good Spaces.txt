 Released in '76, 'Summertime Dream' was Gordon Lightfoot's last of seven consecutive album/CD's to be release under the Reprise label (he did return to Reprise for one more in '93). And with its release, so ended the second phase of Gordon's legendary career.  Gordon's first five albums constituted phase one when he was the poet laurette and inspiration of his home nation of Canada, but virtually unknown south of the Canadian border. It wasn't until he left United Artists and signed with Reprise that he was finally discovered by the American audience. After six years and seven highly successful albums/CD's their partnership ended and so ended the most prolific phase of his career. There were more albums to come, but none of them ever reached the level of acclaim his previous work had.  In 'Summertime Dream' you are listening to the ultimate poet and musician at the top of his game. This is a decidedly melancholy -10 track- collection, quite possibly more so than any of this other work. Keep a box of kleenex close at hand.
