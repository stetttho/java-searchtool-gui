 This is an  50 minute A & E production, part of their award-winning "Biography" series chronicling the life of Lisa Halaby, the beautiful 27 year old American who married King Hussein of Jordan in the late '70's. It's the romantic true story of the woman who was to become Queen Noor, the "Light of Hussein."  Positives: This is the usual well constructed presentation that A & E is known for. Nothing speculative or fabricated, just the basic facts with lots of reviews with the Halaby family and old school friends.  Negatives: All of the footage of Lisa's childhood and college years are still photos. I would have liked to have seen some film footage, but if none exists there's nothing you can do about that. More importantly, I really would've enjoyed seeing some on camera interviews with members of the royal family other than Queen Noor, particularily at least one or two of her eight step-children.  All in all a worthwhile watch, specially if you're a big Queen Noor fan like I am.
