 Who amongst the forty and older crowd doesn't remember with great fondness the inscrutable face and piercing eyes of Master Kan repeating the statement, "snatch the pebble from my hand" in the weekly prologue to the latest episode of 'Kung Fu', one of the truly great television series of the '70's?  This DVD is the pilot show for what would become one of the most popular television series for '72 to '75 which offered a unique blending of Chinese philosophy and martial arts in an Old American Wild West setting.  Yes, this pilot movie is included in the First Season disc set so this one is basically for someone who liked the original movie but doesn't want to bother with all the ensuing episodes, or the completist who just has to have it all. I fall into the second category.
