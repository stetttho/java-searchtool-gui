 Can an uptight, black high school teacher make a difference teaching dis-illusioned Native American high school students at Three Nations Reservation? He will if he's successful transforming the girls basketball team from perennial doormats/losers to a hard working, fastbreaking team of winners.   A insightful look into modern day life and times on the Reservation courtesy of director Chris Eyre. James McDaniel gives a solid perfomance as Kenny Williams, the new teacher and coach. Irene Bedard is as always beautiful as the previous coach and mentor to coach Williams. Also excellent supporting role by Wes Studi.  While 'Edge of America' doesn't rank up there with other sports films like 'Rudi' or 'Saint Ralph' it's still a heartwarming story and a wonderful way to spend an evening with the family!
