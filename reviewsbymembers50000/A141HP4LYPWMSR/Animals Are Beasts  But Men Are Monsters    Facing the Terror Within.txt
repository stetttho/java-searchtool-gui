 To truly become a man one must conquer his fear of 'Two Worlds,' the temporal, mundane world in which we live and the intangible, eternal spirit world within. Mike Blueberry (Vincent Cassel) or "Broken Nose" (his Indian name) has come to his defining moment in life. An old enemy has returned to town, the man responsible for the death of his first love. Will Mike be able to conquer the enemy from his past as well as his inner demons that have tormented him since that tragic event? Or will he succumb to his fears and remain forever nothing more than a man and a monster?  Recipe for the making of 'Renegade': Take the opening twenty minutes of 'Dead Man,' the greater middle portion of 'The Emerald Forest' and mix in a little '2001: A Space Odyssey' at the end and you have 'Renegade.' Not a bad blend by any means.
