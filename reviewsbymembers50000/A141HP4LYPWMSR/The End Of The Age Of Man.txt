 'Gargoyles' is a made-for-television movie from '72. I fell in love with this film immediately. How could anyone resist, ancient creatures thought to be nothing more than myth and legend are living in an isolated American desert region patiently breeding in the darkness of caves and caverns watching their numbers grow as they await the day to step out into the light of day and wage war against mankind as they did in aeons past. Now that's a storyline I can get into!  Cornel Wilde plays the part of a university professor specializing in demonology who uncovers the gargoyle community with his daughter played by Jennifer Salt (I had a crush on her for awhile).  Good, old-fashioned '70's entertainment that was able to frighten the viewer without having access to all the special effects one has come to expect today.
