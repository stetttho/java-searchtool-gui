 Whether intended or not, 'Dancing In The Dragon's Jaw' is by far the most overtly Christian of all Bruce Cockburn's albums/CD's. While all his earlier works were also deeply spiritual in content, this album with songs like 'Wondering Where The Lions Are', 'Creation Dawn' and 'No Footprints' seemed to exude the Christian message and finally caught the attention of the Protestant community-at-large. Despite his attempt to dis-associate himself from mainstream evangelical Christianity, this album was an overnight hit with young believers and he was immediately embraced as one of the flock. It was probably this unwanted association with Protestantism that accelerated his departure from the mellow folk roots of his early work to pursue a hard-edged, secular rock sound ever since.  Whatever the case, Christian or otherwise, this -11 track re-issue of the CD (containing 2 unnecessary bonus tracks) is without doubt the most upbeat, joyous collection of songs in the immense and eclectic Cockburn collection.  Highly Recommended!
