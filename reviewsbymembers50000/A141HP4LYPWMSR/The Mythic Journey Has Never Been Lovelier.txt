 Remember those ancient Greek myths and legends about beautiful sea sirens with voices so pure and enchanting they could lure unwary seafarers to their doom on the rocks? Well, if those stories were true I guarantee Sasha Lazard would be one of those mythic creatures.  'The Myth of Red' is an ingenious blending of mood and emotion all perfectly complimented by one of the most beautiful voices you'll ever hear. Some tracks are deeply romantic, others darkly spiritual and some medieval or Gothic. All are excellent!  This is a first rate production in every way; song selection, lush musical accompaniment and of course the amazing Sasha. If you're already a fan of Lisa Gerrard or Lorenna McKennit get ready to add Sasha Lazard to your list!
