 I bought Bo Hansson's 'Lord Of The Rings' when it first came out in '72 and it immediately became one of my all-time favorite albums. One of the early concept albums, Bo's inspiration was Tolkein's masterpiece and in my opinion he was tremendously successful in exploring the mood and mysticism, both dark and light, in Tolkein's trilogy.   The compositions were written and recorded in a rented castle located on the Scottish moors. The dark overcast and foggy setting turned out to be the absolutely perfect inspiration for Hanssons' project. The imbending gloom, stark loneliness and isolation in some of his tracks is absolutely unnerving. The entire album/CD is exquiste!  This is really a seminal work which pre-dates both the New Age and Gothic musical genres of today. Yes, I said Goth. Many of Hanssons' tracks are deeply somber, melancholy and incredibly haunting. I like to consider his compositions as the instrumental predecessor of 'Dead Can Dance.' Definitely one of the essentials!
