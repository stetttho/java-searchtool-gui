 Wonderful British made-for-television production of 'The Scarlet Pimpernel,' the 18th century version of Clark Kent/Superman. A glorious production with a great cast: Jane Seymour (who has never looked more ravishingly beautiful and buxom), Anthony Andrews and Ian McKellen (Lord of the Rings).    Sir Percy Blakeney (Anthony Andrews), stars as the Scarlet Pimpernal, a British nobleman masquerading in revolutionary France as a harmless British fop as he secretly works at rescuing unjustly imprisoned French aristocracy from beheading.  Production values are second to none and as most British production go, the acting is superb. If you love period pieces, or hobnobing with the rich and famous you'll love it!
