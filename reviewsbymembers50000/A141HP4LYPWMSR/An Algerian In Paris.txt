 Algerian born Souad Massi continues with another strong performance in her third CD 'Honeysuckle/Mesk Elil.' Her voice doesn't appear to be as strong, or her range as vast as some of the other more well known female voices in the genre of Middle East/World Music, it is none-the-less an immensely enjoyable exotic sound incorporating all the traditional vocal nuances that one would hope for.  While the upbeat, festive tracks like 'Inspiration' and 'I Won't Forget My Roots' are a nice change of pace, I think the poetic, melancholy love songs like 'Honeysuckle', 'There's Worse' and my personal favorite 'Why Is My Heart Sad' are Souads' real musical strength.
