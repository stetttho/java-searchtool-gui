 Baba Ram Dass was one of the major spiritual influences in my life during the early '70's. I discovered his books and tapes just about the time I decided to change my college major from Anthropology to Religious Studies. It's books like: 'Be Here Now', 'The Only Dance There Is' and more recently 'Still Here' that continue to break through my rigidity of thought and open my mind and heart to new vistas of understanding and acceptance.  I had the priviledge of meeting Ram Dass back in '76 after a talk he gave at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, CA. During that brief moment in his presence I experienced an unmistakable flow of energy emanating from this ex-Harvard professor, turned subversive LSD user, turned Hindi guru and devotee of Hanuman, the Monkey-God. I felt totally alive, empowered and so bursting with emotion that I didn't get a wink of sleep that night.  Through the years I've met, or stood in the presence of numerous famous spiritual figures from a wide variety of faiths and traditions and I can honestly say that I've never experienced anything comparable to what enveloped me that night in '76 as I looked into the smiling, grandfatherly face of Ram Dass.  Seeing Ram Dass old, infirmed and confined to a wheelchair since his stroke in '97 takes a little getting used to, but once you gaze deeply into those mischevous eyes and see that knowing smile you realize he hasn't changed a bit. At least not concerning the things that really matter. 'Fierce Grace' is a magnificent visual document presenting one mans' commitment to love, endurance and living life "in the moment." His teachings and attitude have remained as clear and consistent today as they were thirty-five years ago; humorous, insightful, deeply personal and above all compassionate.
