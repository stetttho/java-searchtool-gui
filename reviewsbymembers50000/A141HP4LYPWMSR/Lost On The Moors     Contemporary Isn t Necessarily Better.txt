 I hate to say it but Maire Brennan's 'Whisper to the Wild Water' is the least favorite CD to be found amongst my Clannad, Enya, Maire collection. Yes her voice is beautiful as always but it seems somewhat lost and out of place in the techno-pop music that dominates this -13 track- CD. Those tracks that do manage to stay away from the contemporary beat fair a little better but still not up to past performances and material.  If you want just one or maybe two Maire CD's in your collection this is not the one to get.
