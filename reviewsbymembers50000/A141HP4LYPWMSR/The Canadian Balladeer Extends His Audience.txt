 'If You Could Read My Mind' marked a time of change in Gordon Lightfoot's musical career. After five albums with United Artists Lightfoot made a switch to another label. This album, his sixth overall, was his first recording with  Reprise and it contained the hit 'If You Could Read My Mind' which was one of his first songs to receive serious radio play in the U.S.A. His big breakthrough was still four years away when 'Sundown' would be released, but this was never-the-less the beginning of his efforts to gain the attention of the larger American audience south of the Canadian border.  Comprised of -11 tracks- of now classic Lightfoot tunes, this is essential Lightfoot. Heck, what am I talking about? They're all essential Lightfoot!
