 Epica is definitely the right name for this Dutch goth/metal group. There sound is truly epic. Darkly spiritual, classical and symphonic, you feel yourself drawn into a multi-layered Netherworld populated with saints and sinners, ghosts and spirits, demons and angels, God and the Devil.  Like the literary figures of Dante and his beloved Beatrice, Mark Jansen and the exceedingly lovely Simone Simons serve as guides through the various intangible worlds of Heaven, Hell and the realms in-between created by the talented singer, songwriter and guitarist Jansen. When they decided to title this DVD 'We Will Take You With Us' they really meant it.  I'm unable to comment on the lyrics since they aren't singing in English, nor is an insert included to provide a translation. Be that as it may, the music is AWESOME!
