 Create a dark, foreboding urban wasteland, shroud it in an ambience of depression and hopelessness and then add a cutting edge rock/goth soundtrack and what do you get? Answer, a cult classic that has captured the angst of a generation and given us the quintessencial anti-hero of the twentieth century. Not bad for a small budget movie with a cast of unknowns.   Eric Draven (Brandon Lee) and his fiancee Shelly (Sophia Shinas) are brutally murdered on the night before Halloween, the Devil's Night. However their love for each other proves to be so strong that even death cannot prevent Eric from seeking revenge against the four men responsible for the homicides. With the help of an animal familiar, the crow, he digs his way out of the grave a year later and returns to the scene of the crime. As another Halloween approaches the Devil's Night is about to take on a whole new meaning.   'The Crow' is without a doubt the ultimate gothic/romance movie of all-time and quite likely the most revered film adaptation of a comic book hero. This is an amazing work of cinematography coupled with a deeply touching story. Despite the high degree of death and brutality in this film it's first and foremost a love story. Now eleven years since its release we can see in retrospect the profound effect this '94 movie has had in influencing the Goth Movement so prevalent today. A true classic to be enjoyed over and over again!  Cast: Brandon Lee (Eric Draven), Sophia Shinas (Shelly),  Rochelle Davis (Sarah), Ernie Hudson (Sergeant Albrecht), Michael Wincott (Top Dollar) and Ling Bai (Myca).
