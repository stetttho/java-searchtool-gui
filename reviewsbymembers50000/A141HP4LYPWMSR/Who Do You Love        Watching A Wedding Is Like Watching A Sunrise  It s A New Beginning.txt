 'Cowboys and Angels' is a sweet, tender love story about one man's search for the girl of his dreams. Danny (Adam Trese) has been left standing at the altar and begins to doubt if true love really exists. Unexpectedly two attractive women soon come into his life (Mia Kirshner and Radha Mitchell) and before long he must decide which woman is the one fated to become his wife. What he doesn't realize is that angelic forces are present and subtlely guiding him to make the right decision.   I love this movie! Mia Kirshner is absolutely gorgeous as Candice, she is fast becoming one of my favorite actresses. This is a film that can be enjoyed by everyone, old and young, so watch it with your entire family.  Warning to Cowboy Movie Fans: If you're thinking of renting or buying this movie based solely on the presence of the word "cowboy" in the title, don't. It really has nothing whatsoever to do with being a cowboy. One of Danny's love interests happens to live and work on a ranch and you see a couple people ocassionally wearing cowboy hats, but that is the extent of it.
