 The time is the early 1950's, the place a small provincial Irish Catholic community in Eastern Canada. The story revolves around an intense, energetic young boy named Ralph (Adam Butcher). Things are not going well for the fourteen year old, his Father has died, apparently while serving in the military during WWII and his Mother is in the hospital fighting for her life from an unspecified illness. Things couldn't be any worse unless you add to that the fact that he has just started his freshman year in high school at Saint Magnus Parochial School.  When his Mother falls into a coma Ralph comes to the conclusion that the only way to awaken her is to perform a miracle. Recently assigned to the school cross country team by the school principal as punishment for smoking on campus, his choice of miracles takes on the form of a race. The Boston Marathon.   Can a fourteen year old with no running experience win the Boston Marathon? He does have 180 training days before the big race and the help of Father Hibbert (Campbell Scott) the cross country coach and ex-olympic marathon runner. Who knows, "amazing things happen under a full moon."  Delightful film! Adam Butcher is absolutely perfect as Ralph as is Campbell Scott (one of my favorite actors) as Father Hibbert, the dis-illusioned priest who rediscovers his faith and himself while observing the young boys determination to succeed and create his own miracle.  My Highest Recommendation!
