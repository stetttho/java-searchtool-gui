 'The Magnificent Seven' was, is and will always be the standard by which all other Westerns are judged. Every word, every gesture, every camera angle has been orchestrated to achieve the maximum cinematic experience. Speaking of orchestration, thanks to the musical genius of Elmer Bernstein it also possesses one of the best motion picture soundtracks ever!     So many classic lines: "I'm trying to show him how little religion some people now have." "That I can see for myself." "You elected?' "No, but I got nominated pretty good." "It's not getting there that bothers me. Staying there is what I mind." "I've been offered alot for my work, but never everything." "The graveyards are full of boys who were very young and very proud." "He's a good gun and we aren't heading for a church social." "Come on now lets see how fast you are and no games, no clapping hands, none of that stuff. Just draw." "Once there was a time when I would've caught all three." "Nobody throws me my own guns and tells me to run. Nobody." "Go ahead Lee, you don't owe anything to anybody." "Accept to myself." "What's my name?" "Bernardo!" "Bernardo!" "Damn right."  Buy It! - Watch It! - Enjoy It!
