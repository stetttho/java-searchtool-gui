 At last I can watch the extended Alan Smithee version of Dune on DVD! No bootleg, no poorly transferred vhs tape recorded off the television, but an authentic, authorized all region DVD. I almost passed on this import from Brazil since the American region 1 release was scheduled to come out last month. However when it was delayed due to possible legal intervention from David Lynch I decided to just go ahead and get it. I can honestly say that I'm glad I did.  For those of you who are leery of buying imports, don't be. This one is definitely a quality item. I just wish it was widescreen instead of full screen, but I doubt that the region 1 version will be any different if, or when it's ever released.
