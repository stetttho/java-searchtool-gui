 Travel with filmmaker Nadeem Uddin to Mother India on his journey to Allahabad located at the confluence of two sacred rivers, the Ganges and Jamuna. You are on a spiritual pilgrimage to the final mela in a series of festivals that occurs only once every 144 years. Walk amongst the estimated 70 million pilgrims in the sweltering heat as they descend upon their appointed destination.  Open your mind and heart and take a deep breath before you dare enter into a realm of the spirit quite foreign to Occidental sensibilities. It's here amidst the noise and smoke, the pungent fragrances and endless chanting that the visual and olfactory assault will soon begin. Nude ascetics will surround you on all sides and strange, exotic smells will confront your nostrils. In some quarters of the festival bizarre and disturbing exhibitions of self-mutilation will be exhibited while a female avatar dances with cobras and a prospective guru is buried underground for three days in a state of samadi as an offering for universal harmony. Situations very unnerving for the uninitiated traveler.  Congratulations you have arrived at the largest gathering of humanity in the history of the world! It's the 2001 'Maha Kumbh Mela' let the purification begin!  This is an amazing and beautiful spiritual documentary and an essential addition to the DVD library of anyone fascinated by the diverse and sometimes unfathomable nature of faith in all its various modes of expression. Definitely not for the closed minded.
