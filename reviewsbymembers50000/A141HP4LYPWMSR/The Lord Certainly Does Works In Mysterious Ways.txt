 A mysterious, unarmed stranger known only as "Preacher" (Clint Eastwood) rides into town on a pale horse and immediately rekindles the hopes and dreams of a group of poor, struggling panhandlers that have been fighting a losing battle against a wealthy strip mining family and their hired guns. While the odds suggest the stranger should give up and get out while he still can he decides otherwise. Once he removes his collar and straps on his sixshooter there's no turning back. A classic western, good guys versus bad guys all the way!   Let me begin by saying I'm not a Clint Eastwood fan. However with that said, I also have to say that this particular movie is the rare exception to the rule. Here Eastwood is at his best; tall, silent, deadly and remote. He plays the part of the anti-hero to perfection.  Also fine performances by Michael Moriarty, Carrie Snodgress, Richard Dysart, Chris Penn and my personal favorite, the lovely Sydney Penny (Thorn Birds).
