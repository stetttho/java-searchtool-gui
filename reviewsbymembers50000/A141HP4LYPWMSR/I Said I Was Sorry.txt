 Nothing deep or challenging here, just a fun good guy, bad guy martial arts film with plenty of action and enough humor to balance the violence and bad language.  Fans of the '70's television series 'Kung Fu' will recognize the plot immediately. Female assassin and martial arts expert Jing (Chung Lai) known as "the Ghost" flees China to America in an attempt to escape a corrupt law enforcement officer demanding her execution. Her whereabouts are soon discovered and she is pursued to America. Soon violence erupts in the streets of Chinatown in Los Angeles. Will her reputation as the top assassin of the Tong clan be enough to defeat both the Chinese police and American law enforcement and bounty hunters. YOU BET!
