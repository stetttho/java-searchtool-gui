 The ultimate movie experience of my adolescence was 'Jason And The Argonauts.' I remember quite vividly the first time I saw it at the theatre in '63 at the age of eleven. It was at the long defunct Roxy Theatre in Whittier, CA in the old days when you paid to see a double feature. 'Jason' was the main feature, who remembers the other movie. I do remember that my friend Gary and I wanted to see it again so I called my Dad to see if he would let us stay for the midnight viewing and pick us up when it was over. He agreed and we got to see it twice that night. It has been a favorite all these years.  Believe it or not the magic of Ray Harryhausen's stop-action special effects still holds up quite well after all these years and the storyline and acting was suprisingly good for a film of this genre which usually was concerned primarily with visuals and weak on dialogue. To this day my favorite sequences are those showing the Gods resting comfortably in Olympus viewing the affairs of man from a remote, aloof distance. If you bother to listen to their conversations you might be surprised to discover an amazing amount of depth in this mythological action/adventure film.  Note: Unfortunately this DVD has been released only in a full screen version. This is not the way it was meant to be viewed, but for now we must endure with what has been made available.
