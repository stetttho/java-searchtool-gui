 Vangelis' soundtrack to Koreyoshi Kurahara's seldom seen and all but forgotten '84 film 'Antarctica' is one of the true undiscovered classics of the last twenty years. Possibly second only to his highly acclaimed 'Chariots of Fire' masterpiece, 'Antarctica eludes to a less emotional, more remote musical experience.  Vangelis' ethereal soundtrack masterfully transports the listener to a barren, yet exquistely beautiful soundscape that superbly captures the sense of isolation and loneliness of this vast, frozen continent. The pieces are haunting, mystical, yet surprisingly peaceful instead of disquieting. Without a doubt this is one of my all-time favorite CD's.
