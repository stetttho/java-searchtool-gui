 John Warwick Montgomery's 'Principalities and Powers' was released by Bethany Fellowship in '73 in a hardcover edition. Now some 33 years later it remains the best treatise on the subjects of demonology and the occult from the Christian perspective.  This is not the usual treatment on occultism we have all come to expect from evangelical circles. Mr. Montgomery doesn't see a demon around every corner waiting to attack their next unsuspecting victim. He is one of the true scholars of the Christian faith and his examination of the subject matter displays the great depth, insight and clarity he's famous for.  Johns' open-minded treatment of occult taboos is surprisingly daring, particularly for '73. There's no broad brushing the subject matter as demonic and unfit for exploration. Everything is not black or white, he acknowledges the existence of gray areas and gradations of danger. Surprising Mr. Montgomery appears quite fond of the Tarot and has a personal collection of antique decks. Wonders never cease.  Needless to say this was not a popular book with the Christian mainstream, which is probably why it has been OOP and unavailable for quite some time.  'Principalities and Powers' is truly a refreshing and scholarly read by one the greatest Christian thinkers of the 20th century. My Highest Recommendation!!
