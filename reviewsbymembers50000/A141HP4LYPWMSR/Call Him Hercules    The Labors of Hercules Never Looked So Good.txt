 Be forewarned, I'm a big fan of 'Hercules, The Legendary Journeys' and 'Xena, Warrior Queen' so anything new on this mythical hero automatically starts off with the expectation of being a - 5 Stars - production.  This Hallmark Entertainment made-for-television production presents a much darker and somber tale of the "Son of Zeus" than what the fans of Kevin Sorbo have grown familiar with. Hated by his Mother Alcmene (Elizabeth Perkins), High Priestess to Hera and twin brother Iphicles they both unsuccessfully plot to kill Hercules (Paul Telfer). They even enlist the aide of his new wife Megara and his three young sons. When their plan fails and results in the deaths of the three children Hercules is blamed and is banished from the Kingdom. In an attempt to redeem himself he agrees to be tested by his betrayers and undertakes a series of all but impossible tasks, or "Labors." That is, almost impossible for anyone but Hercules!      Hallmark has certainly not given us the definitive version of the God/man but it is a good one. It has better than average special effects, a competent storyline and a strong cast of character: Timothy Dalton, Elizabeth Perkins, Sean Astin, the lovely LeeLee Sobeiski and Paul Telfer as Hercules.  *Special message from my seventeen year old daughter for all the young girls out there:  "Check out Paul Telfer, HOTTTTTT......!"
