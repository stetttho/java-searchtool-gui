 This five male, one female band from Slovenia fails to find an audience in their debut album. 'Out Loud' contains - 13 tracks -each piece almost indistinguishable from the next. The only way to tell that one song has ended and the second is about to begin is by the momentary pause between tracks. A little variation in song selection is recommended, nobody can survive in music long with a one dimensional sound.  Positives; Barbara Jedovnicky has a strong voice that's somewhat similar to Amy Lee of Evanescene. She should be allowed to explore her vocal range more fully in their next album/CD, if there is one.
