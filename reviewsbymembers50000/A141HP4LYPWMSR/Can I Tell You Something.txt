 'Private Parts' is a surprisingly enjoyable film based on the life and career of radio talk show host and innovator Howard Stern. It's everything you'd expect it to be; overtly sexual, irreverant, crude and definitely not for children. It is also quite funny and insightful showing that Howard can laugh at himself and wonder in disbelief at his meteoric rise to fame on the American airwaves. This film was particularily surprising to me since I've never been one of his fans.  Definitely not for everyone, but remarkably good especially considering the subject matter.
