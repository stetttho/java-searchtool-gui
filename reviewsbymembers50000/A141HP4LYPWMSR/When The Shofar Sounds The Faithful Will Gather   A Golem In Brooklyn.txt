 The year is 1947, the place an Irish Catholic neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York. Eleven year old Michael (Peter Tambakis) finds himself caught in a freak snowstorm one August afternoon and steps into a nearby doorway to warm up. Once inside he encounters a bearded man name Judah (Stephen Rea), a lonely, disillusioned rabbi recently arrived from Czechoslovakia.  They become friends and before long Judah is sharing his Jewish faith with the young boy along with wonderous tales of kabbalistic folklore and mysticism. However Michael soon discovers that some people in the neighborhood don't approve of his new acquaintance, or others of the Jewish faith for that matter. For the first time in his short life Michael is exposed to anti-semitic behavior by a group of local teenagers. When the rabbi is badly beaten up by one of the bullies Michael looks for a way to stop the violence.  He asks the rabbi if the stories he has been telling him are true, or at least one in particular. A medieval tale about a Golem, an artifical creation made of clay fashioned in human form. A creature of immense strength that according to legend could be brought to life through a prescribed set of Hebrew prayers and rituals. It would be a 'Warrior of God' that could stand against the neighborhood bullies. He asks Judah if it's possible. Responding with a hesitant maybe, Michael is off to attempt the unimaginable.  "Snow in August" was made on a small budget for television and it shows in the production values. However if you stay with it you'll discover that the story is really quite good and its message of tolerance and understanding is one we should never get tired of hearing.
