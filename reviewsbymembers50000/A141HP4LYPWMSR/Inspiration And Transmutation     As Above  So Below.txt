 Joscelyn Godwin's 'Harmonies Of Heaven And Earth' released in '87 by publishers Thames and Hudson Ltd is the perfect companion volume to his earlier sourcebook, 'Music, Mysticism and Magic.' While the previous work was basically a compilation of testimonies concerning the mystical nature of music and sound by many of histories greatest thinkers, this volume deals directly with the spiritual power of music and how those heavenly harmonies are transmuted from above into the physical creation below.  Godwin divides the book into three sections: 1 - Ascending Parnassus 2 - The Great Work 3 - The Music of the Spheres  Some of my personal favorite topics of discussion are; - Musics effect on matter - Metaphysical accounts pertaining to higher worlds - Music and the currents of time  I enjoyed the first two sections immensely, however I must admit that the last section (The Music of the Spheres) was for the most part beyond my capacity to comprehend. This is where higher mathematics and advanced levels of musical theory come into play which is unfortunately not among my strengths. This section is definitely for the true scholar. Be that as it may, I can't subtract a star for something simply because I'm unable to understand it.  Are you ready for a challenging but rewarding read? Here it is!
