 OK I can be honest, I admit it. I bought this CD for the cover. If I happened to like the music that was just going to be the frosting on the cake.  Even before opening the jewel case I knew this wasn't going to be authentic Tahitian music. It says right on the cover, "Favorite instrumentals on Guitar & Piano." Tahitian piano music? What is that? I was surprised upon playing the CD to discover how slow the music is on this 22 track collection. I expected fast pulsating rhythms from the Islands, not ultra mellow melodies like you'd hear at a downscale Lounge celebrating 'Polynesian Friday's.'  Definitely for the over 70's Geritol crowd. Oh well, like I said. I bought it for the cover so no regrets.
