 Who built the Pyramid of Giza, Stonghenge and many of the other amazing structures from the ancient past scattered around the globe? Were they the same beings that constructed the "face" on the planet Mars?  Internationally known evangelical Christian and teacher Chuck Missler examines these questions and many more in an in-depth survey of one of the most provocative and intriquing subjects found within the pages of the Bible. And what is the topic you ask? Why it's UFO's and their occupants and how they relate to Biblical prophecy, the realm of fallen angels and demons.  This presentation is done as a simulated classroom lecture so there's really not alot of visuals to keep you interested. However the subject matter is absolutely fascinating so if you're ready to listen and learn sit down and let the instruction begin.   Open your mind to the possibility that something extraordinary is happening in the world today and UFO's and their occupants are part of a millenia old program of dramatic spiritual proportions. If you like conspiracy theories get ready to explore the greatest conspiracy of all!  -3 STARS- for the sparse production values / -5 STARS- for the informative material and Chuck Missler's erudite presentation  =  -4 STARS-  Note: Chuck Missler's lecture is also available in a two audio cassette pack with the same title, and in expanded book format titled, 'Alien Encounters.'
