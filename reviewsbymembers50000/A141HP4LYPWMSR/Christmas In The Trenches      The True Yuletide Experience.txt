 'Winter Solstice' as performed on the hammer dulcimer by John McCutcheon is one of those very rare gems that nobody has ever heard of. But Ohh........, when they do!!  On this marvelous CD we have -11 tracks- of the most beautiful, moving holiday music and songs you'll ever have the privilege of listening to. Eight of the eleven tracks are instrumental ranging from spiritual and meditative, to classic Renaissance, to old fashioned foot stomping Celtic fun. Only three tracks are accompanied by vocals. They are tracks; 5- 'Star In The East', 10- 'Detroit, December' and the magnificent track 4- 'Christmas In The Trenches.'    'Christmas In The Trenches' is one of the most touching, beautiful and totally unique Christmas songs you'll ever hear. Based on a true story, it won't leave a dry eye in the room. The CD is worth the price just for this one track.  The One Absolute Essential for the Yuletide Season!!  My Absolute Highest Recommendation!
