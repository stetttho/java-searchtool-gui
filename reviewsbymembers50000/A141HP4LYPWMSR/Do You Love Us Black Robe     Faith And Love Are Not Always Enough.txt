 Set in New France, Quebec in the year 1634, director Bruce Beresford delivers a powerful and cinematically gorgeous film dealing with the cultural devastation wrought upon an indigenous culture by well meaning but somewhat naive and narrow-minded Jesuit missionaries evangelizing the Canadian Northwest.  The story centers around a young Jesuit missionary, Father Laforgue (Lothaire Blutheau), who is sent on an ardous 1,500 mile journey into Huron territory to aid in the task of converting the Huron people to Christ and his Church. Escorted by a small group of Algonquin Indians and a young Frenchman named Daniel (Aden Young), a long and dangerous path lie ahead.    The cultural differences between Laforgue and the Algonquins' are pronounced and animosity towards the Priest is almost immediate. They begin to question his "strange ways" and his dark attire and wonder whether he is a demon sent to destroy them. Instead of addressing him as Father they refer to him as "Black Robe."   Along the way Father Laforgue slowly and begrudgingly begins to understand and appreciate the Indians as people and not just potential converts, but cannot reconcile their spiritual beliefs with his own. His inner doubt and turmoil are in stark contrast with the natural beauty of the land and the communal, harmonious spirit displayed by the Algonquin's accompanying him.    Father Laforgue may survive the dangers and hardships of the wilderness, but will his Christian faith survive the challenge of cultural diversity and the honest and open nature of those he hopes to save? The people who ask him the all important question, "Do you love us Black Robe?"  Joining Lothaire Blutheau is a wonderful cast which includes: Aden Young (Daniel), August Schellenberg (Chomina) and the incredibly beautiful Sandrine Holt (Annuka). The film also contains an enchanting soundtrack by the late composer George Delerue.
