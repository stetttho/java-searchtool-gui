 'Hawaii's Instrumental Favorites' is a somewhat enjoyable -11 track- collection of Hawaiian or Hawaii related melodies. This is pretty much nothing more than ambient faire for those slow, sweltering summer evenings around the pool with family and friends.   Personal favorites: track 8- 'I Am Hawaii' (from Elmer Bernstein's '66 film soundtrack of 'Hawaii') and track 11- 'Hawaiian Love Song.'
