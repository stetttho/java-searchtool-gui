 'Shirey Moledet' is my favorite CD by my all-time favorite female singer, Ofra Haza. I don't speak or understand Hebrew, but you don't have to in order to love this music. This exceptional collection of -21 tracks- expresses the heart and soul of the Jewish experience as only the voice of Ofra Haza could. All the regrets, longings, hopes and dreams of a nation are encapsulated within this wonderful CD. 'Shirey Moledet' is one of the 'ESSENTIALS.' The fact that this CD is now OOP is unbelievable. Get it used while you can, it's getting harder and harder to find!  ~ RIP OFRA ~
