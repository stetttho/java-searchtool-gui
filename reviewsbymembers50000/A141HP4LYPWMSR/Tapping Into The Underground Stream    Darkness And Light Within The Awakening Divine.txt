 An alternate title for this film could've been, 'Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About The Occult But Was Afraid To Ask.'  All joking aside, the real strength of this film is found in director Stuart Urban's admirable effort to incorporate over 2,000 years of esoteric and occult teachings into one unified plot. So much information in one film; early pagan practices, primal male/female energy systems, ley lines forming a transcontinental power grid connecting sacred sites, the role of Mary Magdalene and the grail in Christian esotericism, alchemical symbology and magical formulations, astrological calculations and the planet Venus, secret societies (the Knights Templar), reincarnation and a myriad of other occultic associations coalesce into the image of a small ornately decorated box known as the Loculus. Combine all this with modern day scientific DNA discoveries and you have the basic storyline of 'Revelation.'  Another real plus in this production is the on-location shooting at such wonderful sacred sites as the Rennes-le-Chateau in France and the island of Malta in the Mediterranean. The imagery found in the paintings, sculpture and mosaics in these very early Christian churches will serve as a rather rude awakening to those in Western Christianity who are unaware of how deep and inseparable the connections were between first and second century Christianity, the old ways of paganism and the underground stream of occultism.  Fine performances by James D'Arcy and Natasha Wightman as Jake and Mira (SPOILER: or should I say Jesus and Mary Magdalene). Also featuring Udo Kier as the Grand Master and Terence Stamp as Magnus Martel. The 'Revelation' serves as a good companion piece and prerequisite for those planning to see 'The Da Vinci Code.'
