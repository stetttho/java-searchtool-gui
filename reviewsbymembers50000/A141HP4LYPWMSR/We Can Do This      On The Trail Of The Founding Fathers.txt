 Lots of action, romance and laughs in this wonderous adventure as Ben Gates (Nicolas Cage) tries to locate a legendary treasure dating back to the sacking of the fabled Library of Alexandria in ancient Egypt. Handed down through the centuries via the Knights Templar, the Illuminati and the Masons, it reportedly was last in the possession of America's founding fathers' who were also high ranking Masons. Now hidden away for over two hundred years few still believe in its existence.  Ben Gates is an expert on the topic of the long lost treasure, as is his Father and Grandfather before him. Aided by fellow adventurer Riley (Justin Bartha), the stunning Abigail (Diane Kruger) and his Father (Jon Voight) they must find the secret hiding place before the unscrupulous millionaire Ian Howe (Sean Bean) does.  The storyline is filled with unexpected twists and turns and the cast is excellent. 'National Treasure' is recommended viewing, particularly for those fascinated by the topic of secret societies and conspiracies.
