 Released in '89 under the Sparrow Records label, 'More To This Life' was the third album/CD by Christian songwriter/singer Steven Curtis Chapman. Containing -11 tracks- of not only enjoyable, uplifting music and lyrics, but also conveying a level of depth and introspection that set this collection of songs above most of the other contemporary Christian music being released at the time.   'More To This Life' was not formula-matic and predictable and it fully displayed Steven's ability to touch on so many different concerns in life and present the gospel message in an intelligent, unoffensive manner. I think the biggest praise I could give this CD is that you don't have to be a Christian to enjoy it. After all, isn't that the true intent of Christian music? You can't convert anyone if you can't get them to listen.
