 I purchased this CD in a little Scandanavian import shop several years ago. I was just walking around browsing, not looking for anything in particular until I became fascinated by the sound of an incredibly beautiful female voice coming through the speakers of the store sound system, I went to the counter and asked, "Who is that?" That was my introduction to Sissel Kyrkjebo, the beautiful Norwegian singer whos' amazing voice is one of the best keep secrets in Europe.  'Innerst I Sjelen' contains -12 tracks- all sung in Norwegian, so I don't know what she's saying. But, with a voice this delightful who cares.
