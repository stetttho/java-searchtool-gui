 And what you might ask does a 53 year old, white male from Orange County, CA. know about bellydancing? Good question. The right answer is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING, which is exactly why I'm immensely qualified to review this DVD. This is a introduction to the world of bellydancing so you don't have to have any background or experience in the subject.  If you're looking for an evenings entertainment hoping to see beautiful women dancing gracefully and seductively in exotic customs this is not the DVD for you. If however you have wondered about the art of bellydancing and would like to learn more about it, maybe even participate in this activity then you've come to the right place.  Fine overall presentation and approach and Rachel Brice is quite lovely. I particularily like the incorporation of yoga isolations into the regiment of bellydancing preparation. Dance is afterall first and foremost a form of spiritual expression.
