 A delightful field guide for the would-be spirit chaser in training. While this is primarily a reference book, it goes beyond most books of this genre by giving the reader more than just a brief dictionary type description of the creature being discussed.  Each entry begins with a 'Introduction/Description' of what we're dealing with followed by a 'Lore' section containing encounter stories and ends with the all important 'Disarming & Dispelling Techniques.' The organizational skills of the authors are excellent and highly original. I appreciate the manner in which they divided these "Subversive Spirits" into different geographical locations and climatic conditions (Water - Mountain - Forest - Desert) and distinquishes between inner and outer realities (domicile - psyche).  All in all a highly enjoyable and informative read.
