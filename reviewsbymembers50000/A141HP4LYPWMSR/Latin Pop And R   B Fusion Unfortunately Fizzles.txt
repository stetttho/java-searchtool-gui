 Ana Cristina's debut album/CD is a tale of a good voice in search of a style. Displaying a little too much Christina Aguilera and Mariah Carey influences, she fails to impress. Her performance on the slower ballad material is much stronger and consistent than the more up tempo songs.  Overall enjoyable, but nothing spectacular to lift her above the mass of other female voices on the music scene. I would however advise you to keep an eye on her, when she finds her particular groove she will be fantastic!
