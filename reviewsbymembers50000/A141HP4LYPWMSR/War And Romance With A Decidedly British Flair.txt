 Installment #4 in a series of 14 entertaining and historically accurate episodes made for British television based on the wartime exploits of Major Richard Sharpe (Sean Bean) during the Napoleonic Wars. This is a great series, especially if you're into military history. Afterall how many films can you name that are based on the Napoleonic Wars? Me neither.  This is my favorite episode which is probably due to the fact that this particular installment features the very lovely Elizabeth Hurley as Lady Farthingdale, one of two women who have been kidnapped and held for ransom by a group of British deserters. The leader of this rebel band is Obadiah Hakeswell (Pete Postlethwaite), sworn enemy of Major Sharpe.  Great fun and adventure whether you're a history buff or not. See them all!
