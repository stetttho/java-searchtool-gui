 Note: French with English subtitles.  Outstanding period piece exhibiting French filmmaking at it's very best! Based on the historical 'Massacre of Saint Bartholomew' in Medieval France on August 24, 1572, director Patrice Chereau provides to the viewer a visual feast examining the darkside of European aristocracy and their constant quest for power and wealth.  As the splendor and pageantry of the French court commences it only thinly masks the greed and avarice quickly taking control within the castle walls. Love and lust, treachery and murder, hatred and revenge are the order of the day as constantly shifting alliances are made and broken. However the intrique within the halls of power are but a microcosm of the terror and violence erupting on the streets of France between the Catholic and Protestant citizenry. It's a time of radical change and only the brave and the clever will survive.  Warning; this is a very violent film. There is an immense amount of death and brutality and the camera doesn't hold back on the visuals.  Outstanding cast featuring; Isabelle Adjani as the stunningly beautiful Margot de Valois, Daniel Auteuil (one of Frances' finest) as King Henri de Navarre, Jean-Hugues Anglade as Charles IX, Vincent Perez as La Mole, Pascal Greggory (who is absolutely amazing) as the evil Anjou, Virni Lisi as Catherine de Medicis and Asia Argento as Charlotte of Sauve.
