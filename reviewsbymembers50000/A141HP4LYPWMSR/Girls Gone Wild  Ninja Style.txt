 A total guy flick that delivers! Charlene (Maggie Q) and Katt (Anya) are kidnapped at an early age and trained as assassins. They survive all the training and ordeals which includes killing the other potential female assassins and swear to be loyal to each other no matter what the future brings.  When the girls are ordered to murder Charlene's Mother by their leader Madame M (Almen Wong) the girls must decide where their true loyalites lie.  Warning: Extreme violence and some nudity. Definitely not a family friendly film. For guys only.
