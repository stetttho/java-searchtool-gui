 Do you believe in reincarnation? This is the question that must ultimately be answered by a young American family when a group of crimson robed Tibetan monks unexpectedly appear on the front porch of their upper-class Seattle residence. Dean and Lisa Conrad (Chris Isaak and Bridget Fonda), the parents of a bright, inquistive boy named Jesse (Alex Wiesendanger) are faced with the possibility that their son may be the reincarnated soul of a revered Tibetan Lama. At least that's what they've been told by this group of monks recently relocated to downtown Seattle.  Just before leaving Lama Norbu (Ying Ruocheng) presents Jesse with a gift, a book on the life of Siddhartha. In the days following this initial encounter with the religious leader of the Tibetan community Jesse begins to read about the life and deeds of the young Prince who would one day become the Buddha.  From that point on the film shifts back and forth between the interaction of the Tibetan monks with the Conrad family in modern day America and the retelling of Siddhartha's (Keanu Reeves) life and journey to enlightenment in ancient India. This movement is flawlessly done by director Bernardo Bertolucci, adding depth and meaning to the rapidly changing events taking place in the life of little Jesse Conrad.  An excellent movie on every level. Intelligent storyline, incredibly beautiful cinematography provided by Vittorio Storaro and overall good performances, especially by the Tibetans and Kanika Pandey as Queen Maya. What an exotic beauty! This film may be a little slow for those with no interest in Buddhist philosophy and spirituality, however if you are just a little open-minded it will provide much food for thought and discussion.
