 Katherine Briggs' 'The Vanishing People' is an enchanting volume of legend and fairy lore dealing with one of my favorite topics, "the little people."   This 218 page excursion into the Secret Commonweath covers such topics as;  1) Types of Fairies; brownies, hobgoblins, pixies, trooping fairies, house fairies, fairy midwives and changelings. 2) Topical Issues: Fairy beliefs and origins, supernatural passage of time in fairyland, fairy dealings with mortals, fairy morality and fairy sports.  Published in '78 and long OOP it's a hard book to find, but it's a good one.
