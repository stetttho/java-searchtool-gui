 Released in '72 'Don Quixote' is Gordon Lightfoot's ninth album and third under the Reprise label. And, while I've always been most fond of his earliest work (first four albums) this one just might be his best.  Containing -11 tracks-, almost everyone of them a classic, it's hard to imagine a better album/CD. 'Don Quixote', 'Alberta Bound', Second Cup Of Coffee' and my favorite, 'Beautiful' which was sung at my wedding.  If you own only 2 or 3 Lightfoot CD's this should really be one of them.
