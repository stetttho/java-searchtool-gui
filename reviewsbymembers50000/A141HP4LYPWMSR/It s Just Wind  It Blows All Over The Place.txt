 'The Weather Man' is a somewhat slow, often times uneven, totally off-the-wall black comedy that you will either grow to love by the end, or turn off in disgust about forty-five minutes into viewing. There simply is no middle ground with this film.  Dave Spritz (Nicolas Cage) is a successful television weather man in Chicago. It is the only thing in his life that is going well. He is separated from his wife (Hope Davis), has two troubled teenage children and a terminally ill Father (Michael Caine) who is still waiting for Dave to act like an adult and straighten out his life.     'The Weather Man' is an outrageous tale about one man's search for identity and meaning in 21st century urban America. Dave has lost his way in life, becoming nothing more than the one-dimensional persona seen on the daily weather reports. When Dave finally awakens to the folly of his existence and realizes he has become nothing more than a clown without the costume and make-up he goes on a personal crusade to become the person he once thought he would become. He ultimately discovers how difficult and painful change can be.    There is quite a bit of foul language and some really crude comments and situations, but there are also moments of great clarity and insight thanks to the Chayefsky-like screenplay by Steven Conrad. These great moments center around weather man Dave's time alone when he is either walking the streets of Chicago or practicing archery in the park. This on-going interior personal analysis of his failures in life, what he must do to improve his situation and the final acceptance of who and what he is makes this film worth the watch.  Definitely not for everyone so be forewarned.
