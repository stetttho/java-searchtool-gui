 I first saw 'Doctor Zhivago' at the theater in '65 and was immediately captivated by Maurice Jarre's marvelous soundtrack and the grandiose cinematography featuring the harsh but breathtakingly magnificent Russian landscape. For many years it ranked high on my all-time favorite movie list and I always looked forward to seeing it whenever it made a rare television appearance. However it had been a number of years since my last viewing and was anxious to purchase the DVD.  Finally viewing this long time classic again I have to be honest and admit that in my opinion it hasn't weathered the test of time quite as well as I had expected it would. The music is as enchanting as ever and the cinematograpy is certainly wonderful, especially during the winter sequences, but I now find it somewhat ponderous and slow in many spots. The romantic affair with Lara (Julie Christie) appears overly melodramatic and Yuri's (Omar Sharif) naive, sentimental persona just doesn't work for me anymore. Waiting for him to make-up his mind and do the right thing became frustrating after awhile. Ultimately I found his characterization of a profound and deeply emotional poet silently wandering through the flower garden in search of a verse to be tedious and quite boring.      On the positive side, Julie Christie is marvelous as Lara, as is Rod Steiger (Victor Komarovsky) and Geraldine Chaplin as Tonya. My personal favorites are Alec Guinness as Yuri's half-brother Yevgraf and Tom Courtenay as the intense revolutionary, Pasha.  Don't get me wrong, it's still a classic, just not as classic as I once thought. Obviously a worthy addition to anyone's DVD collection, but it's not something that will get alot of repeat viewing.
