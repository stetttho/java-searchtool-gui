 'Navajo Blues' not only looks and sounds like a low budget made-for-television movie, but it has the dubious distinct of having one of the worst musical soundtracks I've ever heard.   Plot: Big city cop Nick Epps (Steven Bauer) is the key witness in a murder case involving a major gang figure. He is temporarily re-assigned to a remote Indian Reservation under an assumed name (John Cole) to hide out until the trial commences. A female Reservation police officer, Audrey Wyako (Irene Bedard) is assigned to the newcomer and immediately there is a clash between big city law enforcement tactics and the Indian way of handling things.     Nothing new or exciting here as you might have guessed. A series of murders begin to take place on the Reservation and the two finally reconcile their differences in order to work together and solve the case. Romance also blooms between Epps/Cole and Officer Wyako's younger sister Elizabeth (Charlotte Lewis).  Now for the reason why such a bad movie receives -3 Stars-. I bought this DVD for one reason and one reason only. Because it stars Irene Bedard. She's a beautiful actress that just never got that one big break that would have made her a major star. Best known as the voice of 'Pocahontas' in the animated Disney feature film of the same name, most of her on-camera time has been religated to small independent films like 'Smoke Signals' or television movies. Her best work thus far, 'Lakota Woman: Seige At Wounded Knee' is yet to make it to the DVD format.  -2 Stars- for the film / -4 Stars- for Irene Bedard = -3 Stars- Overall
