 This DVD is a collection of 10 music video much like what you would see on MTV  only this collection consists of songs/videos you definitely will not see on American television. A compilation of Middle Eastern, Latin and gypsy music, it will leave you breathless for more. If you like the music of the 'Gypsy Kings' you'll love this!  My three favorite songs/videos are 'Ahle Lila', 'Albee' and 'Chiquita.' 'Ahle Lila' has a group of 8 to 10 female dancers that are absolutely beautiful. Worth the purchase just for this one performance.
