 Do You remember the wonderful Hammer horror films that came out of Britain in the sixties and seventies? If you do what did you like the best about them? Was it their first rate production values, the incredible gothic atmosphere or the numerous classic British actors who starred in these productions like: Christopher Lee, Peter Cushing and Oliver Reed? If you were a young teenage boy at the time like I was you certainly did appreciate all the above, but they weren't the reason. When you talk about Hammer horror you're talking about the most beautiful, buxom actresses of the century.  'Dracula A.D. 1972' was no different, there were four lovely ladies in this film, the two most well known being Stephanie Beacham and my personal favorite Caroline Munro.  Basic stuff here, Dracula (Christopher Lee) rises from the grave once again, this time in modern day London and seeks revenge against the ancestors of Van Helsing (Cushing and Beacham), the man who last put him in the grave.  Enjoyable, well done, but all in all predictable. And as already mentioned lots of pretty woman being terrorized by the horrible Christopher Lee to keep the young boys interested.
