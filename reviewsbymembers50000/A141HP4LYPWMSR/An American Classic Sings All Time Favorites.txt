 For his volume 2 of 'All Time Favorites' Glenn has chosen a selection of  twelve songs much better suited for his classic tenor voice than he did for volume 1.   Along with the inclusion of his longtime signature song, 'Baby The Rain Must Fall', Glenn also scores high marks on his versions of 'Somewhere My Love', 'Always On My Mind', the beloved classic 'Green Green Grass Of Home' and 'Blue Eyes Crying In The Rain' in which he includes some of his wonderfully melodic whistling.   If you liked volume 1, you'll love volume 2!
