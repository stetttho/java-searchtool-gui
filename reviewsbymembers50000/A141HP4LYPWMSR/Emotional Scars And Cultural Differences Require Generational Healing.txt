 Four Chinese women transplanted in the U.S.A. brag about their daughters accomplishments (real or fabricated) whenever they come together. They call these informal social gatherings the 'Joy Luck Club', a name meant to express their parental hopes and dreams for their daughter's future.  While most of their conversations through the years are based on one-upmanship, eventually their false personas fall away and the real emotional traumas and hardships of their lives float to the surface. As we learn more about the past of these four women and the lives they led in China the better we come to understand the emotional, cultural dynamics between mother and daughter and how their relationships have adversely affected the lives of their offspring.  There is much sadness in this film, but there is also hope and redemption offered for a brighter future. The ending is certain to bring tears to your eyes. Much more than just a chic flick. Very Highly Recommended!
