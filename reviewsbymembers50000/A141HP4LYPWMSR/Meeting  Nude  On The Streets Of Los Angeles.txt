 It was late (11:00 P.M.), cold and rainy as I stood outside the Wiltern Theatre in Los Angeles last Friday night (12/02/05) waiting to pick-up my daugther Ally and her friend Britney who were attending the 'All-American Rejects' concert.   While minding my own business I was unexpectedly approached by a young man dressed in black and wearing a pea-coat. He said, "Want a button?" I took one and looked at it. On the button was the word 'Nude.' I asked, "What's Nude" and he quickly replied, "We're Nude man, that's the name of our group!"  Such was my introduction to the 'Nude' trio comprised of Kevin Brown, Bobby Amaro and Tony Karlsson. We talked for about twenty minutes and just kind of "hung out" until the concert was over. Bobby had a stack of CD's with him so I bought one for my daughter and had them all autograph the cover. Soon the doors of the Wiltern opened and out poured the crowd. When Ally and Britney appeared I introduced them to 'Nude' (the band of course) and then the three of us headed back to Orange County.    As I turned off Western Ave. onto the Santa Monica Fwy going east I thought, "Nice guys, I sure hope their music doesn't suck." I decided to find out so I slipped the disc into the CD player and turned up the volume. Before we arrived home we had played the entire CD twice and the girls were already picking out their favorite tracks. Their music has now been playing in Ally's room NON-STOP FOR THE LAST FOUR DAYS! THANKS 'NUDE.'  No kidding, this group is GREAT and every track is strong, which is a rarity especially with new groups. If you like high energy, power-pop rock you have to give these guys a listen, you wouldn't regret it. Join the crowd and have fun playing 'Nude!'
