 Released in '80 'Dream Stree Rose' was Gordon's fourteenth album. I happened to be dating seriously at the time of its release and thought this girl might be the one, so I put her to the test. I gave her a copy of this album along with one of his early releases; 'Back Here On Earth.' I told her "You'd better learn to love this music if you want to keep dating me" (stupid, but absolutely true).  She loved it and we will be celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary this coming August. Ahh... the power of a true poet. Thanks Gordon!  'Dream Street Rose' contains -10 tracks- of solid Lightfoot compositions, my favorites are; 'Ghosts Of Cape Horn', 'Whisper My Name' and 'If You Need Me.'
