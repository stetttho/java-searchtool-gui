 Four female voices have never blended together so perfectly and beautifully as do those of the 'Anonymous 4.' Their CD titled, 'Portrait' contains a selection of tracks from seven other previous CD's, kind of a "Best Of" you might say.  If angels ever came down from heaven to record a CD this is what they would sound like.   Harmonious, Celestial, Purifying and Eternal.
