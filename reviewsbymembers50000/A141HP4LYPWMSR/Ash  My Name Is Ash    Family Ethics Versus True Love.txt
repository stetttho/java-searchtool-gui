 Note: Hindi with English subtitles.  Rahul (Shah Rukh Khan) adopted son of a wealthy Indian family is disowned by his Father (Amitabh Bachchan) for refusing his arranged marriage and marrying Anjali (Kajol) a poor local girl. Brokenhearted, Rahul not only leaves the family estate, but leaves India altogether taking up residence in London, England.  Ten years later his younger brother Rohan (Hrithik Roshan) goes in search of Rahul in hopes of mending the breach between father and son and restore family unity. Rohan was only a small boy when Rahul left, so when they meet again in London Rahul has no idea who he is. Rohan introduces himself saying, "Ash, my name is Ash," using his Father's name to stir his older brother's memories of home.   So begins the deception. Pretending to be a college student named Ash in search of lodging he is taken in by Rahul's family. With his disguise firmly in place Rohan begins to work on Rahul's emotions and love for family and Mother India in an attempt to breakthrough the bitterness of the past.  'Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham' is one of three fantastic Indian films produced in the last couple of years. While the other two, 'Lagaan' and 'Pinjar' are not normative Indian films, this one takes advantage of all the usual Bollywood formulas. However it does it so perfectly you don't care.  The sets and costumes are sumptuous beyond belief, while the music and dancing sways back and forth between mindboggling frenzy and sweet melancholy touching every human emotion imaginable. It doesn't get any better than this in Bollywood, or anywhere else for that matter!
