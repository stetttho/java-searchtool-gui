 This is a great 'male bonding' film. You know tough guys, bare knuckles, gambling New Orleans style, winner take all. That kind of stuff! Add to that Charles Bronson, James Coburn and Strother Martin and you've got a hit on your hands. A hit, get it?  Set during the Depression Era in the 30's, Chaney (Bronson) drifts into town on a southbound freight train. Broke and hungry he immediately begins to look for a way to make some money doing what he does best, fight. Quickly proving himself to be a formidable foe he hires a local down-on-his-luck gambler and promoter named 'Speed' (Coburn) to set-up his fights. Poe (Martin) is also hired on as Chaney's "cut-man" and the three are off to make some fast money.    As Chaney's reputation grows an eventual showdown looms on the horizon with the toughest, dirtiest fighter in town, Jim Henry (Robert Tessier). The big money is within reach if Chaney is really as good as he thinks.  Great performances by all. Bronson and Coburn are magic together and Strother Martin is, as always, the consumate character actor. As for Robert Tessier, well they just don't get any meaner then him. Truly one of the great bad guys of film!    So gentleman send the ladies out for the evening, put the beer on ice, order the pizza and invite a couple of buddies over. Just don't get carried away and try to duplicate anything you see on the screen.
