 If you like traditional Middle Eastern music you'll love 'Inchallah.' Latifa's seductive voice and the up tempo music will soon have your body swaying back and forth as you imagine exotic dancers in brightly colored veils swirl around you. This is fun, festive ethnic music at its very best so enjoy! You'll be speaking Arabic before you know it.
