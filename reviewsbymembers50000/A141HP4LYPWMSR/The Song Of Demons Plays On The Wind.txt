 The interplay of opposites is a constant in life; day and night, darkness and light, male and female, good and bad. The same holds true for Tristania's 'Ashes' [Enhanced] [Special Edition].  To concentrate on the good I have two words, Vibeke Stene. When she is singing the lyrics and music take the listener on a hypnotizing and sometimes frightening trek into a Netherworld where "the Song of Demons" is clearly discerned. When she is not singing the music slips backward into a somewhat mediocre collection of tunes. Don't get me wrong, they're not bad songs, they just don't carry the same emotional impact when Vibeke isn't singing.  Receipt for Success: Keep Vibeke at the microphone as much as possible.
