 Released in '56, 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' is an intelligent and insightful sci-fi/horror film dealing with the topic of an alien invasion from another planet perpetrated in a most unexpected and highly original way.   Kevin McCarthy stars as Dr. Miles Bennel, resident physican in the small California town of Santa Mira. Something strange begins to take place to the residents of this tight-knit community. People begin to change seemingly overnight. They look the same and retain all the knowledge and memories as before, yet they are somehow different. They appear less friendly, more secretive and completely lacking in human emotion.  They are being taken over one by one by an alien presence in the form of some kind of otherworldly vegetation that fell to Earth and into Santa Mira. This vegetation grows into large human sized pods that replicate the physical form of any human sleeping nearby. Once asleep the alien presence takes over the body and the human as we knew them now ceases to exist. It is an invasion without guns or armies, it's an invasion from within.  Will Dr. Bennel and his girlfriend Becky (Dana Wynter) be able to stay awake long enough to escape from Santa Mira and warn the surrounding towns and cities of the approaching threat?  This film is a classic! Storyline, Acting (Kevin McCarthy is amazing), Emotional Impact, First-Rate All The Way!
