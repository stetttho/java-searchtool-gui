 With so many reviews of this film already available (106 to date) there's no need for me to provide another summary of the storyline. However I would like to offer a few thoughts about what I consider to be the greatest musical of all-time.  "Fiddler On The Roof" has been called by many as a celebration of the Jewish spirit. While that is a correct perception, it's not limited to being simply a "Jewish" experience. This amazing film is a inspiration to all, Jew and non-Jew, serving as a universal affirmation of the inner strength and faith within each and everyone of us. The faith and traditions that make us who we are and help us face the challenges that await in this everchanging, often hostile environment.   For Tevye (Haim Topol), a poor, kind-hearted husband and father of five daughters it's his love for God and family that keeps him strong enough to face the continual trials and tribulations brought about by pressures both within his faith community as well as the greater community-at-large. His spirituality is expressed to all by his devotion and adherence to the faith and traditions of Judaism, which are personified on-screen by a solitary fiddler that only Tevye can see.  This film will make you laugh and it will make you cry as it takes the viewer through the full gamit of human emotions. Thank you Norman Jewison for directing such a beautiful film and thank you Topol for becoming the living embodiment of Shalom Aleichem's literary creation, Tevye.  Own It! Watch It! It Will Never Fail To Lift Your Spirits! L'Chaim!
