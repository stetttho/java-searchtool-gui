 It is the Year of Our Lord 1372. The place, a rural county faire somewhere in Medieval Europe where one and all have come to celebrate the bountiful harvest. Along with the villagers there are also gathered minstrels, jugglers, actors and a town fool or two.   The smell of flowers, wine and fresh meat cooking in open fire pits fill the air offering a sweet boutique to all attending this joyous annual occasion. Complimenting these gastronomic fragrances is the most wonderous array of color and texture one could imagine. Allow yourself to become mesmerized by the bright, flowing dresses, scarfs, hats, wreaths and banners stretching out before you for as far as the eye can see.  Soon the intoxication becomes complete when the sound of female voices are added to the olefactory and visual delights. The vocals are enchanting, theatrical, whimiscal, heavenly and wantonly pagan simultaneously. Let the music carry you away on a magical journey to days gone by when man and nature were one, and song and dance was a way of life! Such Blysse!  I've just described what it's like listening to 'Worldes Blysse' a marvelous -16 track- CD by the Mediaeval Baebes.   Yeah, it's kinda like that.
