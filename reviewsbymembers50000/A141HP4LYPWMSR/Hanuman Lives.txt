 Welcome to the 'Kingdom of Hanuman' the beloved Monkey-God of India! Beautifully filmed on location in India, this is an absolutely perfect film that will be loved by the whole family. There's something here for everyone, it's beautiful to watch, well paced and exciting at times, topped off with a touch of bittersweet romance. All this and lots of monkeys too! These elements are subtly interconnected by a thread of Hindu mysticism and spirituality which provides an added dimension of depth and maturity for the adult audience. Truly "All Is One."
