 'At The Earth's Core' is sci-fi silliness from '76. There is absolutely no reason why anyone would want to watch, or own this film. Well, maybe one reason and that reason would be CAROLINE MUNRO! Yes, the beautiful Brit who played the sexy Margiana in 'The Golden Voyage of Sinbad' three years earlier is back as the scantily clad Princess Dia and she looks as incredible as ever.  Watch Princess Dia in her two piece loincloth run from the dumbest looking bunch of blow-up dinosaurs and giant, woman eating, telepathic birds you've ever seen. Make no mistake about it, this DVD is for Caroline Munro fans only, a silly but lovely guilty pleasure to be sure.
