 I've yet to see a single episode of the 'Firefly' television series but I will soon now that I've seen 'Serenity.' Plain and simple, this is a wonderfully enjoyable sci-fi, action/adventure film. It has everything you could ask for, intelligent plot, strong chemistry between cast members, excellent special effects, great fight sequences with that blithe little dynamo River (Summer Glau) and lots of cannibalistic zombie-like creatures called Reavers to keep you on your toes. Add to the mix the very sexy Inara (Morena Baccarin) and you've got a big hit on your hands.     The cast also includes: Nathan Fillion, Gina Torres, Alan Tudyk, Adam Baldwin, Jewel Staite (my personal favorite), Sean Maher, Chiwetel Ejiofor and David Krumholtz as Mr. Universe.  All and all great fun to be had in front of the T.V. set. So get your popcorn and soft drink and you're good to go!
