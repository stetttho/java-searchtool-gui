 'Madame Pele' is a delightful and at times disquieting collection of 29 accounts by 23 contributors attesting to true encounters with the infamous Hawaiian volcano Goddess, Madame Pele. Peter Carroll has done us all a valuable service by putting these fascinating tales in one collection, organizing and categorizing them into four chapters, or sections. They are: 'On the Big Island', 'On Other Islands', 'Hitchhiking' and 'Pele's Rocks.'   The longest section and my favorite of the four is; 'On the Big Island.' It's here on the big island of Hawaii that we find the last active volcano on the islands and it's here that the Goddess is most powerful and most apt to make an appearance. My favorite encounter experience is found in this section. It's titled quite simply and appropriately, 'Pele'.    Pele can appear almost anywhere, but she does seem to frequent some particular spots more than others. She also has a number of different forms to chose from. She may present herself as a beautiful young woman, or an old hag. Pele also has a fondness for either long red, or white dresses depending on her mood.  Each account is no more than four or five pages long so if you come upon a particular tale that doesn't capture your interest don't worry, it will only take a second to work your way to one more desirable. However I recommend you read them all just to gain the full impact and depth of the Pele experience.  'Madame Pele' is only 114 pages in length making it not only a very easy read, but a quick one as well. If you're looking for something to take on vacation to read this is the perfect book, especially if you happen to be heading for Hawaii. If Hawaii is your destination that be sure to read this book first and make sure you remember not to pick up any lava rocks while you're there.
