 'Somewhere In Time' is the ultimate tragic/romance film. Made in '80, it has been one of my favorite films and musical scores for the last 25 years. John Barry's soundtrack is elegant, intensely romantic and will bring the listener to tears whether they have seen the movie or not. To me that is definitely the final and most important test of the value of the music.  Definitely for the thoughtful, romantic and emotional personality. Turn out the lights, put the CD on and find a comfortable spot. The music will ellicite feelings and emotions that you never knew you had.
