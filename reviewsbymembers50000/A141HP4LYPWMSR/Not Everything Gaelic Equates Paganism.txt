 Maire Brennan, older sister of Enya and longtime lead vocalist for the legendary Irish group 'Clannad' has delivered a distinctly Irish/Gaelic Christian sound in her album/CD, 'Perfect Time.' Possessing one of the most beautiful voices on the music scene today, just about everything she touches turns to pure gold. So does this -10 track- release.  Containing the type of harmonious melodies and gentle nuances her fans have come to expect of her, Maire doesn't disappoint. There are however some subtle differences between the mood and feel of 'Perfect Time' and her other earlier endeavors.  The overtly reverential Christian tone throughout somewhat stiffles the more spontaneous and joyous Gaelic sounds conveyed in the pagan influences found in her earlier endeavors. It's only in -track 3- 'The Light On The Hill' that I get the feel of the Clannad years. Be that as it may, it's a beautiful recording and a worthy addition to anyones' music library.
