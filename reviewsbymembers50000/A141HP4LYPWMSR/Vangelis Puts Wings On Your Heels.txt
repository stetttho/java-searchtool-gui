 'Chariots of Fire' is one of the most inspiring, heartfelt films of all-time, a true cinematic masterpiece. One of the major contributing factors in bringing this film to such lofty status is the incorporation of what is probably the most beautiful and emotionally moving soundtracks ever to accompany a film.   In 'Chariots of Fire' Vangelis has perfectly captured in these seven compositions the hopes and dreams of a generation that few of us are old enough to remember. His music exudes humanity and all the noble traits that are so lacking today; courage, commitment, determination and faith. Vangelis' soundtrack graces the listener with an interior vision of a simpler, nostalgic time and place where a few young men "seized the day" and ran their way to glory.
