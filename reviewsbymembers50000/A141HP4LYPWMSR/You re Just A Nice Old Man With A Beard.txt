 If you were a child growing up in the fifties like I was you will certainly remember that there were three classic Christmas films that you had to see every holiday season. They were; 'A Christmas Carol' ('51), 'It's A Wonderful Life' ('47) and 'Miracle On 34th Street' ('47).  'Miracle On 34th Street' is a charming, magical tale about modern day loss of innocence and joy and how one rotund old man with a white beard revives the "Spirit of Christmas" in an increasingly cyncial world. He sees little Susan Walker (Natalie Wood) as his test case. If he can't convince her that he is the real Santa Claus, all is lost.  Will he succeed? Can he convince not only Susan, but the entire state of New York? Even more impossible, can he teach Susans' Mother (Maureen O'Hara) to open her heart and trust once again. Anything is possible at Christmast time!  Edmund Gwenn is wonderful in the role of Kris Kringle and John Payne serves as the perfect foil and romantic interest for Ms. O'Hara. Director Geroge Seaton and an absolutely wonderful cast give the performances of a lifetime in this Christmas classic that belongs in everyones DVD collection.  P.S.: I have to also mention the performance of Marlene Lyden as the Dutch girl who doesn't speak a word of English but wanted to see Santa anyway. This is without a doubt one of the sweetest moments ever put on film.
