 East meets West in this wonderful blending of traditions in Lucia Hwong's debut album/CD, 'House of Sleeping Beauties.' Lucia's electronic compositions, complimented intermittently with her ethereal, angelic voice will slowly but surely hypnotize the listener into an interior state of peaceful relaxed awareness.  This multi-talented musician, composer, enthno-musicologist and Reiki Master offers not only otherworldly sounds to enjoy, but brings a healing dimension to her audience by incorporating ancient Tibetan healing tones throughout her original compositions.  I find it hard to believe this CD is OOP. Get it used while you still can.
