 A quirky, dark little comedy starring Marguerite Moreau (Mighty Ducks, Firestarter 2) in the role of Kat, a naive, young journalist in search of a big story. She is hired by an unsavory fly-by-night internet news agency and is immediately sent off to Hawaii in search of the ultimate surf story. She must locate and interview the legendary surfer known only as 'The Monk.'  However finding the elusive and enigmatic Monk isn't going to be easy. Trying to get a straight answer from the spaced-out surfers and locals she meets along the way is much like Alice in Wonderland's search for the White Rabbit. Asking for directions from this outlandish group of characters is like trying to get directions from the Cheshire Cat.  Troubles abound as she follows the cryptic clues down the proverbial rabbit hole. Saddled with the unwelcomed presence of an overbearing boyfriend and a bumbling guide who doesn't seem to know his way around, Kat is quickly approaching her deadline and the end of her finances.  Will Kat ever locate the Monk and if she does what wonderous 'Words of Wisdom' will he have to share with the world? Or, is the Monk nothing more than a fanciful legend told by the Islanders to confound the tourist? Whatever the truth, what Kat discovers will change her life forever.  Sometimes funny, sometimes absurd, but for the most part rewarding. A potential cult classic.
