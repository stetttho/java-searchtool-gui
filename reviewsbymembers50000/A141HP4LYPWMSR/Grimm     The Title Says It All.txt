 Note: Dutch and Spanish with English subtitles.  Jacob (Jacob Derwig) and his sister Maria (Halina Reijin) are young adults still living at home with their incredibly poor parents. One day their Father leads them out into the forest to gather wood and abandons them there. He leaves a note behind advising them to travel to Spain to visit their uncle. And so their journey begins.  Left with absolutely nothing they must fend for themselves the best they can. They resort to stealing, robbing, prostitution and even murder in order to survive. They finally arrive at their destination only to discover that their aunt and uncle have died in an accident. Believe it or not, things only get worse from there on.  Grimm indeed. Apparently director Alex van Warmerdam was attempting to create a modern day fairytale ala the Brothers Grimm. I will leave the decision as to whether he failed or succeeded in this task up to those more well versed in the writings of these famous siblings. However as far as rating this film on its entertainment value I have to say he failed miserably. The main characters weren't very likeable and the choices they make along the way make them even more undesirable. A pointless film from beginning to end. Pass on this one.
