 This movie had a profound affect on me as a child growing up in the late fifties, early sixties. From a Protestant family, we were taught to have little to do with any Catholic notions that elevated the Virgin Mary to any importance other than serving as the Mother of the divine child. Yet for some reason I still felt somehow connected to this wonderfully moving, if not completely accurate cinematic re-telling of the appearances of the "Beautiful Lady in White" to three peasant children in Fatima, Portugual in 1917.  Finally with its long awaited release on DVD last month I was greatly looking forward to viewing it once again, albeit this time with much older, critical eyes and a markedly more jaded and cyncial mindset. Now having viewed the '52 religious classic all I can say is I must be an old softie after all. The three children are delightful, particularily Susan Whitney (Lucia) in her one and only film appearance, as is Gilbert Roland as the amiable, though historically fictitious town drunk Hugo.  'The Miracle of Our Lady of Fatima' has held up well through the years and still remains one of the great religious films of all-time. Accurate or not, this film will touch the heart of even the most resistant non-believer.
