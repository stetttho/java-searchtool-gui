 The chameleonic Bruce Cockburn has more muscial sides than one could ever imagine. Here in his self-titled debut album/CD, 'Bruce Cockburn' we are introduced to the lighter side of this musical genius.  Nothing complicated here, just Bruce and his guitar having a good time. Containing -10 tracks-, the tunes are simple and folksy like a gentle breeze on a hot summers day. At times carefree, at times contemplative, but all enjoyable. Perfect for daydreaming the afternoon away.   A beautiful first album and the humble beginning of a fruitful career for this French/Canadian legend. To understand where a person's going you have to know where they've been.
