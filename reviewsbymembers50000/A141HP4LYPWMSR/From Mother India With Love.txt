 Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham is quite possibly the most popular film to ever come out of Bollywood and the singing and dancing is unquestionably the best I've ever seen in any film. If you love this movie as I do you simply must own the soundtrack. The music is outstanding and will have you bouncing and gyrating around the house whether you understand Hindi or not. The passion and beauty of this music is truly universal.  Warning: Don't let the neighbors see you when you start getting into 'Shava Shava.' They will think you've finally lost it!
