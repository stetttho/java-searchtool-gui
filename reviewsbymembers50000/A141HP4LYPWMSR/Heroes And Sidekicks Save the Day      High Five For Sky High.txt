At Sky High that's where!  Join young Will Stronghold (Michael Angarano), son of Commander and Jetstream the two most famous and powerful superheroes of all, as he heads off towards Sky High orbiting high above the Earth to begin his freshman year at this training ground for tomorrows superheroes. However young Will is not as happy as you might expect. You see unbeknowns to his parents or any of the other future superheroes Will has yet to discover his superpower. Will he be able to follow in his parents footsteps and become a 'Hero' or will he be demoted to the role of 'Sidekick?'   Put on your mask and tights and prepare for action. This is great family entertainment to be enjoyed by all. So release the superhero within and let the fun begin!  'Sky High' features a great ensemble cast consisting of both knowns and lesser knowns. Kurt Russell gives a wonderful tongue-in-cheek performance as Steve Stronghold a.k.a. Commander. Kelly Preston really doesn't get to say much but does looks lovely in her Jetstream costume.   Michael Angarano follows up his supporting role in 'Lords of Dogtown' with a strong performance in the lead role in 'Sky High.' Also worthy of mention are; Danielle Panabaker as Layla, Steven Strait as Warren Peace, Lynda (Wonder Woman) Carter as Principal Powers, Bruce Campbell (Army of Darkness & Xena) as Coach Boomer, Kevin Heffernan as Ron Wilson/Bus Driver and Mary Elizabeth Winstead as the beautiful but evil Gwen Gracen.
