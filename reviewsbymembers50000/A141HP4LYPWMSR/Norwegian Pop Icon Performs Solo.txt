 With the release of A-ha's first album, 'Hunting High And Low' back in '85 lead vocalist Morten Harket displayed one of the most amazing male voices on the contemporary world scene. While A-ha's popularity remained high in Europe in the years to follow, it was only their first album that made a dent in the American musical consciousness.  Morten's obscure solo effort 'Wild Seed' was recorded in Gernamy in '95 and is available only as a very expensive CD import. Containing -12 original tracks- (words by Havard Rem and music by Morten Harket), we discover a very mature, mellow Morten who has seen and done it all while remaining true to his music and to himself.  His voice is a little deeper now with a slight, raspy tone emerging now and then. I doubt if he could still hit that high note like he could in the '80's, but he really doesn't need to. If he has lost something in his vocals he more than makes up for it in his heartfelt emotional delivery of each and every song. For Morten there's definitely a life in music to be had after A-ha. I hope he pursues it.  My Highest Recommendation!
