 Michael Dudikofff of 'American Ninja' 1 & 2 comes out of retirement to save David Bradley of 'American Ninja' 3 who is captured in Africa by a band of evil ninja's. Say what you want but I love this movie. After all, who doesn't love story's where a few brave warriors defeat all odds and the enemy to save the day!  Obviously not an Academy Award winner, but who cares. This is a total guy film. A couple of buddies with a six pack or two and you're good to go! Not to forget, the late Robin Stille is a very attractive addition to the story.
