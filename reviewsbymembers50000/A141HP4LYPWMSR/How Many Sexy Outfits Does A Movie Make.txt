 'Confessions of a Sociopathic Social Climber' is a '05 made-for-television feature. Promoted as a "social satire" (an attempt at relevance I guess), it's really nothing more than a excuse to film Jennifer Love Hewitt in as many revealing outfits as possible within a limited amount of time.   Plot: Katya Livingston (Jennifer Love Hewitt) is a beautiful, but obnoxious and self-centered ad executive who lies, cheats and sleeps her way up the social ladder. Aided by her gay best friend Ferguson (Joey Lawrence) she worms her way through the movie reeking havoc wherever she goes.  Hate to say it, but this is a total waste of time. Jennifer is unquestionably a very attractive young lady and I'll be the first to admit that seeing her name listed in the credits of a film is probably more than enough to get me to watch. However this film was just insulting, she could do so much better than this piece of trash.  Shallow, Silly and at times Crude. It receives -2 Stars- instead of -1- simply because Jennifer is soo easy on the eyes.
