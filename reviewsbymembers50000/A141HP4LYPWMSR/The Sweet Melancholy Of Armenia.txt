 'Provenance' is an intoxicating blend of traditional Armenian music with a slight contemporary flavor. Hooshere's beautiful soothing voice combined with the richly textured instrumentation of the Mediterrean region (the album/CD was recorded in Yerevan, capital of Armenia) is an inspired work of musicianship.  Highly Recommended!
