 Filmmaker John Walker has done all of us a big favor, believers and non-believers alike, in presenting us with this wonderfully charming and informative documentary on the 'Kingdom of Fairy.'  John's journey of discovery begins in Nova Scotia, Canada, a place not too unfamiliar to me having spent several summer vacations with my maternal Grandparents and extended family in and around the Isle of Newfoundland. While in Nova Scotia he takes part in a discussion with a classroom of local first graders on the topic of the elusive nature of the fairy phenomenon and the difficulty adults have in seeing them, a problem not as prevalent in children.  Soon John is off to England, Ireland, Scotland and Cape Breton in search of the 'wee folk,' documenting a wonderous array of on-camera interviews, numerous firsthand accounts of fairy encounters and a wealth of information all filmed against the breathtaking beauty of the Emerald Isle. It even includes a brief interview with the famous and reclusive fairy artist Brian Froud.  Absolutely enchanting! Do you believe in fairies? I'm not afraid to admit it, I DO!
