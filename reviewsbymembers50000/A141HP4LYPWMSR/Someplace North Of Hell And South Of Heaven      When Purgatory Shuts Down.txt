 What would happen if Purgatory ceased to serve it's primary function of moving departed souls along to the next and final phase of their Afterlife? Certainly would mean there'd be a lot of human souls piling up in a hurry. Quite an interesting concept for a storyline don't you think?  The 'Despiser' has a truly inventive storyline and does the best it can to deliver some entertainment value to the viewer. Yes it was filmed on a very low budget with a cast of unknowns and the special effects are somewhat disconcerting but when all is said and done I think it does a surprisingly admirable job of delivering the goods. The ending is absolutely perfect!  Again, don't expect much and you might just be surprised. At a cost of only $6.98 I would say it's worth taking a chance.
