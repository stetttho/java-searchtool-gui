 In a little Central American town the indigenous Indians are not only looked down upon as being less than human, but they have been deprived by the local authorites and the Catholic Church of their most cherished yearly ritual, the colloquium; 'The Dance To the Holy Lords of Saint Michael and Saint Lucifer' performed on September the 29th.  According to the Church because of this aberrant local Indian pagan belief that Lucifer has somehow achieved the status and title of Saint the dance cannot be allowed to continue as it had in the past. It has now been years since its last re-enactment and things have gone from bad to worse for the down-trodden Indians. They eventually come to believe that returning the yearly celebration will appease Saint Michael and Saint Lucifer and help improve life in the community. Thus they begin to defiantly prepare for the event as Septmember 29th draws near.     As passions ignite both sides stand firm in their beliefs and the possibility of bloodshed is imminient. As one of the locals states in almost prophetic fashion, "for a Mexican keeping the vow to a Saint is a matter of life and death."  'Saint Lucifer' is not just an absolutely amazing film, it's a pure work of art and a cultural masterpiece to be treasured. The script, cinematography, costumes and acting are absolute perfection! This is a MUST SEE FILM!  Starring Rafael Cortes playing the part of the villager performing the role of Saint Michael and Agustin Aviles the part of Saint Lucifer.  Buy This Film!! My Highest Recommendation!!
