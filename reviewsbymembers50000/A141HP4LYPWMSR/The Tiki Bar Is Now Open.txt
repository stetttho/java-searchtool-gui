 This is an wonderful collection of carefree Hawaiian tunes and contemporary pop songs sung "Island Style!" From the reggae sounding 'Tropical Hawaiian Day' to the more traditional 'Kawika' and the unexpected 'Elvira' you'll feel the gentle ocean breeze and the aloha spirit surround you.  Great music for an evening around the pool and be sure you're drinking something fruity with an umbrella in it. Relax, enjoy and stay until the bar is closed!
