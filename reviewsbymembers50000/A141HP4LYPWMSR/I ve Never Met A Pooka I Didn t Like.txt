 'Harvey' was released in '50 and fits into the category of "oldie but goodie." James Stewart is at his funniest in the role of Elwood P. Dowd, a overly gregarious, middle-aged man who enjoys making new acquaintances, drinking too much and spending time with his best friend Harvey, a six foot tall white rabbit that is visible only to Elwood.  When Elwood's sister Veta (Josephine Hull) decides to have him committed to a local sanitorium Elwood must prove his sanity by establishing the existence of his invisible friend to Doctor Chumley (Cecil Kellaway), the resident physician in charge of admissions.  This is one of the great comedy classics of the fifties with an essemble cast to die for. This DVD belongs in every serious film fans personal library!
