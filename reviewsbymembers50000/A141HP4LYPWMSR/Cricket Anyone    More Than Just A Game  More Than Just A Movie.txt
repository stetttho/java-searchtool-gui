 Note: Hindi with English subtitles.  This movie served as my introduction to Bollywood and the Indian film industry. Looks like I started with the very best! What an amazing, enjoyable movie! It will make you laugh, it will make you cry. It will have you watching a band of determined Indians play cricket against the villianous English soldiers. A game, that if you're like me, you don't even know how to play but before you realize it you're rooting for the good guys like you knew exactly what's going on. That in itself is a feat of monumental proportions.  The second most incredible feat accomplished by this film is the fact that its 3 hour and 45 minute running time flew by like it was 2 hours in length. I honestly cannot remember the last time I became so completely engrossed in a film that time came to a standstill.  Simply put, I was spellbound by this film. Long after the closing credits rolled by the music and dancing continued to resonate within my mind and body for days.  Thank you Aamir Khan for bringing this film to a worldwide audience and thanks to an amazing cast of characters that made this truly one of the most memorable, exhilarating cinematic experiences ever!
