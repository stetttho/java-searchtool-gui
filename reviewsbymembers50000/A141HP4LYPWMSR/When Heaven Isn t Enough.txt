 Sharon (Mimi Rogers) is a lonely, suicidal young woman trying to find happiness in a hedonistic lifestyle of group sex and alcohol. Things begin to change when she begins having re-occuring dreams of a beautiful pearl which somehow brings her brief moments of peace and tranquility. And so begins Sharon surreal spiritual odyssey in search of the "Will of God" eventually leading to her embracing the Christian faith. Her new set of beliefs seem to work quite well for awhile. She falls in love with Randy (David Duchovny), marries and is blessed with a little girl. Life is good.  However as we all know "God's ways are not our own." When things begin to go horribly wrong (Randy is murdered) Sharon's most basic assumptions concerning God's love and gift of salvation are challenged as she ponders the question, 'If God loves me why doesn't he answer my prayers?' When Sharon finally gets her wish and 'The Rapture' occurs she must decide once and for all where she wants to spend eternity. Here the film has its finest moment and makes its deepest impact.  This has to be one of the most confusing, convoluted, unrealistic views of evangelical Christian fundamentalism ever presented on film. If it wasn't for the subject matter which has always both frightened and fascinated me, I wouldn't have been able to finish watching. Obviously director Michael Tolkin had an axe to grind and I wouldn't consider recommending this film if it wasn't for the ending. The final scene is so devastating and nihilistic that it leaves the viewer in stunned silence. Definitely a film for a very select audience, stay away if you are easily offended. However if you are in the mood for something different and totally unexpected this may be the movie for you.
