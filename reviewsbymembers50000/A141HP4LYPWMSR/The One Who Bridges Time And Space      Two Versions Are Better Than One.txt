 Judging from the long list of previous reviews there is certainly a wide range of opinions, both good and bad, concerning this release of the theatrical and extended versions of 'Dune.'  Personally, I'm delighted all the legal hassles have finally been resolved and the multitude of Dune fans can now enjoy this film whenever they want. Personally I enjoy the original theatrical version much more than the extended, but I also like to have the extra footage, being the obsessive completist that I am.  Just enjoy it, the DVD containing the theatrical version has been OOP for some time now and now we have it available again along with the extended version in widescreen.  REJOICE!!
