 Note: Chinese with English subtitles.  Chinese, widowed father and professional chef Tao Chu (Sihung Lung) cooks a sumptous meal every Sunday evening for his three grown, single daughters who still live at home whether they want it or not. Though retired, he also continues to help out at a prestigious restaurant when his expertise is required. The strange thing about all this food preparation is the fact that Tao has lost his sense of taste since his wife's death and cannot truly enjoy his wonderful culinary creations.  The only real familial interaction takes place around the dinnertable and even there the communication is poor. Tao is a private man who expresses his love in the preparation of the meal. His daughter's Jia-Jen (Kuei-Mei-Yang), Jia-Chen (Chien-Lein Wu) and Jia-Ning (Yu-Wen Wang) don't appreciate their Father's efforts and can't wait to find husbands and move out.  As the story progresses they all find their own way in life and one by one move out. Unexpected by the daughter's, their Father has also been active and finds a young wife and a new life.  Beautiful poetic story, in an almost flawless production. In the end when his daughter Jia-Chen prepares a meal for her Father he miraculously rediscovers his taste buds. Touching, emotionally understated ending like most Asian films are. Very Highly Recommended!!
