 When 'Juice' was released in '81 things forever changed for country music. Juice Newton was the first successful crossover from the country genre to find a massive pop audience and became the prototype for other female performers who would follow in the years to come. She was beautiful (still is for that matter), personable and talented, possessing a voice so sweet and yet sooo powerful. Truly a phenom of the '80's.  This album/CD contains -10 tracks- of Juice at her very best singing songs that are now considered classics. She has been a consistent artist through the years and has produced numerous wonderful CD's, but in my opinion 'Juice' is her quintessencial accomplishment. A masterpiece in both genres!
