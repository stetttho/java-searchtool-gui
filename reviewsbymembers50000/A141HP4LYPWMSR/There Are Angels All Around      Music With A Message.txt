 Mustard Seed Faith led by singer/guitarist Oden Fong was one of my favorite Southern California Christian pop/rock groups back in the early to mid-seventies during the heighth of the Jesus Movement. Though primarily Evangelical Protestant faire, their music and lyrics are still quite enjoyable and insightful even for those of different religious/spiritual persuasions.   Track 7 - Lighter Side of Darkness - is one of the true classics of Christian rock. A very rare find on CD.
