 A sad, depressing story dealing with cultural bigotry and societies unsympathetic treatment of Trilby Comeaway (Kristina Nehm) a young Aboriginal girl who has bought into the Anglo dream of upward mobility and assimilation into mainstream white society. Trilby talks her Mother into leaving their shabby dwelling in a aboriginal community and move into an all white neighborhood.  Trilby gets her wish however things don't turn out as planned. Shunned by her new white neighbors and unable to escape the constant presence of her extended family who follow them to their new home, she finds herself trapped between two cultures. Not acceptable to one and hounded by the other Trilby tries to find solace in the arms of her boyfriend Phil (Ernie Dingo) which leads to more sorrow in the form of an unwanted pregnancy and the childs untimely death.    Another excellent film dealing with the plight of the modern day aborigine and the damage done by trying to mainstream this ancient culture into white Australian society. A wonderful companion film to be viewed along with this one would be Werner Herzog's "Where The Green Ants Dream."  I bought this - Region 4 - Import DVD about a month ago. It comes in a clear plastic case with good cover art inside and out. The Disc also contains some nice special features if you're into that. Just make sure you have a - Region Free - player.
