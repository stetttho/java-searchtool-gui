 A distant future, another planet. A vast, waterless, desert wasteland where behemoth sandworms roam the sand covered terrain that is Arrakis. These dinosaur-like creatures excrete a substance known as melange or spice, a substance of immeasurable importance, for 'the spice' folds time and makes space travel and interplanetary commerce possible. "The Spice Is Life" and their are many diverse groups willing to die to possess it. Emperor's, Warlord's, a group of mutant telepaths known as the Spacing Guild and their mystical feminine counterparts, the Bene Genserits conspire against young Duke Atreides and the native people of Arrakis, the Fremen, for the melange and ultimately the rulership of the galaxy.    Frank Herbert's epic novel 'Dune' was translated to film by David Lynch in '84 and after one viewing became one of my favorite movies of all-time.   Stylish - Epic - Hallucinogenic, there is simply nothing else like it!
