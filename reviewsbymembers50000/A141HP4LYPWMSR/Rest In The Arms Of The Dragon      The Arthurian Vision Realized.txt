 Director John Boorman's '81 film, 'Excalibur' is a cinematic masterpiece and the definitive treatment of the Arthurian legend. The cinematography is magnificent and would be hard to top even by todays standards, the music fabulous, especially the darker pieces and the costumes will make you believe you've really traveled back in time.  The cast is also excellent; Nigel Terry as King Arthur, Nicolas Clay as Lancelot and Helen Miren as Morgana are but a few of this wonderfully talented cast. The highlight of this film however is Nicol Williamson who is absolutely perfect as the fabled wizard and necromancer Merlin. Playing the role with a bequiling mixture of dark humor and heavy portent, every word, every phrase that falls from his lips is pregnant with meaning and multi-layered context. Listen very carefully whenever he speaks and if you're astute in the magical arts or studied in occult terminology you will atune to the rather odd wording or phrasing in some of his comments. Such as "I am the Merlin" instead of "I am Merlin." It's obvious a great deal of care went into developing not only the Merlin persona, but the correct occult terminology for this film.  If you love films with towering castles, subterranean crystalized caverns, knights and fair maidens and a wizard or two this is the movie for you! Ahh.... yes, if you're also into the arcane arts keep a notebook and pen close at hand, you may need it!
