 Come in, take off your hat and coat and grab a seat near the fire. Order a pint of 'screech' and relax, the music is about to begin. Welcome to Newfoundland!  'Rant And Roar' is a fun, rollicking CD by the Great Big Sea, four native Newfoundlanders who draw their inspiration and music from a unique and rich cultural heritage. English, Irish, Scottish, French and who knows what else come together with a flair that reminds us all of what the "Old World" was like in simplier times.  Though I'm not a native Newfoundlander I have spent numerous summer's there visiting the maternal side of my family. In my youth I've walked up and down Saint John's fishing docks listening to my Grandfather barter in Portugese with fisherman for the best price on the catch of the day and watched the icebergs float by while standing atop Cabot's Tower on the hillside overlooking Saint John's Harbor. All the pleasant memories of the time I've spent there is embodied in this wonderful music. Come with me to other time, another place and sing the type of songs your Grandparents sang. Songs of love, songs of life, songs for drinking and a dirge or two thrown in for good measure. Just be sure to bring your stomping shoes if you got any!  My Highest Recomendation!!
