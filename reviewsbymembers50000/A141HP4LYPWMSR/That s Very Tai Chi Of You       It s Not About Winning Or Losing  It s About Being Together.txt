 Some of the most enjoyable movies I've seen recently have dealt with the everwidening cultural gap between Chinese parents tied to the old ways and customs versus the younger generation assimilating into western culture. Film's like: 'Joy Luck Club', 'Eat Drink Man Woman" and now 'Journey From The Heart.'   Originally released under the title, 'My American Vacation', director V.V. Dachin Hsu has commited to film a humorous and poignant story about two Chinese/American sisters who fly their widowed Mother over from China for a camping trip to celebrate her 70th birthday.  When Lee Lai Yinn (Tsai Chin) arrives in the U.S.A. she finds herself caught in the middle of two warring siblings, Ming Yee (Kim Miyori) recently divorced with a young daughter Melissa (Sasha Hsuczyk) and Ming Na (Deborah Nishimura) and her husband Henry (Dennis Dun).  Aided by the loving memory of her husband Ming Yee-Ba (Robert Fan) Grandma Lee does her best to heal the great divide between her daughters, help her Granddaughter reconnect with some positive feelings about her estranged Father and enjoy the trip. Not an easy task by any means.  Maybe not quite on par with 'Joy Luck Club' or 'Eat Drink Man Woman' but than that's a matter of personal preference. However because of the simplicity of the storyline it just might stand up better to repeat viewings.  Great family film with wonderfully quirky, off-the-wall music provided by Joel Iwataki! Highly Recommended!
