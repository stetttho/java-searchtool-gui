 Note: Hindi with English subtitles.  A timeless tale about two souls that awaken to love but have the misfortune of being of the same gender in a country and culture hostile to such "unnatural feelings." Kiran (Susahini  V. Nair) and Delilah (Sharauiti Menon) are two naturally beautiful, exotic young women with the most expressive, enchanting faces ever captured on film. They are absolutely magical together.     My favorite sequence in the film is Kiran's mystical dream of Delilah dancing in a darkend room. Like Kali in her most compassionate and desirable form, Delilah flashes in and out of the shadows as the drum beat intensifies. Delilahs' movements combined with the music and her transfixed facial expression is mesmerizing and unforgetable. Upon awakening in a cold sweat Kiran is now fully aware that her affection for Delilah is more that just friendship.  In contrast to such interior dream images, the cinematography of the mundane world surrounding the two lovers is bright, vibrant and textured. The sight of these two exotic and graceful native beauties moving hand and hand across the lush, tropical Indian landscape is a wonder to behold. Complimented by an equally impressive soundtrack you will soon find yourself lost within the story and terrain. Whether you're sympathetic to the subject matter or not, the pure, deep felt emotion Kiran and Delilah share for each other will touch your soul and transcend any personal judgement on the subject.  Beautiful, Poetic, Sensitive and unexpectedly Mystical, get ready to enjoy a nearly flawless production!  My Highest Recommendation!!
