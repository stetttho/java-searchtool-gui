 Four years before the Wachowski brothers took us into the cyberspace world of 'The Matrix' director Brett Leonard brought the world of virtual reality to physical form with the arrival of Sid, version 6.7.  Sid (Russell Crowe) is a creation of LETAC, a law enforcement training center where police engage in hostile situations within the persumably safe confines of virtual reality. There they confront the most heinous of virtual criminals, Sid. Sid is the ultimate in evil, a composite personality of 150 serial killers. Highly intelligent and absolutely mercilous he is a hard kill in cyberspace.  However when Sid devises a means by which to transfer his bits and bytes out of his virtual prison and into a physical form the game of death and destruction take on serious consequences. With Sid now roaming the streets of Los Angeles looking for "fun," the job to stop him falls to one of L.A.'s finest, Parker Barnes (Denzel Washington), the police officer who has had the best results against Sid in virtual reality.  While the production values of 'Virtuosity' come no where near the wonders of the 'Matrix Trilogy' it is nevertheless a well constructed plot with two extraordinary actors playing adversarial roles.
