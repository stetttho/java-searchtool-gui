 'The Girl From Monday' offers a somber, thought-provoking glimpse of a possible future where "Consumer is King" and everything else, including mankind, is nothing more than a commodity. Earth has become a corporate run world and we are stock, or property that goes up or down in value based primarily on our sexual desirablity. Good sex enhances net value while failed copulation, or rejection causes de-valuation of personal worth and a decrease in buying power.  Jack (Bill Sage) who was once a prominent figure in the corporate structure has become a leader in the "counter-revolution." As he and fellow partisians fight the "Powers That Be" matters become more complicated when Jack falls in love with a co-worker (Sabrina Lloyd) and encounters an alien (played by the beautiful Brazilian model Tatiana Abracos) from a distant planet known as Monday. She has come to on Earth in search of a missing piece of her worlds "collective soul' which was stranded here a few years earlier. Her embodiment in human form is a process known as "the word becomes flesh."  Can corporate greed and massive group progamming be overcome by a few conscious, free-thinkers? And what role does this extra- terrestial culture have to play in the reclamation of mankind?  This is not a film that stands up well to alot of repeat viewings, but it's a worthwhile watch the first time. It's the perfect film to see with a group of deep thinkers who enjoy dissecting and interpretating cinema late into the night over a good cup of coffee, or glass of wine.
