 'Birth of Jesus: A Celebration of Christmas' is John Michael Talbot's nineteenth release. This CD contains -12 tracks- of beautifully performed traditional songs of the season. Some you'll know, ('We Three Kings'), others you probably won't ('The Appointed Time'). Still all in all, a very nice addition to anyones Christmas CD collection.
