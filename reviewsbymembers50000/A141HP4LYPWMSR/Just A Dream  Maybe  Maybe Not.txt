 'Invaders from Mars' released in '52 was undoubtedly one of the truly scary films of my childhood. Who wouldn't be frightened at the prospect of awakening from sleep one night just in time to observe a flying saucer descend onto your backyard and somehow mysteriously disappear into the ground without leaving a trace.   Such was the opening sequence of this unforgettable alien invasion as the Martian begin to abduct humans with the help of a devise that opens the ground out from under their prey causing them to fall into the arms of one of the mutant giants waiting below the surface. When returned to the surface the victims were no longer as they were before, they were now under the control of the aliens via a devise implanted at the base of their skull. Pretty spooky stuff don't you think.  While weak on special effects the film has a dream-like quality to it that's absolutely mezmerizing to such a degree that the shortcomings in production values tend to go unnoticed. The storyline is solid and thought provoking and the acting is excellent. Jimmy Hunt is amazing as little David MacLean, the boy who knows what's going on, as is Helena Carter as Dr. Pat Blake the adult who finally comes to believe David's improbable tale of invasion.
