 With the passing of the legendary Israeli diva/icon Ofra Haza on 02/23/00, the search for another female voice to embody the soul of the Jewish people began. Rita Kleinstein just maybe the chosen one to occupy that position.  While Rita does bear a striking physical resemblance to the beautiful Ofra, she is not by any means a carbon copy of her. Distinctly different in both her vocal delivery and even more so in her highly theatrical on-stage performances, her beauty, beguiling charm and voice have won the heart of a nation and quickly elevated her to reigning diva staus.  'Time for Peace' is Rita's first English CD and her initial introduction into the world music scene. Unfortunately poor promotion and limited availability of the release has made it almost impossible to find. If you're lucky enough to locate a copy, BUY IT!  My Highest Recommendation!!
