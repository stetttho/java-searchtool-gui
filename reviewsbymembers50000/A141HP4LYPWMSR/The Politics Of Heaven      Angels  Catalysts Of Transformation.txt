 An enjoyable offering from the History Channel. 'Angels: Good Or Evil' is a cross cultural examination of God's chosen messengers covering both the good angels and the fallen ones.  I particularily enjoyed the fact that this survey of angelic beings was not limited to the concept of angels as understood within the Judaic and Christian faiths. The Egyptain, Greek and Roman viewpoints, as well as others, were also discussed. There were also several reenactments of reported modern day personal encounters with angels that you might find of interest.    Nothing too deep or challenging presented here, but a good watch all in all. If you're already familiar with the topics of Angelology and Demonology you probably won't find alot of new material offered, but those new to the subject matter should find this DVD quite rewarding and informative.  The History Channel has provided a much needed refresher course in 'Basic Angelogy 101' that would serve well in a Catholic high school confirmation class, or a comparative religions course as a catalyst to elicit further conversation and debate.
