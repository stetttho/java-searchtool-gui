 I'm in complete agreement with Sam Graham's editorial review above. It was Gordon's "gaunt looks" and "frail voice" that has become so visible in recent years that almost prevented me from watching this DVD. I wanted to remember Lightfoot as he was the first time I saw him in person at the Univ. of Irvine cafeteria in '68. Virtually unknown in California at the time, there was a small but enthusiastic crowd that evening for what was to be his first ever appearance in Orange County and to this day ranks as one of my all-time favorite concert experiences. I was sixteen at the time and since that Irvine concert I have become one of Gordon's staunchest fans with a total of 19 Lightfoot concerts attended and hoping for at least one more before I'm through. You might say Gordon and I have grown old together.  Overcoming my initial fears of watching a fading shadow of what once was, I purchased the DVD and hesitantly watched it one night after my wife and daughter went to bed. I wanted to judge the concert on my own without any input from the family. This was between Gordon and I. Now I can say that I'm happy with my decision. Whatever may have changed through the years, it's still Gordon Lightfoot! Surrounded by some of the same musicians who performed with him long ago in that first concert in '68, I soon forgot about how old and frail he looked and once again became absorbed in the music that has meant so much to me through the years.    Gordon Lightfoot's songs certainly haven't grown old. They still convey all the passion, introspection, regret and wonder of life that they always have. They always will.
