 What do you get when you combine the musical genius of John Williams with talented virtuoso performances by cellist Yo-Yo Ma and violinist Itzhak Perlman? Perfection of course!  'Memoirs of a Geisha' graces the listener with -18 tracks- of some of the best music not to win an Academy Award. Moving effortlessly between traditional and contemporary musical forms, John Williams demonstrates why he is the undisputed master of the motion picture soundtrack.  The music is delicate, soothing and immediately accessible as it gently transports the listener to another time, another place, another culture. You will literally discern your heart begin to slow down and your breath become softer, more shallow as your body atunes to the mood and emotion of these tranquil compositions.  Truly a wonderful and exhilarating listening experience and a testament to all involved in the creation of this masterful musical production.
