 I admit it. I'm a sucker for cover art featuring pretty girls, so I was immediately attracted to the DVD: 'Haunted From Within.' I read the header, "Based on the legend of La Llorona." Always fascinated by anything dealing with mythology, folklore and urban legend, I thought incorporating the La Llorona legend of Mexico into the plot of a horror film sounded like a great idea. I was pretty much hooked at that point.  As for the movie:  What we have here is a case of an excellent original concept burdened with a low budget and incredibly mediocre performances. The sets are dark and drab, the acting stiff and uninspired. There appears to be no chemistry between the cast members, it's like a bad rehearsal where the only concern is delivering your lines correctly.  On the positive side:  The lovely Rina Fernandez does an admirable job in the lead role as the tragic and haunted Anna. The movies best moments are when Anna is alone on camera drifting back and forth between the material world and the spiritual domain of La Llorona. This is where the story becomes authentic and disturbing. The image of the grieving La Llorona is well done and leaves a lasting impression.  Definitely not a classic, but because of the films connection with an ongoing urban legend and the presence of Rina Fernandez it has the potential of attaining some level of cult status.  1 Star for the Cover Art, 1 Star for Originality & 1 Star for Rina Fernandez
