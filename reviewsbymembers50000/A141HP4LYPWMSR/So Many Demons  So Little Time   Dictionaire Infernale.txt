 I certainly wish this book were still in print, I love this large, coffee table hardback edition with its nicely illustrated and evocative cover to go along with the wonderful title, 'Dictionary of Demons.' Who could resist such a delicious temptation?  I'm happy to say I own a pristine copy of Mr. Gettings book that I keep safely locked away and bring out only for my own personal enjoyment when that dark, infernal mood strikes. There are so few good books out there that deal specifically with the topic of demonology, it's a shame such a good one as this has to be stuck in OOP limbo for so many years.  Despite the incoherent ranting and raving by a previous unidentified reviewer, I found this volume not only highly informative and in-depth but also immensely enjoyable and well-illustrated. Such a concern over a minor error here and there, "Ceylon instead of Cairo", GET OVER IT!! Find a book without errors and I'll show you a wide-eyed Evangelical Protestant holding it (Ha-Ha).
