 Note: Vietnamese with English subtitles.  I would never have thought that a movie so simplistic, with so little dialogue could turn into such an exquiste viewing experience. In what is unquestionably one of the most hauntingly beautiful visual cinematic experiences ever 'The Scent of Green Papayas' is a tale of a little ten year old Vietnamese girl named Mui (Man San Lu) who arrives at the home of a moderately well-off family to begin her new duties as a house servant. Her life of servitude finally pays off some ten years later when her quiet beauty and gentle patient ways are recognized by the young master of the house and makes her his wife and expectant mother of his first child.  Nothing complicated here, nor is there anything that one could consider incisive, intelligent dialogue or a highly original storyline. It's the cinematography that initially pulls the viewer into the beautiful Vietnamese world of '51 and that initial interest is soon enhanced by the presence of the sweet and demure young Man San Lu who captures your heart with her innocent, obedient demeanor.  Surprisingly a good two-thirds of the movie deals with Mui in the early years of her household duties. It's only in the final third of the film that Mui appears as an exotically beautiful twenty year old now played by Tran Nu Yen-Khe. Though fully grown, she still retains all of the endearing qualities she had as a child. Quiet, introspective, patient, unassuming, hard working and too attractive to ignore.  If you're in the mood for a visually beautiful film with an even more captivating lead actress (Tran) this is your film. Highly recommended!
