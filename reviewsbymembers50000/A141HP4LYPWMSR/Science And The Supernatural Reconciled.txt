 'Science of the Gods' by David Ash and Peter Hewitt is a great place to begin if you're a novice in the mysterious and thought provoking universe of quantum physics. This rather slender paperback, only 192 pages in length, is simply crammed with infomative material. Such topics as resonance theory, super energy, time and space considerations, matter and the space vortex, parallel worlds and multi-layered, interconnected dimensions are intelligently discussed in an easy to understand manner. This is one of the real strengths of this book, its accessibility to the average reader.  Add to that numerous and fascinating accounts of otherworldly encounters with beings from 'The Dimension of the Gods' makes this book not only informative, but highly entertaining. My personal favorite section is chapter 9 - The Return of Pan.  Have Ash and Hewitt successfully reconciled science and the supernatural? Probably not, but it makes for a good read all the same. Highly Recommended!!
