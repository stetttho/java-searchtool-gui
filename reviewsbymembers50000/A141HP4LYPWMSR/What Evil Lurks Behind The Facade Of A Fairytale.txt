 Join the brothers Grimm, Wilhelm (Matt Damon) and Jacob (Heath Ledger) as they travel through rural 18th century Europe preying on the fears and superstitions of the local villages they encounter. Masquerading as ghost chasers and exorcists Jacob collects the local tales and legends in a large book.   However the two enterprising brothers finally stumble upon an actual case of evil enchantment and need all the help they can get to defeat the supernatural enemy if they hope to survive.  Fine direction by Terry Gilliam, beautifully done cinematography, clever storyline that incoporates almost every Grimm fairytale you've ever heard and a wonderful cast including both knowns and unknowns to the American audience. Including Monica Bellucci as the wicked Mirror Queen and the lovely Lena Headey as Angelika.  Lots of fun and excitement for the whole family. Well....maybe a little intense for the little ones.
