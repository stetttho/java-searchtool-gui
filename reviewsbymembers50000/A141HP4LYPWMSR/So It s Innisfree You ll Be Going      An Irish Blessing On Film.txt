 Sean Thornton (John Wayne) leaves America and returns to his native Ireland to rediscover his roots and himself. He also finds romance in the form of the fiery red-headed Mary Kate Danaher (Maureen O'Hara) and a formidable new adversary in her brother Squire Will (Victor McLaglen).  I never get tired of watching this film. Released in '52, 'The Quiet Man' has withstood the test of time and now some fifty-three years later it's still one of the most beloved romance/comedies of all-time.  And what else would you expect from director John Ford and an ensemble cast featuring some of the most accomplished lead actors and character actors of that generation: John Wayne, Maureen O'Hara, Barry Fitzgerald, Victor McLaglen, Ward Bond, Mildred Natwick, Arthur Shields and many more.   So gather the whole family around the television for a trip to the "Emerald Isle" where you'll meet some of the most lovable, unforgettable characters on the face of the Earth. Just remember, "There'll be no paddy fingers if you please." Truly a classic among classics!
