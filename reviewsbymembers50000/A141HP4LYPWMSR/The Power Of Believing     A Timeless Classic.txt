 'A Little Princess' is a timeless children's classic that is equally enjoyable for an adult audience. The production values are second to none, the musical score composed by Patrick Doyle is exquiste and Liesel Matthews is magnificent in her starring role as little Sarah.  From the opening imaginary sequence in the tropical jungles of India, to the horror of the WWI battlefields of Europe and finally to the elegant but constrained atmosphere of an all-girls bordering school in America, the cinematography is lush, rich and hypnotic. You may start watching this film just to spend some time with your child, but soon you will find yourself drawn into the story for its own sake.  One of the great children's films of all-time! Buy this DVD, you'll continue to watch it again and again long after your children are grown and out of the house.
