 Down a long, deserted and all but forgotten backroad in rural Massachusetts stands the town of Whitewood. No longer appearing on any current maps, the only people who know of its existence are some of the older locals from neighboring towns who would stay away at all costs and of course the witches.  According to legend Whitewood was cursed by Elizabeth Selwyn (Patricia Jessel) and handed over to Lucifer as she burned at the stake in 1692 for practicing witchcraft and consorting with the Devil. Now some 250 plus years later the 'Raven's Inn' stands in the historic spot of the event.  Nan Barlow (Venetia Stevenson), a pretty college coed comes to Whitewood on the recommendation of her professor, Alan Driscoll (Christopher Lee) to do some primary research for her term paper on Witchcraft. She checks into the 'Raven's Inn' and is never heard from again. Her sudden and unexpected disappearance brings her brother and boyfriend to Whitewood to find her and instead discover a nest of witches in search of yet another sacrifice for Candlemass Eve.  One of the earliest and in my estimation one of the best films in the Hammer Horror library. Released in the U.S.A. under the title, 'Horror Hotel', the American version is two minutes shorter than its British counterpart, 'City of the Dead.' The additional material is at the beginning of the movie during the burning at the cross sequence when the accused witch is calling upon Lucifer to curse Whitewood. It doesn't add much to the plot, but if you're a purist like I am it's nice to have the film intact in its original form.  This may have been produced on a small budget, but they made up for it with a great storyline, some ingenious atmospheric effects, an eerie soundtrack and an excellent cast. Besides those aready mentioned, also wonderful performances by: Betta St. John, Dennis Lotis and Valentine Dyall as Jethrow.
