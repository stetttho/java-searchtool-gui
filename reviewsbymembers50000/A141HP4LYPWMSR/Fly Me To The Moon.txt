 'Missile To The Moon' was released in '59, I was seven at the time. The first time I watched this film was on television, it was one of those "Movies of the Week" where it ran every night, Monday thru Friday at 8 o'clock, Saturday afternoon and twice on Sunday. I didn't miss a single showing.  Hey what did you expect, what little kid could resist a flight to the Moon, frightening rock monsters, a giant cave spider on strings and some very lovely Moon Maidens in form fitting tops and stretch pants. It was like heaven. I didn't particularily like the fact that these lovely lunar ladies where able to control humans through mind control, but I guess that was something I would learn to accept when I grew older (THAT'S A JOKE!).  Bad special effects, low budget, silly script, but lots of fun! However after all these years I still hate that stupid spider for eating Pat Mowry, my favorite Moon Maiden.
