 'The Court Jester' released in '56 is without a doubt one of the funniest movie ever made starring the consumate comedian of all-time. A wonderful parody on Robin Hood, Danny plays the part of a follower of the Black Fox (Robin) who sneaks into the castle impersonating a famous jester and professional hired killer, Giacomo.  Playing the role as only Danny Kaye could, the bumbling impersonator weaves his way into the inner recesses of the Kings court and eventually helps to dethrone the imposter King and place the true heir on the throne.  Simply one of the true comedy classics of early Hollywood with a cast of characters that includes some of the great names of the Golden Age!  Basil Rathbone, Glynnis John, Angela Lansbury, Mildred Natwick, Cecil Parker, John Carradine among others contributed in making this a family favorite for almost fifty years.  A movie that deserves an honored spot in everyone's collection!
