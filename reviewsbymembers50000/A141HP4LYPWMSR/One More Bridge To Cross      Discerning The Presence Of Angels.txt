 Beautiful and poignant coming of age film about a little Portugese Catholic girl named Monica (Genevieve Buechner) whose only desire in life is to be one of nine girls chosen by her church to be dressed up as angels and march in  the upcoming annual 'Assumption of Mary parade.'  Her chances don't look good for selection. Her parents have recently divorced and she has moved with her Mother and Uncle out of the parish district. When she isn't picked she steals one of the pairs of wings from  a costume and catches a bus for home. Providentially she loses the wings on the ride home and thus her great search begins.  Searching the streets for her missing wings she discovers an old transient woman named Mary has found them. She uses them to magically walk across busy streets as she calls upon angelic protection to stop traffic. Monica wants her wings back and will do anything to get them. Or so she thought.  A slow but enjoyable tale of discovering what's really important in life and sacrificing your own desires to help others.
