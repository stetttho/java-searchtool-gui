 Ray (Bryan Brown), the resident white police officier in a remote region of the Australian Outback finds himself in over his head when a young male is murdered for descrating a local sacred site. Ray's attempts to locate the killer are hampered by the local aborginal community which views the death as required and justifiable by ancient tribal law. And so the confrontation begins.  Another great Australian film dealing with the vast differences between "white man's law" and the "old ways" of aboriginal society. Great performance by Bryan Brown and a nice cameo appearance by David Gulpilil.
