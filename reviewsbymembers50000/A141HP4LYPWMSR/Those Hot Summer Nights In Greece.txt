 Do you remember that sweltering summer night in Athens when we danced and drank ouzo until 4 A.M. beneath the twinkling lights of the Acropolis in one of those little smoke filled cafes' scattered along the cramped quarters of the Plaka District?  You don't? Well, give Despina Vandi a listen and it's almost like being there. She has a powerful, absolutely beautiful Greek voice and the music and songs are pure Grecian! The tempo fluctuates between fast and infectious to slow and sultry, allowing Despina to demonstrate the full versatility and range of her vocals.  This CD will not disappoint, so be prepared to stand up,throw your glass in the fireplace and link arms with the person next to you! OPAH!!
