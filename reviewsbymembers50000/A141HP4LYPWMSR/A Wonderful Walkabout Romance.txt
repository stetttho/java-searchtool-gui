 'Crocodile Dundee' is a highly entertaining comedy romance released in '86 that implanted such delightful Aussie terms as; "G'day" and "out for a walkabout" into Amercian mainstream consciousness.  Paul Hogan is absolutely perfect as the man from down under, Michael J. 'Crocodile' Dundee who is pursued by an American reporter (Linda Kozlowski) in search of a good newspaper story about the elusive crocodile hunter roaming the Australian Outback. When their brief but intense encounter blossoms into romance she invites Mic to return to New York with her and see the sights. Can a naive Aussie fresh from the bush cope with the perils that accompany life in the Big Apple? You Bet!!  Great family fun with good performances by Hogan and Kozlowski as well as John Meillon as Mic's Outback partner, Walter and a brief but memorable cameo by David Gulpilil.
