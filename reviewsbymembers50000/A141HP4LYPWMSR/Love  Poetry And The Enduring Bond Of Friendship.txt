 Note: Italian with English subtitles.  To be honest this film didn't live up to the grandiose expectations of the reviews that presided it. Don't get me wrong, I liked it, it's a good movie, it just isn't quite the poetic, romantic masterpiece I had anticipated.  Problem 1: First, it's a little slow and tedious as you wait patiently for Mario (Massimo Trois), the village mail carrier, to get up the courage to make his romantic intentions known to the beautiful Beatrice (Maria Grazia Cucinotta) who works as a waitress in her families restaurant. He procures the aid of a new resident in town, the famous Chilean poet and political activist Pablo Neruda (Philippe Noiret) to help him impress his love interest. Pablo encourages Mario to translate his emotions into words to woe the enchanting but distant Beatrice.  Problem 2: The other major drawnback in my estimation was that once the conquest is complete and the wedding is underway it seems from that moment on Mario's primary concern is his friendship with Pablo. When Pablo decides to return to his homeland Mario is consumed with sadness and seems to ingnore Beatrice and all the wonderful things he has achieved in Italy. How a shy, simple villager could be so lucky as to win the love of the incredible Beatrice and then delegate her to secondary importance is totally beyond comprehension.   This film is more a story of the enduring bond of friendship and not the romantic love story it was advertised to be. It's enjoyable but not a classic.  Positives: 'Il Postino' does serve as a tender and fitting memorial to Massimo Trois who died on the final day of filming. There are also some nice scenic shots of the Italian coastline and countryside. Then of course there is the even more scenic Maria Grazia Cucinotta to enjoy.
