 Gordon Lightfoots' fifth and last album under the United Arts label was 'Sunday Concert' recorded live, March of '69 in Toronto. With longtime companions Red Shea (lead guitar) and Rick Haynes (bass) at his side, we are treated to -16 tracks- combining a nice mix of both old and new songs. This is a unique album for any Lightfoot collection since it is the only live performance available out of his 21 albums/CD's (he does have another concert recording on DVD titled, Live In Reno).  In many ways this concert recording clearly marks a shift about to take place in Gordon's musical career. Not only did he drop UA after this album and sign with Reprise, but his next album, 'Sit Down Young Stranger' contained his first major hit in the U.S.A., 'If You Could Read My Mind.' No longer just a Canadian phenomenon, his lyrics slowly broadened in scope in harmony with his new found popularity. His band also grew, adding a drummer and other musicians, thus losing the intimacy once provided by the legendary threesome.  Don't get me wrong, he still continued to have many great songs and albums with Reprise and later Warner Brothers for years to come. Lightfoot was still Lightfoot. He just didn't solely belong to Canada anymore.
