 Note: Spanish and Portuguese with English subtitles.  Something strange and unprecendented is happening on the European continent, more specifically in the region of the Pyrenees Mountains bordering Spain and Portugal. An immense fissure has opened up in the earth, a crack that continues to widened until the two countries detachment themselves from each other and the Iberian Pennisula breaks free from the continent and floats off eventually coming to rest in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, halfway between North America and Europe (the location of the legendary Atlantis).  Director Geroge Sluizer offering is an allegorical tale which attempts to address a variety of European concerns; social and monetary issues, regional politics and long standing distrusts amongst neighboring cultures. Along with that throw in a touch of rugged idividualism and the idealistic belief and hope for a better future visualized in the form of the rebirth of Atlantis and you have the basic storyline of 'The Stone Raft.'  The story deals with five individuals amongst the multitude aboard this immense "stone raft." Each of them has a paranormal story to tell about a recent event in their life that coincides with the dislodging of the Iberian pennisula. They band together and travel to the edge of the pennisula vowing to share their mutual fate, whatever that may be. Does destruction await, or a new beginning? Maybe even a "New Millenium."   Very slow and plodding film. It takes forever for their journey to be completed and when it finally is you're not sure if it was all worth the effort of getting there. On the positive side the acting was quite good. You really come to care about the main characters and it's the fondness you form for them that keeps you watching to the end.   Very inventive story concept with so many possibilities and avenues for exploration. Unfortunately none of them were ever fully realized. This is one of those "what could've been films."
