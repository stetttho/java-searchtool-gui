 Based on the true Drepression Era story of James Braddock, a pennyless, washed-up heavyweight boxer who returns to the ring against all the odds and wins the Heavyweight Boxing Title!  This is a heart wrenching tale of personal integrity and unflinching determination during a time of hopelessness. Russell Crowe fully embodies the soul of the legendary fighter James Braddock, while director Ron Howard expertly captures the patheos and collective loss of a generation in search of one single ray of hope.  Great performances abound; Renee Zellweger as Mae Braddock, Paul Giamatti (incredible performance) as Jim's manager Joe Gould and Paddy Considine as his best friend Mike. Special praise for Craig Buerko as the defending champ and 'terror of the ring', Max Baer. Truly the perfect foil for Crowe.
