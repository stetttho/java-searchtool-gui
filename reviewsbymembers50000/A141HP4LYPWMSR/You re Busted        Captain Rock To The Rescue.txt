 Dennis Hooper plays the part of Lieutenant Krebs, a respected police officer in a rural West Coast town. Krebs also has a popular alias with the children and teachers in the community, it's a puppet named Captain Rock who he takes to local elementary schools performing shows geared at keeping children drug free. As Captain Rock likes to say when a culprit is uncovered, "You're Busted!"  There is another character in Lieutenant Krebs array of personalities, a very disturbing one that likes to kidnap young exotic dancers now and then and lock them away in a sound proof cell located in the basement of his secluded home. His latest victim is Gina (Asia Argento) who is now forced into a twisted game of collecting conduct points from her "keeper" to stay herself alive as she waits for an opportunity to escape.  'The Keeper' is an okay psychological thriller reminiscent of the '65 classic 'The Collector' starring Terence Stamp and Samantha Eggar. Dennis Hooper gives a subdued, but excellent performance as the disturbed Krebs. This is not Asia Argento at her best, but that husky, sexy voice of hers is always a welcomed treat.
