 When you talk about music that conjures up exotic images of ancient cultures steeped in tradition, superstition and mystical beliefs, yet possessing a vast understanding of "the true nature of things" you are talking about the music of Loreena McKennitt.  Possessing one of the most bewitching voices you'll ever hear singing lyrics pregnant with meaning and mystery, you will be transfixed by the depth, content and the multi-layered nature of the compositions contained on this -8 track- CD. Listen as the music and vocals weave a magical spell, creating and dispelling the shadows of medieval ghostly images as they dance in unison to 'The Mummers' Dance', 'La Serenissima' and 'Night Ride Across the Caucasus' or stand in solemn silence to the bittersweet incantation of 'Dante's Prayer.' This is truly timeless music that touches the soul.  My Highest Recommendation!!
