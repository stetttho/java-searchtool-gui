 Note: Hebrew with no subtitles, but it doesn't matter. Music is universal.  My favorite singer for the last twenty years plus has been the late Ofra Haza. I never expected anyone to come close to my love and admiration for the great Yemenite, Israeli diva, but Rita Kleinstein is making me re-think the possibility.  'Great Love: The Performance' is the best live concert DVD I own, and I own quite a few. Production values, camera angles, song selection, sound... I could go on and on. Simply a MAGNIFICENT PRODUCTION!!!  It was at first a little disconcerting to watch because Rita is extremely similar to Ofra Haza in appearance. In other words, very beautiful!! However out of love and respect for both I will  try to make no further comparisons.  Rita is INCREDIBLE, look, voice, performance. It simply couldn't be any more enjoyable. Sit back and enjoy an incredible concert performance you will view over and over again. This is a rare DVD, if you're at all interested in Middle Eastern, Israeli music please do not hesitate. Get it while you can!!  Most Highly Recommended!!
