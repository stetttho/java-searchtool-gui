 Wonderful survival story about a self-centered white man and a young Inuit woman stranded in the Artic  after a plane crash. Charlie (Barry Pepper) is an enterprising pilot and WWII veteran flying the Artic circuit trying to "make a buck" with no moral conscience about how he does it. He agrees to fly an Inuit girl with tuberculosis (Annebella Piugattuk) to a hospital after being offered a pair of valuable walrus tusks as fare. At first Charlie displays a sense of superiority over his passenger, but when the plane crashes in a remote, isolated region Kanaalaq's (Anna) wilderness survival skills prove more valuable than his.  In the face of adversity cultural indifference transforms into a profound friendship and spiritual bond between the two that will last forever.  A little slow in spots, but it's such a beautifully visual and spiritually moving movie that it still gets a '5 Star' rating. Annebella Piugattuk is absolutely incredible and makes the movie a profound, emotional experience.
