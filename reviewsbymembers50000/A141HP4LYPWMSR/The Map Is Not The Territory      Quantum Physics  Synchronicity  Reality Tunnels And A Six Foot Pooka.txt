 Listening to Robert Anton Wilson speak on the nature of reality and the 8 dimensional universe is much like listening to a Bene-Gesserit from Frank Herbert's novel 'Dune.' He speaks of "plans within plans", oops, I mean "metaphors within metaphors" and "models within models."  Dispensing his own personal brand of melange (sorry, another 'Dune' reference) Psychonaut Wilson folds space and time (at least figuratively) taking the viewer through a labyrinth of thought so foreign that it may take sometime to fully recover from the voyage. Such is the protean and eclectic nature of the Robert Anton Wilson experience. Consider this your warning.  Here's your once in a lifetime opportunity to open wide your third-eye and join the self-proclaimed Discordian Pope as he travels at light speed beyond all our self-imposed metaphors and models and through 'Chapel Perilous' on the way to Sirius. I will leave you with one word of advice before your departure. If you see a Pooka* on the journey remember to SMILE!   *[Pooka: Found in Irish fairylore. Can take on a variety of forms, one being a six foot white rabbit].  If you've read and enjoyed his cult classic 'The Illuminatus Trilogy' or 'Cosmic Trigger' you should really get a hold of this DVD. If you're unfamiliar with his work and writings it still 'Maybe Interesting.'
