 Did extraterrestial travellers visit Egypt long before the time of the Pharoahs' and construct the pyramids using a form of technology beyond our understanding even by todays standards? Is history as we know it based on wrong assumptions and misinterpretations of the historical record? Or better yet, has the real history of the planet Earth been willfully and purposely hidden from us by those who don't want us to know the truth?  Stargate asks you to challenge some of those basic assumptions and simply sit back and enjoy a cosmic adventure transporting a renegade Egyptologist and a band of military personnal across the universe via an alien device known as a 'Stargate.' This small band of explorers instantaneously arrive on a distant planet where they will not only discover a civilization much like what once existed on ancient Earth, but the forgotten origin of man's belief in heavenly powers and those beings of myth and legend that were worshipped as Gods.  James Spader is perfect as Daniel Jackson, the brilliant Eygptologist with the cutting edge theories as is Kurt Russell as Colonel Jack O'Neil, the emotionally dead but duty bound commandeer in charge of the expedition. Also great performances from Jay Davidson as the Sun God, Ra and the very attractive Mili Avital as Sha'uri. Everything works in this sci-fi extravaganza; cinematography and special effects are first rate as is the screenplay.  Throughly enjoyable from beginning to end and it will leave you with something to think about and maybe explore on your own concerning some of the unorthodox beliefs circulating around today concerning man's past and destiny. It never hurts to think outside of the box.
