 Once again the angel from the Emerald Isle has descended from above to grace us with a -12 track- collection of enchanting, multi-layered tunes performed by the most beautiful voice in the world today.  Enya has not strayed from the gloriously textured sound that she is famous for and I for one like it that way. When you do something so well that is also so beloved it's best to leave perfection alone. I'm not sure if there's a song in this latest collection that will ever be a stand-out the likes of 'Orinoco Flow' or 'Only Time', but it's way too early to try and make such a determination. Either way, for all those parched ears that have waited five long years for her next release, drink deeply from the CD 'Amarantine.' You will not be disappointed.
