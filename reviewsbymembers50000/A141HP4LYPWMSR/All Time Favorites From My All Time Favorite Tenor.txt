 You always take a big chance with your audience when you decide to sing the hits of other artists instead of your own. Glenn Yarbrough has taken such a risk in his 'All Time Favorites' volume 1 CD. Possessing one of the most recognizable voices of the past fifty years, Glenn has recorded -12 tracks- for our listening enjoyment.  This CD is a rather mixed bag, some successes, some so-so. I was somewhat disappointed until -track 4- 'Sweetheart Tree.' Ahh... there's the Glenn Yarbrough I've been waitng for! He scores well again on -track 6- 'The Last Farewell' and also on the final four songs. Along with the already mentioned 'Sweetheart Tree' my other favorite on this CD is -track 12-, 'Scarlett Ribbons.'  Not a perfect album, but there's enough to make it more than worthwhile for the Yarbrough fan. Besides, no matter what he sings who could ever tire of that beautiful tenor voice?
