 It's been a longtime since Hollywood has delivered a true Christmas classic the likes of 'It's A Wonderful Life' ('47), 'Miracle On 34th Street' ('47) and 'A Christma Carol' ('51). Finally, thanks to Disney, we have a new one to add to that list, 'The Santa Clause' ('94).  When Santa dies after falling off Scott Calvin's (Tim Allen) roof Scott follows the directions in Santa's coat pocket and inadverently becomes subject to "the Santa clause." Now only Scott and his son Charlie (Eric Lloyd) know who the new Santa is. Troubles soon follow as those around Scott think he's "lost it," especially his ex-wife Laura (Wendy Crewson) and her new husband Neal (Judge Reinhold).   Can Scott, I mean Santa, convince an unbelieving world that he's the new bearded fat guy in the red suit, or will he be deemed a crackpot and lose parental visitation rights to his son?  This is a great movie that should become a Christmas viewing tradition in every family. I consider this to be Tim Allen's signature role and little Eric Lloyd is adorable as Chalie Calvin. The chemistry between Father and son is sure to bring tears to your eyes.  There are also excellent performances provided by David Krumholtz as Bernard the head elf and the enchanting Paige Tamada as elf Judy.
