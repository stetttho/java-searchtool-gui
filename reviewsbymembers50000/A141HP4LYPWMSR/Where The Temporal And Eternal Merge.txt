 Aine Minogue has one of the most enchanting otherworldly voices you'll ever hear and her skillful mastery of the Irish harp is without equal. 'Between The Worlds' is one of those very special albums/CD's that don't come around very often. Simply the best Celtic music I've ever heard and I've heard and own alot!  This CD is now OOP, so purchase it used while it's still available. This really is one you don't want to miss.
